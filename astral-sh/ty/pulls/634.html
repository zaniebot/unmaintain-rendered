            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if it makes sense to put them under &quot;server&quot; but I&#x27;m also not sure if they belong in the changelog because these were panics in our testing files.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The panics were <em>uncovered</em> by improving our test coverage, but they could easily have been triggered by a user hovering over exactly the wrong AST node in their IDE. Here&#x27;s an example of exactly such a crash that was previously reported by a user: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/366">astral-sh/ty#366</a>#issuecomment-2909869832. It was fixed in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18321">astral-sh/ruff#18321</a>. So I think these definitely deserve to be listed in the changelog!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The user-facing impact right now is that users of the server are less likely to see random panics when hovering over AST nodes in their IDE, which is why I would have put them under &quot;server&quot;. Obviously not a huge deal, though!</p>
