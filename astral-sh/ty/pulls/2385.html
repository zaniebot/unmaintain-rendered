            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This might be a problematic line too? I'm not sure we should omit it unless we reproduce the problem though. Also, I think no part of this script is repo specific, so we should probably just put it in it's own repo or a gist and link to it in CONTRIBUTING?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have the shellcheck hook enabled in Ruff's pre-commit config but not in this repo — it might be an idea to add it here too if we're adding more shell scripts. It's really good at checking for syntax issues and common mistakes in shell scripts. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/7319c37f4eb063e9590e1f09c8e92d7dabc63403/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L134</p>
