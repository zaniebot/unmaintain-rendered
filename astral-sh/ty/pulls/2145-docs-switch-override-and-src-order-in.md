# [docs] Switch override and src order in configurations

---

_@Cjkjvfnby_

## Summary

It's confusing that 'override' is above the 'src' section.  Typically, you begin by configuring the global settings and then fine-tune them.

## Test Plan

No test is required for docs.  I just switched the blocks of the document.
