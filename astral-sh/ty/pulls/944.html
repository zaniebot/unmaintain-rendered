            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d remove it. It&#x27;s a nice feature, but not really relevant when configuring the editor (it only describes how ty will respond to configuration changes).</p>
<p>I think the bigger question here is if and how we want to group the settings.</p>
<p>I think I would remove <em>Runtime settings</em> but keep <em>Initialization options</em>. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the terminology because it isn&#x27;t really clear for users what initialization options are. Given that the only supported options are logging related, should we rename the section to <code>Logging options</code> (and maybe move it to the very bottom?)</p>

<p>This is a good idea but I&#x27;m worried in the future we might have to rename it if there&#x27;s anything other than logging related options that gets added. I think I&#x27;d keep it &quot;initialization options&quot; for now but I&#x27;ve updated the brief at the start to avoid using &quot;language server&quot; and change the language to be more towards using ty in an editor.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another reason to avoid the &quot;Logging options&quot; section is that the <code>ty.trace.server</code> should also be part of that section but it&#x27;s only specific to VS Code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, good idea. I think something like &quot;... language services that ty provides like ...&quot; sounds reasonable (which I&#x27;ve updated to). What do you think?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>They&#x27;re relevant for Zed users. In general, these are relevant for all editors except for VS Code because the ty VS Code extension provides a different settings interface.</p>
