This doesn't exists yet. I think it's fine to include it but just mentioning it.

```suggestion
Repository = "https://github.com/astral-sh/ty"
Documentation = "https://github.com/astral-sh/ty"
```


We can change this once we add proper documentation. I don't expect this to happen before the beta

I'd prefer keeping it beause we'll have documentation in the readme
