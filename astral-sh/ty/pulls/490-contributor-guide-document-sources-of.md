# Contributor guide: document sources of autogenerated reference docs

---

_Pull request opened by @brainwane on 2025-05-22 18:46_

## Summary

Explain in `CONTRIBUTING.md` that some ty help text and reference documentation result from source code that lives in Ruff, and point to sources, to help tech writer contributors.

Inspired by my stumble in #478 and subsequent pointers in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18246 .

## Test Plan

I used `git grep` to search the Ruff repository for several chunks of the prose in `docs/reference/` to verify which source code contains text that turns into the autogenerated docs. I pushed my branch to GitHub and manually checked that the formatting and hyperlinks were correct.
