# minor: fix link to rules docs

_Pull request opened by @eruditmorina on 2025-05-14 09:12_

Hi there 👋 

Was going through the docs and noticed the link to `rules` page was probably changed and moved to `/reference`, hence this minor PR!

Thanks for the work

The docs are generated and the link has already been fixed in the ruff repository. I'll merge this to fix the link until we make the next release
