I'd weakly favor leaving out the "production use" thing, but if we keep it, it should not be hyphenated

```suggestion
This is the first Beta release of ty, which we're now ready to recommend for production use to
motivated users. See our [blog post](https://astral.sh/blog/ty) for more details.
```

TODO after landing:
- [x] Copy the same blurb into https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/releases/tag/0.0.2 probably?
