            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I already have a mini-FAQ for this rule in the docs for this rule at https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#invalid-method-override, under the &quot;Common issues&quot; subheading. That isn't rendered very well right now (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1884), but I think it's useful for all the docs relating to this rule to be in one place. Another advantage of putting FAQs there is that we link to that page straight from diagnostics printed to the terminal (following https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21502).</p>
<p>So I would be inclined to improve the FAQ section at https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#invalid-method-override, and link to that page from this document, rather than having Liskov-related FAQs in both documents.</p>

<p>This will be a separate PR, since it's a separate repo.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and link to that page from this document</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added an FAQ here that does this in a very generic way, for all rule codes -- lmk what you think.</p>

<p>I think that's fine? Doesn't feel materially different to me to linking to GH issues from the FAQs doc here</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From a user perspective, it would probably be nicer to also have direct links to the error codes where we know we have different behaviour to mypy/pyright -- something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rules where we have slightly different behaviour to mypy and pyright include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>invalid-method-override</code></li>
<li><code>foo-bar-baz</code></li>
<li><code>spam-ham-eggs</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But the advantage of the way you've currently got it is that we won't have to remember to change the link here if we rename a rule in the future (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2001). So: no strong opinion.</p>
