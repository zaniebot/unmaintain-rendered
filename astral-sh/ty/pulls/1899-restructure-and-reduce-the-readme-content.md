# Restructure and reduce the README content

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2025-12-15 18:45_

Loosely corresponding to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/1894 but with more aggressive simplifications.

As with that pull request, this doesn't add a highlights section — I'll do that separately.

I sort-of prefer highlighting the playground first, actually (the way we currently do). You can have complex multi-file/multi-directory setups in the ty playground, not just snippets, and it lowers the burden to trying it out (no installation requried, you don't even need to switch from your browser to a terminal window).

I think the playground is cool but realistically I think the vast majority of users are going to want to run ty locally first.

I mention snippets and small projects in the documentation section of the playground, but wanted to be succinct here.

Fair enough. Maybe just make this edit

```suggestion
Or, check out the [online ty playground](https://play.ty.dev).
```

then?

hm. I sort of want to hint what kind of thing you can do in the playground. 

Maybe?

```suggestion
Or, check out the [ty playground](https://play.ty.dev) to try it out in your browser.
```
