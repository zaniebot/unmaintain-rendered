More README updates will be coming, just want to get this in there ASAP since we're on the front page of HN now.

```suggestion

Should this be removed?

We _could_ use the "warning" note?

>
> ty is pre-release software. Expect to encounter bugs, missing features, and fatal errors.
> ty is in active development, and we're working hard to make it stable and feature-complete.

Yeah I think I'd replace this and avoid adding a new heading?

I left it in intentionally. I realize it's a bit redundant, but I think it doesn't hurt to be redundant here.

I do think if we use the Warning note to be more prominent, we could probably remove this.

Do you intend to append this? If not, ignore this.

I did this intentionally -- I didn't feel like this last sentence was part of the "warning", more additional commentary? But it could be wrong, if you think it's better to put it all in the warning box, I can easily do that.

Going to go ahead and merge for now, if anyone would like to further adjust, feel free to make a follow-up PR!
