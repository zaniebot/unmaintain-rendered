Some of the things I chose to leave out of the CHANGELOG. Let me know if you want them to be included:
```
- Add virtual files to the only project database ([#19322](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19322))
- Use `…` as the "cut" indicator in diagnostic rendering ([#19420](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19420))
- distinguish references from definitions in `infer_nonlocal` ([#19341](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19341))
- fix a couple latent bugs uncovered during `nonlocal` work ([#19336](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19336))
```
