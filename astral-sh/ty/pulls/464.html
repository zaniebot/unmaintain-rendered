            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Add troubleshooting guidance and a table of contents to ty detailed README and installation instructions. This improves documentation navigability and, by incorporating advice from @AlexWaygood, helps prevent or remediate an error I stumbled into while testing ty at the PyCon US 2025 sprints.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I previewed the Markdown file on GitHub and manually checked the formatting and hyperlinks.</p>

<p>@MichaReiser, in my view (Firefox on a laptop), GitHub does not render a table of contents in the sidebar for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/tree/main/docs">this document</a> even when <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/README.md">I directly navigate to <code>README.md</code></a>. As a newcomer I found I wanted a table of contents to give me a quick overview of the high-level section headings, especially since GitHub's displays of second- and third-level headings look really similar to me.</p>

<p>Thanks @AlexWaygood for pointing out the &quot;show a table of contents&quot; button that I had completely missed. In my opinion this is so tiny and hard to notice that I'm in favor of showing a one-line ToC of the top-level headings at the top of Markdown documents, but of course I'm happy to defer to Astral's documentation style guide on this point!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're talking about this synchronously, but I briefly considered adding a ToC before noticing the GitHub does supply one. I don't really have strong feelings here, but generally here was my thought process:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we have a ToC, I probably want it to be automatically rendered</li>
<li>GitHub has a ToC, which covers part of the immediate use-case</li>
<li>We'll publish these as a real site eventually, with a real generated ToC</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I don't mind adding it because the GitHub one stinks but I don't really want to invest in automatic rendering, so it's sort of a question if it's likely to go stale before we switch to MkDocs?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now, the section in this document on running ty is only a few sentences, so I thought it was perfectly fine to combine it in this section for now. Sounds like you have a strong preference to instead have it be a top-level header; do you intend to add any more guidance for users in that section, or have all of that guidance be in <code>cli.md</code>?</p>
