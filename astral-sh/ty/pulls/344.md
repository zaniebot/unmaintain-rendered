# Minor clarifications in Python version docs

---

_Pull request opened by @sharkdp on 2025-05-13 07:24_

## Summary

This is unfortunately longer than what we had, but I thought that this section could use some clarification. In particular, newer syntactic features can not appear in `sys.version_info` branches, they will always lead to errors.
