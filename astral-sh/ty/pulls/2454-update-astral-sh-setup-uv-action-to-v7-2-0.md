### Release Notes

<summary>astral-sh/setup-uv (astral-sh/setup-uv)</summary>

### [`v7.2.0`](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/releases/tag/v7.2.0): 🌈 add outputs python-version and python-cache-hit

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/compare/v7.1.6...v7.2.0)

##### Changes

Among some minor typo fixes and quality of life features for developers of actions the main feature of this release are new outputs:

- **python-version:** The Python version that was set (same content as existing `UV_PYTHON`)
- **python-cache-hit:** A boolean value to indicate the Python cache entry was found

While implementing this it became clear, that it is easier to handle the Python binaries in a separate cache entry. The added benefit for users is that the "normal" cache containing the dependencies can be used in all runs no matter if these cache the Python binaries or not.

> \[!NOTE]\
> This release will invalidate caches that contain the Python binaries. This happens a single time.
