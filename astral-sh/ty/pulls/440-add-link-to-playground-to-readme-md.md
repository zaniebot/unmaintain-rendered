# Add link to playground to README.md

_Pull request opened by @danielhollas on 2025-05-18 13:00_

The playground is not mentioned anywhere in this repo except in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE.

I added a link to the README in the same place and style as in Ruff repo:

Thank you. It does make sense to promote the playground but this seems a bit too prominent. I wonder if we could embed it into *getting started* instead

I talked to someone today who was specifically looking for the playground, knew it exists, and still wasn't able to find any link to it 😆 We should definitely link it from somewhere in the README.

I agree that the playground is a fantastic way to try out ty without having to install anything — advertising it in the README seems like a great idea to me!

Indeed that was my experience as well. 😊 

Leaving the exact placement, wording up to y'all, cheers.
