# Link to the typing specification in the "type checking" features page

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2025-12-15 21:26_

Instead of to the top-level page which does not really seem like what I would want if I was trying to understand supported features?

unsure. I'm okay either way.

The spec isn't really designed as end-user documentation — it's really targeted towards authors of type checkers — but it might well be the best thing to link to here anyway

If we want better docs to link to I think we just have to write it ourselves, like mypy did
