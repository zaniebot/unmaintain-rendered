# Update Zed settings structure

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

This PR updates the Zed configuration examples to remove the repeated `ty` path in `ty.settings.ty.diagnosticMode` as this is no longer required as of Zed 0.207.2.

Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1299


## Test Plan

I tested the new settings structure with Zed's preview build.
