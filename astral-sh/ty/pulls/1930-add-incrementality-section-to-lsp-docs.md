# Add incrementality section to LSP docs

_Pull request opened by @sharkdp on 2025-12-16 13:51_

I was halfway through with designing an example here to understand fine-grained incrementality, but ultimately, I'm not sure this is the right place to discuss this? It is interesting in a technical talk, but it's (ideally) really not relevant for users to understand this in detail(?).

```suggestion
down to individual definitions. This incrementality means that you get instant feedback as you type, i.e., within
a few milliseconds, even on large projects.
```

It might be nice to have a very simple example, but I agree it's not critical
