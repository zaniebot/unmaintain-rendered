# Update docs README for Python version inference from environment

---

_Pull request opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-06-02 11:11_

## Summary

These docs are not autogenerated, so they need to be manually updated following the changes made in github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18057. The wording here is basically the same I used for the reference docs in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18397.

## Test Plan

`uvx pre-commit run -a`

"however, but a" -- what about "... is not available, and a virtual ..." ? I'm finding the "however, but" combination hard to parse ;)
