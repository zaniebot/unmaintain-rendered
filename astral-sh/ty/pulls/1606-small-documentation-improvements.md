# Small documentation improvements

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

* Remove the preview warning. ty is fairly stable at this point and only crashes rarely so that a warning as prominent as the one we used is no longer justified. The alpha version should be sufficient as indicator that ty is still in development.
* Inline the basic setup instructions for VS Code rather than pointing users off the ty documentation
* Document how to use ty's suppression comments alongside suppressions from other tools

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1467
