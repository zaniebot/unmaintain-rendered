            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. It does make sense to promote the playground but this seems a bit too prominent. I wonder if we could embed it into <em>getting started</em> instead</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I talked to someone today who was specifically looking for the playground, knew it exists, and still wasn&#x27;t able to find any link to it 😆 We should definitely link it from somewhere in the README.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that the playground is a fantastic way to try out ty without having to install anything — advertising it in the README seems like a great idea to me!</p>
