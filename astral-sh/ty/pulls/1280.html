<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This workflow doesn't pin the Github Actions to a specific version using SHA tags. Now it does, just like the others, which will prevent weekly Dependabot PR's based on commit only.</p>
<p>You can find the release SHA's here.
https://github.com/actions/checkout/releases/tag/v5.0.0
https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/releases/tag/v5.0.0
https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/releases/tag/v4.6.2</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. Unfortunately, this doesn't work because cargo dist doesn't support adding the <code># version</code> comment (CC: @Gankra). But it would certainly be nice to have.</p>
