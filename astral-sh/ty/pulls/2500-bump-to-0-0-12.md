_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:9 on 2026-01-14 21:10_

```suggestion
- Avoid panic that could occur when `cast`ing an object to a TypedDict or union of TypedDicts ([#22509](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22509))
```

---

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:11 on 2026-01-14 21:11_

```suggestion
- Fix stack overflow with recursive type aliases containing tuple types ([#22543](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22543))
```

---

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:12 on 2026-01-14 21:11_

```suggestion
- `functools.total_ordering`: ensure the signatures of generated methods reflect the signature of the user-provided method ([#22496](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22496))
```

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:14 on 2026-01-14 21:12_

```suggestion
- Use the top materialization of classes for `if type(x) is y` narrowing. For example, `if type(x) is tuple` will cause the type of `x` to be intersected with `tuple[object, ...]` rather than `tuple[Unknown, ...]`. ([#22553](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22553))
```

```suggestion
- Avoid emitting Liskov violations with respect to a grandparent class if such violations could not be fixed without introducing Liskov violations with respect to a parent class ([#22484](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22484))
```

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:17 on 2026-01-14 21:14_

```suggestion
- Check contravariant type variable bounds contravariantly in specialization inference ([#22488](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22488))
```

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:28 on 2026-01-14 21:14_

```suggestion
- Apply type narrowing to walrus targets ([#22369](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22369))
```

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:30 on 2026-01-14 21:15_

I'd combine this bullet with the "Add support for dynamic `type(...)` classes" bullet

---

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:33 on 2026-01-14 21:15_

```suggestion
- Improve disambiguation of types in diagnostics ([#22547](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22547))

```suggestion

```

---

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:37 on 2026-01-14 21:16_

I'd combine these with the bullets that talk about the respective features being introduced

---

Same for these two
