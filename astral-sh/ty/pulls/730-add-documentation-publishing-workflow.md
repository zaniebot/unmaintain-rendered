# Add documentation publishing workflow

---

_@zanieb_

Adds a documentation publishing workflow as a part of https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/729 but is based on `main` so we can test the workflow dispatch against the branch.

This is copied from ruff with updated names.

I'm going to merge this so I can test it, feel free to review still but it's very copy-paste.
