            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PPC64 seems dead, and it&#x27;s only supported on one exact manylinux version (<a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/issues/669">pypa/auditwheel#669</a>), so we should drop it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s arguable whether this is a breaking change, since it doesn&#x27;t remove support for the platform (which is already barely support by manylinux), but it does make installation more complex on PPC64.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm. I don&#x27;t have much context myself but I&#x27;ll try to find the PR that added support for it in Ruff to understand what the motivation was back then.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I couldn&#x27;t find a reason why PPC64 support was added in Ruff. Given that it&#x27;s very easy for us to restore PPC64 support if users ask for it, I suggest we go ahead and merge this. This will at least give us signal on why we have to support PPC64 going forward (and for how long).</p>
