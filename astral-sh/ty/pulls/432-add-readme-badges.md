Add badges to the README. Same badges as those used in the READMEs of uv and ruff.

(I kind of don't like README badges, curious what others think — I was looking at removing most of them in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11257)

I don't have strong opinions but if we do keep it, PyPI and Discord seems enough as I think others are present in the GitHub UI.

I'm fine with badges that serve a purpose and don't add redundant information. I agree with @dhruvmanila that I'd keep PyPI, Discord. The license is already visible on PyPI and GitHub and so is the CI status (which is rather useless on PyPI).

Makes sense. Removed the license and CI badges.
