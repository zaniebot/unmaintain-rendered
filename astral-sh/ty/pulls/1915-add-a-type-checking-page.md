# Add a "type checking" page

---

_@zanieb_

[Rendered](https://update-docs-zb-doc-type-chec.docs-119.pages.dev/ty/type-checking/)

I was a bit unhappy that the "Introduction" had to explain concepts like file selection and environment discovery. I also think the "Concepts" sections didn't really make sense as "Installation" -> "Configuration", I wanted a page for _using_ the type checker in between. This adds a new page for "Type checking" and moves some of the content out of the "Introduction". The "Features / Type checking" page is renamed to "Features / Type system" to disambiguate — which I think is more appropriate for the target readers anyway.

I think in the long run, we'll want to add "Guides" and have a "Type checking your project", "Type checking a script", etc., but I think that's out of scope for the beta.
