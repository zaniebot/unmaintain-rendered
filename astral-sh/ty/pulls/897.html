            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a bit of a chicken/egg story, but it won't work until after its merged. But if you replace the json url with one to a little gist of mine, you can get a sneak peak:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jorenham/9041990267c10a80730c98bd8b1beef0/raw/c8b626d25c4cc498727cf43803be290e1182c122/v0.json" alt="ty" /></a></p>
<p>I kept it as close as I could to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#show-your-support">ruff's badge</a>. I slightly modified the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/assets/logo-letter.svg">ty svg</a> (removed the redundant <code>viewbox</code> and <code>fill</code> attributes, and did some modest path rounding) to shave off a couple of precious bytes and to make the json somewhat less unreadable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have no strong personal opinions about it, so don't hestitate to let me know what you think about it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh yea, I wasn't sure if it should link to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty (as it now does) or to https://ty.dev. Ruff links to github, but https://ty.dev is quite a bit shorter and seems to (currently?) redirect to github either way. Linking it to ty.dev could perhaps also be handy for analytics or something, but then again, I'm not sure what what your planning to do with it. So, should I change it to ty.dev or keep it pointing github?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know we have it in ruff but I'm leaning towards omitting this section here. Mainly because I don't have an expectations that users show their support this way. I think the badge at the top is enough.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you'd be surprised at the number of people that can't wait to start using ty. But I can also see how it could be cleaner to indeed keep it minimal here (too).</p>
