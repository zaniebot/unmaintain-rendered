            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s a bit of a chicken/egg story, but it won&#x27;t work until after its merged. But if you replace the json url with one to a little gist of mine, you can get a sneak peak:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jorenham/9041990267c10a80730c98bd8b1beef0/raw/c8b626d25c4cc498727cf43803be290e1182c122/v0.json" alt="ty"></a></p>
<p>I kept it as close as I could to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#show-your-support">ruff&#x27;s badge</a>. I slightly modified the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/assets/logo-letter.svg">ty svg</a> (removed the redundant <code>viewbox</code> and <code>fill</code> attributes, and did some modest path rounding) to shave off a couple of precious bytes and to make the json somewhat less unreadable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have no strong personal opinions about it, so don&#x27;t hestitate to let me know what you think about it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh yea, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it should link to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty (as it now does) or to https://ty.dev. Ruff links to github, but https://ty.dev is quite a bit shorter and seems to (currently?) redirect to github either way. Linking it to ty.dev could perhaps also be handy for analytics or something, but then again, I&#x27;m not sure what what your planning to do with it. So, should I change it to ty.dev or keep it pointing github?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know we have it in ruff but I&#x27;m leaning towards omitting this section here. Mainly because I don&#x27;t have an expectations that users show their support this way. I think the badge at the top is enough.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you&#x27;d be surprised at the number of people that can&#x27;t wait to start using ty. But I can also see how it could be cleaner to indeed keep it minimal here (too).</p>
