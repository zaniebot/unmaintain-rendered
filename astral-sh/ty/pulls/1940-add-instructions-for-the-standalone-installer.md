# Add instructions for the standalone installer

The installer for `latest` won't work until we have a non-pre-release on GitHub, so we should merge this post-release if we want to.

I kinda don't like that we recommend the "run a random script from the internet" installation at all, but at least it's not our first-recommended method.

I have no way to verify the Windows instructions, but I assume someone verified them at some point!
