            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When you have typing.py module defined in your code, ty will get confused (since typing is builtin). It can be difficult to debug the issue, so it would be nice to have a warning when this kind of shadowing occures</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This does seem like a reasonable thing to offer a diagnostic for, since it&#x27;s likely that we&#x27;ll have confusing behaviour if a user does this accidentally. It might be noisy on some codebases, but I guess they can just suppress the diagnostic. It will probably only be useful if it&#x27;s enabled by default.</p>
<p>One interesting question is: <em>how</em> users would suppress this diagnostic? Would the diagnostic be issued on the first line of the incorrectly named file? If so, I guess they could just put a <code>ty: ignore[&lt;error code&gt;]</code> comment on the first line of the file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ideally it would be emitted without a range because there&#x27;s no need to render a code frame. But yes, that might require some special casing on the suppression side or add support for file level ty:ignore</p>
