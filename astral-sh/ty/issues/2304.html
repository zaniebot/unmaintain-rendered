            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ty does not emit a warning or error when doing a logical comparison where there is no overlap</p>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/beedfd79-499c-443f-a083-4c874e4b5350</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo: str = &quot;bar&quot;

if foo is not None:
    a = &quot;hit&quot;
    print(&quot;hit&quot;)

if foo is None:
    a = &quot;miss&quot;
    print(&quot;miss&quot;)

reveal_type(a)
</code></pre>
<p>basedpyright does provide <code>1. Condition will always evaluate to True since the types &quot;Literal['bar']&quot; and &quot;None&quot; have no overlap [reportUnnecessaryComparison]</code></p>
<p>mypy does not report anything and same with pyright</p>
<p>Another interesting quirk from the playground is that ty knows that the second condition check is unreachable and will then report a as
<code>1. Revealed type: </code>Literal[&quot;hit&quot;]<code> [revealed-type]</code>
But funny enough, basedpyright reports it as <code>1. Type of &quot;a&quot; is &quot;Literal['miss', 'hit']&quot;</code></p>
<hr />
<p>Emitting a warning when there is no overlap between checks feels like an amazing rule to have!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting! I would have expected mypy to flag the first condition with <code>--strict-equality --enable-error-code=redundant-expr</code>, but even with those flags added it doesn't complain about it. (Mypy <em>does</em> complain about the second condition if you add <code>--warn-unreachable</code>.)</p>
