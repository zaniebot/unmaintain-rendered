# option to ban Unknown and `Any`

_@DetachHead_

opening an issue for this because it was mentioned [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/161446a47a7f49b1da96e2547acdb1f963d9af10/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/doc/public_type_undeclared_symbols.md?plain=1#L24) and i couldn't find an existing issue for it:

> Together with a possible future type-checker mode that would detect the prevalence of dynamic types, this could help developers catch such mistakes.
