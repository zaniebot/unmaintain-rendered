<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve found a case where autocomplete won&#x27;t work even tho the type of the variable is clear. It is when I iterate over a list, the variable attributes are not autocompleted inside the for loop:
<img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77452a4a-b079-429e-8a2f-e37e612eed87"></p>
<p><code>i</code> type is correctly detected as <code>Unknown | A</code> and I can even go to definition of its attributes, but autocomplete doesn&#x27;t work. Here&#x27;s the playground link: https://play.ty.dev/80851291-8503-4aaf-b5aa-f286949c820b</p>
<p>Thanks for this amazing LSP! :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @rodrigoscc for the report and thanks @sinon for the initial triage!!</p>
<p>The problem here is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/81f34fbc8e404cd26fa40ee86a339947dce7617c/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/list_members.rs#L165-L172">this branch</a> in our routine for collecting &quot;all members&quot; of a given type. On a union type <code>T | S</code>, the available members will be the <em>intersection</em> of <code>&lt;set of members available on T&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;set of members available on S&gt;</code>. That makes sense from a type-theory perspective, but it&#x27;s obviously suboptimal for this specific case.</p>
<p>The problem is that a dynamic type such as <code>Any</code> or <code>Unknown</code> has an infinite number of members available on it, but it would take a &quot;very long time&quot;™️ for us to enumerate an infinite number of members, so instead of attempting to do that the <code>all_members()</code> routine just returns an empty set if you ask for all members available on a dynamic type. And the intersection of any set with an empty set is another empty set.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that this routine is too naive currently when it comes to unions that include dynamic types. Shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to fix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Honestly I think this approach could be changed in general, not only for unions of dynamic types. Consider, for example, the type <code>T | None</code> (with T being some concrete type). While getting members from this type is not sound at runtime, it is still often useful to get autocompletion for its members, for example, i.e. to see what is possible to do with values of type T, without having to insert an <code>assert obj is not None</code> before that.</p>

<p>Maybe. But wouldn&#x27;t it be confusing for a user to have a situation where ty suggests an autocompletion, you accept that autocompletion suggestion, and then ty immediately complains about the code that it just added for you?</p>
<p>We should look at what other language servers like pylance do here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Basedpyright gives all (or at least, multiple of) union fields in the completions:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @Wizzerinus, that&#x27;s super helpful!</p>
<p>I would still be inclined to view that as a separate issue that should maybe be fixed in a separate PR. But it&#x27;s extremely valuable to know how other LSPs handle union types here!</p>
