            <div class="timeline-body"><p>red-knot allows users to specify a custom typeshed using <code>--typeshed</code>, but we currently have poor test coverage for cases where a custom typeshed means that builtin or stdlib symbols aren't available to us as a result of this. We should improve our coverage here -- for example, what happens to our binary arithmetic logic if we're in a world where there's no <code>builtins.int</code> symbol available to us? (I have no idea.)</p>
<p>We have <em>some</em> test cases for this scenario here, but we need more:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/76e4277696e8b34b771d554f8f0d07054d413289/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types/infer.rs#L4570-L4603</p>
<p>It will be easier to add tests for this scenario once we've implemented support for custom typeshed directories in mdtest.</p>
