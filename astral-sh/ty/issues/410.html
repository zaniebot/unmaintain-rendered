            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a workflow in the Ruff repo here that runs property tests daily on ty and opens an issue if they fail: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily_property_tests.yaml.</p>
<p>We should move that workflow to this repo. Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm subscribed to all issues on this repo but not on Ruff. I think this also applies to most other people at Astral working on ty! So it'll be harder for us to miss it when the bot opens an issue</li>
<li>This is where all the other ty issues are these days, so it's where I'd expect the issue to be opened</li>
