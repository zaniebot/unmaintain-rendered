<p>Claude claims</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the type context is a union (52-element <code>CoreSchema</code>), it tries each union element via <code>try_narrow</code>. And for each attempt, nested call expressions also go through the same process. This gives <code>O(52^depth)</code> complexity.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I felt it was probably not appropriate, so I pursued avoiding redundant narrowing of repeated unions instead as an alternative. <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22066">astral-sh/ruff#22066</a> tracks ancestor unions to avoid recursive analysis. This still gives a 250x improvement on the 4-level snippet. I can get another 4x on top of that (i.e., 1000x) with various caching changes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think we should pursue any micro-optimisations that only benefit pydantic (especially not ones that regress memory usage) until we see the performance impact of @oconnor663&#x27;s upcoming work to implement tagged-union narrowing for unions of TypedDicts. (We know the pathological performance on pydantic is caused by the fact that they have a huge union of TypedDicts, and it currently never gets narrowed by us.) E.g. the reported pydantic speedup on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22066">astral-sh/ruff#22066</a> is currently very impressive, but it&#x27;s possible the number changes a lot after Jack&#x27;s work has landed.</p>
<p>I continue to find <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22065">astral-sh/ruff#22065</a> interesting, however, since it&#x27;s a very targeted change that also shows speedups on non-pydantic benchmarks, and actually shows a memory-usage <em>improvement</em>.</p>
