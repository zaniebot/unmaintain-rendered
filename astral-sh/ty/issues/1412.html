            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like you're running an old version of ty (0.0.1-alpha.19). Could you check whether this reproduces on the latest ty alpha (.0.1-alpha.23)?</p>
<p>If it does repro with the latest version, we'll need some more information to be able to debug this, too</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for confirming that it still repros. Unfortunately we won't be able to help debug this unless you're able to provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal, reproducible example</a>, however, so I'll close this for now -- but happy to reopen if you're able to narrow it down at all.</p>
<p>The most common cause of this panic is https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/256</p>
