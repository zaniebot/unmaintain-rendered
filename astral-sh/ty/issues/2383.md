# Overload resolution fails to match through `ThreadPoolExecutor.submit()`

---

_Issue opened by @bcmills on 2026-01-07 22:06_

### Summary

https://play.ty.dev/00383569-b7bd-4b82-addd-1d9b11b03560:
```py
from typing import overload
import concurrent.futures
import time

executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)

@overload
def print_time(now: float | None, /) -> None: ...

@overload
def print_time(*, now: float | None = None) -> None: ...

def print_time(now: float | None = None):
    if now is None:
        now = time.time()
    print(now)

print_time(now=42)

executor.submit(print_time, now=42)
```

`ty` correctly allows the direct call to `print_time`, but erroneously rejects the one indirected through `executor.submit()`:
```
Argument to bound method `submit` is incorrect: Expected `Overload[(now: int | float | None, /) -> Unknown, (*, now: int | float | None = None) -> Unknown]`, found `Literal[42]` (invalid-argument-type) [Ln 20, Col 29]
```
