            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Ty is absolutely an amazing work but Ty is still in its early stage. And I don't find any roadmap about Ty. I would like to know what features will Ty have in official production ready release? Or in what phrase Ty will be deemed to be production ready?</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.0.1-alpha.26</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're currently working towards the beta release and you can track its progress and what features it includes in our <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/milestone/2">beta milestone</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/milestone/4">stable milestone</a> where we'll track progress and the features once the Beta has been released. The stable milestone should already give you a good sense for the feature in the first stable version, but there are some features that we plan to include in stable but haven't had the time to create issues for yet.</p>
