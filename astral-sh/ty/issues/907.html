            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Go to https://play.ty.dev/a9c085a2-f7d2-4998-8bc5-4540c5c3d826 and ctrl-click on <code>field</code>. It shows empty previews:</p>

<p>Interestingly, after I jumped to the <code>dataclasses</code> module first, it seems to work fine (although I noticed that it jumps to a 3.14 overload which should not be reachable on the default configuration)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, that might be trickier to integrate. It's not entirely clear what the right entry point here is. I suspect that the playground has the same issue for regular files after loading a stored playground and you haven't opened those files yet</p>

<p>That's more likely a bug with go to definition itself</p>
