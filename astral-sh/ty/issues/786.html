            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since ty now supports the <code>--config-file</code> flag, we can add this flag to the <code>server</code> command. This would greatly benefit users running ty server within a monorepo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the request!</p>
<p>I agree that it&#x27;ll be useful to have something similar to <code>--config-file</code> for the server but it shouldn&#x27;t be a command-line flag. This is because starting a language server is mostly done by the editor and is not something a user would do quite often. So, this kind of configuration should be exposed as server setting. I&#x27;ll be working on that soon (#82) after which we can start including certain settings that the user can set directly in their editor.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to convert this issue in a way to capture what I&#x27;ve said above and make it a sub-issue for client settings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve added <code>needs-decision</code> because it might be useful to first discuss whether something like this is useful to add. For context, Ruff provides this option: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/settings/#configuration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to add right now it is impossible to use the ty vscode extension in a monorepo setup. More info here: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2034">astral-sh/ty#2034</a>#issue-3740386726</p>
<p>I also want to point out that the ruff extension is able to work in a monorepo (and it doesn&#x27;t even have an option in the extension to specify a config file, it finds it automatically and just works)</p>
<p>Some feature parity between ty and ruff here would be nice</p>
