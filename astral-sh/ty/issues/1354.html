            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'd like to ask if there are plans for supporting a feature for ignoring <code>unresolved-import</code> per library, i.e. similarly to how <code>mypy</code> does it with:</p>
<pre><code>[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = [&quot;foobar.*&quot;]
ignore_missing_imports = true 
</code></pre>
<p>The behaviour I'd expect is that all unresolved imports of <code>foobar</code> are silenced (e.g. <code>from foobar import X</code>).</p>
<p>I have already checked the documentation and haven't found anything similar in <code>ty</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Milosz</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you elaborate on what you expect from this configuration? Is it that all unresolved imports of <code>foobar</code> are silenced (e.g. <code>from foobar import X</code>) or that all unresolved imports within <code>foobar</code> are silenced (e.g. an <code>import XX</code> within a <code>foobar</code> module)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sure! Sorry, I should have mentioned that in the beginning instead of relying on the familiarity with <code>mypy</code> :)</p>
<p>The behaviour I'd expect is that all unresolved imports of <code>foobar</code> are silenced (e.g. <code>from foobar import X</code>).</p>
<p>The use case/rationale behind it is e.g. an environment where we run <code>ty</code> locally in a runtime that does not include <code>foobar</code>, but the package is ultimately used in a docker container that vends <code>foobar</code> (hence lack of <code>foobar</code> outside of the docker runtime).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, that makes sense. I was just asking because we support the latter (by using overrides).</p>
<p>An allowlist for modules that are known not to exist and should be silently treated as any makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Yup, I found that one.</p>

<p>Is that something you considered for your roadmap? Otherwise, can we keep this one as a feature request?</p>

<p>Yes, it's something we also already discussed as a team. It's not on our immediate roadmap but it's a feature we want and this issue is great for tracking it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I bump the priority on this one because it seems relatively easy to implement and has come up a few times.</p>
