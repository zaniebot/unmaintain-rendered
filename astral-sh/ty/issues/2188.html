            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Unrelated code in a  initializer appears to prevent type narrowing. Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Foo:
    def bar(self) -&gt; None:
        # revealed type changes to `Literal[True]` if you comment out any of these lines related to _unrelated
        if hasattr(self, &quot;_unrelated&quot;):
            return
        self._unrelated = True

        self._b: bool | None = None    
        self._b = True
        reveal_type(self._b)  # bool | None, expected Literal[True]
</code></pre>
<p>If you comment out any of the <code>_unrelated</code> lines, it changes to <code>Literal[True]</code>.</p>
<p>This behaviour seems to be specific to it being an instance method. For a regular function, the type narrowing never happens.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Heh, file this one under &quot;things I did not expect to get an issue about.&quot; Lesson learned: everything will be noticed :) Thanks for the report!</p>
<p>Your &quot;unrelated&quot; code is not really entirely unrelated, because of the conditional <code>return</code>. What happens here is that we enter a cycle finding the attributes of instances of <code>Foo</code>, because we flip between thinking the class has two attributes and thinking it has none (because once we think it has <code>_unrelated</code>, then we see the early exit.) We fallback to just going with the declared type, which I think is reasonable.</p>
<p>There are various possible improvements here, though I don't think the current behavior is that much of a problem.</p>
