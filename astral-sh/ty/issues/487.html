            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi ty-team,</p>
<p>I was trying to fix up some unresolved-attribute errors reported by ty related to lxml.etree in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lxml/">lxml</a>.</p>
<p>Reducing it down to just an import statement, ty doesn't seem to be able to see lxml.etree:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cat use_lxml.py 
import lxml.etree

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ty check use_lxml.py 
WARN ty is pre-release software and not ready for production use. Expect to encounter bugs, missing features, and fatal errors.
error[unresolved-import]: Cannot resolve imported module `lxml.etree`
 --&gt; use_lxml.py:1:8
  |
1 | import lxml.etree
  |        ^^^^^^^^^^

info: make sure your Python environment is properly configured: https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/README.md#python-environment
info: rule `unresolved-import` is enabled by default

<p><code>lxml.etree</code> is a C extension module. I wonder if we could detect this and show a better error?</p>
<p>You probably want to fix this by installing <code>types-lxml</code>?</p>

<p>Pyright does a fancy thing in its module resolver to distinguish between modules that are definitely unresolvable (no python or C-extension modules are available) and modules which might be resolvable but which it cannot inspect, because it's a C extension or similar and there are no stubs installed.</p>
<p>Mypy does not have that feature, but it does have a hardcoded list of untyped packages for which it knows high-quality stubs are available, and issues a nice diagnostic suggesting to install the relevant stubs package if it issues an <code>unresolved-import</code> diagnostic on one of those packages.</p>
<p>We don't have either feature right now; we could consider adding one or both. (The mypy one is easier to implement!)</p>

<p><code>uv add types-lxml --dev</code> does the trick - thanks @sharkdp!</p>
