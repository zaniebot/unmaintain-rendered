            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently do some extensive special-casing in <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::infer_call_expression_impl</code>, much of which dates back to working around limitations we no longer have, and can/should now be removed. Part of this special-casing is a dedicated path for constructor calls (<code>Type::try_call_constructor</code>), which doesn't use the bindings that would be returned by <code>Type::bindings</code> for the same type -- so it's not consistent with what happens if you use <code>Type::try_call</code>. This leads to bugs like https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1446</p>
