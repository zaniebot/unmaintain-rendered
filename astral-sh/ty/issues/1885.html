            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's because they're sorted by default severity first. We could consider showing the default severity more prominently or, as you suggest, just sort alphabetically.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see! That wasn't at all obvious to me. I think I'd vote for keeping it simple and just sorting them alphabetically, unless we want to have a whole different section in the docs for each severity group.</p>
