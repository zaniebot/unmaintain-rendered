            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pyright allows functions to unsoundly have empty bodies even if they have a non-<code>None</code> return type, and mypy used to allow this too. As a result, we've seen several instances of users being confused by the fact that we do not allow this. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def foo() -&gt; int: ...  # error[invalid-return-type]
</code></pre>
<p>It's a deliberate decision from us to be more strict than pyright here, since this function obviously does not return an <code>int</code> at runtime. We already have a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/5b1d3ac9b9c458448e388075945869a4d49296a9/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/diagnostic.rs#L2676-L2679">subdiagnostic</a> message that explains the specific conditions in which we do allow functions to have empty bodies. However, splitting this into a separate <code>empty-body</code> error code would allow users who are heavily impacted by this inconsistency to switch it off on their codebase (even just temporarily while they work down the number of errors). This would also match mypy's behaviour (mypy has a dedicated <code>empty-body</code> error code.</p>
