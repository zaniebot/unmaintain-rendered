            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>Follow-up from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14099 which was closed by astral-sh/ruff#16073 which adds support for re-export conventions in stub files unconditionally.</p>
<p>We should add a new lint rule <code>implicit-reexport</code> which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled by default</li>
<li>When enabled, performs the check for runtime files</li>
</ul>
<p>For stub files, the implementation is such that it will ignore the symbol if it's not being re-exported which means that the symbol could be unbound as seen in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/60b3ef2c985dba405db58a72bc6f22ff64c249fa/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/import/conventions.md">these tests</a>. But, for runtime files, we should be inferring the types correctly.</p>
