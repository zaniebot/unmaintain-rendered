</code></pre>
<p>According to typeshed, <code>typing.Callable</code> and <code>collections.abc.Callable</code> are the same object, and it would require quite deep special casing from us to override typeshed on that point. So I&#x27;m not sure this is worth fixing.</p>

<p>I think that would be likely to either break existing type checkers, or else have somewhat unexpected effects on their handling of <code>Callable</code>. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the disruption to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Is there real-world code where this causes issues? What&#x27;s the use case needing to consider <code>collections.abc.Callable</code> (but not <code>typing.Callable</code>) an instance of <code>type</code></p>

<p>i mean, ty&#x27;s vendored typeshed, not the upstream one</p>

<p>i have run into it in the past where the <code>typing</code> definition of <code>Callable</code> has caused issues, i think there is some special handling in ty already to avoid this as <code>class C(Callable)</code> isn&#x27;t reported. imo it&#x27;s better to iron out this incorrect definition at the root</p>

<p>I see — no, I&#x27;d strongly prefer it if we can avoid patching upstream typeshed unless we have a very good reason for it. The patches mypy has applied to typeshed have been a real maintenance headache for them and made syncing typeshed much more complicated for them than it should be because of the frequent merge conflicts. I don&#x27;t want for us to get into a similar situation.</p>
<p>Our handling of special forms is quite different to most other type checkers, as you&#x27;ve already observed, so I think it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll have the same bugs that you&#x27;ve observed with mypy. <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1220">astral-sh/ty#1220</a> relates to a branch of code in ty that is already marked as TODO. We actually infer a <code>Todo</code> type currently (which is similar to <code>Unknown</code>, but is explicit about the fact that there&#x27;s still some missing logic in ty) when <code>Callable</code> is present as a base class.</p>
<p>So all in all, I don&#x27;t see sufficient motivation to make any changes with regards to this one. But thanks for the report!</p>
