            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Add support for workspace-wide diagnostics in addition to showing diagnostics for open files only. Default to workspace-wide diagnostics, but with an option to switch to open file diagnostics.</p>
<h2>Work items</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Initial support for workspace diagnostics using <code>workspace/diagnostic</code> endpoint (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18939)</li>
<li>[x] Fix VS Code not clearing diagnostics in non-workspace mode (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18939 &gt; &quot;Test Plan&quot; &gt; &quot;VS Code&quot;) (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19273)</li>
<li>[x] Consider open virtual files (<em>might</em> requires #619) (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19322)</li>
<li>[ ] Add support using publish diagnostics notification (<em>low priority</em>) [^1]</li>
<li>[ ] Consider Jupyter Notebooks (<em>low priority</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>[^1]: This is a low priority mainly because clients like VS Code, Zed and (soon) Neovim supports the <code>workspace/diagnostic</code> (pull diagnostic) endpoint.</p>

<p>I think we should only do this if there are user requests for it otherwise it might get complicated to support both the push and pull model for workspace diagnostics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider Jupyter Notebooks (low priority)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merging this into #173</p>
<hr />
<p>Closing this as completed. I've opened a separate issue for the one remaining task which is related to performance.</p>
