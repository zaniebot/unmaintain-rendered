# String Literal Contains the whole string as it is

_Issue opened by @AnirudhG07 on 2025-08-06 13:47_

Hi, I am using `ty` in neovim. Thanks for `ty`, as a rust user, I liked this idea so much(as a fellow rust user)!

Version: 
ty: `0.0.1-alpha.16 (c452e53a0 2025-07-25)`
Python: `3.13.1`

As you can the problem I have. I donot want to have the whole string in Literal, just `Literal[str]` should be enough. Please share a fix, or if this is a bug, fix it.

Thank you!!!
