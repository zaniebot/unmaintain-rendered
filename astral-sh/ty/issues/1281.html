            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is probably covered by one of the other bi-directional type inference issues, but I could not find it exactly, so I figured I'd open a new issue.</p>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/b0eee25d-19ac-40cf-a5f5-6b3271ee61e7</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Literal

issue: dict[Literal[&quot;a&quot;], Literal[1]] = {
    &quot;a&quot;: 1
}  # Object of type `dict[Unknown | str, Unknown | int]` is not assignable to `dict[Literal[&quot;a&quot;], Literal[1]]` (invalid-assignment) [Ln 3, Col 1]
</code></pre>
<p>This could probably be solved also if there was some mechanism where the literal was also considered to have the Literals of all it's key/values Literal variants, but I think this could also be solved with bi-directional type inference.</p>
