            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi, thanks for the great work! Creating this as a request for documentation. We're considering moving from pyright to ty, but unsure of what the impact of the change is going to have on the rules that are being enforced.</p>
<p>While there is documentation of the rules in the docs, it would help pyright users if there was documentation on how to migrate from a strict pyright configuration to ty. What exactly is the feature parity between pyright and ty?</p>
<p>The FAQ mentions that ty does not have a strict mode and suggests complementing it with ruff - are there other rules that are missing at this point in ty compared to pyright?</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.0.8</p>
