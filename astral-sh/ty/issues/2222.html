            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I cannot really find anything about the longer term ambition for ty. I know it is early days. Is the long term goal to give a similar feature set and developer experience as in typescript?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An example is the <code>keyof</code> keyword in typescript. Could you see ty inferring keys doing something like this <code>Literal[*example_dict]</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. For reference, TypeScript supports many <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/types-from-types.html">type mapping operators</a> that allow creating new types by mapping over existing types (similar to <code>map</code> but instead of mapping a value, mapping a type).</p>
<p>We&#x27;re interested in experimenting on new typing features (and we already did by introducing intersection types) once we ship a stable version of ty. However, we also want to do it without fragmenting Python&#x27;s typing ecosystem. Meaning, ideally we&#x27;d propose those new features to the Python&#x27;s typing specification (maybe after some experimentation on our end)</p>

<p>Ah, yes, exactly what I was thinking about.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the tradeoffs you have to make. I understand that it would be most beneficial to have these in Python&#x27;s typing specification, however, that can be a fairly long process. Maybe you could consider making some of these features opt-in, and support them natively in ty, to the extend it makes sense. Just throwing ideas.</p>
