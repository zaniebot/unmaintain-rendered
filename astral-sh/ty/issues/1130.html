            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>We just closed #456, but there&#x27;s one special case that needs more attention: <code>isinstance(x, dict)</code>. The tricky part is that TypedDicts are instances of <code>dict</code> at runtime, but are not (generally) assignable to any materialization of <code>dict[Any, Any]</code>. (See the proposed spec change in <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/pull/2072">python/typing#2072</a> for the details.)</p>
<p>Current behavior is as follows (<a href="https://play.ty.dev/89647293-a588-442d-ae5c-d0e2fbdacd2c">playground</a>):</p>
<pre><code>from typing import TypedDict

class X(TypedDict):
    a: int

def _(x: list | X):
    if isinstance(x, dict):
        reveal_type(x)  # X &amp; Top[dict[Unknown, Unknown]]
    else:
        reveal_type(x)  # list[Unknown] | (X &amp; ~Top[dict[Unknown, Unknown]])
</code></pre>
<p>Mypy and pyright both infer <code>X</code> in the positive branch and <code>list[Any]</code> in the negative branch, which is what we&#x27;d want.</p>
<p>I know TypedDict support is still missing a lot of functionality, so things will change, but I see a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make TypedDict types into subtypes of <code>Top[dict[Unknown, Unknown]]</code>. That would make this sample work correctly, but it&#x27;s technically wrong in that TypedDicts aren&#x27;t materializations of <code>dict[Any, Any]</code>. As such, it may cause issues with other possible use cases for <code>Top[]</code>. It would also allow some unsafe operations (https://github.com/JelleZijlstra/unsoundness/blob/main/examples/narrowing/isinstance_dict.py).</li>
<li>Change the spec so that TypedDict types are assignable to <code>dict[str, Any]</code>. I think that&#x27;s a defensible change, but it&#x27;s not what the current spec says and I don&#x27;t know if such a change would see a positive reception.</li>
<li>Add a new special form <code>ty_extensions.AnyTypedDict</code>, with the semantics that any TypedDict type is a subtype of <code>AnyTypedDict</code>. The only allowed operations on <code>AnyTypedDict</code> are those that are allowed on any TypedDict (so no <code>.clear()</code>; <code>.keys()</code> returns an iterable of <code>str</code>; <code>.values()</code> an iterable of <code>object</code>; etc.). <code>isinstance(x, dict)</code> would narrow to <code>AnyTypedDict | Top[dict[Unknown, Unknown]]</code>. This is technically correct and would fix the soundness hole in https://github.com/JelleZijlstra/unsoundness/blob/main/examples/narrowing/isinstance_dict.py, but it would introduce a new user-visible concept.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this would also require that TypedDict types are all subtypes of <code>Top[dict[str, Any]]</code>?</p>
<p>And this also would require that <code>.clear()</code> be part of the <code>TypedDict</code> type, allowing that unsoundness.</p>

<p>We could potentially spell the new type <code>Top[TypedDict]</code> instead of <code>AnyTypedDict</code> (I&#x27;d probably prefer to stay away from the word &quot;Any&quot; regardless, as part of the name of a fully-static type), which means it doesn&#x27;t require any new symbols.</p>
