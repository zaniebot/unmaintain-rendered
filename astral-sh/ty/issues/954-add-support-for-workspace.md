# Add support for `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders`

This is dependent on #89.

Once the server supports multiple workspaces, we can add support for dynamically adding and removing workspaces from the server to reflect the state in the editor.

I'll close this in favor of [#89](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/89) as I'd consider any workspace implementation as incomplete that doesn't handle `didChangeWorkspaceFolders`
