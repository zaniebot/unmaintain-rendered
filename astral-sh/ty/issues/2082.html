            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Similar to https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/configuration/#replace-imports-with-any%20option</p>
<p>This is useful for highly-dynamic and/or badly-typed third-party modules that you just want to not get false positives from, ever.</p>
<p>Would be a solution to #2076</p>
<p>Related but not the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1354</p>

<p>Not necessarily <em>that</em> tricky... we could add another <code>DynamicType</code> variant that carries around our &quot;best-guess&quot; type inside it (and uses that for completions), but acts like <code>Any</code> in that it always results in zero diagnostics when type-checking?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll bump the priority on this because it has come up a few times and I suspect it's very easy to implement.</p>
