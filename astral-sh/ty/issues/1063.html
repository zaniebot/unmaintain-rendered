            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>It would be great if we can have a document that compares the rules vs pyright.  It would make it easier to migrate to ty based on this doc, and understanding equivilent behaviour</p>

<p>I think this can be folded into &quot;adding a migration guide&quot; but it might be a while before we invest time into it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d also find it immensely helpful to have a migration guide from tools like <code>pyright</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m currently attempting to migrate to <code>ty</code> in a rather large codebase (https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) and am finding there to be a lot of diagnostic messages due to lack of rule set parity. I&#x27;d be happy to resolve them with code changes, but would also want to be certain I&#x27;m not just missing a setting.</p>
