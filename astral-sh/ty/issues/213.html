            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>Real-world type-checker users often want to get a sense of how well-covered their code is with static types. One granular way to measure this is &quot;percentage of expressions typed with a dynamic type&quot;.</p>
<p>We would also have an internal use case for measuring &quot;percentage of expressions typed with a Todo type&quot; as a measure of red-knot progress.</p>
