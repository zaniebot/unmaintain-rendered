            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>You should be able to extend callable instances (e.g. functions) with attributes. Currently instead I get the above error for the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def a():
    a.test = 1
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think it would be consistent for this to be allowed. In general, statically typed Python assumes that classes have a certain known set of attributes (with known types), and only those attributes can be set (to the correct types) on instances of those classes. Functions do not generally have a <code>test</code> attribute.</p>
<p>All major type checkers (mypy, pyright, pyrefly) agree with us that this code is an error. (In mypy you have to add <code>-&gt; None</code> to the function definition, otherwise the function body isn't checked at all.)</p>
<p>It's true that setting arbitrary attributes on functions works at runtime, but so does this, and no type checker allows this either:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class A(): pass

a = A()
a.test = 1
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Weird, because in our existing type checker, basedpyright, I am sure that this is allowed. I will check with regular old pyright and come back if it also allows this behaviour</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have wondered in the past whether we should add a <code>__setattr__</code> method to <code>FunctionType</code> in typeshed... I do agree that it's quite common (and quite idiomatic!) to monkey-patch attributes onto functions, and that the status quo makes typing many decorators quite painful</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In pyright, this is configurable. Pyright has a specific diagnostic category for this check: <code>reportFunctionMemberAccess</code>. This check is <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=diagnostic-settings-defaults">disabled</a> in &quot;basic&quot; type checking mode but is enabled in &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;strict&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll reopen this, it seems like at some point we may want to consider how we can better support this use case.</p>
