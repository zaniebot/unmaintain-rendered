            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First of all, thanks for ty!</p>
<p>I’d like to ask whether <code>ty</code> plans to support an <code>extend</code> configuration field, similar to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery">the one provided by <code>ruff</code></a>, to allow explicit configuration inheritance.</p>
<p>This would be helpful for sharing common configuration parameters in monorepositories with multiple <code>pyproject.toml</code> files, while keeping overrides explicit and localized.</p>

<p>@aeroyorch could you say a bit more about your project layout? More specifically, where do you want to define the shared configuration and where would you use it (projects of the same workspace or across workspaces?)</p>

<p>In my case, this is a typical <code>uv</code> workspace with several packages and a root <code>pyproject.toml</code>. Maybe, supporting configuration inheritance or extension in <code>ty</code>, similar to <code>ruff</code>, would help keep configuration patterns consistent across both tools.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If the inherited pyproject.toml can be anywhere (same behavior as the <code>extend</code> key of ruff) instead of just in a parent folder (as per #175) this would allow more use cases (e.g. a monorepo where the root is not a pyproject can still have some global ruff + ty configuration defined in a, for example, <code>python_linter</code> directory that all other projects inherit).</p>
<p>Either way, to me this alone would be a killer feature to adopt ty (as is the equivalent ruff option).</p>
