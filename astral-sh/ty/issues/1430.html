            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We're fixing this issue in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21049 for goto-definition for unary operators, but the issue also exists for goto-definition for binary operators. Goto-definition allows you to jump from the first <code>+</code> in this snippet to <code>Foo.__add__</code>, but doesn't currently allow you to jump from the second <code>+</code> in this snippet to <code>Bar.__add__</code> (because <code>Bar.__add__</code> has an invalid definition):</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Foo:
    def __add__(self, other): ...

Foo() + Foo()

class Bar:
    def __add__(self): ...

Bar() + Bar()
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally goto-definition wouldn't care about such details, and would jump to <code>Bar.__add__</code> even though it's invalid here. It's also probably not high-priority to fix this, though.</p>
