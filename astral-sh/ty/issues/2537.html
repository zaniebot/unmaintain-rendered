            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Consider a <code>dict[K, V]</code> like class with a get method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Any, reveal_type

class Map[K, V]:
    def set(self, key: K, value: V) -&gt; None: ...
    def get[T=None](self, key: Any, default: T = None, /) -&gt; V | T: ...

d: Map[str, int] = Map[str, int]()

# as expected, these are both `Any | None`
reveal_type(d.get(&quot;key&quot;))  # int | None  ✅️
reveal_type(d.get(&quot;key&quot;, None))  # int | None  ✅️
# outer context should not overrule the argument type!
result: str = reveal_type(d.get(&quot;key&quot;, None))  # int | None | str ❌️
</code></pre>
<p><code>d.get(&quot;key&quot;, None)</code> alone produces <code>int | None</code> as expected, but in the last case we have <code>str</code> as outer context. This gives an unsolvable situation for the type variable <code>T</code> as we would need both <code>T &lt;: str</code> and <code>T :&gt; None</code>. It seems <code>ty</code> gives priority to the outer constraint <code>T &lt;: str</code> here, which seems misguided, as it produces an illogical <code>reveal_type</code> result: <code>int | None | str</code>.</p>
<p>But <code>d.get(&quot;key&quot;, None)</code> cannot produce a <code>str</code>!</p>
<p>Instead, the inner constraint <code>T :&gt; None</code> should probably be prioritized in this situation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to be clear, this is purely an issue of the diagnostic / hover / revealed type -- there is no type checking correctness issue here?</p>
<p>I think this is a known issue with how we apply type context in generic cases. We would like to fix it, but we don't consider it super high priority since it just makes the revealed types sometimes wrongly include the context type, when there is no solution that satisfies the context type. It doesn't ever change the correctness of a program.</p>
