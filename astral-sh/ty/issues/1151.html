<p>Do we want to support go to on augmented assignments? Pylance doesn't support it as far as I can tell and it's less clear if jumping to e.g. <code>__bool__</code> for <code>&amp;=</code> seems is the correct behavior as it is a combined operator (it's just that there's no where to jump to for <code>=</code>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know why pylance doesn't support it -- is it possible that that's just an oversight? To me it seems natural that we'd jump to <code>__iadd__</code> for <code>+=</code> (or <code>__add__</code>/<code>__radd__</code> if there's no <code>__iadd__</code> method and the operation falls back to one of those).</p>

<p>Do you mean <code>__iand__</code>? Not sure why <code>__bool__</code> would be involved for <code>&amp;=</code> :-)</p>
