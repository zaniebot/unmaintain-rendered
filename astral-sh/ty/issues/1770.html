            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, but I would expect it to be included in the import suggestions with or without <code>pandas-stubs</code> being installed, yeah. I can't see anything obvious in the <code>pandas</code> or <code>pandas-stubs</code> package layout that we know isn't supported by the <code>SymbolFinder</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So I'm not sure what happened, but <code>read_csv</code> shows up for me in auto-import now:</p>
<p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb3de31c-a5a9-4604-9a32-9e5701a534c3</p>
<p>It's also the first result, which is nice.</p>
<p>pylance also handles this correctly, but it <em>only</em> shows the top-level result:</p>
<p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/356b3183-546c-4e88-9f03-178ac1cc1078</p>
<p>I created https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1857 to track removing the duplicate suggestions for cases like this. But I guess this issue can be closed.</p>
