<p>We should revisit the rename feature and stabilizie it once we have more confidence in it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran into this yesterday with a much more complex example, and I only found out that ty's rename functionality broke my code several minutes later (and at that point it is difficult to undo). We should refuse to rename a variable if there is an existing variable of that name.</p>
<p>To reproduce, start with a snippet like the one below, and then rename <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>. The behavior of the script will change.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f():
    x = 1
    print(&quot;the value of x is:&quot;, x)
    y = &quot;foo&quot;
    print(&quot;x still has the value:&quot;, x)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh that's an interesting/good idea.</p>
<p>(Related but different: rust-analyzer will introduce shims to preserve the old name in some contexts. i.e. if you rename a struct field <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>, in places where you destructure it, it may change a simple <code>x</code> pattern to <code>y: x</code> so that the local you introduce in whatever function is still called <code>x</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Other things that come to mind that we should test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renaming a definition from a third-party file should always fail (e.g. renaming a class defined in a third-party library or a method of a class from where it's used)</li>
<li>Renaming a member should rename the member for all sub-classes</li>
<li>Renaming named parameters should rename the call sites</li>
<li>Renaming a named argument should probably not rename a named parameter?</li>
