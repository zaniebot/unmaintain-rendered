# Stabilize auto imports

---

_@MichaReiser_

Our auto-import functionality has improved a lot since we added it. I think we should stabilizie it (remove the `experimental.autoimport` option)

I've been using auto import daily since it became available. Even if we don't offer all completions in all cases yet, the actual insertion of the import has never once been a problem for me, and I guess that's the critical part here. I think it would be good to stabilize this for the beta release so that we can get more user input before the stable release.
