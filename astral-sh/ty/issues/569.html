<p>If you see the screenshot below, the type is not known to <code>ty</code>, but ty gives an error about the object maybe not being iterable. This is different than the warning seen above where <code>ty</code> is unsure about the attribute being unbound, so gives a warning.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have a <code>possibly-not-iterable</code> rule to fit cases like these to distinguish between known and unknown iterable states.</p>

<p>Perhaps the diagnostic could be improved to make this clearer, but in both of these cases the type that ty is worried about is not the <code>Unknown</code>, it&#x27;s the <code>None</code>. ty is very forgiving about <code>Unknown</code> -- will happily consider it iterable and having all attributes. But <code>None</code> is a known quantity: it is definitely not iterable, it definitely does not  have an <code>info</code> attribute, so these are correct errors for ty to emit.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x27;s correct for ty to believe that <code>logger</code> and <code>providers</code> in these two snippets can be <code>None</code>, is a different question, but it&#x27;s one that can&#x27;t be answered with just the bits of code you included here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@carljm that&#x27;s a great explanation of <code>ty</code>&#x27;s point of view on this. Looking at the larger context, I see that the parameter is indeed unguarded at this point to make sure the value isn&#x27;t <code>None</code> in this comprehension. Once that guarding takes place, the error message is removed!</p>
<p>With that in mind, I would consider <code>ty</code>&#x27;s behavior to be the most correct assessment. Thanks, Astral team, for another great tool!</p>
