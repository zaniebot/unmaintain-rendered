            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider this example (<a href="https://play.ty.dev/9ec508e3-29af-43e2-a761-967982cf6a56">playground</a>):</p>
<pre><code>class C[T]:
	_v: T
	def __init__(self, v: T) -&gt; None:
		self._v = v

c = C(0)
c._v = 1  # Currently allowed
</code></pre>
<p>The assignment to <code>c._v</code> should be reported, since otherwise an instance of <code>C</code> would be considered mutable, causing <code>T</code> to be invariant instead of covariant. For consistency, I think read accesses should also be disallowed.</p>
<p>This issue is related to #488.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For soundness with inferred-variance type variables, we technically only need to forbid access of private variables typed with a typevar (or some type including the typevar), which we ignored in variance inference.</p>
<p>There is some tension with the gradual guarantee here; apart from the issue with variance inference, this is a fairly opinionated lint rule, not a &quot;your code will fail&quot; type error. If it weren&#x27;t for the variance issue, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t consider this a candidate for an enabled-by-default rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://discuss.python.org/t/should-variance-inference-ignore-underscore-prefixed-attributes/102978</p>
<p>Our variance inference does consider underscore-prefixed attributes to be immutable, so for soundness we would need to at least make mutation of them an error.</p>
<p>I think I&#x27;m leaning towards making mutation an error but access not an error. (We currently do still consider an underscore-prefixed attribute to constrain its typevar to covariance, so allowing access is not unsound, just mutation.)</p>
