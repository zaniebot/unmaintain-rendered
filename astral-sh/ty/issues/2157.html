            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Looking at the documentation / faq / existing issues I can't see this reported/explained anywhere else, but I may not have looked for the right thing.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/reference/protocols.html#defining-subprotocols-and-subclassing-protocols">example from the python typing documentation</a> doesn't seem to work as expected:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Protocol

class SomeProto(Protocol):
    attr: int  # Note, no right hand side
    # If the body is literally just &quot;...&quot;, explicit subclasses will
    # be treated as abstract classes if they don't implement the method.
    def method(self) -&gt; str: ...

class ExplicitSubclass(SomeProto):
    pass

ExplicitSubclass()  # error: Cannot instantiate abstract class 'ExplicitSubclass'
                    # with abstract attributes 'attr' and 'method'
</code></pre>
<p>mypy gives an error as expected:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; mypy .\test.py    
test.py:16: error: Cannot instantiate abstract class &quot;ExplicitSubclass&quot; with abstract attributes &quot;attr&quot; and &quot;method&quot;  [abstract]
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</code></pre>
<p>ty gives no error, which is not correct (<code>ExplicitSubclass().method()</code> will return <code>None</code> which is not of type <code>str</code>):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ty check .\test.py
All checks passed!
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! I agree we don't have an issue specifically open for this right now, but this is basically the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1877, so I'll close this in favour of that one and add a comment saying that we also need to treat <code>Protocol</code> methods as implicitly abstract 👍</p>
