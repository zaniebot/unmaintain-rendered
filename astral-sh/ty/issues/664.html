            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Ty emits &quot;possibly-unbound-attribute&quot; diagnostic on setting the attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Self

class Foo:
    def __init(self: Self, flag: bool):
        if flag:
            self.x = 1 # error possibly-unbound-attribute
</code></pre>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/617d2c31-fe1b-4c8a-9787-7b7baf1f886d</p>
<p>Currently in a class body if an instance attribute is conditionally defined or undefined, we emit a diagnostic on setting the attribute.</p>
<p>Instead ty should report when accessing the attribute. In the previous code example if we only accessed the <code>self.x</code> when it's undefined the diagnostic made sense.</p>
<p>Another example of where this diagnostic makes sense.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class C:
    if flag:
        x: int

C().x  # error: [possibly-unbound-attribute]
</code></pre>
<p>comments from @carljm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that in the case of a possibly-unbound implicit instance attribute, we should never emit a diagnostic on that, whether inside or outside the class body, and whether setting or accessing the attribute</p>
</blockquote>
<p>comments from @sharkdp on implementation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree that we shouldn't even attempt to emit that diagnostic in case that it refers to an instance attribute. For other attribute accesses, like on class bodies or modules, it probably still makes sense, but might be similarly problematic to possibly-unresolved-reference, which we've recently degraded to ignored-by-default.
Fixing that would require a richer return type for Type::member, I think. We are planning to do that anyway for better error messages, but I guess in the non-error case, we could also return additional metadata (what kind of attribute is this, is the returned type the result of a descriptor <strong>get</strong> method, etc.)</p>

<p>That sounds great. The two source ranges I linked above are good places to start. I think we probably want to skip over eagerly-executed scopes before trying to identify the method scope (and its parent class scope). We should also take care of skipping type-parameter scopes, which I think is not done consistently at the moment: For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class C:
    def f[T](self):
        [[... for self.x in ...] for ... in ...]
</code></pre>
<p>Here, I think we have the following scope stack when discovering the <code>self.x</code> expression (I have not checked this, might also look slightly different):</p>
<pre><code>inner comprehension scope (eagerly executed)
outer comprehension scope (eagerly executed)
scope of function `f`
type parameter scope `[T]`
scope of class `C`
</code></pre>
<p>So if we want to properly mark (and later recognize) this as an attribute assignment to <code>self.x</code>, we should first skip all non-function eagerly-executed scopes (in this case: the two comprehensions), then verify that we are in a function scope, then skip the type parameter scope, then verify that the function is inside a class.</p>
<p>Maybe it makes sense to limit this to eager comprehension scopes for now(?).</p>
<p>This old PR is probably also interesting: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17012.</p>
