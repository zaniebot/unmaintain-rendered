            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @IsoNovio</p>
<p>I only just became aware of the extension. We don't maintain the extension. It has been published by a third party. I reached out to the Zed team and asked them to update the plugin's metadata to point to the proper repository. I suggest you create an issue there once the metadata has been updated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please report this in https://github.com/zed-extensions/ty</p>
<p>I suspect the issue is that the server can't find the <code>ty</code> binary at the path that you specified in your configuration.</p>

<p>Hi! Is there a plan to create an &quot;official&quot; extension by the team?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, creating a Zed extension is not on our current roadmap but it could be something that we would discuss at later point.</p>
<p>Are you facing any issues in using ty with the Zed editor?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For now the only issue was the types hints in line not showing, in vscode it was working. For the linter itself, works like a charm!</p>
