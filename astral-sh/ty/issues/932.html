            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Apologies if I have posted this in the wrong repo, just wondering if there are going to be plans on adding fixes for type errors that can be done safely and or add the ability to add types to things where it is not typed automatically? Or is the goal to add these to ruff that would interface with ty?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, we plan to support auto fixes for rules where an unambiguous fix is possible in the future, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/635. Unlike many ruff rules, typing errors are a bit trickier because it's not always clear what the proper fix is, but it should be possible for some rules.</p>
