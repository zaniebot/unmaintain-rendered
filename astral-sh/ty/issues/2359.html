            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! This actually doesn't seem to have anything to do with type aliases, but it has everything to do with lambdas.</p>
<p>We can see that if we use a function defined using a <code>def</code> statement, ty has the behaviour you'd expect here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from collections.abc import Callable

type TA[**P] = Callable[P, None]

lam: TA[int] = lambda x: print(x)
reveal_type(lam)  # (x) -&gt; Unknown
v1: TA[int] = lam # No error
v2: TA[str] = lam # No error

def f(x: int, /) -&gt; None: pass

not_lam: TA[int] = f
reveal_type(not_lam)  # def f(x: int, /) -&gt; None
v3: TA[int] = not_lam
v4: TA[str] = not_lam  # error, as expected
</code></pre>
<p>What's happening is that for your <code>lambda</code> case, we don't yet use the annotated type of the variable (or any other type context) to inform how we should infer the type of a <code>lambda</code>'s parameter types. This means that the inferred type of the <code>lam</code> variable is <code>(x) -&gt; Unknown</code> despite the explicit type annotation of <code>TA[int]</code>. We allow an object with type <code>(x) -&gt; Unknown</code> to be assigned to the variable annotated with <code>TA[int]</code>, because <code>(x) -&gt; Unknown</code> is assignable to the type <code>Callable[[int], None]</code>, but that doesn't alter our locally inferred type for the <code>lam</code> variable.</p>
<p>Since type aliases generic over paramspecs seem to be working fine if you use a function defined via a <code>def</code> statement, this seems to be just a duplicate of #181</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think for the specific OP example, #136 would be sufficient even without any bidirectional typing of lambdas. With that change we'd just respect the annotated <code>TA[int]</code> type, and it wouldn't matter what we infer for the lambda in this case (beyond that we infer something assignable to <code>TA[int]</code>, which we already do).</p>
<p>But I think it's more common for lambdas to be used &quot;inline&quot;, without this kind of explicitly annotated assignment to a callable type, so #181 is also important -- just not necessary for this example.</p>

<p>Yes, either change would fix this, of course</p>
