# manylinux 2.17 wheels are missing on pypi for 0.10.0

### Question

Hello,

It seems from 0.9.0 to 0.10.0, the manylinux wheels builded with libc 2.17 has been replaced by 2.24 ones. Is this normal? 

**0.9.0 :**

**0.10.0 :** 

<img width="857" height="405" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51395628-440f-4bda-be03-e5d2b465e180" />

I am on a constrained environment (both OS and internet access) and I can only rely on already packaged wheels (cannot build locally if there is external dependencies like rust for example) 

Thanks

### Version

0.10.0
