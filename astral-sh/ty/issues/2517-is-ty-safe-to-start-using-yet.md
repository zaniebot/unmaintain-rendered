# Is ty safe to start using yet?

---

_@MarthinusBosman_

### Question

My bad for the dumb question, but I remember there being a note at the top of the ty page reading something like "ty is currently in early alpha, don't add this to any production projects" or similar, and I can't find it anymore.

Would love to just know if the maintainers feel like it's ok to start switching repos to use ty, or if you expect major breaking changes? I just had Pylance crash in VSCode again so was just hoping I could be optimistic.
