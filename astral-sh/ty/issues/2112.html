            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yeah. I think I argued against that a long time ago but I&#x27;ve come around to the view that it&#x27;s probably more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think it does much harm while it&#x27;s disabled by default, but it&#x27;s also just not a very useful rule in its current state.</p>
