            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yeah. I think I argued against that a long time ago but I've come around to the view that it's probably more trouble than it's worth.</p>
<p>I don't think it does much harm while it's disabled by default, but it's also just not a very useful rule in its current state.</p>
