            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to know if anything is planned for semantic highlighting.</p>
<p>It is a feature provided in basedpyright, pylance and even typescript language server that highlights based on the semantics, like known variables by the LSP are highlighted.</p>
<p>This has been very important in my workflow because I set syntax highlighting to very minimal and prefer to use mainly semantic highlighting. More colour in my code means more type-complete, making programming more fun kind of like painting.</p>
<p>I appreciate your work!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For example, the first function call would be coloured and the second would be white if I used basepyright&#x27;s semantic highlighting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s a cool feature! I think we have a fair amount of higher-priority things we need to do first, but this seems like an interesting feature to consider in future.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for considering!</p>
<p>As a reference this is what basedpyright looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b5d1d7c-e7cd-4d85-9314-ceaac86447cc"></p>
<p>The <code>var_outside_scope</code> has a semantic highlight as well, it just happens to be white in this case. So the variable within and outside of function have different colours.</p>
