            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An extremely useful and underappreciated feature of Mypy is that it is able to use type information to generate C extensions. Or IOW, it acts as a Python compiler (Mypyc). The result is substantially faster than plain interpreted Python. It is a good middle ground between doing nothing and doing a full RIIR.</p>
<p>It would be very cool if Ty could do this. Obviously this is a long-term feature request. Good to keep in mind at this early stage.</p>
<p>Could try out different codegen backends, etc.</p>
