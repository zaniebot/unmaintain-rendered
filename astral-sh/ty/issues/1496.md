# Reduce verbosity of inlay hints for assignments that use unpacking

---

_Issue opened by @smortezah on 2025-11-06 16:31_

### Question

How can I hide inferred types for a specific line since it exceeds my line limit and I can’t hard wrap the code on that line?

Is there any tag we could use at the end of the line, like `# ty: ignore`?

```python
# What I've written
model_instance, model_settings = create_model_and_settings(model=model)

# What is shown in VS Code (extra info is in faint grey)
model_instance: OpenAIChatCompletionsModel, model_settings: ModelSettings = create_model_and_settings(model=model)
```

### Version

There's no option to suppress an inlay hint (inferred type) within the editor for a specific line. I'm also not aware of any other server that supports this and I'm not convinced that pragma comments are a good use case for this because only some users in a project may have inlay hints enabled.

But we can think about ways to reduce the verbosity. E.g. Pylance only shows inlays for the last unpacked value:


```py
model_instance, model_settings: ModelSettings = create_model_and_settings()
```

which makes the line much shorter
