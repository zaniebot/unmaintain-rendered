# Migrating from Pyright

---

_Issue opened by @samirotiv-polybee on 2026-01-02 14:45_

### Question

Hi, thanks for the great work! Creating this as a request for documentation. We're considering moving from pyright to ty, but unsure of what the impact of the change is going to have on the rules that are being enforced. 

While there is documentation of the rules in the docs, it would help pyright users if there was documentation on how to migrate from a strict pyright configuration to ty. What exactly is the feature parity between pyright and ty?

The FAQ mentions that ty does not have a strict mode and suggests complementing it with ruff - are there other rules that are missing at this point in ty compared to pyright? 

### Version

0.0.8

This is similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2111 and #1063
