            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As VSCode user who uses rust-analyzer, here is the fallback scenario I would expect when failed to load configuration:
The prerequires here is ty-vscode could improve by adding a status button in the status bar and snapshot already loaded configurations.
When there is invalid configuration, status button should be change to warning and show what is it currently fallback to.
When there was snapshotted configuration, it goes with that and still provide an option to user to reset to default configuration when hovering over status button. (bonus here would be an option to open snapshotted configuration in new tab)</p>
<p>P.S I didn't have chance to test ty-vscode yet, so apologies if some of them already implemented.</p>
