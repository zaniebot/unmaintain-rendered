            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just want to focus on errors for now. I guess I can look up all the warning rules and call <code>--ignore &lt;RULE&gt;</code> for each but that's a bit tedious.</p>
<p><code>| grep -v warning</code> works for the concise output format, but having a <code>--errors-only</code> or something like it would still be very nice!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems like a reasonable thing to have (cc @MichaReiser)</p>
<p>ESLint uses the <code>--quiet</code> flag to hide warnings (https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--quiet)</p>
<p>Biome uses <code>--diagnostic-level</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>--diagnostic-level=&lt;info|warn|error&gt;</code> — The level of diagnostics to show. In order, from the lowest to the most important: info, warn, error. Passing <code>--diagnostic-level=error</code> will cause Biome to print only diagnostics that contain only errors.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The proper solution here depends on what exactly the issue author is looking for.</p>
<p>Adding a CLI flag to hide warning diagnostics is certainly something we can do. However, this won't hide the warnings in the editor.</p>
<p>The alternative to this would be something like profiles (see https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2129) that allow users to easily configure ty's strictness.</p>
<p>@tino can you say a little more about your specific use case?</p>

<p>Thanks. That's helpful. As another alternative design. Cargo has a <code>warnings</code> category. It's a bit weird because the category is dynamic. You only know what rules are in the <code>warnings</code> set after resolving the entire configuration. But it avoids any extra config flags. But it's a flexible combination of <code>error-on-warning</code> and any <code>--ignore warnings</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My use case:
When a developer runs a check locally, it returns 200 warnings and errors all combined.
Only <strong>errors</strong> should block their pre-commit (and CI), so I'd like to be able to filter to just show the errors with full details.</p>
<p>Other flag possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>--min-severity</li>
<li>--errors-only</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser my use case is the same, to use during CI/pre-commit. Seeing warnings in the editor is fine for me. We can already silence rules that we don't want, wether that's a warning or an error.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation, we'd start with the default config. So I'd rather have a single flag than having to compile some profile in which I determine what's a warning or not. <code>--errors-only</code> sounds reasonable.</p>
