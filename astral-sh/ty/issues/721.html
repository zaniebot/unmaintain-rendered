            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We introduced <code>AstIds</code> to get IDs that are local to a single scope. This has the benefit that local changes in one scope don't change IDs for other scopes. However, we don't really use the <code>ScopedExpressionId</code> in any place where this would be important (e.g. a scope local query result). I think this is mainly because we have <code>Expression</code> which accomplishes the same and is often more useful.</p>
<p>We should explore if we can remove <code>AstIds</code> by directly using <code>ExpressionNodeKey</code> instead. This should help reduce memory usage a fair amount because expressions are fairly common.</p>
