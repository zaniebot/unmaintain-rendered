<p>(Somewhat separately, I do wonder about our current behavior of interpreting any type: ignore with an unrecognized code as a blanket type: ignore. It seems unlikely to me that that will be the desired behavior for anyone -- but I&#x27;m also not sure what would be a better behavior.)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that it&#x27;s somewhat questionable but it does match pyright&#x27;s behavior. There&#x27;s also the argument, but not a very strong one, that the PEP only <a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#type-ignore-comments">specifies</a> that the comment starts with <code>type: ignore</code>. To my knowledge, <code>type: ignore[code]</code> is a mypy invention.</p>
<p>I think there&#x27;s an argument to always ignore <code>type: ignore[]</code> comments, since they&#x27;re obviously meant for mypy, not for ty. That might be annoying in the LSP use case when you use ty with a mypy project that requires <code>type: ignore[code]</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards leaving it as is. The user wants to suppress a type-check diagnostic on that line. Unfortunately, ty doesn&#x27;t understand which specific one it is, but ty should honor the user&#x27;s intent to suppress a diagnostic on that line.</p>
