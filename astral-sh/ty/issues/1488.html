            <div class="timeline-body"><p>See here for background on <code>available_submodule_attributes</code>:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/cef6600cf3a7a22db214c6cb5d2393ede4209c37/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types.rs#L10997-L11060</p>
<p>As discussed there, <code>available_submodule_attributes</code> is dangerously high priority and early in our analysis right now (&quot;wins all tie-breaks&quot;). In  https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21173 I actually rolled back my own attempts to expand the functionality of it, after we determined it was too semantically limited and heavy of a hammer for the problem we wanted to solve.</p>
<p>That said, <code>available_submodule_attributes</code> still has value, as this is basically the only way to introduce sub-attributes on modules other than the current file (i.e. to encode the effect that <code>import a.b.c</code> should make <code>a.b</code> and <code>a.b.c</code> available in-scope).</p>
<p>I believe we would be able to expand its functionality if we inverted its priority: instead of being the <em>first</em> thing we check, it should be the <em>last</em> thing we check. That is, if a module otherwise defines a local with that name, it should shadow the submodule attribute. This would make it more ok to eagerly shove as much as possible into <code>available_submodule_attributes</code>.</p>
<p>(I'm filling a couple issues that IMO &quot;need&quot; this as a prerequisite.)</p>
