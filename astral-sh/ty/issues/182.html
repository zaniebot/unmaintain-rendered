            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An instance of a type inheriting Any/Unknown should be assignable to any non-final type, because it might inherit from it.</p>
<p>Most common scenario where this occurs is <code>NotImplemented</code>; typeshed defines <code>_NotImplementedType</code> as inheriting <code>Any</code>. This is supposed to allow <code>NotImplemented</code> to be returned from any method, regardless of its annotated return type.</p>
<p>(Personally I am not sure this is right; only certain dunder methods really support returning <code>NotImplemented</code>. But I don&#x27;t think we should spend time on anything different here right now, we should just add the support for <code>Any</code> inheritance and let the behavior fall out from typeshed.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually I think to fully support <code>NotImplemented</code> via its typeshed annotation, we&#x27;d have to support assignability of &quot;instance-of-type-inheriting-Any&quot; to <em>all</em> types, which doesn&#x27;t seem correct to me. Such an instance still cannot be an instance of a final type; it cannot be a literal integer or string or bool, etc. I guess other type checkers just treat types inheriting <code>Any</code> as if they were fully <code>Any</code>, but that <a href="https://pyright-play.net/?strict=true&amp;code=GYJw9gtgBALgngBwJYDsDmUkQWEMoCCKcANFADJIwCmIAhgDYBQTAxg3QM6dQDCAFETgBKAFxQAdFJYAPcZRr0GAbQCMAXSgBePv2FA">doesn&#x27;t seem right</a>.</p>
<p>But it is important for <code>NotImplemented</code> to be returnable even from methods annotated to return a final type, or a literal type, etc. So maybe we should special-case <code>NotImplemented</code> as a <code>KnownInstance</code> instead, and handle it specially in return type checking. That doesn&#x27;t seem too difficult.</p>
