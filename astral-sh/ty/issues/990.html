            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Just wanted to see a comparison between <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright">pyright</a> and ty, how do the goals, priorities, and vision compare to each other?</p>
<p>What would be some reasons someone using pyright would switch to ty aside from performance?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ultimately ty and pyright are quite similar: both are Python type checkers and LSP servers that aim to understand your codebase and offer useful diagnostic feedback and IDE features.</p>
<p>There are a few differing type system decisions; ty puts a bit more emphasis than other Python type checkers on avoiding making assumptions that can result in false positives on working untyped code.</p>
<p>But ultimately I think the goals and vision are much more similar than different.</p>
