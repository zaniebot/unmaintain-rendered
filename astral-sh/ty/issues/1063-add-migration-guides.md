# Add migration guides

---

_Issue opened by @ShravanSunder on 2025-08-20 14:31_

### Question

It would be great if we can have a document that compares the rules vs pyright.  It would make it easier to migrate to ty based on this doc, and understanding equivilent behaviour

### Version

_No response_

Thank you for opening this issue!

I think this can be folded into "adding a migration guide" but it might be a while before we invest time into it.

I'd also find it immensely helpful to have a migration guide from tools like `pyright`.

I'm currently attempting to migrate to `ty` in a rather large codebase (https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) and am finding there to be a lot of diagnostic messages due to lack of rule set parity. I'd be happy to resolve them with code changes, but would also want to be certain I'm not just missing a setting.
