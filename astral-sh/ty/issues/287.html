            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! Yes, this is a known issue where we don't properly understand some common standard library generic types which inherit from generic protocols. There is a PR open already to fix it, we are just working on eliminating some issues with that PR before we land it.</p>
<p>(Note for future: it's always better to include text code samples in bug reports, rather than screenshots.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is partly fixed; we now do support these generic types, and support checking calls to methods of them.</p>
<p>What we are still missing here is captured by https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/543 -- closing in favor of that.</p>
