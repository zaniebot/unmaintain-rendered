# Autocompletion for Polars/Pandas Data Frame Column names, similar to how Pycharm & Data Lab IDE's provides

### Question

I am looking for a solution to the following. I am not sure if it already exists or if I need to turn on a setting: Python Autocompletion for Polars/Pandas Data Frame Column names, similar to how PyCharm & Data Lab IDEs provide autocompletion for column names

Can't seem to trigger it. Happy to share more details if it helps. As you can see, the dataframe is loaded in memory.

It only works when using square brackets and trying to access it as dict
