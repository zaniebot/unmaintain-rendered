            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If you hover on <code>bar</code> in the following, you get <code>Never</code></p>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/61a6752c-3844-4494-9ad5-367de301f768</p>
<p>This is totally reasonable behaviour from a type checker, but it's not as ideal for an LSP. It's pretty common to temporarily have unreachable code while refactoring and want to be able to see types — at least types of globals, like other functions</p>

<p>This also would require adding some nuance to our understanding of reachability -- currently we don't really distinguish between an unreachable use and an unreachable definition, we just care whether there is a path from a definition to a use. See #2281 also.</p>
