            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For users who are OK restricting themselves to ty and want to use intersections, there's no reason for us not to make it easier for them to do so.</p>
<p>We should maybe consider splitting <code>ty_extensions</code> into two modules, one for things we want to support as public API, and another for things that are really just for internal mdtest use.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For some symbols like <code>Intersection</code> and <code>Not</code>, we could also see if some of these symbols could be added to typing_extensions directly. Given that some of them have been floated in the typing community for many years, and typing_extensions often adds APIs for draft PEPs, this wouldn't be totally without precedent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a great alternative if we can make it happen! I'm optimistic for <code>Intersection</code>; less clear for <code>Not</code>.</p>
