            <div class="timeline-body"><p>They are rarely useful (this is a hypothesis -- to be confirmed or refuted by ecosystem tests), they make our displayed types more complex/confusing, and their tendency to preserve intersections instead of simpler types can cause other issues (e.g. most recently https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2200). Simplifying them out may improve performance due to more simple types instead of intersections (again a hypothesis to check on an actual PR.)</p>
<p>The easy approach here (good for a prototype PR to check the performance and ecosystem impact) would be to just strip them out in <code>IntersectionBuilder::build</code>.</p>
<p>If we decide we want to do this, the better approach might be to remove them entirely as <code>Type</code> variants, and replace with <code>Type::remove_always_truthy</code> and <code>Type::remove_always_falsy</code> transformers. (This will be easier if we update our narrowing support so that it can just return a new type, instead of only a type to intersect with.)</p>
