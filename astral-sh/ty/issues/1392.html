            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I recently added these tests: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/8ca2b5555d47e211c04136637477c5227172d885/crates/ty_ide/src/completion.rs#L3899-L3946</p>
<p>They show that</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f[T: str](msg: T):
    msg.&lt;CURSOR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>should show completions like <code>upper</code> and <code>capitalize</code>. This does work in the LSP with neovim. But it does not work with VS Code or in the playground:</p>
<p>neovim:
<img width="429" height="238" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f9f8e44-4d93-40ab-bb0a-e2bebc1971db" /></p>
<p>VS Code:
<img width="588" height="170" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55108d96-4c8b-4cbc-a089-f7436d9f8e00" /></p>
<p>Playground:

<p>What's very weird is that I <em>can</em> see those completions if I make other random changes to the file. For example, if I add a comment in that function:</p>
<p><img width="459" height="213" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5db72c-6dab-4d09-a88c-935c5a1675e0" /></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, yes. Completely forgot about that (closed now). At the time, I thought it was only playground specific (probably because I only compared it to neovim behavior), and thought that maybe something just wasn't exposed to the playground.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect that is due to our heuristic for &quot;this is the current scope&quot; is a bit naive https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18281#discussion_r2105173847</p>
<p>More specifically, the issue is that the function's range ends right after the <code>.</code>.</p>
<p>Funnily, the completions work if you add a trailing comment (which doesn't change the function's range, so maybe that's wrong?))</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, these are the tests that I thought this issue is related to, but maybe not? I'll keep digging</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/6e7ff0706564cb938c154b5a5f9993c1118085e0/crates/ty_ide/src/completion.rs#L1355-L1454</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well as far as I understood, the problem was that if the cursor is at the end of the file, there is an additional Newline token &quot;at the offset of the cursor&quot;. This is why https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20951 simply attempts to strip that token off, and then everything works as expected. But that seems like a bit of a hack. That newline probably shouldn't be there in the first place? Or at least, we should identify that the cursor is behind the dot, not behind the newline.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interestingly, this works with cursor tests.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The newline token is correct. Every statement must be terminated by a newline</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I think I know what the issue is. It's that <code>Newline</code> has an empty range. And that is only the case for the newline at the very end of the file. All other newlines (ignoring newlines inserted by error recovery) are guaranteed to have a non empty range</p>
