            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m interested in migrating off <code>mypy</code> for <a href="https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix">this project</a> and have had great experiences with astral tooling such as <code>ruff</code> and <code>uv</code> in the past. Wondering when will <code>ty</code> be ready for primetime?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can follow the milestones at https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/milestones (a beta release will be ready this year, at which point we think people should be able to adopt ty even though it won&#x27;t have all of the features we want)</p>
