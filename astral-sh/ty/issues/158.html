<ul>
<li>[x] Infer the type of the RHS for public uses of bare <code>Final</code> symbols</li>
<li>[x] Add a new diagnostic for modifications of <code>Final</code>-qualified symbols</li>
<li>[x] Make sure that both of the above also works for attributes</li>
<li>[x] Disallow <code>Final</code> in function parameter definitions / return-type annotations</li>
<li>[ ] Prevent overriding of <code>Final</code> attributes in subclasses</li>
<li>[ ] Report an error if there is no binding to a <code>Final</code>-qualified symbol</li>
<li>[ ] Variance inference: if an attribute is marked <code>Final</code>, its type should be covariant rather than invariant</li>

<p>I kept the checklist in the description very much up to date.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I still want to merge https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19480 and then I was planning to close this and write follow-up tickets. I think &quot;Prevent overriding of Final attributes in subclasses&quot; is also a core aspect of <code>Final</code>, but that could probably be done when we tackle Liskov enforcement, which I think would set up the required functionality anyway(?).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm closing this ticket, as we now support the core mechanisms of <code>typing.Final</code>. The three remaining items from the description above are now captured in the following tickets:</p>
