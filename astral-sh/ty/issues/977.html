            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>why there's isn't ay feature where <code>ty</code> auto-completes the function but to be able to auto add brackets? we need similar feature on how jetbrains pycharm auto adds brackets from auto completion via intellisence</p>
<h3>Version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you give a specfic example what you're looking for, e.g. what sort of completion your looking for (what's the start code, what should ty complete)</p>
<p>The short answer is probably: We just haven't had the time yet :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>well i want ty when it provide list of function and statements and i click any of then ty should add <code>()</code> this when completed
so my experience was when i select suggestion from ty and completed it ty does not add brackets
that's what i'm saying see the clip for more detail @MichaReiser</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see. I just tested pyright and it doesn't add the parentheses as well. But Rust Analyzer does, and it also completes all the parameters. One caveat that I see is that it's not uncommon in Python to pass a function as a callback, in which case this form of completion is undesired.</p>
<p>I do think this is a reasonable extension for the future. CC: @BurntSushi</p>

<p>You're correct that pyright's language server doesn't support this. However, pylance does offer a setting to enable this functionality: <code>python.analysis.completeFunctionParens</code>. It's disabled by default because the majority of users prefer <em>not</em> to have parentheses automatically added.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is one of the feature that I want ty to implement. Without this, there are more typing required while coding. May be this can be implemented as an option to enable in config file. Please give it a second thought.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Isn't it possible to decide that based on available context? The type system should give even more precise context when types are specified. Otherwise, it should fallback to no parentheses.</p>
