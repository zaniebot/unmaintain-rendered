            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When <code>Call Argument Names</code> is on, calls like <code>enumerate()</code> or <code>str()</code> will have argument names displayed, which can make the source code noisy. It would be nice to have an option to selectively disable hints for built-in functions (and perhaps user specified packages).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this issue.</p>
<p>Is the reasoning here that users are more familiar with builtins/specific packages so that they don&#x27;t need inlays? Or are there specific inlays you&#x27;ve found to be too verbose? Is it specifrically one-argument functions?</p>

<p>I think all are true. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485bae82-74c8-4ae7-8efb-f970296cf761"></p>
<ol>
<li>One-argument functions <code>enumerate</code>, <code>str</code> become too verbose</li>
<li>It is true that people may be more familiar with some packages that they don&#x27;t need this hint, but they would for other packages</li>
<li>Generally it may even be ok to hide the name for the first argument (e.g. <code>textwrap.indent</code>)</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m curious to hear @Gankra perspective on this. I can see the argument that inlays for one argument functions are less useful because it&#x27;s unlikely that you would confuse them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My first thought is that the most offensive results here are single-argument functions, we could consider a heuristic that omits them for those.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>indent</code> on the other hand is more borderline. Like I kinda like seeing <code>prefix=</code> but <code>text=</code> is a bit less helpful.</p>

<p>I think this is because <code>len()</code> is defined in typeshed as having a positional-only argument (that is, the type checker will complain if you even tried to pass its argument by keyword, so we&#x27;re not going to show an inlay hint that implies you could), where e.g. <code>enumerate()</code> constructor has positional-or-keyword arguments.</p>
