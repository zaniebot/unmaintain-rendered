@zanieb / @Gankra is my understanding correct that this is done (we can build and publish to pypi?)

Yep! I think zanie has some rooster improvements in mind, but stuff Works.

In theory there's one temporary measure for the fact that the repo is private: https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/37/files#r2074162740

But it's not terribly important.
