# cli: Show progress bar when checking takes longer

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2025-05-04 11:02_

Checking larger projects can take multiple seconds. We should show a progress bar after some amount of time. 

We don't have to do this as part of this issue but a similar feature would also be useful in the LSP. 

We should checkout `tracing_indicatif` and how uv does this
