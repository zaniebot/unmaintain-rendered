            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just like <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10250">the related issue in the ruff repo</a>, I wanted to ask if you all would consider adding support for <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython">Cython</a>. Writing Cython is a common way for Python developers to write high performance code that compares to C speeds by typing the code properly, without the need to write in two languages like similar projects C++ &amp; nanbind/pybind or Rust &amp; pyo3.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Cython doesn't have a proper linter or language server, as far as I know, making it quite challenging to write Cython code as projects grow. Since this issue is inside the ty repo, I'd like to focus on the latter point: having a language server like ty that also offers features like auto-completions for Cython would really enhance productivity.</p>

<p>Thanks, but this is only a linter, not a language server as this issue is about. Plus, the project has been abandoned for two years.</p>
