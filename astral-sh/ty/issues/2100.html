            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. With not working, I assume you mean ty doesn&#x27;t provide any LSP features within a notebook?</p>
<p>Yes, I think this is the expected result of their &quot;mitigation&quot; mentioned here <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode/issues/893">astral-sh/ruff-vscode#893</a>#issuecomment-3573658501</p>
<p>But they also mention</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and it effectively disables Ruff (and other Python extensions for our notebooks). We already have a custom LSP with ty for type-checking (and autocomplete) with our out-of-order cells, and I&#x27;m working on a PR to have a managed version of Ruff similarly running inside our extension for our notebooks (<a href="https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo-lsp/pull/262">marimo-team/marimo-lsp#262</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which would suggest that ty should work? CC: @manzt</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, sorry for the vagueness. Out of the box the LSP features were not being provided when editing the Marimo notebook using the extension. Enabling the config <code>marimo.disableManagedLanguageFeatures</code> for suppressing the managed language features makes them show up, but throwing errors, giving the wrong contextual information and &quot;go to definition&quot;turning off the notebook inteface of the extension. Type checking seems to work.</p>
