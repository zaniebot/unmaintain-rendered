            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Type checkers often struggle with very large nested collections (which unfortunately are produced fairly often by code-generation tools). See e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14970</li>
<li>https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14636</li>
</ul>
<p>(Not arguing that we shouldn't try to do better here than other type checkers -- we should!)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had a similar problem in pyright when dealing with very large tuple literal expressions.</p>
<p>My solution was to add <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/8b02aa84ec916697e76d5ee69299a89d555ec98c/packages/pyright-internal/src/analyzer/tuples.ts#L53">a limit</a> to the number of tuple entries. If there is no inference context (i.e. it's not assigned to a variable or parameter with a declared type) and the number of entries exceeds the limit (currently 256), then the type of the expression is inferred to be <code>tuple[Unknown, ...]</code>. That behavior isn't ideal, but I figured it was preferable to long hangs.</p>
