            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I tried switching fully to ty from pyright, but as stated in the README, it is still early. I'm now planning on running a hybrid between ty and pyright. It would be really useful if there was some page where it clearly shows which features are supported by ty, which are unstable, which are upcoming and which are not yet started. If this was on the website or the README that would make it much easier for people to start testing it and providing feedback.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you specifically looking for the features that the language server provides or the typing features? For the language server, we've something here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ty-vscode/?tab=readme-ov-file#features but I agree that it'd be useful to have it in the official docs similar to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/features/.</p>

<p>Currently, ty only supports go to <em>type</em> definition and not go to definition. They're different. In Neovim, that would be <code>vim.lsp.buf.type_definition</code>.</p>
