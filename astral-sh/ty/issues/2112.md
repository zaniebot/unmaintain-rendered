# State in documentation for `division-by-zero` that it's disabled by default because it has false positives

Split out from https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2107 because this is something we should definitely do

We could also consider removing it and adding it back once we have the necessary infrastructure

yeah. I think I argued against that a long time ago but I've come around to the view that it's probably more trouble than it's worth.

I don't think it does much harm while it's disabled by default, but it's also just not a very useful rule in its current state.
