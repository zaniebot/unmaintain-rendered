            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pyright does this, see #6 in https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/import-resolution
Pyrefly also does something similar (though not clear if its a fallback for each failed import, or a configuration-time fallback): https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/import-resolution/#fallback-search-path</p>
<p>The benefit here is that it can make lots more scenarios work out of the box.</p>
<p>The con is that it's kind of an expensive way to make imports work throughout your project, and if it &quot;fixes&quot; the issue well enough, you may never know to properly config your import roots.</p>
<p>We'd probably want a config option to turn it off.</p>

<p>This could also be its own rule where we emit a warning diagnostic for those imports by default that can be turned off.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I think I missed that one because it was tagged <code>server</code> -- I guess it commonly helps in an LSP case, but I think if we implement this it shouldn't be LSP-specific. (The recent case that came up was someone running ty via CLI, not LSP.)</p>
<p>I don't really care which issue we keep, but I think this one has slightly more detail (and up to date links) in the description and discussion, so I'll close the other as duplicate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll bump the priority of this because we need it for pyx.</p>
<p>The issue they're facing is that they have a single workspace with multiple members defining their own <code>conftest.py</code>. We can't work this around with <code>environment.root</code>, because ty would then always use the conftest of the first workspace member in <code>environment.root</code> rather than the one local to the workspace member.</p>
<p>Implementing this might also allow us to remove <code>tests</code> from the paths we add by default to <code>environment.root</code> if left unspecified. Adding <code>tests</code> seems sort of a terrible idea in hindsight because it prevents ty from catching accidental imports of testing-only modules in production code.</p>
<p>For pyx, it would be sufficient to only consider directories that contain a <code>pyproject.toml</code> as an additional search path.</p>
<p>Other alternative solutions that we discussed to solve the issue for pyx are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an option to suppress specific unresolved imports. While that removes the diagnostics, it also breaks go-to-def. Which is why I think the solution proposed in this issue is preferred</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21666 This is probably the ideal but it's a bit more work to get done and the solution discussed in this issue might also help with multiple <code>tests</code> directories</li>
</ul>

<p>This was my preferred option (easy to explain and understand) so I'll start with that.</p>
