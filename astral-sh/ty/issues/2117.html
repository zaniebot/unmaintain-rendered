            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20128, we disabled boundness analysis for <em>implicit</em> instance attributes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class C:
    def __init__(self):
        if False:   
            self.x = 1

C().x  # would previously show an error, with this PR we pretend the attribute exists
</code></pre>
<p>It is possible that we can simply re-enable this now that we have a better strategy for dealing with these cyclic type inference problems.</p>
<p>We probably don't want a full-blown revert of that PR. I like <code>TypeQualifiers::IMPLICIT_INSTANCE_ATTRIBUTE</code> much better than <code>TypeQualifiers::POSSIBLY_UNBOUND_IMPLICIT_ATTRIBUTE</code>, so maybe we can prevent bringing the latter back.</p>
<p>For some reason, I don't see any regression tests for https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/758 in that PR, so we should probably add them when we resolve this issue.</p>

<p>I think my PR is close to what's described in this issue.</p>
<p>I'm leaving it as a draft because I found the following false positive:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21822/files#diff-19ac4a4d9337821d0bbfb544ab4e3fda87df59c6ea06065b77d3fcf5cf682ec2R650-R666</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Callable

class C:
    def __init__(self, cond: Callable[[], bool]) -&gt; None:
        i = 0
        while cond():
            i += 1

        # TODO: this should be `int`
        reveal_type(i)  # revealed: Literal[0, 1]
        if i &lt; 100:
            return
        self.x = 1

# TODO: this should be a possibly-unresolved-attribute error, not unresolved-attribute
# error: [unresolved-attribute]
reveal_type(C(lambda: False).x)  # revealed: Unknown
</code></pre>
<p>Resolving this requires accurate control flow tracking (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/232).</p>
