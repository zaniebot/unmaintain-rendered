You might want to expand on this a little. What `README` are you referring to? Neither [this repo's `README.md`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/afb20f6feb139cf7d01ff3dc80cbe02c8bf011d1/README.md) nor [the `ty` crate's](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/97b824db3ed34a8e029a3914fc9daf6bbcd8c5b2/crates/ty/README.md) has a TOC.

It's the one in the `docs` folder, [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/README.md)
