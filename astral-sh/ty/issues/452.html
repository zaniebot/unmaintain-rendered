<p>Not arguing that this can't be improved, but if you open the playground for the first time, or if you click &quot;Reset&quot;, it has a <code>ty.json</code> tab by default.</p>

<p>Huh, interesting, I did not even know that the playground apparently remembers previous sessions. For some reason I didn't have the <code>ty.json</code> there and it didn't occur to me to click reset since I didn't know I don't have the default view.</p>
