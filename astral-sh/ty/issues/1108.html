            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I heard that ty currently does not support options like noImplicitAny or strict. If types are not explicitly specified, ty does not analyze those parts of the code.</p>
<p>Are you considering adding options similar to noImplicitAny or strict in the future?</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I use tools like Pyright is because they can alert me to potential type errors in code sections where I may have missed or forgotten to add type annotations. I believe this kind of feature would be very helpful for catching missing type annotations and improving code safety.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think we do hope to add rules like these at some point. It&#x27;s not our priority right now, though — right now there are still several quite fundamental features that we&#x27;re still missing, which are probably much more significant causes of false negatives currently. (If we did add rules like these <em>now</em>, they would probably lead to many false positives due to these other missing features.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the meantime, note that you can enforce a certain level of strictness by enabling these ruff rules that make sure that your code is fully annotated: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-annotations-ann</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The priority of this feature is low, and I understand the reason for that as well. Thank you for your response, and I will wait for the beta version. I really needed a fast static analyzer.</p>
