<p>Currently, there is no way for me to add extra paths for import resolution, would be great to have this</p>

<p>Good news: there is, actually! It has the same name as the pyright option</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s correct, yes. I&#x27;d assume the setting would still be read from a pyproject.toml file or ty.toml file even in the context of an IDE such as VSCode, though. @MichaReiser or @dhruvmanila know more about how our editor integration works; they might be able to say more.</p>

<p>For now yes, but exposing some settings as editor settings is something we want to do. We just didn&#x27;t get to it yet</p>
