# Feature request: Add `--watch` argument to ty

Having a `--watch` argument to `ty check` that would refresh the results whenever a file is updated would be nice.

oof, my bad. I didn't see it `ty --help` so I figured you folks hadn't gotten to it yet. Didn't cross my mind to check `ty check --help` for some reason 😅
