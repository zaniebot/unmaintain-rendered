            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>Follow-up from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14099, the current implementation does not consider the values from <code>__all__</code> variable as seen in the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/60b3ef2c985dba405db58a72bc6f22ff64c249fa/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/import/conventions.md#exported-using-__all__">test document</a>.</p>
<p>This requires support for <code>__all__</code> in general so ideally that should be done first and then a separate PR which considers that values in <code>__all__</code> for re-export conventions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This will also be required for the second stage of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14169 (the first stage that I'm implementing will pretend none of the semantics around <code>__all__</code> exist for wildcard imports)</p>
