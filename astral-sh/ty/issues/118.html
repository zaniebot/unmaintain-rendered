            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if what this might break (if anything), but we currently assume that all class literals are singletons.  Normally they are:</p>
<pre><code>class C: ...
</code></pre>
<p>Only one instance of the type <code>C</code> at runtime. But if a class is defined in a function:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    class D: ...
</code></pre>
<p>then a new <code>type</code> is created each time the function is invoked.</p>
<p>A couple of wrinkles complicate this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inside the function body, <code>D</code> <em>is</em> a singleton, since for the duration of that single invocation, <code>D</code> refers to the (single) class that was just created.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It&#x27;s only <em>outside</em> the function body where we have to consider that <code>f</code> might be invoked multiple times. Now, at the moment, without return type inference (#17349), there isn&#x27;t a way for anything outside of <code>f</code> to talk about <code>D</code> (either the type itself, or subclasses of it, or instances of it, etc). But we&#x27;ll have to consider how we want to represent this if we do implement RTI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(There&#x27;s some overlap here with eager nested scopes, since that&#x27;s another feature that changes behavior once we cross a function body boundary.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems like we may want to label scopes as run-once vs run-many (where the former is any scope outside of any function, and the latter is all scopes where any ancestor is a function), and then <code>Type::ClassLiteral</code> would know if its a singleton or not based on whether the scope in which it was defined is run-once or run-many?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I put a bit more thought into this over in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/128">astral-sh/ty#128</a>#issuecomment-2864800219</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think my comment above makes sense; it&#x27;s not nearly enough to just consider the class-literal type not a singleton; this affects all kinds of assumptions we make about class and instance types. I think instead we have to avoid this possibility in our implementation of return-type inference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think our conclusion here is to continue to assume that class literal types are singletons, and avoid allowing them to be inferred as a return type.</p>
