<p>Most classes and types will have lsp description of &lt;class 'Foo'&gt; (which is especially weird for built-in ones like &lt;class 'int'&gt;) and doesn't seem to carry much info</p>

<p>ty</p>

<p>Both ty and pylance show that the type is a class, but IMO, pylance does so in a more idiomatic way in the LSP by using <code>class &lt;TYPE&gt;</code> over <code>&lt;class &lt;TYPE&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We should consider changing how we render class definitions within the LSP (across operations)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this is a great first contribution issue because it will require some upfront design work before opening a PR, because this might also touch on how we show classes in type signatures.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser No worries! Once I started following the code I figured there would be a bigger conversation around it but wanted to take a stab anyways. But makes sense you wouldn't want someone new/lower context to propose those designs.</p>
