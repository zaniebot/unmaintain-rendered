            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently many of the code-action tests are e2e-only because they require getting &quot;real&quot; diagnostics and I wasn't sure how to do that outside of e2e tests. e2e tests are unpleasant and I should figure out a better solution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The auto-import stuff relies on also having the diagnostic_range, which is technically computed/passed by the server request handler. It's not too unreasonable to just assume it, but it would be nice to not have to. Maybe I'm overthinking it.</p>
