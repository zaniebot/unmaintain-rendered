<p>The standard setup at my workplace is to junction our development directory. So I work in C:\whatever but the physical location of all my files is actually S:\whatever. In VS Code, when I hit F12 on a symbol, ty opens the source code  in the S:\whatever location.</p>
<p>I briefly mentioned it <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1967#issuecomment-3663117349">in issue 1967</a>, but it turned out not to be the source of that bug.</p>
<p>The <code>python-environment-tools</code> project just fixed this bug in their locator: https://github.com/microsoft/python-environment-tools/pull/277</p>
<p>Any chance you could implement a similar fix in <code>ty</code> please?</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.0.12</p>
