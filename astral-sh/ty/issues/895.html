            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19521">PR #19521</a> implements a new <code>SymbolVisitor</code> that collects symbols for the &quot;workspace symbols&quot; and &quot;document symbols&quot; language server features. The same visitor mechanism is designed to be usable by a future auto-import feature as well.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19521#discussion_r2228057233">code review for this PR</a>, it was pointed out that the <code>SymbolVisitor</code> functionality overlaps that of the existing <code>exported_names</code> call. While there is significant overlap, there are also some differences noted in the code review discussion.</p>
<p>It's not clear that the <code>exported_names</code> feature could be used to implement auto-import. It can probably be made to support &quot;document symbols&quot; and &quot;workspace symbols&quot;, but some changes (perhaps mode flags) would be required.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Closed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21779 because <code>SymbolVisitor</code> is now substantially different to <code>ExportFinder</code>, and will probably become more so in the future, so the answer now seems clear that we shouldn't try to unify the two.)</p>
