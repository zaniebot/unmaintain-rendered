            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello! I did have to wait a good few years for Pyright to implement pull model diagnostics, and it would be a shame to wait years again for the same support from <code>ty</code>. Have a look at the history behind this change. See: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/3452">microsoft/pyright#3452</a></p>
<p>I was the original dev who suggested that LSP should have a pull model while working on ALE. Having support for pull diagnostics means the client has control over when diagnostics will be sent, and if implemented correctly on the server side I believe it can also be an optimization where the server does less processing overall. Note that it&#x27;s important for servers to implement both push and pull models.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t read the code or tested <code>ty</code> yet, so may have already implemented this. In any case, I&#x27;ll add a linter definition for <code>ty</code> to ALE.</p>
