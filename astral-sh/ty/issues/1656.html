            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Consider the following examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f(x: list[int] | None, y: None):
    x[0]  # error: [non-subscriptable]
    y[0]  # error: [non-subscriptable]

    for z in x: ...  # error: [not-iterable]
    for z in y: ...  # error: [not-iterable]

    x.index  # warning: [possibly-missing-attribute]
    y.index  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
</code></pre>
<p>When it comes to subscripting a union or iterating over a union, we issue a hard error if any element of the union does not support the operation. That's as it should be: these are serious typing errors where we're confident in our analysis. The user should definitely want these errors surfaced even if they didn't want any warnings displayed.</p>
<p>When it comes to attribute access on a union, however, we only emit a <code>possibly-missing-attribute</code> <em>warning</em> if some union elements do not have the attribute, rather than an <code>unresolved-attribute</code> error. I don't think this is correct; it's just as serious a typing error as attempting to subscript a union where some elements don't support subscription.</p>
<p>Ideally we would be able to distinguish attribute access on a union from something like this, which I think <em>should</em> remain a warning rather than an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def coinflip() -&gt; bool:
    return False

class F:
    if coinflip():
        x = 42

F.x  # error: [possibly-missing-attribute]
</code></pre>
<p>Currently our member-lookup machinery conflates these cases</p>
