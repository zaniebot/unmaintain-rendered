            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://bazel.build">Bazel</a> is a popular cross-platform cross-language build system. E.g., at Google it is commonly and publicly known that essentially every [sub]repo in its monorepo has <code>BUILD</code> files for Bazel integration.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty">ty</a> could easily become the replacement for <a href="https://github.com/google/pytype">pytype</a> now that that's deprecated.</p>
<p>To that end, the recommendation is for the creation and maintenance of <code>rules_ty</code>.</p>
<p>FWIW: There is https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_py but it seems to have some weirdness associated requiring a login to their SaaS.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this suggestion.</p>
<p>We don't currently have the capacity or expertise on the team to maintain those rules ourselves. But more than happy to support any work within ty that unblocks a community-driven ty buck rule set.</p>
