            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For this class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Foo:
    @property
    def bar(self) -&gt; str:
        return &quot;baz&quot;
    
    @bar.setter
    def bar(self, value: str) -&gt; None:
        pass

    @bar.deleter
    def bar(self) -&gt; None:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>If you have Pylance disabled in VSCode and the ty-vscode extension installed, right-clicking on the first <code>bar</code> function and renaming it to <code>spam</code> will apply this diff to your code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">  class Foo:
      @property
-     def bar(self) -&gt; str:
+     def spam(self) -&gt; str:
          return &quot;baz&quot;
    
-     @bar.setter
+     @spam.setter
      def bar(self, value: str) -&gt; None:
          pass

-     @bar.deleter
+     @spam.deleter
      def bar(self) -&gt; None:
          pass
</code></pre>
<p>But if you enable Pylance and do the rename, then this edit is applied instead from the same operation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">  class Foo:
      @property
-     def bar(self) -&gt; str:
+     def spam(self) -&gt; str:
          return &quot;baz&quot;
    
-     @bar.setter
-     def bar(self, value: str) -&gt; None:
+     @spam.setter
+     def spam(self, value: str) -&gt; None:
          pass

-     @bar.deleter
-     def bar(self) -&gt; None:
+     @spam.deleter
+     def spam(self) -&gt; None:
          pass
</code></pre>
<p>The Pylance behaviour is how I would want a property rename to work; the ty behaviour should match that.</p>
<p>Failing tests for this were added in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21810; a fix for this issue should aim to resolve the TODOs added in that PR.</p>
