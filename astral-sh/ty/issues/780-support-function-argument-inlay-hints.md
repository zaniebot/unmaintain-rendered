# Support function argument inlay hints

Like in Rust how function arguments can have inlay hints of their respective argument name, we could (optionally) do a similar thing.

There may have to be some thought put into how args and kwargs would work, but I think this could be a nice addition to the lsp

Edit: If there is interest in this I'd love to take it on

Before we do this, it's probably important to make inlay hints an opt-in feature.

Sounds good, I can add that.

I think it'd be useful to wait until #82 is complete before we add any settings.
