# Support basedpyright `reportImplicitOverride`

---

_Issue opened by @jaymegordo on 2025-12-18 19:46_

Not sure if there's a better place for this issue eg a list of 3rd party feature sets with planned support?

I like Basedpyright's `reportImplicitOverride` a lot though [reportImplicitOverride](https://docs.basedpyright.com/v1.31.4/configuration/config-files/#reportImplicitOverride)

Adding this if support is possible, thanks!
