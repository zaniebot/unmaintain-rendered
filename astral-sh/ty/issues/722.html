            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19019 shows that we spent a decent amount of time in semantic indexing. I wonder if it would help performance if we make the semantic index more lazy by building it scope by scope instead of all in a single pass.</p>
<p>This could also help for third party modules where it may not be necessary to index the entire file to answer the necessary type requests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think we had this as a potential area of exploration on the roadmap for a long time now. I think the only real downside I can think of is more queries, but I think proportionally the increase shouldn't be too great, definitions (for example) greatly outnumber scopes.</p>
