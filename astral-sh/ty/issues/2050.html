            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thanks for the huge amount of effort on this, and congrats on the v0.2 release!</p>
<p>I'm wanting to configure <code>ty</code> to ignore issues for a specific module. For example, I have a <code>mypy</code> configuration like:</p>
<pre><code>[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = &quot;astropy.*&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>In truth, I'd rather be able to ignore a <em>specific</em> error on a per-module basis. For example, here I'd like to ignore just <code>unresolved-attribute</code> errors from <code>astropy.units</code>. Is it possible to configure this, currently? Thanks!</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ty 0.0.2 (42835578d 2025-12-16)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use <code>tool.ty.overrides</code> to change the severity (enable or disable rules) for a subset of files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.ty.overrides]]
include = [&quot;tests/**&quot;, &quot;**/test_*.py&quot;]

[tool.ty.overrides.rules]
possibly-unresolved-reference = &quot;warn&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike mypy, it isn't module-based, but it should allow you to accomplish the same.</p>
<p>Unless you want to disable attribute errors anywhere in the code base if accessed on an object with a type from any <code>astrolpy.*</code> module.</p>

<p>That's indeed what I'd be after. I don't want to disable the error globally, rather just for external modules that cause issues.</p>

<p>Can you say more about what you mean by per-module ignores?</p>

<p>Is this really a feature mypy offers? I'm not clear, because the config in the OP doesn't seem to be complete? It shows that you're overriding something for a certain set of modules, but it's not clear what config options you are setting for those modules.</p>
<p>This almost sounds like a use case for #2082 ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for any confusion. Indeed, the mypy configuration above simply ignores <em>all</em> errors from the specified module. I was curious to know if it was possible to configure something similar in <code>ty</code>.</p>
<p>My follow up question, which perhaps confused matters, was that it would potentially be preferable to have more granularity on a per-issue + per module basis. As far as I know this isn't possible MyPy, however.</p>
<p>In that sense, I think my question is a duplicate of #1354</p>
