            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Is tests for strict equality on the roadmap for ty. In mypy we can check for &quot;strict equality&quot; using the <code>--strict-equality</code> flag or equivalent configuration setting. This check flags a class of error where the developer might accidentally be comparing disparate types for equality. Naively it looks like this but you can imagine more complex scenarios.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">an_int: int = 42
a_str: str = &quot;42&quot;

if an_int == a_str:
    print(&quot;This should not print, as int and str are not equal&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>mypy returns:</p>
<pre><code>main.py:###: error: Non-overlapping equality check (left operand type: &quot;int&quot;, right operand type: &quot;str&quot;)  [comparison-overlap]
</code></pre>
<p>ty does not warn or give an error and all the default ignored rules do not seem like they would capture this.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point is me wondering if this is on ty's roadmap? It is a feature of mypy that i discovered recently and seems very valuable!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a rule that would fit better into a type-aware linter that we intend to eventually build on top of ty. It's not a type error in Python to compare an integer and a string. (In fact, if all we know is the types <code>int</code> and <code>str</code>, it's not even a definitely-false comparison: the types <code>int</code> and <code>str</code> include user subclasses of <code>int</code> and <code>str</code>, which can override <code>__eq__</code> to compare equal to anything.) So for these reasons we'd be unlikely to add a rule like this as a core type-checker diagnostic. But it does seem like it could be practically useful as a more opinionated lint rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agree it more likely a opt-in feature than an on by default feature for all the reasons you bring up.  If it is a feature on top of ty or part of ty is fine by me. Just a useful lint to trap certain kinds of bugs.</p>

<p>While this is all true, I've found mypy's <code>strict-equality</code> error code very useful on my Python projects. It's very effective at finding bugs and rarely has false positives. If we want feature parity with existing type checkers, I think we should consider putting this on the roadmap for our stable release.</p>
