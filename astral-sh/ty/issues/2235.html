            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I have a standalone script <code>scripts/run</code> in my project that I want to typecheck along with the main project code.</p>
<p>So I have this in my <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ty.src]
include = [&quot;mypackage&quot;, &quot;scripts/run&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>However, the <code>run</code> script gets ignored. I&#x27;m assuming this is because of some filtering for <code>*.py</code> files in directories. I think that if the include is a file instead of a directory then it would be useful to include it as-is instead of filtering to allow this use case.</p>
<p>Interestingly it works fine if I explicitly run ty as <code>ty check scripts/run</code>.</p>
Version
<p>ty 0.0.7</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, yeah, this is a bit tricky. We support checking files without extension if you pass them directly to the CLI. But we currently don&#x27;t support including files without a <code>py</code>, <code>pyi</code>, or <code>ipynb</code> extension when using <code>include</code>.</p>
<p>We could consider allowing exact matches in <code>include</code>s too. But I&#x27;m not sure this would be intuitive, and it also seems too limited if you want to check a handful of files that have no extension (or any other non-standard extension).</p>
<p>We could automatically change <code>*</code> to <code>*.{py,pyi,ipynb}</code> unless the glob ends with an extension (and the same for <code>**/*</code>), and, therefore, to the filtering as part of the globbing. However, this would only work for individual files. Including a set of files without an extension would not be possible.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to allow custom extension mappings, similar to what we have in ruff where you can map a file extension to a file type (like <code>custompy</code> -&gt; <code>py</code> would make ty check all files ending with <code>.custmpy</code> as if they were regular python files). Adding a mapping for an empty extension would make ty check every file without an extension. That might be annoying too.</p>
<p>Are you aware of any other tools that allows checking files without an extension (e.g. what other tools did you use before). Do you know how they handle the extension-less case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pyright works for me with an identical include specification. As far as I can tell it supports simple file includes, but not wildcards that resolve to files:</p>

<p>This behaviour got implemented here:
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/pull/5463">microsoft/pyright#5463</a></p>
<p>Pyrefly also supports explicitly specified files (i.e. no wildcards):
