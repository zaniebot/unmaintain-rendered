            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently these typically fall back to Divergent/Unknown at the point of recursion. We should properly support them.</p>
<p>An example case where this is relied on in typeshed is the annotation for the second argument to <code>isinstance</code>, which is a recursive tuple-of-tuples. Currently we don't catch the type error in <code>isinstance(None, (int, None))</code> (though we do catch it in <code>isinstance(None, None)</code>), due to not fully supporting the recursion.</p>
