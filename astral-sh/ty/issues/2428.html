            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>
<p>I think our inference of singleton function or bound-method types when accessed off nominal-instance or subclass-of types is simply wrong and needs to be fixed. The nominal-instance type <code>A</code> includes instances of <code>A</code> and all subclasses of <code>A</code>. That means it is wrong to say that <code>instance_of_a.method</code> is a singleton bound-method type, unless either <code>A</code> or <code>A.method</code> is marked as final. Similarly, <code>type[A]</code> includes subclasses of <code>A</code>, so <code>subclass_of_A.method</code> cannot be a singleton function literal type.</p>
<p>Accessing methods as attributes of class-literal types can still correctly return a function literal.</p>
<p>One unfortunate side effect of making the above fix is that we will lose go-to-definition on most methods. To avoid this regression, we may need to allow callable types to optionally carry a &quot;most precise known&quot; source definition (or definitions?), which is not &quot;part of the type&quot; in terms of type relations but can be used for go-to-definition.</p>
