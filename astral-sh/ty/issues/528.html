            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">PEP 750</a> introduces <i>template strings</i>, also known as t-strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">template: Template = t'Hello {name}'
</code></pre>
<p>According to the PEP, this feature is expected to be used for &quot;safety checks, web templating, domain-specific languages, and more&quot;.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obviously, this is a big feature and needs some design, but here are a few ideas to get things started:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">type_checker = 'ty'                   # Literal['ty']
template = t'{type_checker} is fast'  # LiteralTemplate[t'{type_checker} is fast', type_checker: Literal['ty']]

reveal_type(template.strings)         # tuple[Literal[''], 'is fast']
reveal_type(template.interpolations)  # tuple[LiteralInterpolation[Literal['ty']]]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure I'd want to introduce any kind of dedicated <code>Type</code> variant or special form for template strings until I'm a bit clearer on what the use cases are, and/or whether there's going to be any attempt to standardise support for generic <code>Template</code>s in typeshed. It's generally good to keep special-casing (and complexity in our model) to a minimum.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do now have basic support for template strings in 3.14, but it's just what the typeshed annotations give; there's no support for a &quot;template literal&quot; type that actually knows its details.</p>
