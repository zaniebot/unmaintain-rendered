            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>project.is_file_open</code> can be pretty expensive because it requires indexing all project files. The main reason for it is to check if a file isn't gitignored.</p>
<p>This isn't as much of a problem for the CLI where we index all files anyway, but it is somewhat costly for the VS code extension.</p>
<p>It would be great if <code>is_file_open</code> could determine whether a file is included simply on its path without requiring a full traversal.</p>
