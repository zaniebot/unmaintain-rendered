            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If a user does this, it indicates that they're confused, because attempting to create an instance of a class like this always fails at runtime:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NamedTuple

@dataclass
class Foo(NamedTuple):
    x: int
    y: str

# Both of these calls fail with `AttributeError: can't set attribute`
Foo(42, &quot;y&quot;)
Foo(x=42, y=&quot;y&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>We don't model the semantics here correctly right now (we don't synthesize any of the <code>NamedTuple</code> generated methods on this class at all -- we think, for instance, that this class inherits its <code>__new__</code> method from <code>tuple</code>). But we don't need to model the semantics correctly if we detect that this is an error (which it is) and emit an appropriate diagnostic.</p>
<p>We added a TODO for this in the code in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/3e0299488e72fa80f59473565cf724041d0f3f3c, but I don't think we added any tests for it.</p>
