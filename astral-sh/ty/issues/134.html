            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>concise</code> output format is helpful when piping Red Knot&#x27;s output to other tools. For example, I find myself frequently doing something like</p>
<pre><code>red_knot check --output-format concise | rg unresolved-import
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder if we should default to using <code>--output-format concise</code> when the output is not a TTY? The way this could work is that we introduce <code>--output-format auto</code>, which would be the new default. When stdout is an interactive terminal, <code>auto</code> would be equivalent to <code>full</code>, and otherwise it would be <code>concise</code>. This way, users could still force <code>--output-format full</code> if they really want to pipe the &quot;rich&quot; output format to a file or another tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An <code>--output-format=auto</code> has come up before for ruff but in a different context <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7353">astral-sh/ruff#7353</a></p>
<p>I like to sometimes pipe diagnostics to a text file if the output is very long so that I can look at the diagnostics in an editor. In that instance, I think I&#x27;d find the behavior somewhat confusing.</p>
<p>But I can see how this is useful when processing the input with other tools (until we have a json output)</p>

<p>Yes, that&#x27;s the problem with these &quot;smart&quot; behaviors. Piping diagnostics to a pager like <code>less</code> instead of <code>rg</code> in the example above could also lead to this unexpected behavior.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Even when we have json output, I often prefer a simple line-based format to work with for one-off command lines. But maybe that&#x27;s just because I never invested time in properly learning <code>jq</code>. I definitely agree that a JSON output would be a useful addition as well!</p>
