# Incorrect invalid-assignment Error in Conditional with Never Function call and Type | None Variable

---

_Issue opened by @jelle-it on 2026-01-09 12:53_

### Summary

I'm encountering an incorrect `invalid-assignment` error when a variable is set by a function that returns `Type | None` and a function returning `Never` is called in the `if variable is None` clause.
I've noticed that a function returning `Never` breaks the flow, even though the use of `raise` or `return` achieves the desired outcome.

This is probably related to #690, but It might be a bug on its own, as it is unexpected behavior and not missing behavior.

```python
from typing import Never

def get_dict_or_none() -> dict | None:
    return None

def raise_error() -> Never:
    raise ValueError()

def working():
    a: dict[str, str] | None = get_dict_or_none()
    if not a:
        raise ValueError()
    a["foo"] = "bar"

def working_too():
    a: dict[str, str] | None = None
    if not a:
        raise ValueError()
    a["foo"] = "bar"

def also_working():
    a: dict[str, str] | None = None
    if not a:
        raise_error()
    a["foo"] = "bar"

def not_working():
    a = get_dict_or_none()
    if not a:
        raise_error()
    a["foo"] = "bar" # <-- Cannot assign to a subscript on an object of type `None`(invalid-assignment)
```
https://play.ty.dev/6bc9e459-6317-40c6-9762-370d7c2e7c18

I would expect the `also_working` to have the same behavior as the `not_working` function, as the only difference is how the variable is set.

NoReturn = Never

Thanks! This has the same root cause as #690, so while the symptom might be slightly different I'm inclined to close this to focus discussion in a single issue. The fix will be the same :-)
