<pre><code>from typing import Any, final

class Mock(Any): ...

def takes_bool(x: bool): ...
takes_bool(Mock())

takes_fx(Mock())

<p>I guess I understand why ty is doing the thing it is currently doing, but curious how you would spell this kind of pattern in a way that works for ty (maybe the answer is just pull out <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code>?)</p>

<p>Yes, it seems correct to insist that <code>Mock</code> could not possibly be a subclass of a final class.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m afraid something like</p>
<pre><code>class Mock: ...

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    Mock = cast(Any, Mock)
</code></pre>
<p>might be necessary at the moment. It would be cool if we could do something like:</p>
<pre><code>def mock_class[C](cls: C) -&gt; Intersection[C, Any]:
    return cls

@mock_class
class Mock: ...
</code></pre>
<p>That would give you more precise types and would enable things like auto-completion on mock objects. Unfortunately, there are a few things that we do not support here:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not support arbitrary class decorators (that should hopefully be easy to add)</li>
<li>We do not support intersection types in the generics solver</li>
<li>We do not support instantiation of intersection types, so you currently get a <code>@Todo</code> type if you instantiate a <code>Mock &amp; Any</code></li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Putting this in stable milestone with <code>needs-decision</code> tag. By stable we should either have a recommended pattern here (ideally one that doesn&#x27;t require <code>cast</code>), or (if it seems this will impact a lot of people) we could decide to go for pragmatism and match other type checkers.</p>
