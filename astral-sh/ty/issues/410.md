# Move daily property test workflow to this repository

---

_Issue opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-05-15 15:48_

We have a workflow in the Ruff repo here that runs property tests daily on ty and opens an issue if they fail: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily_property_tests.yaml.

We should move that workflow to this repo. Reasons:
- I'm subscribed to all issues on this repo but not on Ruff. I think this also applies to most other people at Astral working on ty! So it'll be harder for us to miss it when the bot opens an issue
- This is where all the other ty issues are these days, so it's where I'd expect the issue to be opened
