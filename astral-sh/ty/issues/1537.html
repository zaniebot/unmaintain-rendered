            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That one seems more narrowly focused around one particular UX improvement -- detecting compiled modules and giving a better error than &quot;module not found.&quot; But I see this issue as broader -- what about pure Python packages that just don't have inline types, and have a stubs package available? (Maybe that's not a case that exists very much in practice?)</p>
<p>#487 has more details, so if you are confident that it describes the full scope of the actual feature we want here, feel free to close this as duplicate. Otherwise I'd be inclined to mark #487 as a sub-issue of this one?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1591 is an example case of where we could do better here even for pure Python packages. Pandas has type annotations inline (presumably for internal type checking?), but there's also the <code>pandas-stubs</code> package which provides public type annotations for users of pandas. Since mypy doesn't respect inline types for non <code>py.typed</code> packages, users will just get no type-checking unless they install <code>pandas-stubs</code>. But for us and pyright, we will attempt to use the inline types and sometimes emit diagnostics that should be fixed by installing <code>pandas-stubs</code>. Ideally we could inform users if they are using <code>pandas</code> without <code>pandas-stubs</code>, that they probably want to install <code>pandas-stubs</code>.</p>
