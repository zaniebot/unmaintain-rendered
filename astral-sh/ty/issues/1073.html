            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wish ty can check for comparing coroutine in if statement. Given the following code:</p>
<pre><code>async def check_foo() -&gt; bool:
    return True

async def main():
    if check_foo():
        print(&quot;hello&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>we almost never want to compare a coroutine in if statement because it will always be true. What we want is actually:</p>
<pre><code>async def main():
    if await check_foo():
        print(&quot;hello&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder if this should be a ty rule or ruff rule? I don&#x27;t know if ruff knows the <code>check_foo</code> is a coroutine during the check. If it should be a ruff rule I will move this issue to the ruff repo.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff could check this, but only in a very incomplete way; if <code>check_foo()</code> came from a different module, it would not know that it is an async function.</p>
<p>Long-term our plan is to build type-powered linting on top of ty, but at the moment we are still focused on getting the type-checker feature set complete.</p>
<p>I do think this is an ideal example of a type-powered lint rule, and we should definitely build it, when we are at that point of adding such rules.</p>
