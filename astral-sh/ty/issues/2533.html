            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am running GitHub CI jobs which have a Python distribution installed by <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-python">actions/setup-python</a>, which configures a few environment variables and adds the python executables to the job <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>If the job later runs <code>ty</code> without any custom environemnt, it will fail to detect python packages installed under the <code>setup-python</code> target. As a workaround, I can add a job step to explicitly define <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to use the target directories as below:</p>
<pre><code>    - name: Explicit PYTHONPATH
      run: echo &quot;PYTHONPATH=${PWD}:${Python3_ROOT_DIR}/lib/python3.12/site-packages&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe ty could use the python executable in normal path to derive an appropriate PYTHONPATH on its own. I thought that is what was happening already, but I suppose not because that explicit envar is currently needed.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ty 0.0.9</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report!</p>
<p>ty does not currently ever use the shell path to find a Python installation to use. I suspect, though, that you are installing ty into the Python environment you want to use, meaning that this would be fixed by #2068 .</p>
<p>I think as a workaround, explicitly setting <code>--python ${Python3_ROOT_DIR}</code> in your invocation of ty would be a bit simpler than setting <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to the site-packages directory, and more correct in that it would cause ty to actually find the Python installation and treat the site-packages directory as a site-packages dir.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Going to go ahead and close this as duplicate of #2068 for now, as I think it's quite likely that's the fix here. Please comment if you are <em>not</em> installing ty into the setup-python Python installation -- if so, this would represent a different use case we need to consider.</p>
