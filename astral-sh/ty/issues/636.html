            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In python there are bound methods which is actually a function/classmethod bound to an object (<code>&lt;bound method A.foo of &lt;class '__main__.A'&gt;&gt;</code>).
As on opposite, there are unbound methods - those, who were not bound.</p>
<p>You can find this term in that meaning here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock-examples.html#mocking-unbound-methods
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html</p>
<p>Ty uses &quot;unbound method&quot; as a synonym of an absent/not assigned attribute.
https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/blob/main/docs/reference/rules.md#possibly-unbound-implicit-call</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Checks for implicit calls to possibly unbound methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't relate to unbound local variable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this could be something good for a contributor to tackle; we should just review usage of the word &quot;unbound&quot; in all diagnostic codes and messages and consider alternative wording. If someone picks this up but isn't sure what wording to use, feel free to post questions here. I think maybe we could substitute the word &quot;missing&quot; for &quot;unbound&quot; in a lot of these cases (e.g. I think maybe <code>possibly-unbound-implicit-call</code> could be <code>possibly-missing-method</code> instead?)</p>

<p>What about &quot;possibly undeclared&quot;? I'm not sure if it's technically correct, however &quot;missing&quot; doesn't convey the idea of &quot;is only conditionally valid&quot; to me.</p>

<p>I don't think we should use this phrasing, as ty uses the term &quot;declared&quot; to mean &quot;given an explicit type annotation&quot;, while these errors are really talking about whether the attribute exists at all. Attributes can exist without being declared, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 1
</code></pre>
<p>Instances of <code>C</code> have an <code>x</code> attribute which is definitely &quot;bound&quot; (definitely exists), but is not &quot;declared&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;missing&quot; doesn't convey the idea of &quot;is only conditionally valid&quot; to me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure I follow here. The issue (in the case of <code>possibly-unbound-implicit-call</code>) is that a certain dunder method might not exist. &quot;Possibly missing&quot; seems like a clear way to describe this?</p>
