            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Today in type inference we sometimes construct a Place from an AST node, to use as a key for lookup in the place table. It's confusing and a potential footgun that this uses the same Rust type as a Place queried from the actual Place table, because querying the metadata (flags) on the former will just give you a meaningless/misleading &quot;no&quot; answer. It would be better to use separate Rust types for these, so that if we have a Rust type with place metadata, we know that metadata is actually accurate from the place table, not just misleadingly empty.</p>
