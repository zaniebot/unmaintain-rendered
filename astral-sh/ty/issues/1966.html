            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is less so a bug than it is a feature request, but in my project, I have a <code>backend</code> and <code>frontend</code> folder. <code>ty</code> is unable to resolve the imports likely due to trying to resolve them from the root, but <code>backend</code> is the &quot;root&quot; of my python project (that holds my <code>pyproject.toml</code> file).</p>
<p>To get import to resolve with the normal python language server in vscode, I had to add the <code>&quot;python.analysis.extraPaths&quot;: [&quot;./backend&quot;]</code> setting. So I would assume <code>ty</code> needs a setting like this to get projects like this to work.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.0.2</p>

<p>Thanks! Would that work for my structure? To clarify it looks like this for example:</p>
<pre><code>my_repo
├── backend
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   ├── uv.lock
│   └── app
├── frontend
└── README.md
</code></pre>
<p>I tried</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ty.environment]
root = [&quot;../backend&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>but that didn't work. But I also suspect <code>ty</code> is not finding my <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and I don't see a setting to specify the path to my <code>pyproject.toml</code>, so maybe one needs to be added (at least most extentions/plugins of this nature allow you to set a path to some config file)</p>
<p>Also to clarify I am able to get proper module resolution with the normal python/pyright/pylance stuff in vscode as well as pycharm works just fine. Just can't get <code>ty</code> to work in my case</p>
