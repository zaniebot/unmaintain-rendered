            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>First of all thanks for this amazing tool, even though it's not production ready it's quite impressive how it fast it is.</p>
<p>One thing that I'm missing (sorry if it's already talked, but I didn't find any reference to it) it's the possibility to have a similar behavior to MYPY's <code>disallow_untyped_defs</code>.</p>
<p>Do you have it in your radar? Or it's something that ty will not support?</p>
<p>As I said, thanks for your job. Not just <strong>ty</strong>, but also <strong>uv</strong> and <strong>ruff</strong>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our opinion is that such a rule is out of scope for a <em>typechecker</em>, but is a great opt-in rule to provide in a <em>linter</em>. For some rules this might require a type-aware linter (which we ultimately aim to provide), but <code>disallow-untyped-defs</code> is a much simpler rule that doesn't even require type information to provide. In fact it's already provided by Ruff! See ANN001, ANN002, and ANN003 here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-annotations-ann</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks so much @carljm, it has all the sense.</p>
<p>I was using <strong>ruff</strong>, bur just as a formatter. Definitely I'll take a look to it as a linter too.</p>
