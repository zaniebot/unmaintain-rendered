<p>I'd be inclined to hard code the Python version to 3.8 or shard the benchmark to check multiple versions (both seem equally likely to catch bugs IMO because we default to an old Python version in mdtests)</p>

<p>I did the first bit of this suggestion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21844 (the <code>--python-version</code> argument for the fuzzer is currently hardcoded to 3.9, typeshed's lowest supported Python version). But we could consider doing the second suggestion as well: we could run two instances of the fuzzer script on every PR. Once with <code>--python-version=3.9</code>, and once with <code>--python-version=3.14</code></p>
