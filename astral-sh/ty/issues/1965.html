<p>Where <code>[PATH TO MY PROJECT]</code> is a directory, not a file, which results in the following image when trying to open it by clicking the path on the log file:</p>

<p>Thank you for your time! Excited to try the newly released ty beta!</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p><code>The extension ships with ty==0.0.2.</code> from the extension description</p>

<p>ty has its own namespace for this setting (<code>ty.completions.autoImport</code>), it's set to <code>true</code> already by default</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for sharing the logs. They're very insightful.</p>
<p>It looks like the extension is using an older ty version that doesn't yet support this option:</p>
<pre><code>2025-12-16 16:26:21.257436000  INFO Version: 0.0.1-alpha.26 (b225fd8b4 2025-11-10)
</code></pre>
<p>If you open the &quot;Output&quot; panel and select ty, then the logs should show you which binary the extension picked:</p>
<pre><code>2025-12-17 09:22:39.781 [info] Name: ty
2025-12-17 09:22:39.781 [info] Module: ty

2025-12-17 09:22:40.521 [info] Found executable at /Users/micha/.local/bin/ty
</code></pre>
<p>Most likely, it's because the extension finds an older ty version in your virtual environment or PATH</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was experiencing the same issue and can anecdotally confirm this appears to be a versioning issue with the extension requiring local ty installs to be &gt;=0.0.2. I had previously used <code>uv add ty</code> to install a <code>0.0.1aXX</code> build. When I upgraded to <code>0.0.2</code>, the extension immediately began working as intended without OP's error.</p>

<p>Nice catch! This fixed it for me! I totally missed that someone had already added it to our dev dependencies so it was using an older version!</p>
