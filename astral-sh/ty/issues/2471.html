            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the latter is easier to understand and aligns with <code>possibly-missing-attribute</code>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there is a reason that &quot;unresolved&quot; is more correct or preferrable for a different reason. There are also other <code>*unresolved*</code> errors - I think currently:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for filing this! I do find &quot;unresolved&quot; to be awkward wording here, and I think &quot;missing&quot; would be clearly better in at least three of these cases: &quot;missing-attribute&quot;, &quot;missing-global&quot;, &quot;missing-import&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;missing-reference&quot; doesn't make sense, since it's not the reference that is missing but the referent. I think <code>undefined-name</code> and <code>possibly-undefined-name</code> would be better?</p>
