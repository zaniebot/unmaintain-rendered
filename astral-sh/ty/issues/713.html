            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>If a maybe-<code>None</code> variable is defined in a while loop, and the while loop exits when the variable is determined to be not <code>None</code>, ty still thinks the value may be <code>None</code> resulting in a false positive of <code>possibly-unbound-attribute</code></p>
Example 1
<p>This showcases the false positive.</p>
<pre><code>def f() -&gt; str | None: ...


while True:
    if v := f():
        break
print(v.capitalize())
</code></pre>
<pre><code>warning[possibly-unbound-attribute]: Attribute `capitalize` on type `str | None` is possibly unbound
 --&gt; example.py:7:7
  |
5 |     if v := f():
6 |         break
7 | print(v.capitalize())
  |       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this false positive is not tied to the <code>:=</code> operator. The more verbose example below produces the same error:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    v = f()
    if v is not None:
        break
print(v.capitalize())
</code></pre>
Example 2
<p>This example, while functionally equivalent, does <em>not</em> raise a false positive.</p>
<pre><code>def f() -&gt; str | None: ...


while not (v := f()):
    continue
print(v.capitalize())
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess specifically the issue here is that we model control flow &quot;falling off the end&quot; of the <code>while</code> loop, while in fact that possibility is contingent on re-checking the while loop condition?</p>
<p>FWIW that seems fixable without fully modeling the control flow back edges -- the bug described here doesn&#x27;t actually depend on the back edge.</p>

<p>Hm... really? It seems to me that only example 2 follows that description, and this we already handle fine.</p>
<p>But you&#x27;re right. My analysis here was short-sighted The problem is actually that we don&#x27;t retain the narrowing constraint in the control flow merge (another instance of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/690">astral-sh/ty#690</a>). Everything else works just fine:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    v = f()
    if v is not None:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>Before looking at the static truthiness of the conditions, there are three ways that control flow could reach the post-loop state:</p>
<ol>
<li>the first evaluation of the loop condition yields false. This has a reachability constraint of <code>~[True]</code>, so it&#x27;s excluded</li>
<li>the body was executed, but a later evaluation of the loop condition yielded false. This path is also guarded by a <code>~[True]</code> reachability constraint, i.e. it&#x27;s also excluded</li>
<li>the loop was exited through the <code>break</code> statement. This path has a reachability constraint of <code>[True] AND [v is not None]</code>, which evaluates to an ambiguous truthiness.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third branch is the only on that survives after the control flow merge, but we lose the narrowing constraint of <code>[v is not None]</code> when merging it with the other two branches.</p>
<p>I think we might be able to fix this specific example by eagerly recording <code>ALWAYS_TRUE</code> for the expression <code>True</code>, but of course that wouldn&#x27;t work with any other always-truthy condition. The real solution seems to be <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/690">astral-sh/ty#690</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, that clarifies, thank you!</p>
<p>You reopened the issue, but I actually think your analysis suggests this should be closed as a duplicate of #690?</p>

<p>Yes — I thought it might be neat to try and fix this specific instance by recording <code>ALWAYS_TRUE</code>/<code>ALWAYS_FALSE</code> for <code>True</code>/<code>False</code>. That might be beneficial for performance anyways. <code>if True</code> and <code>if False</code> hopefully don&#x27;t appear that often, but <code>while True</code> is a frequent pattern.</p>

<p>Yes, that works: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18998">astral-sh/ruff#18998</a> (that was just a hacky implementation, will redo that in a cleaner way on Monday).</p>
