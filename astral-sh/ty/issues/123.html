            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This code, in a stub file, results in a query cycle, with <code>ClassLiteralType::try_metaclass</code> as the cycle head:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def lucky_number(self): ...

class B(A):
    def lucky_number(self): ...

obj = B()
assert obj.lucky_number() == 2
</code></pre>
<p>The issue is that name resolution of <code>A</code> in <code>class B(A)</code> is deferred (because we are in a stub file), and the public binding of <code>A</code> has a visibility constraint of <code>obj.lucky_number() == 2</code>. Evaluating that visibility constraint requires figuring out what <code>obj.lucky_number</code> is, which means resolving the MRO of <code>B</code>, which means resolving the public binding of <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m recording this issue for future consideration, but not prioritizing it right now, since I think it&#x27;s very unlikely to occur in the wild; since stub files are not executed, they are very unlikely to have assertions or conditionals based on the types they themselves define. (There may well be visibility constraints on e.g. <code>sys.version_info</code> or other simple constants, but those won&#x27;t cause this kind of cycle.)</p>
<p>It may be that we find other, more compelling reasons to add fixpoint handling to <code>ClassLiteralType::try_metaclass</code>, in which case this cycle panic would go away too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It feels like when resolving deferred names, we really shouldn&#x27;t need to take into account the possibility of the scope not completing at all. But I&#x27;m not sure how to model this exactly. Maybe by <code>OR</code>ing the visibility constraints on each binding with the negation of <code>scope_start_visibility</code>? That is, when considering the visibility of a given binding, we should eliminate from consideration those cases in which the scope-start itself is not visible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d honestly be okay with just banning <code>assert</code> and <code>raise</code> statements in stub files if we can&#x27;t be confident that we can handle them without panicking. I can&#x27;t see any possible use case for having them in stub files. Do other type checkers accept them?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The only use case I can think of is platform asserts, like <code>assert sys.platform == &quot;win32&quot;</code> for a Windows-only stub. I feel like that&#x27;s been proposed but I&#x27;m not sure any other type checker supports it.</p>
<p>If we add that, I&#x27;d be fine with restricting them syntactically to be before any class/function definition though, which should simplify life for you.</p>
