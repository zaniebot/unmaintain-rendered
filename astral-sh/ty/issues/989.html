            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would make e.g. <code>uvx --with Foo ty check script_using_Foo_library.py</code> work as a one-liner. Today it doesn&#x27;t work. uv creates an ephemeral env with Foo installed, and then invokes ty&#x27;s Python shim from that env, but ty doesn&#x27;t care about that. uv doesn&#x27;t set <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code>, and the ephemeral env isn&#x27;t located anywhere ty&#x27;s searching will find it, so ty never finds the env it was invoked from.</p>
<p>I suspect this would also make things &quot;just work&quot; for a significant number of end-user cases, where they are running ty from the same Python installation their dependencies are installed in, without <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> set. (Either because they have a venv and are running its binary directly without shell activation, or because they aren&#x27;t using a venv at all.)</p>
<p>Uv has specific logic to do this (for itself), see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/a186fda2d27d74c631c50ffccb9413d31f95cc89/python/uv/<strong>main</strong>.py#L35 and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/2c54d3929c11fd9b5c8b0235ab201fe9d5501751/crates/uv-python/src/discovery.rs#L487-L493 -- we could borrow this approach.</p>
<p>We would still need to decide where in the priority this would fall. I think it would probably be last in fallback order, after explicit config and <code>.venv</code> and <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this used to work with previous versions of uv after a PR I made to uv, but I think they changed the way they layer ephemeral environments over the top in a recent version of uv which means that it no longer works.</p>

<p>Ah sorry, I&#x27;m getting mixed up between my uv executables -- yeah, I don&#x27;t think <code>uvx</code> has ever worked to date; would be cool if it did!</p>
<p>I thought something with the <code>uv run</code> invocation broke recently but now I can&#x27;t seem to find a minimal repro... I&#x27;ll post a separate issue if I come across it again.</p>
<p>Sorry for the noise!! :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we also need this to allow users to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/691#issuecomment-2995041731">check their PEP 723 scripts</a> using <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12763">uv&#x27;s new <code>--with-requirements</code> option</a> using</p>
<pre><code>uvx --with-requirements script.py ty check script.py
</code></pre>
<p>This already works with pyright, mypy, pyrefly, but not yet with ty.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was discussed internally in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1039017663004942429/1343690517745111081/1417965051549188277">Discord</a>.</p>
<p>The reason pyright and mypy work is that they add the virtual environment they are <em>installed</em> in to the search path. ty does not do this, but should. There&#x27;s some debate about which circumstances are appropriate for ty to do this, e.g.:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an environment cannot be found (i.e., neither <code>.venv</code> and <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code>)</li>
<li>If an environment is not active (i.e., only if <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> is unset)</li>
<li>If ty is invoked with <code>python -m ty</code> (this matches uv&#x27;s behavior for respecting its own environment)</li>
<li>Always (with some opt-out)</li>
