            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently we reveal the following here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import reveal_type

def f(x: object):
    if hasattr(x, &quot;foo&quot;) and hasattr(x, &quot;bar&quot;):
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: &lt;Protocol with members 'foo'&gt; &amp; &lt;Protocol with members 'bar'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/6eba5550-5bb9-4481-a3e6-7a616a09c3a3</p>
<p>What would be better would be if we merged the two synthesized protocols together into a single synthesized protocol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import reveal_type

def f(x: object):
    if hasattr(x, &quot;foo&quot;) and hasattr(x, &quot;bar&quot;):
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: &lt;Protocol with members 'foo', 'bar'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This could be implemented as part of the logic in our <code>IntersectionBuilder</code>. We would only want to implement the change for synthesized protocols, not for class-based protocols.</p>
<p>The reasons for merging them together are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the merged versions more readable in its display</li>
<li>it will probably be better for our performance</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I don't think we should implement this change until we start considering the types of protocol members for assignability/subtyping/equivalence. That will lead to significant changes in the inner structure of synthesized protocols.</p>
