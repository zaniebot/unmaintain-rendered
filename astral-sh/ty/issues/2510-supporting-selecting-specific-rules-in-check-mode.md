# Supporting selecting specific rules in check mode

---

_@Feiyang472_

### Question

ty version 0.0.12 check command supports `ignore, warn, error` flags to alter rule behaviour. It would be great to support selecting a whitelist of rules like `ruff check --select` to enable.

### Version

0.0.12
