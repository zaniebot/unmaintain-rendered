            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Smart formatting of complex types for improved readability (esp. signatures of callables) with a focus on the LSP, but it would also be nice if some of it could be ported to CLI diagnostics.</p>
<p>We don't have to but we could use our formatter infrastructure for this.</p>
<p>Example of a not so readable type in https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/264#issuecomment-3185997723</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did a rough draft of this locally for functions but concluded we probably want to tweak the type/signature display machinery to take formatting settings -- notably whether line-breaking would be appropriate or not, as many places aren't expecting it.</p>
