            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider this example</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class A:
    class B:
        pass

class C:
    class B:
        pass


a: A.B = C.B()
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>ty</code> reports <code>Object of type B is not assignable to B</code>. This message does not help fixing the error.</p>
<p>This this example, it's easy to see the problem. However, consider if two <code>B</code> classes were coming from different packages. In that case, it would be much harder to understand why the error is happening.</p>
<p>Printing the fully qualified name, with packages, module and inner classes would improve the error message while keeping the error message clear.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>We should probably avoid doing this all the time and only print the full qualified name if the name is ambiguous in the current file (e.g. there are multiple symbols with the same name or the type isn't even imported)</p>
