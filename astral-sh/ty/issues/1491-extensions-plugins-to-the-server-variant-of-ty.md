# Extensions/plugins to the server variant of ty

---

_Issue opened by @mkarbo on 2025-11-05 19:53_

### Question

E.g., to enable live query against a postgresql database similar to  `sqlx` crate in rust.

Being able to make extensions in the type-checker for the lsp would enable a lot of really cool tools to be built that can validate logic in python code that can't be caught easily otherwise.

### Version

_No response_

I'm not sure I follow what you're asking for. Can you say a bit more about what sort of extensions you're looking for? What information would you expect from ty?

Closing for now, but happy to reopen if you can provide more detailed information on what you're asking for here :-)
