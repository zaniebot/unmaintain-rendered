            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. First things first: Thanks a stack for conceiving <code>ty</code>, and a happy new year!</p>
<p>We'd like to invoke <code>ty</code> in a traditional CI/GHA environment where we are not using <code>uv</code> yet. As such, the package and its dependencies are installed into the global system environment, because it's ephemeral anyway. Currently, <code>ty</code> doesn't find third-party modules, and we don't know how to configure it properly, because we don't know upfront where GHA (<code>actions/setup-python</code>) locates its Python environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/crate/pytest-cratedb/actions/runs/20797404169/job/59734360168</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you know a good trick how to make <code>ty</code> work in this environment? We tried to configure <a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-python/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#environment-variables"><code>env.pythonLocation</code></a>, but it didn't work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">env:
  VIRTUAL_ENV: ${{ env.pythonLocation }}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>ty failed
  Cause: Failed to discover local Python environment
  Cause: Invalid `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable `/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.14.2/x64`: points to a broken venv with no pyvenv.cfg file
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! I think this is basically a duplicate of #2068, since that's how ty should support this case. But I'll leave it open as a question, to help others maybe find it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you Carl, you are right. I first posted this message at https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2068#issuecomment-3720992492, but then decided to use a separate issue, because others might know some tricks how to configure <code>ty</code> properly on GHA without modifying it, and without using a virtualenv.</p>
