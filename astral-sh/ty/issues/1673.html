            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When hovering over a variable that has type <code>T</code>, ty currently tells you the variance of <code>T</code>, which is really useful. It would also be very useful to know what the upper bound or constraints of <code>T</code> are, however. E.g. here, <code>T@f</code> has an upper bound of <code>F</code>.</p>
