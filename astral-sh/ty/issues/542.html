            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This file has lots of places where it emits tracing warnings if <code>site-packages</code> discovery doesn't go to plan: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/site_packages.rs. Ideally we should convert these to warning-level diagnostics so that they're more visible to IDE users (suggested by @MichaReiser in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18335#discussion_r2111051215)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To clarify: we should only convert the once that require user interaction (where we expect them to change something) because warning diagnostics can change the exit code</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hrm. A message like this I think would be useful for the user to see (it'll help them diagnose the cause of type-checking diagnostics) but I don't know what we expect the user to do about it. It most likely indicates a bug in uv or ty, if it happens! But I don't think we should fail the process, because type-checking <em>might</em> proceed just fine.</p>
<p>What about an info-level diagnostic? Would we still exit with code 0 if we did that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess one action the user could take in response to that diagnostic is to not use <code>uv run --with=ty</code>, and instead run ty using some other uv invocation.</p>
