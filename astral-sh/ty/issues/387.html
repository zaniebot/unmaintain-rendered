            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should add a CI job that will fail on PRs like https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/383 so that we can easily tell which PRs touch generated code (and therefore that we should not approve and merge). In this case I remembered that this might be generated code when I saw the PR but I'm worried I won't remember next time (the PR looked correct!). Something like what we have at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/cf70c7863c2c011367d5fd673332f7fa56ef81ec/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L499-L503 in Ruff.</p>
<p>We should also mark these files as generated in our <code>.gitattributes</code> file</p>
