            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A python concept I often see in functions is checking if a certain set of variables is not None.</p>
<p>Checking that individually with <code>if not x: return</code> works fine.</p>
<p>But checking for multiple variables at a time with <code>if not all(...)</code> seems to break currently type checkers which is unfortunate.</p>
<pre><code>data: dict[str, str] = {
    &quot;a&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;,
    &quot;b&quot;: &quot;world&quot;,
}

a_val = data.get(&quot;a&quot;)
b_val = data.get(&quot;b&quot;)

def test1():  # &gt;&gt;&gt; This works 👍 
    if not a_val or not b_val:
        return

    _ = a_val * 2  # ✅ 
    _ = b_val * 2  # ✅ 


def test2():  # This breaks 💥 
    if not all([a_val, b_val]):
        return

    _ = a_val * 2  # 🛑 
    _ = b_val * 2  # 🛑 

</code></pre>
<p>Any way this could be achieved? 🤓</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for reporting this.</p>
<p>This is <em>technically</em> possible, but would require special-casing <code>all(…)</code> calls, and explicit matching on various kinds of inner iterables.</p>
<p>Given that no other type checker supports this either, I&#x27;m questioning if this really something that we should implement. The alternative of <code>not a or not b or not c or not …</code> or <code>not (a and b and c and …)</code> does not seem much more verbose than <code>not all([a, b, c, …])</code>? Is this really a common pattern (in code that would benefit from this kind of type narrowing)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting thoughts 🤔</p>
<p>I have seen this a few times and many ai tools / copilots seem to suggest that regularly so this must be based on something 😆 .</p>
<p>But I agree, this is not ideal.
Maybe a ruff rule could actualy suggest and auto-fix that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran into some errors where it would be helpful if ty supported narrowing on <code>all()</code>.</p>
<p>Code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def f(x: list[str]): ...

def _(value: object):
    if isinstance(value, list) and all(isinstance(item, str) for item in value):
        f(value)
</code></pre>
<p>(And similarly with using <code>isinstance(..., dict)</code> and then passing the object to something that needs <code>dict[str, object]</code>.)</p>
<p>While other type checkers do not support this, narrowing here is uniquely useful with <code>ty</code> because it narrows <code>value</code> to <code>Top[list[Any]]</code> instead of <code>list[Any]</code>, so operations that other type checkers would accept are rejected by ty.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this code example is still unsound, though? Just because <code>value</code> is a list at runtime and it happens to contain all strings at runtime, does not mean we can type it as <code>list[str]</code>. It may elsewhere (that is, in the caller) be typed as e.g. <code>list[Literal[&quot;foo&quot; | &quot;bar&quot;]]</code>, or <code>list[LiteralString]</code>.</p>
<p>I think that we could safely type <code>value</code> within the <code>if</code> as <code>Top[list[Unknown]] &amp; Iterable[str]</code>? Which I think should then be assignable to e.g. <code>Sequence[str]</code>, though this probably requires some logic we don&#x27;t currently have.</p>
