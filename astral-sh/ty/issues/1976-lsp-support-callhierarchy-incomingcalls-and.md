# LSP: Support callHierarchy/incomingCalls and callHierarchy/outgoingCalls

---

_Issue opened by @sr0lle on 2025-12-17 05:36_

According to the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/language-server/#feature-reference), neither of the [callHierarchy methods](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#callHierarchy_incomingCalls) is supported yet. Both methods are incredibly helpful when navigating or refactoring large projects, so it would be fantastic to have support for both and bring the LSP closer to being feature-complete.
