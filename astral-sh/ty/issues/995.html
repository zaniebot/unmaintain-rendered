<p>Hi,</p>
<p>According to the docs, we should be able to do multiline suppressions:
https://docs.astral.sh/ty/suppression/#ty-suppression-comments</p>
<p>But this doesn't seem to work with unknown-argument.
This still errors out:</p>
<pre><code>MyBuilder(
    name=&quot;123&quot;,
    translation=&quot;Some translation&quot;,
)  # ty: ignore[unknown-argument]
</code></pre>
<p>Same as:</p>
<pre><code>MyBuilder(  # ty: ignore[unknown-argument]
    name=&quot;123&quot;,
    translation=&quot;Some translation&quot;,
)
</code></pre>
<p>Only this works:</p>
<pre><code>MyBuilder(
    name=&quot;123&quot;,  # ty: ignore[unknown-argument]
    translation=&quot;Some translation&quot;,  # ty: ignore[unknown-argument]
)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here's a more complete example: https://play.ty.dev/071a7857-df0c-42a5-801c-d2a59e2440d4 and I'll use this to explain what's happening.</p>
<p>The first diagnostic is:</p>
<pre><code>Argument `name` does not match any known parameter of bound method `__init__` (unknown-argument) [Ln 7, Col 5]
</code></pre>
<p>and the documentation says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rule violations spanning multiple lines can be suppressed by adding the comment at the end of the violation's first or last line:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The violation's first line is line number 7 as you can see in the diagnostic message. That means, you can place a suppression comment at the end of line 7.</p>
<p>Now, it's a bit harder to tell where a diagnostic ends because that's not visible in its message but in this instance, it's also line number 7. That means, suppressions are only allowed at the end of line 7.</p>
<p>You can change your example to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class MyBuilder:

    def __init__(self):
        pass

MyBuilder(
    name=  # ty: ignore[unknown-argument]
        &quot;123&quot;,
    translation=&quot;Some translation&quot;,
) 

</code></pre>
<p>In which case the suppression is both valid at the end of the <code>name=</code> line or after <code>&quot;123&quot;,</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class MyBuilder:

    def __init__(self):
        pass

MyBuilder(
    name=
        &quot;123&quot;,   # ty: ignore[unknown-argument]
    translation=&quot;Some translation&quot;,
)  
</code></pre>
<p>Because the diagnostic starts at line 7, and ends at line 8, suppressions are valid at both the end of line 7 and 8</p>
<p>You can find more exmaples in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/1167ed61cf3fa186e852df2d6ec9cb0136dffa80/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/suppressions/ty_ignore.md</p>
<p>Now, I can see how it might be desirable to suppress all unknown argument errors with a single suppression. And we had other instances where we intentionally kept the diagnostic range larger than it had to be so that suppressions worked more intuitively (@AlexWaygood do you remember some of those instances). What we discussed there is whether diagnostics can have a secondary range that isn't visible when rendering the diagnostic but adds an extra range where suppressions are allowed in addition to the start and end line of the diagnostic itself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, some of the other instances where we intentionally kept the range broader than what we'd ideally highlight in the diagnostic rendering (so that suppresion comments work intuitively) are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assert_type</code></li>
<li><code>assert_never</code></li>
<li><code>cast</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>reveal_type</code> we did not do this -- we changed the range of the diagnostic so that it was only the range of one of the arguments passed in. I think that was the correct decision, because users will never realistically want to suppress a <code>reveal-type</code> diagnostic. But the narrower diagnostic ranges still caused issues for <em>us</em> when writing mdtests: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17980/files#r2081633694</p>
