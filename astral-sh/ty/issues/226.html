            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14873">astral-sh/ruff#14873</a>, it&#x27;s now required to document every lint. The PR itself documented some lints but not all of them.</p>
<p>The goal of this issue is to go through all lints and add documentation to them, similar to what we have in ruff.</p>
Lint rules
<p><em>The following table only includes the lint rules that have incomplete documentation.</em></p>
<p>| Rule                                | &quot;What it does&quot; | &quot;Why is this bad?&quot; | &quot;Examples&quot; |
| --------                            | --------       | --------           | --------   |
| <code>CALL_POSSIBLY_UNBOUND_METHOD</code>      | ✅             | ✅                  |            |
| <code>INVALID_BASE</code>                      |                |                    |            |</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is this <code>help-wanted</code>? There are currently 21 rules with <code>/// TODO #14889</code>; that should only take up one of my afternoons or so.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for asking. IMO, it has fairly low priority at the moment and we don&#x27;t even know if we&#x27;ll keep the rules as they are right now. That&#x27;s why I probably would wait.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The table should be updated now. There&#x27;s only a few left after <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17981">#17981</a>.</p>
<p>As per the discussion there, there are a few lints that need refactoring. The most problematic would be <code>invalid-type-form</code>, which uses &quot;type form&quot; incorrectly (a &quot;type form&quot; is supposed to be a runtime object that encodes a type in the type system) and has numerous references.</p>
