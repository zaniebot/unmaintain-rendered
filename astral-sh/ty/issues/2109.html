<p>You&#x27;re right - I apologize for the confusion.</p>
<p>I likely assumed <code>possibly-unbound</code> existed because Pyright/Pylance has a similar rule (<code>reportPossiblyUnbound</code>). When configuring ty, I tried adding common type checker rules without checking if they exist in ty specifically.</p>
<p>Could you point me to where I can find the complete list of available ty rules? I searched the documentation but couldn&#x27;t find a comprehensive rules reference.</p>
<p>Also, what is the equivalent rule name in ty for detecting potentially unbound variables (if it exists)?</p>

<p>I opened <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2111">astral-sh/ty#2111</a> for this, but I don&#x27;t think we should do it now because we&#x27;re still constantly adding, renaming, changing and removing rules at the moment. Maybe when we&#x27;re closer to stable :-)</p>
