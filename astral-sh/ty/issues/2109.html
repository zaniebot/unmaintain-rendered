<p>You're right - I apologize for the confusion.</p>
<p>I likely assumed <code>possibly-unbound</code> existed because Pyright/Pylance has a similar rule (<code>reportPossiblyUnbound</code>). When configuring ty, I tried adding common type checker rules without checking if they exist in ty specifically.</p>
<p>Could you point me to where I can find the complete list of available ty rules? I searched the documentation but couldn't find a comprehensive rules reference.</p>
<p>Also, what is the equivalent rule name in ty for detecting potentially unbound variables (if it exists)?</p>

<p>I opened https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2111 for this, but I don't think we should do it now because we're still constantly adding, renaming, changing and removing rules at the moment. Maybe when we're closer to stable :-)</p>
