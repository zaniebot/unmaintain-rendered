# LSP mdtests?

---

_Issue opened by @Gankra on 2025-12-08 22:46_

### Summary

The amount of snapshot tests we have inline in the code for ty_ide is getting a bit absurd, and makes me wonder if we could extend/ape mdtests. But at this point there's literally over 900 tests so... Oof.

Also I'm not sure if mdtests are really the right format, snapshot tests do feel like the right approach for these...
