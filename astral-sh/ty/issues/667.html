            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently report multiple diagnostics in situations like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># Name `UnknownTypeForm` used when not defined (unresolved-reference) [Ln 1, Col 4]
# Int literals are not allowed in this context in a type expression (invalid-type-form) [Ln 1, Col 20]
x: UnknownTypeForm[1]


# Name `UnknownTypeForm` used when not defined (unresolved-reference) [Ln 1, Col 4]
# Syntax error in forward annotation: Unexpected token at the end of an expression (invalid-syntax-in-forward-annotation) [Ln 1, Col 20]
x: UnknownTypeForm[&quot;some string&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>The first of these (<code>unresolved-reference</code>) is obviously fine, but I think we should suppress the other diagnostic. This can also cause false positives in unreachable code where legit type forms may be inferred as <code>Unknown</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">assert False

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A possible approach is to apply &quot;name-based resolution&quot; on some of the unresolved references:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># `Literal` is unresolved, since it is not imported,
# but instead of treating it as `Unknown`,
# assume the user mean `typing[_extensions].Literal`.

#        vvvvvvv error: `Literal` is not resolved
def _(a: Literal['a b']):
#                ^^^^^ Fine
	reveal_type(a)        # Literal['a b']
	reveal_type(Literal)  # Error out, but reveal `typing[_extensions].Literal`
</code></pre>
<p><code>reveal_type()</code> is already benefitting from this special treatment. I'm not sure how much of a good idea it is to extend to other symbols, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we want to make assumptions based on the name.</p>
<p>It seems to me the likely fix here is just some kind of &quot;visit and evaluate/store unknown&quot; helper in type expression evaluation that doesn't emit diagnostics, so when we evaluate something as <code>Unknown</code>, we can just mark its subscript expression (and all sub-expressions) as also <code>Unknown</code> and move on, rather than really trying to evaluate them and possibly emitting diagnostics.</p>
