            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I might be wrong, but I seem to remember that I used to get file-level diagnostics in project-external files. For example: I have the <code>~/ruff</code> folder opened in VS Code. If I open a file from <code>~/playground</code>, I don&#x27;t see any diagnostics:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60be60e6-7235-4fbb-bb44-02c0bdb5db73"></p>
<p>Everything works fine if the file comes from within the project:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd1869f7-4baf-459e-a0fe-26669c9aeaf3"></p>
<p>And everything also works fine if I open <code>~/playground</code> as a folder.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if something in VS Code has changed, or if something in ty has changed.</p>
<p>Choosing a different <code>&quot;ty.diagnosticMode&quot;</code> does not help.</p>

<p>I think it depends and we may want to introduce a configuration option for this. I&#x27;d be very annoyed seeing a ton of diagnostics on standard library files because they aren&#x27;t annotated or redefine variables in a way that isn&#x27;t allowed by ty (but completely fine in a file that has typing stubs).</p>
<p>This question then expands into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should on-save fixes run when hitting save?</li>
<li>How should we handle auto import completions (may already be an issue today)? We don&#x27;t know the search paths</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these things should (ideally) happen a lot less with ty than with other type checkers, but I see your point.</p>
<p>I am not so sure anymore if this ever worked(?), but I now realize that other LSPs like rust-analyzer also don&#x27;t support it, and it seems potentially difficult or even controversial. So let&#x27;s maybe close this for now.</p>
