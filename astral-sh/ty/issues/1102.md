# When will `ty` be ready for production use?

---

_Issue opened by @axiomofjoy on 2025-08-28 14:36_

I'm interested in migrating off `mypy` for [this project](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) and have had great experiences with astral tooling such as `ruff` and `uv` in the past. Wondering when will `ty` be ready for primetime?

You can follow the milestones at https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/milestones (a beta release will be ready this year, at which point we think people should be able to adopt ty even though it won't have all of the features we want)

Can you pin this issue or otherwise expose it  more obviously in the readme and or docs? This took me a while to find. Thanks! You all are doing incredible work.
