            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the kind words.</p>
<p>We're working towards a beta in the near future. You can follow the milestone to track our progress.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I can't say more than it's done when it's done, but we're getting close to the features and bug fixes that we want for the Beta. You can give ty a try. If it's language support is good enough for use case, then you could consider adopting it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest! Ty is already released as alpha and is installable and usable, depending how affected you are by its limitations. We're still closing in on the beta release. A stable release is likely a number of months away still. You can track releases at https://pypi.org/project/ty/#history or https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/releases</p>
