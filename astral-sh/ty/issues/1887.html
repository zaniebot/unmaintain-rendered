            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Checking <code>audit_logs.py</code> dominates the entire type-checking time:</p>
<ul>
<li>wall-time: 380ms</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/blob/master/discord/audit_logs.py"><code>audit_logs.py</code></a>: <code>/home/micha/astral/discord.py/discord/audit_logs.py</code> took more than 100ms (340.341158ms)</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't looked into what's special about <code>audit_logs.py</code> (or something it imports), that explains its long type-checking time.</p>
<p>There are some other &quot;slow&quot; files but none takes as long as <code>audit_logs.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>INFO Checking file `/home/micha/astral/discord.py/discord/ext/commands/bot.py` took more than 100ms (104.770849ms)
INFO Checking file `/home/micha/astral/discord.py/discord/client.py` took more than 100ms (121.575732ms)
