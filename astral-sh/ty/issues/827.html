            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because <code>ty --watch</code> keeps on appending to the current terminal it can be a bit confusing to read its output.
Its also hard to find the start of the output of the latest run.</p>
<p>With <code>watchexec</code>, which i assume ty is using behind the scenes, you can set <code>--clear</code> which clears the terminal.
Then all you see in the terminal is the latest data of a run making it easier to see which issues are still present.</p>

<p>ty uses custom watcher because it allows us to do more fine grained updates.</p>
