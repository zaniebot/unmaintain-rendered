            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you actually want to do that? One of Ruff&#x27;s great points is that it unifies things that used to be separate.</p>
<p>I can see a few advantages to publishing only one extension for both (having experience writing one myself):</p>
<ul>
<li>Most, if not all, users of Red Knot will also want to use Ruff. It is easier to make Red Knot optional for users of Ruff who don&#x27;t want to use Red Knot than to develop two extensions simultaneously and ask users of both to install them.</li>
<li>A number of underlying infrastructures (helpers, test frameworks, etc.) can be shared, as do bugfixes and feature requests, thereby lowering the maintenance cost. Having them in the same repository could help.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Knot is supposed to be a <em>standalone</em> type checker, so coupling them to one extension effectively hides Red Knot within Ruff&#x27;s shadow. The repurposing cost will be high too: One might not understand why Ruff suddenly turns into Ruff &amp; Red Knot.</li>
<li>Currently, Ruff&#x27;s extension gets one release for each release of Ruff. If Red Knot were to have a separate versioning scheme, the extension would need to account for both, increasing user update frequency; I have seen some reviews saying they are disturbed by this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then again, I&#x27;m speaking from the viewpoint of a JetBrains plugin developer who makes users do tool updates on their own. Perhaps VS Code users are more tolerant about installing different extensions?</p>
