            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to be able to trigger property tests on a PR by adding a label to the PR, similar to the way we do it with ecosystem-analyzer. They&#x27;re too slow to run on every PR by default, but you generally want to run them on any PR that touches our <code>Type::has_relation_to_impl</code> logic, and it&#x27;s annoying to have to check out the PR locally in order to run them.</p>
