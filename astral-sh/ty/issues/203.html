<p>Ruff gets the range correctly:</p>

Found 1 error.

<p>But Red Knot doesn't:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ red_knot check --venv-path .venv
error: lint:call-non-callable

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It appears that this has been fixed by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18962 🥳</p>
<p>@BurntSushi, do you think it's worth adding another regression test for this specifically, or would that just duplicate the tests you already added in that PR?</p>
