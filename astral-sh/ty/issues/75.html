            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The LSP supports cancellation requests to &quot;cancel&quot; requested information that the client no longer needs, e.g. because the document was closed or changed since the request was sent.</p>
<p>We should add support for cancellation requests. One way of implementing this is to keep a map of pending-requests (keyed by request id) and skipping requests if their id isn&#x27;t in the map. Cancelling a request is than as simple as removing the id from said map (which we also need to do when completing requests).</p>
