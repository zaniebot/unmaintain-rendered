            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should start with a pretty dumb version of this (infer solely based on the types present at construction, maybe unioned with Unknown), which will be quick and easy to implement and be fine for a lot of cases.</p>
<p>We have a lot of design decisions to make about how we want to improve from there. It likely intersects with https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/136 and bidirectional checking.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just came across this too with simple constructors like so.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">y = [1,2,3]
# list[Unknown]
reveal_type(y)
</code></pre>
<p>And some comprehensions cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a: list[int] = [1,2,3]
b = [i for i in a]
# Revealed type: `@Todo`
reveal_type(b)

d = [i for i, x in enumerate(range(5))]
# Revealed type: `@Todo`
reveal_type(d)

f = [j for j in range(5)]
# Revealed type: `@Todo`
reveal_type(f)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Container inference is now largely implemented, so I'm going to close this issue in favor pf a number of smaller open issues for limitations in our bidirectional inference solver. https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1240 is the issue for the question of how we should handle unannotated collection literals, and I opened https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1388 for comprehension inference.</p>
