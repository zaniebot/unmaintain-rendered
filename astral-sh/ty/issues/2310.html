            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I&#x27;ve been using ty and the vscode extension for a few months now. I pretty regularly get the message in vscode saying &quot;ty has crashed 5 times and will not be restarted&quot;.  Previously, I never looked at the logs, but it happened again just now and I&#x27;ve attached the log. It looks like many files take over 100ms, then a worker gets a stack overflow. Sorry if this is the wrong place to put vscode extension issues.</p>

<p>No need to be sorry. We&#x27;ll move issues if they aren&#x27;t in the right place (but yours is).</p>
<p>This is tricky to narrow down without access to the code. Can you try to run <code>ty</code> on the CLI with <code>TY_MAX_PARALLELISM=1 ty check -vv</code>. It should then run in single-threaded mode and log what files it&#x27;s currently checking. That should help us to narrow down which (first-party file) contains the code on which ty currently stack overflows.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also an existing issue, any chance this is something you use in your code? <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2039">astral-sh/ty#2039</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay thanks, I&#x27;ve attached the output of <code>TY_MAX_PARALLELISM=1 ty check -vv</code></p>
<p>We do little to no recursion so I don&#x27;t think recursive callables would be the source. I had a quick look and didn&#x27;t find anything matching that pattern.</p>
<p>If you wanted to see the contents of one or two files, I could probably share that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. The logs are very useful and allowed me to submit what I think should fix this issue, see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22433">astral-sh/ruff#22433</a></p>
<p>What makes me draw this conclusion is that we only see the stack overflow when using the server, but not when using the CLI. I also assume that you use <code>diagnosticMode: &quot;openFilesOnly&quot;</code> (the default), in which case checking doesn&#x27;t run on a rayon thread (for which we already set the higher stack size), but on one of the LSPs worker threads.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay I&#x27;m happy to try again whenever any new changes are merged in. I do use <code>&quot;ty.diagnosticMode&quot;: &quot;workspace&quot;,</code> however.</p>
<p>The other two settings changes I have are <code>&quot;ty.inlayHints.variableTypes&quot;: false,</code>, and <code>&quot;ty.inlayHints.callArgumentNames&quot;: false,</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay I updated to the new version and after about 30 minutes I got a similar error. This one popped up different warning messages in vscode, but it looks like there&#x27;s still an overflow in there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The logs suggest that you&#x27;re still on 0.0.8. Any chance you have ty installed globally or in your venv?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oops, I&#x27;m used to Pylance that uses its own bundled version by default. Will ty only use the bundled version if it doesn&#x27;t find another version installed?</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve updated my venv to 0.0.10, and haven&#x27;t had the language server crash yet today. I&#x27;ll report back if it stays reliable or it fails again in the next few days.</p>

<p>There&#x27;s a setting controlling the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/editor-settings/#importstrategy">extensions behavior</a>. The default is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version installed in the selected venv</li>
<li>A system wide installation</li>
<li>The bundled version</li>
</ul>
<p>ty always uses the bundled version when opening an untrusted workspace.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay thanks, good to know!</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t have any language server crashes for a few days, but I had another one just now. It seemed a bit different than in the past and just mentioned it exited in a panic.</p>
