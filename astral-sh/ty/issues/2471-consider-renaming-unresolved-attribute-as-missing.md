# Consider renaming `unresolved-attribute` as `missing-attribute`

I think the latter is easier to understand and aligns with `possibly-missing-attribute`.

I'm not sure if there is a reason that "unresolved" is more correct or preferrable for a different reason. There are also other `*unresolved*` errors - I think currently:

- [possibly-unresolved-reference](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#possibly-unresolved-reference)
- [unresolved-attribute](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#unresolved-attribute)
- [unresolved-global](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#unresolved-global)
- [unresolved-import](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#unresolved-import)
- [unresolved-reference](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#unresolved-reference)
