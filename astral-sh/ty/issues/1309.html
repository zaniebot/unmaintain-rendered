            <div class="timeline-body"><p>many python projects support a range of python versions, eg. <code>&gt;=3.9,&lt;3.14</code>, which means having to write checks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">if sys.version_info &lt; (3, 13):
    ...
else:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>currently, all the type checkers only support specifying one python version, which means one of those branches will incorrectly be treated as unreachable, when it's obvious that the developer intends for their code to run on multiple different python versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! Yes, this is a feature we'd love to have. We initially wanted to include it in ty's first alpha, but postponed it due to the complexity of the feature and the number of other things we have to do.</p>
<p>We already have an issue tracking multi-platform checking (#160) but it looks like we didn't have one open for multi-version checking — so thank you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>oh i thought multiple platforms were already supported since there's an <code>&quot;all&quot;</code> option for <code>python-platform</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/configuration/#python-platform</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We support it as a configuration option but it doesn't necessarily lead to a great experience right now, which is why it isn't the default (see #160 for more details)</p>
