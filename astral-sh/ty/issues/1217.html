<p>the value here could be safely inferred as <code>A[int] | A[str]</code>, as there is only one input value</p>

<p>It seems to me like there are additional requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for that property to hold (not just the &quot;one input value&quot; constraint)? It might work for <code>int</code> and <code>str</code>, as there is an instance lay-out conflict, but for general classes, I don't think it's true that <code>A(value)</code> with <code>value: X | Y</code> should be assignable to <code>A[X] | A[Y]</code>, because there could be subclasses that derive from <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, and <code>value</code> might be an instance of those subclasses.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like any other type checker allows your snippet to pass without errors. Do you have a concrete real-world use case where you see this problem?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i did run into this at one point, but i can't remember the specifics, i think it was creating a list</p>
<p>in the case of covariant types <code>A[int] | A[str]</code> is a subtype of <code>A[int | str]</code>. so we would be inferring the more specific type</p>

<p>yeah, it's more complicated than i initially thought, and now i think not worth it</p>
