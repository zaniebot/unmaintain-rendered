            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>Literal</code> inlay hints are often extremely verbose and not what you would ever want to bake. We could consider applying a &quot;weakening&quot; transform to some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literal[&quot;foo&quot;] -&gt; str</li>
<li>Literal[1] -&gt; int</li>
</ul>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>(Writing this down before I forget about it)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here also it seems potentially quite confusing if inlay hints do not match the type we actually infer and will use for subsequent uses of the name. I've seen a lot of evidence already in issues that users are using inlay hints as a replacement for <code>reveal_type</code>. I'm not sure that we should sacrifice this fidelity in the interests of making inlay hints more bakeable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Possibly a setting we could expose?</p>
