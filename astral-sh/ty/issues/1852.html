            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to suggest a new heuristic: consider prioritizing builtin modules over symbols defined with the same name in the environment.</p>
<p>For example in <a href="https://play.ty.dev/fbc4ba96-0d33-4c7c-a120-39f4cf88f626">this trivial example</a> I'd like the <code>os</code> reference in <code>main.py</code> to complete first to the standard lib <code>os</code> module.</p>
<p>The situation that prompted this is the <code>coverage</code> library where <a href="https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/blob/bedb949d20cb16ca98415a6fc018accbeae3e763/coverage/files.py#L22">this</a> is a common pattern; in my project that happens to have a dev-dependency on <code>coverage</code>, this happens:</p>

<p>Which is suboptimal.</p>

<p>So in this example specifically, I think I'd question whether we want to prioritize the stdlib module. Or at least, I'm having trouble coming up with a heuristic. In particular, I think I would generally expect symbols that are &quot;more local&quot; to show up before symbols that are &quot;less local.&quot; i.e., All else being equal, I see symbols in my project ranked higher than symbols from a dependency or the standard library.</p>
<p>What about a heuristic that ranks the names of modules over names within modules? I think that would fix your two examples without always prioritizing std modules over non-std modules. I don't know how well it generalizes though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I retitled this issue based on the <code>coverage</code> example given in the OP, but the playground example is quite different, as @BurntSushi says. These seem like pretty distinct cases, though it's of course possible that they'll share the same solution</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that's fair, I'm not sure how to represent a faithful example of the situation I care about (where the conflicting symbol is coming from a module I have no control over).</p>
