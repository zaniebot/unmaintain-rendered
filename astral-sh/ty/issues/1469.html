            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ty checks every path specified on the CLI even if they match an exclude pattern. This is
because explicitly passed paths are considered explicit than an exclusion pattern.</p>
<p>This behavior generally matches expectation but it's problematic when integrating ty with other tools that aren't aware of the exclusions. For example, pre-commit (also see https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/269), passes all changed files to ty, including paths excluded in ty.</p>
<p>We should add an option similar to Ruff's <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/269"><code>--force-exclude</code></a> that gives exclude patterns higher precedence over the paths passed on the CLI, enforcing that the exclusion rules are respected even for files passed on the CLI</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Bazel is another example of a tool that typically passes files as individual paths, and therefore would benefit from this feature.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the incredible work!</p>
