<p>In theory, if you goto-declaration on a definition in a .py, it would be desirable for us to jump to the definition in the .pyi, allowing you to freely jump between the &quot;real&quot; implementation and the type info.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> this would require us to implement, essentially, &quot;stub unmapping&quot; with a third <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bd4506aac56228af83d8ad76569530b3b32be473/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/module_resolver/resolver.rs#L49">ResolveMode</a>: StubsOnly. A mode that would literally ignore the .py you're current in.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>AFAIK, no pyright or pylance users has ever requested this feature, so I think it's reasonable to make this low priority — or defer it entirely until you get a request from a user.</p>
