            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>both calls to <code>infer_objects</code> on <code>pandas</code> <code>DataFrame</code> and <code>Series</code> trigger</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Argument <code>copy</code> does not match any known parameter of bound method <code>infer_objects</code> (https://ty.dev/rules#unknown-argument)</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;A&quot;: [1, 2, 3], &quot;B&quot;: [4, 5, 6], &quot;C&quot;: [7, 8, 9]})

df.infer_objects(copy=False)
df.A.infer_objects(copy=False)
</code></pre>
<p>docs on the <code>copy</code> parameter:</p>
<ul>

<li>https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.infer_objects.html</li>
</ul>
<p>i looked over at https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Apython%2Ftypeshed%20infer_objects&amp;type=code but found no mention of <code>infer_objects</code> so not sure where this incorrect type stub is coming from</p>

<p>Typeshed only provides stubs for objects defined in the standard library. (Well, it has stubs for other libraries, but ty doesn&#x27;t vendor those out of the box -- you have to <code>(uv) pip install</code> (or the Conda equivalent) those stubs packages into a Python environment.) The reason why typeshed&#x27;s stubs were relevant in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1048">astral-sh/ty#1048</a> was that pandas&#x27;s type annotations indicated that the <code>Dataframe.attrs</code> attribute is a dictionary, so ty then looked at the stubs for the <code>dict</code> class and its methods in typeshed to figure out what the signature of <code>dict.update()</code> should be.</p>
<p>Here, it looks like the <code>infer_object()</code> method is directly defined on <code>pandas.DataFrame</code>, so I&#x27;d expect ty to look either in the <code>pandas</code> library or the <code>pandas-stubs</code> library for information on the signature of that method. (In general, it&#x27;ll be much easier to debug issues with <code>pandas</code> if you could let us know whether you have <code>pandas-stubs</code> installed or not! If it is installed into your environment, ty will look at that stubs package for information about pandas; if not, it&#x27;ll look at the <code>pandas</code> library itself for information about the classes, functions and methods in <code>pandas</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can reproduce the error if I have <code>pandas-stubs</code> installed but not if I only have <code>pandas</code> installed, so I&#x27;m guessing you have <code>pandas-stubs</code> installed into your environment!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thanks a lot @AlexWaygood for troubleshooting this. you&#x27;re exactly right:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip show pandas-stubs
Using Python 3.13.0 environment at: /Users/janosh/.venv/py313
Name: pandas-stubs
Version: 2.3.0.250703
Requires: numpy, types-pytz
Required-by:
</code></pre>
<p>required by nothing so what triggered its installation initially seems to have been uninstalled or no longer depends on it.</p>
<p>i&#x27;ll report this over at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs</p>

<p>No problem!</p>
<p>I think it was harder than it should be here to figure out where ty was getting its type information from -- I&#x27;m working on a patch now to improve our diagnostics here</p>
