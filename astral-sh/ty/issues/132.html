            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17023/files#r2033191626 @sharkdp called out that with generic classes, our implementation of <code>getattr_static</code> does not match its runtime behavior, since at runtime, generic aliases are instances of the special <code>_GenericAlias</code> class. We treat generic aliases as a specialized instance of the underlying class literal.</p>
<p>This <code>getattr_static</code> behavior is arguably better for our type checker, but @carljm suggested that we might consider a custom <code>getattr_static</code> in <code>knot_extensions</code> (instead of piggy-backing on the name of the runtime's <code>inspect.getattr_static</code>) to clarify this difference in behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm personally fine with the deviation that we currently have, i.e. I'm not convinced that we need to do anything here. If anyone wants to work on this, I think it should be discussed first.</p>
