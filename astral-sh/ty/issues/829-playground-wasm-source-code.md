# Playground WASM source code

### Question

Hi,

maybe stupid, very unrelated question to ty but is the source code for the [playground ](https://play.ty.dev/)also openly available somewhere? As I understood it is made using WASM which I never used and I wanted to have a look how you did it :) 

### Version

_No response_
