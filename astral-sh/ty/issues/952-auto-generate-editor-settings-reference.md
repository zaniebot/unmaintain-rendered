# Auto-generate editor settings reference

---

_@dhruvmanila_

Currently, the editor settings reference are being manually added and updated: https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/editor-settings/

The task here is to update it such that it gets auto-generated similar to the command-line options in ty and Ruff.

I have a reference implementation in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19823 from when I tried doing this for Ruff server a while ago.
