            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Support for jupyter notebooks</p>
<p>The infrastructure already supports notebooks but we should test if it's necessary to have any notebook-specific behavior and if the infrastructure works as expected (LSP, diagnostic rendering etc)</p>
<h2>Work items</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Handle open (<code>notebookDocument/didOpen</code>) and close (<code>notebookDocument/didClose</code>) notifications</li>
<li>[x] Handle change notifications (<code>notebookDocument/didChange</code>, <code>workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles</code>)</li>
<li>[x] Consider notebooks for document diagnostic and ~~workspace diagnostics~~ (not supported)</li>
</ul>

<p>Pyright ignores it, so you lose a lot of static analysis when you, say, create a cell above another that defined some variables. This is generally not a problem for traditional notebooks, where out of order execution is a problem for reproducibility. But in a reactive notebook, like marimo, cell order doesn’t matter. Looking at the spec, it seems like <code>executionOrder</code> could offer an opportunity to compose with other static analysis tools.</p>

<p>Thanks! Yeah, I agree that this seems like a useful information to consider. I don't think Ruff stores or uses this information but we'll keep this in mind when implementing notebook support in ty.</p>
