            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently track whether an entire scope is enclosed inside an <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> block. But there are certain semantics that it would be useful to apply to <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks where tracking this at the scope level is not sufficiently fine-grained. For example, if your code supports Python 3.9, we allow this type alias (it doesn&#x27;t really matter that it uses the PEP-604 syntax, since it will never be executed at runtime, and the intent is clear):</p>
<pre><code>import typing

if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
    class Foo:
        X = int | str
</code></pre>
<p>but we don&#x27;t support this type alias, which is something a user is much more likely to write:</p>
<pre><code>import typing

if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
    X = int | str
</code></pre>
<p>Another case where this would be useful is <code>@type_check_only</code>. Currently we always put symbols marked as <code>@type_check_only</code> at the bottom of autocompletion suggestions, since they&#x27;re not available at runtime. But this is suboptimal: ideally we wouldn&#x27;t include them in the list of suggestions at all if we&#x27;re outside a <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> block (or maybe we&#x27;d keep them at the bottom of the list of suggestions), but we wouldn&#x27;t apply any downranking for these symbols if the user&#x27;s cursor is inside a <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> block, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # we could freely suggest typeshed&#x27;s `_SupportsSynchronousAnext` protocol here, for example
    `_SupportsS&lt;CURSOR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We could also freely suggest modules inside <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks that we know not to exist at runtime, such as the <code>_typeshed</code> module (which contains some very useful types!):</p>
<pre><code>if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from _typesh&lt;CURSOR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff also has a number of linter rules that require a fine-grained analysis of which basic blocks are inside <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> conditions. If we ever want to reimplement these rules using ty&#x27;s semantic model, we will need to replicate this fine-grained understanding.</p>
