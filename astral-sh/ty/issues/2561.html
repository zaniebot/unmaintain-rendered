            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>in PyCharm, it would be very useful to be able to ask ty for the type of an expression. retrieving this type as a string with fully qualified names is enough</p>
<p>we have a working prototype of this, would you be interested in incorporating this into ty?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be open to that as it doesn't expose much internals. Can you say a little more about what Pycharm uses it for (You can also include that information in the PR or the custom LSP method's documentation). Having good documentation of the intended use case will help us understand the API stability that PyCharm expects upstream.</p>
<p>I'd be inclined to make the result type an object with only a full qualified name string for now. It will make it easier to expose more information later.</p>
<p>Are there other LSP methods that you expect are needed for Pycharm?</p>
