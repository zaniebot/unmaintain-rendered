            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>in PyCharm, it would be very useful to be able to ask ty for the type of an expression. retrieving this type as a string with fully qualified names is enough</p>
<p>we have a working prototype of this, would you be interested in incorporating this into ty?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d be open to that as it doesn&#x27;t expose much internals. Can you say a little more about what Pycharm uses it for (You can also include that information in the PR or the custom LSP method&#x27;s documentation). Having good documentation of the intended use case will help us understand the API stability that PyCharm expects upstream.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be inclined to make the result type an object with only a full qualified name string for now. It will make it easier to expose more information later.</p>
<p>Are there other LSP methods that you expect are needed for Pycharm?</p>
