            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>ty_extensions currently requires Python 3.13 or newer. Would it be possible to support older versions as well?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m looking to adopt ty for an existing project that supports 3.11+ and it would be great if ty_extensions could support that, but <strong>any</strong> additional version support would be most welcome.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you say a bit more about what specifically is going wrong if you try to use <code>ty_extensions</code> on a project that supports Python 3.11?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It won&#x27;t install on anything less than Python 3.13. Pip is being its usual unhelpful self by complaining about a bunch of other modules, but if I remove ty_extensions from the dependencies everything installs just fine on 3.12 and below. These observations appear consistent with the ty_extensions package metadata stating 3.13 is a minimum requirement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, in my 3.12 environment pip gives a more helpful message: <code>ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ty_extensions~=0.1.0; extra == &quot;test&quot; (from betty[test]) (from versions: none)</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don&#x27;t publish ty_extensions to PyPI at all right now, I&#x27;m afraid! You have to import it in an <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> block if you want to use it in a non-stub file in your project.</p>
<p>Uploading an installable runtime shim to PyPI is tracked in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2084">astral-sh/ty#2084</a>. If we did that, we would make sure it&#x27;s installable on all versions of Python ty supports</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I now see that https://pypi.org/project/ty-extensions/has nothing to do with the current state of things at all :) @AlexWaygood Thanks!</p>
<p>@charliermarsh Could an update to that PyPI package page avoid others from trying to use the package?</p>
