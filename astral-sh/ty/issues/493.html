            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To make sure I'm following, this would only be valid for a one-element tuple, right? For multi-element tuples the equivalence wouldn't hold, since &quot;tuple of union&quot; is heterogeneous while &quot;union of tuple&quot; is homogeneous.</p>

<p>Right, but if I'm reading that section correctly, the resulting expansion has to retain the heterogeneity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If multiple elements are union types, full expansion must consider all combinations. For example, <code>tuple[int | str, int | str]</code> is equivalent to <code>tuple[int, int] | tuple[int, str] | tuple[str, int] | tuple[str, str]</code>. Unbounded tuples cannot be expanded in this manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the following does not hold:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">static_assert(is_equivalent_to(tuple[int | str, int | str], tuple[int | int] | tuple[str | str]))

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another way to think about it: Tuples are products, unions are sums, and this is the distributive law:</p>
<pre><code>(int + str) × (int + str) = int × int + int × str + str × int + str × str
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Full&quot; explosion is not the only alternative form. The following two representations are also equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>(int + str) × int + (int + str) × str
int × (int + str) + str × (int + str)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There was also a similar post here: https://discuss.python.org/t/unbounded-tuple-unions/92472, showing that these types are equivalent: <code>tuple[int, ...]</code> and <code>tuple[()] | tuple[int, *tuple[int, ...]]</code>. (I believe ty doesn't yet support such unpacked types.)</p>
<p>There's a lot of other variations to come up with; for example, these are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Group 1
tuple[bool, ...] | tuple[object]
tuple[()] | tuple[object] | tuple[bool, bool, *tuple[bool, ...]]

# Group 2
tuple[Literal[False], ...] | tuple[Literal[True], ...] | tuple[bool, bool, *tuple[bool, ...]]
tuple[bool, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>I think ideally type checkers should detect the equivalence, but I'm not sure there's a general algorithm that will run in a reasonable time, and most of these are unlikely to come up in practice, so probably not worth worrying about too much.</p>
