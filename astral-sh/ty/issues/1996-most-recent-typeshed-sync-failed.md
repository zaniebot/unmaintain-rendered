# Most recent typeshed sync failed

_@AlexWaygood_

See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/20216754532. It failed again when I reran it.

Because it _timed out_ rather than encountering an error during the job, the automation that should have created an issue about it also failed to trigger.
