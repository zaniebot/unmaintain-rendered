            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect the initial version of #210 will not fix this issue; the top-priority fix there is to stop wrongly assuming end-of-scope (and instead assume might-be-called-from-anywhere-in-scope). Once we have that foundation in place, we can explore further trimming of the possibilities.</p>

<p>Yeah I think it's useful to track this as a separate improvement.</p>

<p>I think we can leave it closed though, as a duplicate of #710</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the boundness analysis problem here was indeed fixed. In a rather crude way, though: by always considering nonlocal symbols to be bound.</p>
