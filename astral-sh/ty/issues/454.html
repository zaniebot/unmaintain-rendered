            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I don't know how to describe it exactly, but running ty check on the following code shows an <code>invalid-return-type</code> because the code does not acknowledges that sys.exit is equivalent o a raise SystemExit and thus the function will not return anything.</p>
<pre><code>def config(thing) -&gt; dict:
    if thing:
        return {'response': thing}
    sys.exit(-1)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a dumbed down version of a real function on a real codebase, where the code exits if some config is not passed correctly. In all successful function calls, it will return a dict otherwise it will raise SystemExit. There is no possible &quot;None&quot; being returned as suggested:</p>
<pre><code>error[invalid-return-type]: Function can implicitly return `None`, which is not assignable to 
return type `dict[Unknown, Unknown]`
