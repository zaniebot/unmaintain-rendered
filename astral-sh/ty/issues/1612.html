<p>Here a few options</p>
Top-level
<p>Put the settings directly under <code>ty</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ty]
allowed-unresolved-modules = [...]
</code></pre>
<p>The main downside of this, and the reason why all existing settings are grouped, is that top-level settings make it more difficult to explain which settings are allowed within <code>.overrides</code>, in user-level configurations, or when we add hierarchical configurations.</p>
<p>No grouping can also make it more difficult to discover options, asssuming we can come up with meaningful section names.</p>
Rule-level
<pre><code>[tool.ty.rules]
unresolved-import = { level = &quot;warning&quot;, allow=[...] }
</code></pre>
<p>I like that the settings are very local to the rule. However, many settings are specific to many rules (e.g. whether ty should respect <code>type: ignore</code> comments) and I worry that the configuration schema becomes very complicated and I don&#x27;t know how well editors support tagged-unions...</p>
Sub-section
<p>This is still my favorite option, except that I&#x27;m struggling to come up with a good section name. The most obvious choice is <code>check</code></p>
<pre><code>[tool.ty.check]
allowed-unresolved-modules = [...]
</code></pre>
<p>Long-term, what if ty also supports formatting and the options only apply to typing? Is <code>check</code> still a good name? Could we come up with something more meaningful? <code>tool.ty.typing</code>?</p>
<p>The other downside is that a separte section is somewhat verbose when using overrides</p>
<pre><code>[[tool.ty.overrides]]
include = [...]

[[tool.ty.overrides.check]]
allowed-unresolved-modules = []
</code></pre>
<p>I think the following should also work, but only for as long as the configuration fits on a single line</p>
<pre><code>[[tool.ty.overrides]]
include = [...]
check.allowed-unresolved-modules = []
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Related to rule settings, there&#x27;s also a discussion of where to put a potential <code>strict-typing</code> setting, which controls how ty handles <code>type-ignore</code> comments, and a setting to allow unresolved modules (which is the case I used above). What&#x27;s special about <code>strict-typing</code> is that this is another setting that probably can&#x27;t be overridden in an initial version; instead, it applies to the entire project.</p>
<p>Under the current design, the idea was to use different sections for project-level settings (e.g., <code>environment</code>) and settings that can be overridden at a per-file level. The idea behind this guiding principle was that having settings grouped this way makes it relatively easy to explain and verify which settings can be used within <code>overrides</code>, a user-level configuration, or, in the future, a workspace member configuration.</p>
<p>However, I do think there are two main challenges with it and I&#x27;m starting to conclude that we should give up on this principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#x27;s difficult to come up with both semantically meaningful section names while also separating project-level settings from file-level settings. E.g., one proposal is to introduce an <code>analyze</code> section for settings that change how the analyzer works (this section might differ from rule-specific options). If there were an <code>analyze</code> section, as a user, I&#x27;d expect both <code>allowed-unresolved-modules</code> and <code>strict-typing</code> to be there rather than, e.g., finding <code>strict-typing</code> in <code>environment</code> just because it&#x27;s a project-level setting.</li>
<li>It&#x27;s impossible to predict the future, and what used to be a project-level setting inevitably becomes a file-level (or member-level) setting. For example, we currently don&#x27;t support checking multiple projects in a single ty invocation. However, this might change depending on how we design our mono-repository support. It would be unfortunate if we had to move settings around just because their scope has changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that project-level settings should be rare, I think it should be sufficient if their scope is documented (and warning about invalid usages).</p>
<p>Drawing this conclusion, I think we should put <code>allowed-unresolved-modules</code> into a new <code>analyze</code> section. I consider <code>allowed-unresolved-modules</code> an analyzer and not a rule-level setting because ignoring imports changes what types we infer for those modules. Meaning, the setting doesn&#x27;t just change a single diagnostic; it has a more widespread impact on how your project is checked.</p>

<p>a potential <code>strict-typing</code> setting, which controls how ty handles <code>type-ignore</code> comments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me why an option for how we handle <code>type: ignore</code> comments would use the name <code>strict-typing</code>? That seems like a very general name with many possible interpretations; if we have it at all, I think it probably needs to be a meta-option that turns on a bunch of other different options. (But I think we should try to avoid having it, and just let the individual options stand on their own.)</p>
<p>Another &quot;strict typing&quot; option that I think we will need is an option to not union <code>Unknown</code> into un-annotated attribute types. (Or alternatively this could be named something like a <code>gradual-typing</code> option.)</p>

<p>Sorry, that must have been my auto correct tool making my English better but mixing up the semantics of what I tried to say 😆. These should be two settings: one for <code>strict-typing</code> and one for ignore comments.</p>

<p>Yes (minus exact setting names). I don&#x27;t know yet whether we should put lint rule settings under <code>lint</code>, inline them into <code>rules</code>, put them in <code>rules.settings</code>, or put them in <code>analyze</code>, but I&#x27;m leaning towards punting on that design question for now because we don&#x27;t need a decision today.</p>
