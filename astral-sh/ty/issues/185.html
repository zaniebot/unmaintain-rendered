            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo():
    pass

a, b = Foo().nonexistant
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the RHS of the assignment has an error <code>unresolved-attribute</code> which is being shown 3 times (2 + 1 where 2 is the number of variables involved in the unpacking):</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6be58cc-cc5e-4079-814c-de25191bc10d"></p>
<p>This is because the standalone expression is being inferred <em>outside</em> the unpacking in <code>infer_assignment_definition</code> (and similarly in <code>infer_for_statement_definition</code>). This inference should only be done for non-unpack targets.</p>
<p>Fixing this would lead to another bug which is that the diagnostics raised during the unpacking query isn&#x27;t being merged into the outer type inference builder.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should be relatively easy to fix once <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18041">astral-sh/ruff#18041</a> has landed. This is because that PR adds a <code>Definition</code> ingredient for all attributes which would then allow us to use the <code>infer_unpack_types</code> for all attributes involved in an unpacking.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried fixing this today based on the assumption that assignments containing an attribute expressions now always create a <code>Definition</code> but that isn&#x27;t true. It&#x27;s only created if <code>PlaceExpr::try_from</code> is successful, so a call expression like the following doesn&#x27;t create a <code>Definition</code>. I&#x27;ll have to re-think the approach that I used here.</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 1

Foo().x = 2
</code></pre>
