            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One of my favorite features from rust-analyzer, if you hover over a keyword it shows documentation about that keyword.</p>

<p>The main place I would find this very helpful in is with <code>for</code>/<code>while</code> loops and their <code>else</code> blocks. I use them just rarely enough I forget the exact semantics, but also go through some headache trying to figure them back out when I need to use them. Having that sort of info available in a hover would be very nice.</p>
<p>This also helps when learning/picking back up the language. I often go a good stretch of time between using rust, so being able to quickly pull up usage info on the language itself is very nice. I could see that same sort of benefit also translating to python.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Off the top of my head: this would be a new GotoTarget with a special implementation of the docstring method that the hover code invokes. possibly would need to make a new specialcase for ResolvedDefinition too.</p>
<p>Are there specific docs for python keywords that are worth showing? Seems like a similar problem to special forms having no docs for us to show.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is docs from The Python Language Reference that could be used, though I don't think that actually goes with python so in the end it would be something built into ty. They also are not the best in terms of readability
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html
(rust-analyzer also shows for example the equal docs on hovering <code>==</code>, which is where most of the expressions reference would come in handy, though keywords also also there)</p>
