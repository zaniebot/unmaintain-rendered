            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I initially created my configuration file as <code>.ty.toml</code>, to mirror <code>.ruff.toml</code> and group files next to each other in the directory. However, this <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/configuration/">seems unsupported</a>.</p>
<p>I've searched for other issues (rather hard with <code>.ty.toml</code> as a search pattern!) but couldn't find any requesting support, so I humbly beg thus in this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Adam</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, this was somewhat intentional to reduce the number of places ty has to look and to align with uv.</p>
<p>I'm open to adding support for this but I first want more evidence that this is something many users want.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm about to use ty for regularly do type checking in my project. I definitely want this. I do not like overloading my <code>pyproject.toml</code> with tool configuration, thus I prefer separate configuration files. Most of my configuration file names start with a dot as per usual UNIX tradition to keep them &quot;hidden&quot; (there is one exception, tough: <code>tox.ini</code>) . It would be great if ty, like ruff, adheres to this commonly used UNIX convention.</p>
