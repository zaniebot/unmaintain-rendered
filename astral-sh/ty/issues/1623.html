            <div class="timeline-body"><p>if we hit this branch, we have pretty high confidence that we know what the user <em>meant</em> here -- we could even consider inferring the module-literal type of the submodule rather than inferring <code>Unknown</code>. (Or <code>&lt;submodule type&gt; | Unknown</code>...?)</p>
<p>And since this often will (by pure luck!) work at runtime, we could also consider downgrading the diagnostic to warning-level rather than error-level</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's a good idea to go ahead and infer the submodule type instead of <code>Unknown</code> (I don't think there even needs to be a union with <code>Unknown</code> or anything like that.) And I think it would make sense to downgrade the severity of the diagnostic, as well.</p>
