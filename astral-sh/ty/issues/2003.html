            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's easy for users to jump to these definitions in the stub file from inlay hints. It will be even easier to jump to these definitions if something like https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1575 is implemented.</p>
<p>We should add more docstrings/comments to the stub file so that users have a better experience when they land there. Ideally we would also show this documentation on hover, so that users can easily learn about what the <code>Unknown</code> type means and represents, for example.</p>

<p>Not directly, actually! I tried to implement this quickly before, but <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/0bd7a94c2732c232cc1423756e2437d9bce558b1/crates/ty_vendored/ty_extensions/ty_extensions.pyi#L20">since <code>Unknown</code> is not <em>declared</em></a>, we show this:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes I think three things are required for good on-hover with <code>Unknown</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change the <code>Unknown</code> definition to <code>Unknown: _SpecialForm</code>. <code>Unknown = object()</code> is just really confusing because users get the docs for <code>object</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Add an &quot;attribute docstring&quot; to <code>Unknown</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">Unknown: _SpecialForm
&quot;&quot;&quot;Some docs for `Unknown`&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>(The PEP for these was <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0224/">rejected</a>, but they're nonetheless very popular in the community and recognised by the Sphinx documentation tool)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add support for showing attribute-docstrings on-hover to the LSP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think each of these stages on its own would be a big UX improvement, so we can do each of them in isolation</p>
