            <div class="timeline-body"><p>wow I came begging for one particular feature and found this late xmas present! 😻</p>
<p>LMK if you need any help/advice!</p>
<hr />
<p>As a starter (and the reason I came here): could y'all implement attrs's underscore prefix stripping? 😇</p>
<p>I.e. defining an attribute called <code>_foo</code> creates an <code>__init__(self, foo)</code> because there's no such thing as a private argument and you wouldn't call your argument that yourself either (this goes back to attrs's philosophy of helping you to write classes the way <em>you</em> would write them). This is currently by far my biggest annoyance with ty's LSP server.</p>
<p>Should I open an subissue (hilariously I've never used that feature so not sure how)?</p>
