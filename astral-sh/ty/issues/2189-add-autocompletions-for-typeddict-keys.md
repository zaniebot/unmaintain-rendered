# Add autocompletions for TypedDict keys

---

_@RyanSaxe_

### Summary

There are no completions for the key values when the type is a TypedDict. I have confirmed that this does not happen on the playground as well as my editor.

Here is a simple playground to explore yourself: https://play.ty.dev/8f17cad1-eee9-4ba2-bec6-abf9aef19ae5
