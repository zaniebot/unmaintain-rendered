            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Today, there's exactly one <code>ProgramSettings</code> per <code>Db</code> instance. I think the main motivation for this design were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistent caching: We can cache at a program settings level. E.g., using different cache files for each Python version</li>
<li>It's simpler. <code>ProgramSetting</code>'s is a singleton and it can be queried from anywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I'm starting to see more downsides to this approach. Most notably, in larger workspaces where it's common for each member to have their own <code>src.root</code>, but all members use the same Python version.</p>
<ul>
<li>We parse every imported file once for each workspace member (in which it is imported)</li>
<li>We rebuild the semantic index for every imported file for each workspace member, even if all of them use the same Python version</li>
<li>We rebuild auto completions for each workspace member rather than sharing a single index (or one per Python version)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not entirely sure how such a new design would look like but we'll have to include the <code>PythonVersion</code> or the <code>ProgramSettings</code> as part of the query arguments. I think where this is going is that we'd have a <code>ProgramFile(File, ProgramSettings)</code> salsa ingredient and maybe a <code>FileWithPythonVersion(File, PythonVersion)</code> that we pass along instead of passing <code>File</code> (we can still pass <code>File</code> everywhere where the query result doesn't depend on <code>ProgramSettings</code> or the <code>PythonVersion</code>.</p>
<p>I think this will become more relevant as we start looking into how to better support mono repositories and uv workspaces.</p>
