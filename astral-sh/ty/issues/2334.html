            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the issue! However, this is deliberate behaviour here. The first of these (the PEP-695 alias) leads to a runtime exception if you try to subclass it. The other two do not.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, maybe we'd say that you should never be allowed to use any kind of type alias in runtime contexts like this. But we've found that real-world actually does do things like this, and it seems needlessly pedantic to disallow it if it won't lead to a runtime error. It's also allowed by other type checkers such as mypy and pyright, and there doesn't seem to be a strong motivation for us to break compatibility with them here</p>
