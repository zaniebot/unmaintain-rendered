            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I&#x27;m using Cursor on macOS, connected to a Linux machine with the Anysphere Remote SSH extension. When I press the &quot;Install&quot; button on the extension page I get a dialog box that says &quot;Can&#x27;t install &#x27;astral-sh.ty&#x27; extension because it is not compatible with the current version of Cursor (version 2.2.20, VSCode version 1.105.1)&quot;.</p>
<p>Using the &quot;Install previous version&quot; option I am able to install the pre-release version without issue. Then on the extension page I get a button labeled &quot;Switch to Release Version&quot; and when I press it I get an error that says &quot;Can&#x27;t install release version of &#x27;ty&#x27; extension because it has no release version.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Found some things (e.g. https://forum.cursor.com/t/newly-published-extensions-appear-slower-on-cursor-than-vscode/39028/3 ) suggesting that there is a ~1 day delay for newly published extension versions to make their way into Cursor? It seems likely that&#x27;s what is happening here, since ty-vscode 0.0.2 was only released a couple hours ago. We may just need to wait a day.</p>
