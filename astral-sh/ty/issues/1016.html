            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is unsafe because Liskov is not enforced on <code>__init__</code> methods. It also makes the exclusion of <code>__init__</code> from variance-inference unsafe.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You could argue it's safe from a liskov perspective on an instance of a final class? But maybe the variance thing still holds</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, the variance thing is still an issue for a generic class, even if its final.</p>
<p>We could in theory allow it for final non-generic classes, but I'm really not sure that's worth the extra complexity, for something that's rarely done (and never a good idea) anyway. In any case where you really want to do this, you can extract the stuff you want to re-call into a separate method called from <code>__init__</code>.</p>

<p>I had the same question a few years ago! There's some great answers here: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/431549/the-liskov-substitution-principle-and-python/</p>
