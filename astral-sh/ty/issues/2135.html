            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Code completion doesn&#x27;t work for local variables. from the video below you can see if I disable <code>ty</code> language server, the completion for <code>abc</code> shows up. After I enable <code>ty</code> language server, the code completion for local variables doesn&#x27;t work, but code completion for property/method name still working</p>

<p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81bb82dc-8cd0-4c10-85c7-bf6fb4bd58ba</p>
<p>Could it be that whichever extension (or builtin feature) is providing the ghost text is somehow interfering with the completion request? Can you use <code>&quot;ty.trace.server&quot;: &quot;messages&quot;</code> setting and check whether you see a <code>textDocument/completion</code> request under &quot;ty Language Server Trace&quot; channel:</p>
<pre><code>[Trace - 14:11:54] Sending request &#x27;textDocument/completion - (310)&#x27;.
...
[Trace - 14:11:54] Received response &#x27;textDocument/completion - (310)&#x27; in 128ms.

<p>It seems that the completion request is taking a long time to complete as it got cancelled after ~8 seconds.</p>
<p>Even the code action request took a long time (~1.2 second) and got cancelled:</p>

<p>It might be useful to get some insights on the codebase like how it&#x27;s structured, is it a large codebase, what are the dependencies? If the codebase is open-source, could you provide us with the link?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dhruvmanila I do confirm that the code completion works on a fresh new project so maybe this bug only appears under certain conditions. Let me try creating a minimal reproducable example for you.</p>
