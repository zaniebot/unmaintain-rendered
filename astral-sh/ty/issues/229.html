            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pretty much what @carljm wrote in a comment <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13980#discussion_r1824747585">here</a>, and what is now described in this TODO comment:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/13a1483f1e51087d7c95922a6b3d2914ac2b68c3/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types.rs#L80-L93</p>
<p>I'm opening this as a ticket as there seems to be an open discussion point regarding the desired behavior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Possibly the behavior here should differ depending on whether we are importing from a stub or a regular Python module? But an argument could be made that even in a regular Python module, if it declares x: int at module level, we should just trust that and not require that we can see the binding of it.</p>
