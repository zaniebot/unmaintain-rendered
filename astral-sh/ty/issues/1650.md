# RST to markdown on warning directive

---

_Issue opened by @klonuo on 2025-11-27 03:27_

Hi,

I first must commend the idea of converting RST to MD, as it makes the tooltip docstrings cleaner and easier to read and more beautiful :)

I noticed that RST warning directive is rendered in markdown with python identifier, while it probably should be just plain text:
