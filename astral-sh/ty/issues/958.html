            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19821 we will include types from nested-scope nonlocal bindings in the public type of a symbol, but we still won't consider them in local reads of such symbols. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19821#issuecomment-3169019532 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19821#issuecomment-3169316459 for examples of code where we get type inference wrong due to this, and ideas on how we could improve it.</p>
<p>I don't think we should prioritize this until/unless we see it coming up in real-world bug reports. (For example, pyright doesn't do this, and gets these types wrong in the same way we do, which suggests it hasn't been a major issue?). Just wanted to capture the issue here for posterity.</p>
