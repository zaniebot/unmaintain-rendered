            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#invalid-method-override">docs for <code>invalid-method-override</code></a> are longer than the docs for most of our rules. I wanted to make them high-quality, because I expect that many users won't have heard of the Liskov Substitution Principle, and it's useful to have a good explanation of why it's important for us to link to.</p>
<p>As part of the documentation, I added a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/8bc753b842967b53dc2698fdff8e1a410ffafa46/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/diagnostic.rs#L2170-L2188">&quot;Common issues&quot; section</a>, with the idea that I'd be able to link directly to it or subsections in it if users brought up a question that we'd already written up an answer to. Currently, however, the <code>## Common issues</code> heading is the same font size as the <code>### Why does ty complain about my </code><strong>eq</strong><code> method?</code> heading immediately below it. I also can't link directly to any subsections in the docs for this rule currently.</p>
<p>We should either find a way to fix this, or I should rewrite the docs for this rule to not use subheadings 🙃</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it might be useful to have separate pages for each rule (similar to Ruff) which would allow us to provide links to individual sections in a rule documentation. We'd need to have a design on how to present a list of rules similar to https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html and add some filters / sorting ability based on attributes like severity, version added, etc.</p>
