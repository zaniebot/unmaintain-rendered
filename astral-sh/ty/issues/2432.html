            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Playground: https://play.ty.dev/fddded41-5c96-4852-9849-bd44cdf03074</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Obj:
    x: datetime

a: Obj | None = Obj(datetime.now())
# Since a is always truthy, the boolean statement continues and returns datetime
b = (a and a.x - timedelta(days=1))
# c should always be datetime here, so the diagnostic is incorrect
c = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1) &gt; b
# Operator `&gt;` is not supported between objects of type `datetime` and `(Obj &amp; ~AlwaysTruthy) | datetime`
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>a</code> was just <code>datetime | None</code>, this would work fine, but this use case is meaningful as often container data types might be None (ex. a DB row lookup).</p>
<p>To be fair, this diagnostic is useful <em>if <code>a</code> was not AlwaysTruthy, such as through a function call (which is more realistic)</em>. However, the diagnostic message is misleading as it currently is. One could argue instead we should write code using an if or ternary expression.</p>
<pre><code>b = None
if a:
    b = a.x - timedelta(days=1)
# or ...
b = None if a is None else a.x - timedelta(days=1)
</code></pre>
<p>With this change, ty will correctly infer <code>b</code> is always datetime and have no issue. And it will also correctly error with an accurate message if <code>a</code> was not AlwaysTruthy (ie. None can&#x27;t be compared to datetime).</p>
<hr>
<p>Terms used to find already-reported issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>unsupported-operation boolean</code></li>
<li><code>unsupported-operation and</code></li>
<li><code>unsupported-operation truthy</code></li>
</ul>
<p>#1972 might be a match. It talks about types being constrained by values. In a way, the type of <code>b</code> does get constrained by the resulting value of evaluating the compound boolean expression. But my example is not using a direct value but instead the resulting value of an operation.</p>

<p>ty does not consider <code>Obj</code> to be an always-truthy type, because there could be subclasses of it which define <code>__bool__</code> to sometimes return <code>False</code>. Instances of such subclasses would not necessarily be truthy, and are part of the type <code>Obj</code>.</p>
<p>Of course in this case we could in theory tell that <code>a</code> cannot be an instance of such a subclass, because we directly constructed an <code>Obj</code> instance just above. But making this distinction would require ty to track &quot;exact&quot; types (instance types that <em>don&#x27;t</em> include subclass instances). This would add a lot of complexity, and the usefulness of it is questionable, since it can only apply in limited scenarios, locally right after the construction of an instance from a concrete class.</p>
<p>Another workaround for this case would be to mark <code>Obj</code> as <code>@final</code> -- then ty will treat it as always truthy.</p>
<p>We can keep this open as a feature request for exact types, but I don&#x27;t think that will be a priority in the near term.</p>
