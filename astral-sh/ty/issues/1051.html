            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do this sort of thing a lot in ty's code base: iterating over both bindings and declarations separately, hoping that there is a 1:1 relationship. This is not always the case. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class D: # maybe a protocol, maybe a dataclass with fields, …
    if condition:
        attr: int
    else:
        attr = &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is unlikely to be a problem for protocols in particular, I think. And it's certainly not something specific to this PR. But I think it would be very beneficial in a lot of places if we could somehow iterate over all <em>definitions</em> and then get the declared type (for <code>attr: int</code>), the inferred type (for <code>attr = &quot;&quot;</code>), or both (for <code>attr: int = 0</code>).</p>
<p>Here, it would eliminate the mutation of the entry. And the bug would probably not have happened in the first place if the iterator would yield either a <code>DeclaredType { ty }</code>, an <code>InferredType { ty }</code>, or <code>Both { declared_ty, inferred_ty }</code>. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19756 for a somewhat related problem that I fixed a few weeks ago.</p>
