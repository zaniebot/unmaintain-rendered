            <div class="timeline-body"><p>VS code starts to lag when using ty's workspace diagnostics if the project has many diagnostics.</p>
<p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/963f4836-962c-4c43-9758-cadd2969c688</p>
<p>See how the scrolling sometimes &quot;hangs&quot;. The frequency roughly aligns with the 2s poll interval used by VS code.</p>
<p>I suspect the issue is that we send all diagnostics as part of every workspace diagnostic response. Alone deserializing the 30k diagnsotics will take a meaningful time in JS. The solution here is to do proper long-polling and sending diffs instead of full reports on every request.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I did a quick search and missed this issue. Yes, I think we can merge it.</p>
<p>Using it on homeassistant made me realise that the optimization is more than a nice to have. Workspace diagnostics without it are somewhat painful to use.</p>
