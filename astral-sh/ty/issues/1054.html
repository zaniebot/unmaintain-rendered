            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a followup to #1004.</p>
<p>It's exactly the same issue but specifically for when goto-declaration opens up a copy of our vendored typeshed in your IDE.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from warnings import deprecated
</code></pre>
<p>If you goto-declaration on &quot;deprecated&quot; it will open up our vendored typeshed in the IDE.
If you goto-definition on &quot;deprecated&quot; it will open up the actual stdlib in the IDE.
...but if you goto-definition on <em>the vendored typeshed definition</em> it won't go anywhere.</p>
<p>From initial debugging it seems like file_to_module doesn't recognize the opened file, and so stub mapping fails. I assume there's some trickery going on with vendored typeshed files that makes this file a different one from the one used normally in our stdlib analysis.</p>

<p>That makes sense to me. Does it, by chance work if we don't fallback to use the default database here and instead use the top-level project as fallback here</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/fc72ff4a946e4f044911ada12986a9f8731c812c/crates/ty_server/src/session.rs#L338-L343</p>
<p>You might also need to change this in other places where we fall back to the default db</p>
<p>My thinking here is that <code>file_to_module</code> might succeed if we use the correct set of search paths.</p>

<p>Thinking about it more. I think my suggestion above is rubbish :)</p>
