<pre><code># revealed: Unknown | str
x = [reveal_type(string) for string in [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]]
</code></pre>
<p>We should always avoid literal promotion and <code>Unknown</code> widening here, as the list is immutable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Other type checkers do promote here.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2441">astral-sh/ty#2441</a> maybe already captures the core idea here, that we can avoid promotion for single-use lists (in this case that&#x27;s the inner <code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]</code>).</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m not sure the ultimate effect of inferring the outer comprehension result as <code>list[Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]]</code> would be desirable. That&#x27;s a normal mutable list that subsequent code might try to add things to (although I guess if you&#x27;re using comprehension/functional style that would be a slightly weird thing to do.)</p>

<p>This would only apply to the inner list, the outer list would be promoted as usual to <code>list[str]</code> (or <code>list[Unknown | str]</code>. The difference is that the element type within the comprehension is <code>Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]</code>, which would avoid issues like <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2355">astral-sh/ty#2355</a>.</p>
