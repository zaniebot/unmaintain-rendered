            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Even after https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1602 is resolved, we may still fail to infer comprehensions that iterate over a list literal, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># revealed: Unknown | str
x = [reveal_type(string) for string in [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]]
</code></pre>
<p>We should always avoid literal promotion and <code>Unknown</code> widening here, as the list is immutable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Other type checkers do promote here.</p>
<p>I think https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2441 maybe already captures the core idea here, that we can avoid promotion for single-use lists (in this case that's the inner <code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]</code>).</p>
<p>But I'm not sure the ultimate effect of inferring the outer comprehension result as <code>list[Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]]</code> would be desirable. That's a normal mutable list that subsequent code might try to add things to (although I guess if you're using comprehension/functional style that would be a slightly weird thing to do.)</p>

<p>This would only apply to the inner list, the outer list would be promoted as usual to <code>list[str]</code> (or <code>list[Unknown | str]</code>. The difference is that the element type within the comprehension is <code>Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]</code>, which would avoid issues like https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2355.</p>
