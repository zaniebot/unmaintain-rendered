            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22581, ty started filtering out completions for redundant re-exports deeper in a package's hierarchy. For example, instead of suggesting all of <code>pandas.read_csv</code>, <code>pandas.io.api.read_csv</code>, <code>pandas.io.parsers.read_csv</code> and <code>pandas.io.parsers.readers.read_csv</code>, ty will only suggest <code>pandas.read_csv</code>.</p>
<p>However, if you're <em>working on</em> Pandas, you might reasonably want to see all available re-exports. Or perhaps even more precisely, see the &quot;closest&quot; re-export. The latter is perhaps ideal, but requires defining a notion of &quot;closesness&quot; that is more refind than &quot;top-most.&quot; We could start by implementing the former and leave the latter for future work.</p>
<p>That is, it should be pretty straight-forward to avoid doing any kind of dropping of re-exports when you're within first party code (just look at the search path of the containing <code>Module</code>). So that if you're working on pandas, you'll see all 4 re-exports. But if you're depending on pandas, you only get the top-level one.</p>
<p>The one thorny part of this though is testing. We don't have a great story right now for testing how we handle Python files coming from different search paths in a granular way. We could add support to it in our <code>CursorTest</code> infrastructure. An alternative is to write an end-to-end integration test.</p>
