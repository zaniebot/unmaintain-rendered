            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>This issues exists in other type checkers (e.g. https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13392), and I can see it exists here as well.</p>
<p>When I install an editable dependency, in this case using uv as my package manager, I get a whole bunch of <code>unresolved-import</code> issues. What I had to do with mypy was this:</p>
<pre><code>[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = [
    &quot;editable_1.*&quot;,
    etc...
]
ignore_missing_imports = true
</code></pre>
<p>Mainly I'm just wondering if you are planning on supporting resolving editable dependencies, or at least being able to ignore these errors in a targeted manner, as opposed to disabling the check entirely.</p>
<p>Thanks for the work on the new exciting project!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We support editable installs that statically write the path to the editable install to a <code>.pth</code> file in <code>site-packages</code>. However, just like every other type checker, we unfortunately cannot support editable installs that use import hooks. This would require us to dynamically execute Python code, which is not something a static type checker can realistically support.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can I confirm that you are using the setuptools build backend with uv? Because uv's default build backend is hatchling, and my understanding is hatchling should do static editable installs via <code>.pth</code> files, which work with static analysis. Only setuptools (AFAIK) defaults to the incompatible import-hook style of editable install.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This came up from a partner, with a suggestion that basedpyright may have a technique for handling these editable installs? Need to verify that, but if it's true we should consider if we can support these somehow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I'm not sure there's any special handling. I only did a quick search for <code>pth</code> and their logic looks very much the same as ours.</p>
<p>https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/blob/acfea41d0026bf99fa9084f101776ff9bdf5ca70/packages/pyright-internal/src/analyzer/pythonPathUtils.ts#L179-L194</p>
<p>@DetachHead do you know if basedpyright does anything special for editable installs created by setuptools?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>basedpyright's behavior is unchanged from pyright, which supports <code>.pth</code> files, but does not support whatever setuptools does by default.</p>
<p>i did however <a href="https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/usage/import-resolution/#setuptools">tweak the documentation a bit</a> in response to https://github.com/detachHead/basedpyright/issues/731 to make it a bit more clear that this is controlled by the build backend rather than the frontend, because pyright's documentation didn't really make that clear</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! Ok I'm going to leave this out of ty Stable milestone -- it doesn't seem like anyone has any good short-term ideas for actually supporting these setuptools editables.</p>
<p>I'll leave this open as a long-term issue -- what really needs to happen is someone pushing forward a PEP for a metadata standard for editable installs to fix this mess. And in theory we could do that.</p>
