            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Notice the default value displayed as <code>Literal[False]</code> instead of <code>False</code>. Also <code>…</code>, which is a very common default parameter value in stub files, gets rendered as <code>EllipsisType</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I agree that this is confusing and we should change this. We didn't have an issue before now for it though, so this is useful.</p>
<p>There's some design work we need to do to decide exactly what heuristics to use when rendering default values as <em>values</em> rather than <em>types</em>. There was some discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20991#issuecomment-3426434202 and the following comments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I took a quick super-naive crack at this but hit a bit of a road-block on dataclasses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class Member:
    name: str
    role: str = field(default=&quot;user&quot;)
    tag: str | None = field(default=None, init=False)

# revealed: (self: Member, name: str, role: str = Literal[&quot;user&quot;]) -&gt; None
reveal_type(Member.__init__)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the default type/expression comes from some deeper recursive analysis, and needs to be bubbled up. I'll try to dig through it more later.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For anything complex (and I'd include &quot;generated methods that don't have source code&quot; in that bucket), I think we can just render the parameter default as <code>...</code>. That's still less confusing than what we have currently, I think, and matches pylance.</p>
<p>For me the more interesting questions are things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many elements can a list/dict/set/tuple literal have before we fall back to <code>...</code>?</li>
<li>How &quot;deep&quot; should containers (lists/sets/dicts) be before we decide they're &quot;too complex&quot; and fall back to <code>...</code>? (E.g. if the default is something like <code>[[[[[[[[[], [], (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), {}], {}, ], {}, ]]]]]]]</code> or whatever, the list only has one item but that's clearly not something we should render as part of a bigger signature display (IMO).</li>
<li>What heuristics should we use to decide when numbers should be rendered in octal? In hexadecimal? Do we just want to copy what the source code does? Pylance does a poor job here IMO.</li>
<li>Should we just render all attribute expressions as they appear in the source code? Typeshed uses <code>x: int = sys.maxsize</code> a lot; it would be a shame to have all those just rendered as <code>x: int = ...</code>, the way pylance does.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>reopening. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22010 gets us to a much better state but I think there's still lots of improvements we can and should make to get to parity with Pylance here (and I have dreams of doing better than Pylance in this area).</p>
