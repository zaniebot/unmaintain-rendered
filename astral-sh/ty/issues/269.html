            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I hope that as well. I use mypy a lot for static type checking, but the only available pre-commit hook is <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy">mirrors-mypy</a>, which is maintained by the pre-commit team, not mypy itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don&#x27;t plan on adding this right now because ty is still at a very early, experimental stage and we don&#x27;t want to give the impression that it&#x27;s ready for serious production use yet. When we&#x27;re closer to feature-complete, however, we&#x27;ll absolutely be adding this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood makes sense.</p>
<p>for others wanting to ride out the experimental phase (given it might be a better UX than <code>mypy</code> 😄), you can use a <code>local</code> hook:</p>
<pre><code># .pre-commit-config.yaml
ci:
  skip: [ty]

repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ty
        name: ty check
        entry: ty check .
        language: python
</code></pre>
<p>this will not work (e.g. in CI) unless you run <code>curl --proto &#x27;=https&#x27; --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/releases/download/0.0.0-alpha.7/ty-installer.sh | sh</code> first</p>
<p>the only issue i&#x27;ve had so far is i had to add this to <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ty.rules]
unresolved-import = &quot;ignore&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can also add the ignore directly to the pre commit config file</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to point it out explicitly: This will be a killer feature, since <code>mypy</code> in pre-commit is severely compromised because it runs in an isolated environment (as per https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy). It takes quite some work to setup a correctly functioning pre-commit hook with mypy, and this is an area where <code>ty</code> can really stand-out IMO.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know this is very beta, but I coudn&#x27;t resist trying to run ty, and here is my config:</p>
<pre><code>- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: ty
      name: ty check
      entry: uvx ty check . --project backend --python backend/.venv
      language: system
      files: ^backend/
</code></pre>
<p>It runs fine locally, with <code>pre-commit run --all-files</code>, but once on the CI, I get all sorts of <code>error[unresolved-attribute]: Type Self has no attribute creation_date</code> on my Django models. I did install <code>django-stubs</code> but I think its not related as the errors are present even for explicit Django model attributes.</p>
<p>Is there any fundamental reason we should expect <code>ty</code> to run differently inside a CI environement?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess there are lots of possible reasons, mostly related to the venv used, the Python version detected, and the third-party dependencies installed. Running ty with <code>-vv</code> might clarify any differences there? But I&#x27;m not sure just based on the reported errors what it might be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One issue I ran into when trying this with a project that is gradually adopting types is that <code>tool.ty.src.exclude</code> doesn&#x27;t seem to be respected when running <code>ty check</code> against specific files as is done when using pre-commit.</p>
<p>I can work around a bit:</p>
<pre><code>  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ty
        name: ty check
        entry: ty check .
        language: system

        always_run: true

<p>Yes, paths provided on the CLI take precedence. We would need to add an option similar to Ruff&#x27;s <code>--force-exclude</code> to force-exclude paths that were provided on the CLI</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this is very off topic, but what is the point of pre-commit? the maintainer is extremely toxic, there are more effective task runners (pyprojectx/poe etc), you have to maintain and keep in sync the version of something in two places (<code>uv.lock</code> + <code>pre-commit-config.yml</code>)</p>
<p>the only use-case that i can understand is easier installation/configuration of git-hooks, which personally i haven&#x27;t used in years, my editor does my formatting/linting etc for me</p>

<p>i&#x27;ve recently started using https://github.com/j178/prek (a rust port of <code>pre-commit</code>) and so far it&#x27;s been great! maybe something astral wants to endorse/look into</p>

Ideas
<ol>
<li>I don&#x27;t think turning off <code>unresolved-import</code> is a good idea.</li>
<li>The relate to PyCharm&#x27;s &quot;Content Root&quot; set to <code>&lt;root&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>. But if I set to <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>, it&#x27;d be unbearable to work with other parts of the project (frontend, Docker, docs).</li>
</ol>
<p>(I think I should remove the comment as it&#x27;s not really related to <code>ty</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@KotlinIsland isn&#x27;t the only one who has his frustrations with this maintainer. It&#x27;s painfully easy to find examples of the described behavior by looking through the pre-commit issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#x27;t an appropriate forum to discuss that kind of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the maintainer of open-source software is problematic, then by promoting the use of that software, you&#x27;re increasing the likelihood that your users are confronted with this behavior. And even if we&#x27;re just talking about a single person here, interactions like these can damage the trust in open-source in general.</p>
<p>I realize that pre-commit is the go-to git-hook manager. And technically speaking, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, and is certainly very handy. But even so, I personally do not want to use it, because I don&#x27;t trust the person that wrote it.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t feel like playing the victim role here, so I&#x27;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that there&#x27;s no code of conduct.</p>

<p>Note that setting <code>pass_filenames: true</code> has the downside that the pre-commit hook passes if your changes created typing errors in otherwise unchanged files. E.g. you delete a function but forgot to update all uses.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m still using prek with basedpyright instead of ty, but I thought pre-commit also auto-stashes unstaged changes? Since the pre-commit hook is supposed to check the state of what you&#x27;re about to commit.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In vLLM we accept that the staged files that are type checked might introduce errors in unchanged files.</p>
<p>Then we catch this in CI with a different hook that:</p>
<ul>
<li>runs on all files (<code>pass_filenames: false</code>)</li>
<li>runs only on hook stage manual (<code>stages: [manual]</code> in the pre-commit config, <code>--hook-stage manual</code> in the GitHub Actions workflow)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Unrelated tip, make sure that you require serial (<code>require_serial: true</code>) so that pre-commit doesn&#x27;t try to be smart and run multiple <code>ty</code> processes, therefore isolating their imports from each other.</p>

<p>Currently trying to setup <code>ty</code> in a full-stack project [inside of PyCharm]. This will be a WIP-comment, hence, please, don&#x27;t mind frequent updates.</p>

Ideas
<ol>
<li>I don&#x27;t think turning off <code>unresolved-import</code> is a good idea.</li>
<li>The relate to PyCharm&#x27;s &quot;Content Root&quot; set to <code>&lt;root&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>. But if I set to <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>, it&#x27;d be unbearable to work with other parts of the project (frontend, Docker, docs).</li>

<p>@UnoYakshi I think you&#x27;re issue (and that of some of the other posts) is that</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv run ty</code> creates a <code>.venv</code> with the project&#x27;s dependencies as defined in your pyproject.toml</li>
<li><code>prek run ty-check</code> creates an isolated <code>.venv.</code> for ty with only its dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>This might work by chance, if your project&#x27;s dependencies are included in <code>ty</code>&#x27;s dependencies - but will fail otherwise. I would guess that PyCharm does not use <code>uv</code> to run <code>ty</code> (and therefore does not use the <code>.venv</code> of your project).
An easy way to check these issues, is by deleting the local <code>.venv</code> and then just run <code>prek</code> (or <code>pre-commit</code> if you must) and see if it works. If you cannot get around these issues, a hack-around is to create the <code>.venv</code> before running the hooks in CI as well.</p>

<p>We don&#x27;t plan on adding this right now because ty is still at a very early, experimental stage and we don&#x27;t want to give the impression that it&#x27;s ready for serious production use yet. When we&#x27;re closer to feature-complete, however, we&#x27;ll absolutely be adding this.</p>

<p>@AlexWaygood, ty is in Beta now. Should this ticket be prioritized?</p>
<p>https://astral.sh/blog/ty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we&#x27;re announcing the Beta release of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty">ty</a>. We now use ty exclusively in our own projects and are ready to recommend it to motivated users for production use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my personal projects, I use pre-commit for CI checks, and having an easy hook will simplify my life.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey guys, so I tried a little something, before realising that others also made the same thing, so for those interested, here are some unofficial versions of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/NSPC911/ty-pre-commit (my attempt)</li>
<li>https://github.com/JacobCoffee/ty-pre-commit</li>
<li>https://github.com/hoxbro/ty-pre-commit</li>
<li>https://github.com/allganize/ty-pre-commit (im very concerned on the rev that it uses)</li>
<li>https://foundry.fsky.io/vel/ty-pre-commit (missed out on this being mentioned above)</li>
</ul>
<p>But I noticed that there is still the issue of <code>unresolved-import</code> and <code>possibly-missing-import</code> causing failures. Until Astral manages to fix those, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these in production with <code>--ignore unresolved-import --ignore possibly-missing-import</code> (and also the fact that these are still unofficial and not at all endored by Astral and friends)</p>
