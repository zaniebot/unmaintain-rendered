            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I hope that as well. I use mypy a lot for static type checking, but the only available pre-commit hook is <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy">mirrors-mypy</a>, which is maintained by the pre-commit team, not mypy itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't plan on adding this right now because ty is still at a very early, experimental stage and we don't want to give the impression that it's ready for serious production use yet.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood makes sense.</p>
<p>for others wanting to ride out the experimental phase (given it might be a better UX than <code>mypy</code> 😄), you can use a <code>local</code> hook:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yml"># .pre-commit-config.yaml
ci:
  skip: [ty]

repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ty
        name: ty check
        entry: ty check .
        language: python
</code></pre>
<p>this will not work (e.g. in CI) unless you run <code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/releases/download/0.0.0-alpha.7/ty-installer.sh | sh</code> first</p>
<p>the only issue i've had so far is i had to add this to <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ty.rules]
unresolved-import = &quot;ignore&quot;
</code></pre>
</div>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to point it out explicitly: This will be a killer feature, since <code>mypy</code> in pre-commit is severely compromised because it runs in an isolated environment (as per https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy). It takes quite some work to setup a correctly functioning pre-commit hook with mypy, and this is an area where <code>ty</code> can really stand-out IMO.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know this is very beta, but I coudn't resist trying to run ty, and here is my config:</p>
<pre><code>- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: ty
      name: ty check
      entry: uvx ty check . --project backend --python backend/.venv
      language: system
      files: ^backend/

<p>It runs fine locally, with <code>pre-commit run --all-files</code>, but once on the CI, I get all sorts of <code>error[unresolved-attribute]: Type Self has no attribute creation_date</code> on my Django models. I did install <code>django-stubs</code> but I think its not related as the errors are present even for explicit Django model attributes.</p>
<p>Is there any fundamental reason we should expect <code>ty</code> to run differently inside a CI environement?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess there are lots of possible reasons, mostly related to the venv used, the Python version detected, and the third-party dependencies installed. Running ty with <code>-vv</code> might clarify any differences there? But I'm not sure just based on the reported errors what it might be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One issue I ran into when trying this with a project that is gradually adopting types is that <code>tool.ty.src.exclude</code> doesn't seem to be respected when running <code>ty check</code> against specific files as is done when using pre-commit.</p>
<p>I can work around a bit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">  - repo: local

<p>Yes, paths provided on the CLI take precedence. We would need to add an option similar to Ruff's <code>--force-exclude</code> to force-exclude paths that were provided on the CLI</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this is very off topic, but what is the point of pre-commit? the maintainer is extremely toxic, there are more effective task runners (pyprojectx/poe etc), you have to maintain and keep in sync the version of something in two places (<code>uv.lock</code> + <code>pre-commit-config.yml</code>)</p>
<p>the only use-case that i can understand is easier installation/configuration of git-hooks, which personally i haven't used in years, my editor does my formatting/linting etc for me</p>

<p>i've recently started using https://github.com/j178/prek (a rust port of <code>pre-commit</code>) and so far it's been great! maybe something astral wants to endorse/look into</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't think turning off <code>unresolved-import</code> is a good idea.</li>
<li>The relate to PyCharm's &quot;Content Root&quot; set to <code>&lt;root&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>. But if I set to <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>, it'd be unbearable to work with other parts of the project (frontend, Docker, docs).</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@KotlinIsland isn't the only one who has his frustrations with this maintainer. It's painfully easy to find examples of the described behavior by looking through the pre-commit issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This isn't an appropriate forum to discuss that kind of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the maintainer of open-source software is problematic, then by promoting the use of that software, you're increasing the likelihood that your users are confronted with this behavior. And even if we're just talking about a single person here, interactions like these can damage the trust in open-source in general.</p>
<p>I realize that pre-commit is the go-to git-hook manager. And technically speaking, there's nothing wrong with it, and is certainly very handy. But even so, I personally do not want to use it, because I don't trust the person that wrote it.</p>
<p>But I don't feel like playing the victim role here, so I'll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that there's no code of conduct.</p>

<p>Note that setting <code>pass_filenames: true</code> has the downside that the pre-commit hook passes if your changes created typing errors in otherwise unchanged files. E.g. you delete a function but forgot to update all uses.</p>

<p>Not really, this is an inherent problem of multifile checking. Your staged file might contain typing errors due to changes in your unstaged files. They're really not that disconnected anymore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still using prek with basedpyright instead of ty, but I thought pre-commit also auto-stashes unstaged changes? Since the pre-commit hook is supposed to check the state of what you're about to commit.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In vLLM we accept that the staged files that are type checked might introduce errors in unchanged files.</p>
<p>Then we catch this in CI with a different hook that:</p>
<ul>
<li>runs on all files (<code>pass_filenames: false</code>)</li>
<li>runs only on hook stage manual (<code>stages: [manual]</code> in the pre-commit config, <code>--hook-stage manual</code> in the GitHub Actions workflow)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Unrelated tip, make sure that you require serial (<code>require_serial: true</code>) so that pre-commit doesn't try to be smart and run multiple <code>ty</code> processes, therefore isolating their imports from each other.</p>

<p>Currently trying to setup <code>ty</code> in a full-stack project [inside of PyCharm]. This will be a WIP-comment, hence, please, don't mind frequent updates.</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't think turning off <code>unresolved-import</code> is a good idea.</li>
<li>The relate to PyCharm's &quot;Content Root&quot; set to <code>&lt;root&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>. But if I set to <code>&lt;root&gt;/backend</code>, it'd be unbearable to work with other parts of the project (frontend, Docker, docs).</li>

<p>@UnoYakshi I think you're issue (and that of some of the other posts) is that</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv run ty</code> creates a <code>.venv</code> with the project's dependencies as defined in your pyproject.toml</li>
<li><code>prek run ty-check</code> creates an isolated <code>.venv.</code> for ty with only its dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>This might work by chance, if your project's dependencies are included in <code>ty</code>'s dependencies - but will fail otherwise. I would guess that PyCharm does not use <code>uv</code> to run <code>ty</code> (and therefore does not use the <code>.venv</code> of your project).
An easy way to check these issues, is by deleting the local <code>.venv</code> and then just run <code>prek</code> (or <code>pre-commit</code> if you must) and see if it works. If you cannot get around these issues, a hack-around is to create the <code>.venv</code> before running the hooks in CI as well.</p>

<p>We don't plan on adding this right now because ty is still at a very early, experimental stage and we don't want to give the impression that it's ready for serious production use yet. When we're closer to feature-complete, however, we'll absolutely be adding this.</p>

<p>@AlexWaygood, ty is in Beta now. Should this ticket be prioritized?</p>
<p>https://astral.sh/blog/ty</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we're announcing the Beta release of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty">ty</a>. We now use ty exclusively in our own projects and are ready to recommend it to motivated users for production use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my personal projects, I use pre-commit for CI checks, and having an easy hook will simplify my life.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey guys, so I tried a little something, before realising that others also made the same thing, so for those interested, here are some unofficial versions of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/NSPC911/ty-pre-commit (my attempt)</li>
<li>https://github.com/JacobCoffee/ty-pre-commit</li>
<li>https://github.com/hoxbro/ty-pre-commit</li>
<li>https://github.com/allganize/ty-pre-commit (im very concerned on the rev that it uses)</li>
<li>https://foundry.fsky.io/vel/ty-pre-commit (missed out on this being mentioned above)</li>
</ul>
<p>But I noticed that there is still the issue of <code>unresolved-import</code> and <code>possibly-missing-import</code> causing failures. Until Astral manages to fix those, I wouldn't recommend using these in production with <code>--ignore unresolved-import --ignore possibly-missing-import</code> (and also the fact that these are still unofficial and not at all endored by Astral and friends)</p>
