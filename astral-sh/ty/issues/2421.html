            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is more of a feature request, but since I didn't see that option, I'm opening as a bug.</p>
<p>When using third-party libraries with incomplete type hints, ty frequently flags <code>invalid-argument-type</code> errors when passing <code>T | None</code> to functions that accept <code>T</code>. This happens because the library's type stubs incorrectly annotate a parameter as <code>T</code> when it actually accepts <code>None</code> at runtime.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def lib_func(a: int = None) -&gt; int:
    return a or 1

a = None
lib_func(a=a) 
</code></pre>
<p>then <code>ty</code> will flag the <code>a=a</code> as being wrong, despite there being no error at runtime. I understand this might be desired behavior in some cases, which is why I'm asking for a config to switch on or off. My issue is specific for this <code>None</code> that work at runtime. Ideally they'd be warnings not errors, but only current option would be to disable all invalid argument checks which is not an option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I was hoping the Python ecosystem by this point had mostly moved on from relying on mypy's old non-strict-optional behavior, but it sounds like at least some libraries have not?</p>
<p>I don't love the idea of adding an option for this -- IMO the annotations in the library are just wrong and should be fixed. But we can consider it, and see if there's high demand for it.</p>
<p>Do any type checkers other than mypy offer a similar option?</p>
