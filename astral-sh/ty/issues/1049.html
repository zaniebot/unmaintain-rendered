            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ty now supports most features of <code>NamedTuple</code>s defined via the class-based syntax (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/545). However, we do not yet have full support for namedtuples defined using the function-call syntax. I suggest that we hold off on this until work on https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/742 is complete, as some refactoring that needs to be done for that issue will likely be helpful for this issue.</p>
<p>We should add suppport for these ways of defining a namedtuple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from collections import namedtuple
from typing import NamedTuple

a = namedtuple(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a b c&quot;)
b = namedtuple(&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a, b, c&quot;)
c = namedtuple(&quot;c&quot;, [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;])
d = namedtuple(&quot;d&quot;, (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;))

e = NamedTuple(&quot;e&quot;, [(&quot;a&quot;, int), (&quot;b&quot;, str)])
f = NamedTuple(&quot;f&quot;, ((&quot;a&quot;, int), (&quot;b&quot;, str)))
</code></pre>
<p>The first four should all be inferred as being <code>NamedTuple</code> classes that inherit from <code>tuple[Unknown, Unknown, Unknown]</code>; the last two should both be inferred as being <code>NamedTuple</code> classes that inherit from <code>tuple[int, str]</code>.</p>
<p>There are some additional rules and restrictions about the functional syntax that are described at the bottom of https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/namedtuples.html#defining-named-tuples and at https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple</p>
