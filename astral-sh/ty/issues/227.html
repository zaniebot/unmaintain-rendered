            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently don't understand that classes like <code>class C(Any): ...</code> represent non-fully-static types. This is captured in the following TODO comment:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Retitled the issue to reflect the current state (we no longer have a <code>Type::is_fully_static</code> method, but I suspect we still treat nominal types that inherit from <code>Any</code> as participating in subtyping etc., which we probably still need to fix)</p>
