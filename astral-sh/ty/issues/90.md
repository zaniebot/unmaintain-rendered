# merge tracing setup for CLI and LSP

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-08-08 07:51_

With https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12730, I think we should merge the tracing setup which exists in `ty_server` into the main setup.

We should also add tracing span to the requests that have been sent by the server.
