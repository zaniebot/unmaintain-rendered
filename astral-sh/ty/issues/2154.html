            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently for this file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import overload

class A:
    @overload
    def f(self) -&gt; int: ...
    @overload
    def f(self, x: str) -&gt; str: ...
    @overload
    def f(self, x: str, y: str) -&gt; bytes: ...
    def f(self, x=&quot;foo&quot;, y=&quot;bar&quot;):
        raise NotImplementedError

class B(A):
    @overload
    def f(self) -&gt; int: ...
    @overload
    def f(self, y: str) -&gt; str: ...
    @overload
    def f(self, x: str, y: str) -&gt; bytes: ...
    def f(self, x=&quot;foo&quot;, y=&quot;bar&quot;):
        raise NotImplementedError
</code></pre>
<p>we emit this diagnostic:</p>
<p><img width="1410" height="746" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc95379-7305-4abd-a2ec-b221184b59aa" /></p>
<p>which is extremely confusing, because from the code frame we show you'd think that the subclass method has exactly the same signature as the superclass method.</p>
<p>The issue here is that the second overload of the subclass method has a different parameter name to the second overload of the superclass method. Ideally we'd say exactly that, but that's very hard without https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/163. In the meantime we should just print the first <code>N</code> overloads as part of the diagnostic, the same as mypy does, and the same as we do for other diagnostics such as <code>no-matching-overload</code>.</p>
