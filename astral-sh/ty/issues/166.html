<p>If I understand correctly, you are describing a case like this?</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Protocol, final

class A(Protocol):

<p>In this case it does seem intuitive to me to enforce Liskov between <code>B</code> and <code>A</code> (and thus error on <code>B</code> redefining <code>x</code> to <code>str</code>), because it ensures that the structural type <code>B</code> is assignable to the structural type <code>A</code>. This isn&#x27;t <em>necessary</em>, but I think it matches the usual intuition for what inheritance means.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m also not sure why the <code>@final</code> on <code>B</code> actually matters here; I think the arguments for and against requiring <code>B</code> to match <code>A</code> are the same whether or not <code>B</code> is final?</p>

<p>Hmm, this example shows that it isn&#x27;t as easy as I initially thought, so I&#x27;ll try to explain a bit better what I&#x27;m trying to say here.</p>
<p>One of the use-cases I had in mind, is this one</p>
<pre><code>@final
class Unhashable(Protocol):
    __hash__: ClassVar[None]
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#x27;d enforce LSP here, then the <code>__hash__</code> definition would be flagged as an LSP violation. But because this protocol 1) cannot be instantiated, and 2) cannot be subclassed, I was thinking that this LSP violation will never lead to type-safe unsafe situation.</p>
<p>But your example shows that these 2 conditions are not sufficient to guarantee type-safety in the absence of LSP — an additional condition is required.</p>
<hr>
<p>So how about this:</p>
<p><em>The LSP does not apply to a method or attribute of a final <code>Protocol</code> when it directly overrides a member of <code>object</code>, and only of <code>object</code>.</em></p>
<p>Another way to think about it, is that final protocols behave as if they don&#x27;t have <code>object</code> as a base class.</p>
<hr>
<p>To illustrate, let&#x27;s squash our examples, and apply the updated conditions:</p>
<pre><code>class A(Protocol):
    x: int

@final
class UnhashableAndHasX(A, Protocol):
    __hash__: ClassVar[None]  # LSP doesn&#x27;t apply =&gt; accept
    x: str                    # LSP applies       =&gt; reject
</code></pre>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In principle, every Python object is an instance of <code>object</code>, and the API surface of<code>object</code> must be true for every Python object.</p>
<p>Thus, in principle, a protocol that isn&#x27;t Liskov compatible with <code>object</code> is useless and describes a type that has no inhabitants (equivalent to <code>Never</code>).</p>
<p>However, as we know, for pragmatic/historical reasons, unfortunately the description of <code>object</code> in typeshed claims some things to be true which are not actually true for all Python objects, and causes Liskov violations in some situations.</p>
<p>But IMO this means that this is not an issue related specifically to Protocol or structural typing (because, for the <em>accurate</em> parts of the typeshed <code>object</code> definition, there is no value in, or need for, any special case for structural types). Thus I wouldn&#x27;t support a general rule about Protocols and Liskov compatibility with <code>object</code>, because if we assumed a fully accurate typeshed <code>object</code>, that would be a useless / nonsensical rule.</p>
<p>Rather, this is an issue of how we handle Liskov for a few particular attributes of <code>object</code> (like <code>__hash__</code>) that are described wrongly in typeshed. I think the problem is specific to those problem attributes, but is not specific to Protocol; it is just as much a problem for non-Protocol inheritance as for Protocol inheritance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@vlashada our Liskov checks are working as intended here. Currently, we view any function lacking an explicit return-type annotation as implicitly returning <code>Any</code>/<code>Unknown</code> (the two concepts are equivalent), and <code>Any</code>/<code>Unknown</code> are assignable to all types, including <code>str</code>. This may change if <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/128">astral-sh/ty#128</a> is implemented, but until then you can prevent this unsoundness by enforcing <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-annotations-ann">Ruff&#x27;s <code>ANN</code> rules</a> on your code base</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @Paul-B98 ,</p>
<p>This is an example of unsafe code that this check is intended to catch. If D is a subtype of C, that means anywhere you annotate as C it should be safe to pass a D. But if C&#x27;s method accepts A and D&#x27;s method accepts only B, that&#x27;s not safe: code that thinks it has a C (but actually has a D at runtime) might try to pass an A to that method, which will blow up as D is only expecting instances of B as argument to that method.</p>
<p>In general, when you override a method, the parameters of the subclass version need to accept everything the base class method accepts (or more -- but not less). So it&#x27;s safe to have the base class accept B and the subclass accept A, but not the other way around.</p>
<p>So your options here are either to write your code differently, or if you are ok with the potential unsafety, use a <code># ty: ignore</code> comment, or globally disable the invalid method override check.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @carljm, thanks for the clarification. How would this change if C were to become a protocol or an abstract base class (with an abstract method)? Would it make sense to have the option to create a minimal type for that &quot;interface&quot;, or should I simply remove the type and define it in the subclasses?</p>
</div>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/carljm">@carljm</a> on 2025-12-08 18:00</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Paul-B98 The core issue here doesn&#x27;t change at all if C is a protocol or abstract base class. For the type <code>C</code> to be safely usable as an annotation, all subtypes of <code>C</code> that override <code>test</code> must override it with a signature that is a subtype of the signature defined by <code>C.test</code>, which requires that the signature can accept any calls accepted by the signature of <code>C.test</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;option to create a minimal type for that interface.&quot; You do have that option, the problem is that if you define the minimal interface as &quot;has a method <code>test</code> which accepts an instance of <code>A</code>&quot;, then a type which has a method <code>test</code> which does not accept any instance of <code>A</code>, is simply not a type which implements that interface: <code>D</code> in your example above does not implement the interface of <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>So yes, if you want <code>D.test</code> to only accept <code>B</code> instances, and a hypothetical <code>E.test</code> to only accept <code>B2</code> instances (where <code>E</code> is a subclass of <code>C</code> or implements the <code>C</code> interface and <code>B2</code> is another subclass of <code>A</code>), then the only way to make that type-safe is to remove the <code>test</code> method from the interface defined by <code>C</code> entirely. That eliminates the problem, because it means that code using an instance <code>c</code> of type <code>C</code> won&#x27;t be able to unsafely call <code>c.test(...)</code> blithely assuming it can pass any <code>A</code> as argument.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Paul-B98, one option you might consider is to make your abstract base class generic, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class Abstract[T: A]:
    def test(self, state: T) -&gt; None:
        pass

class Concrete(Abstract[B]):
    def test(self, state: B) -&gt; None:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you&#x27;re using Python &lt;3.12:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;, bound=&quot;A&quot;)

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class Abstract(Generic[T]):
    def test(self, state: T) -&gt; None:
        pass

class Concrete(Abstract[B]):
    def test(self, state: B) -&gt; None:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>All major type checkers agree that this does not violate the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>
