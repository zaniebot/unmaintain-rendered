            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Feature request: Support runtime type checking</p>
<p>Provide an easy way for end users to enable type checking in such a way that no separate build/lint step is needed.</p>
<p>One way to provide this is to have a wrapper binary (or -mty.runtime) around python which always type check code before running it, perhaps via a sys.meta_path hook.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the issue! This is a complicated topic, and supporting this use case is well out of scope for ty right now, unfortunately. For now, you might consider using one of the pre-existing frameworks for doing this kind of thing, which all have their pros and cons. Some of the more popular ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/agronholm/typeguard</li>
<li>https://github.com/beartype/beartype</li>
<li>https://github.com/davidfstr/trycast</li>
</ul>
<p>If we were to add something like this in the future, it would probably look more similar to <a href="https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc">mypyc</a> rather than one of the above frameworks, though: this would also provide potentially big speedups, but at the cost of some dynamic features that Python typically provides and that type checkers can&#x27;t support.</p>
<p>Since a mypyc-style compiler is already discussed in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/283">astral-sh/ty#283</a>, I&#x27;ll close this in favour of that issue</p>
