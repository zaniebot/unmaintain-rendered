            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Two <code>unused-ignore-comment</code> diagnostics are enough to take up most of my monitor with my terminal full screen. It feels like the rendering of the autofix doesn't add much on top of what the primary annotation shows:</p>

</details>

<p>But if anything, I think I'd actually prefer to keep the autofix rendering and get rid of the primary annotation? It's definitely useful information to know that there is an autofix, and I love that the diff rendering shows me exactly how to fix the diagnostic even I don't want to opt into autofixes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure I fully agree. I do think it's useful to highlight the unused comment, especially if the code spawns multiple lines.</p>
<p>This is also a more general discussion on how we want to render fixes/primary annotations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It might just be that our context windows are too big for the fix rendering? I don't find this diagnostic from rustc to be nearly as verbose, and it's basically doing the same thing as our diagnostics but with much smaller context windows:</p>
