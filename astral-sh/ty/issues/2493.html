<p>Playground: https://play.ty.dev/6143bcb7-6aa9-405d-ba62-33a4ea7e764d</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from collections.abc import Sequence

type JsonType_RO = int | Sequence[str]


def encode_a(value: JsonType_RO) -&gt; None:
    if isinstance(value, Sequence):
        sequence_value: Sequence[str] = value

def encode_b(value: JsonType_RO) -&gt; None:
    if isinstance(value, Sequence[str]):
        sequence_value: Sequence[str] = value
</code></pre>
<p>Errors:</p>
<pre><code>Object of type `(int &amp; Sequence[object]) | Sequence[str]` is not assignable to `Sequence[str]` (invalid-assignment) [Ln 8, Col 41]
Object of type `JsonType_RO` is not assignable to `Sequence[str]` (invalid-assignment) [Ln 12, Col 41]
</code></pre>
<p>The main case is <code>encode_a</code>. I'd expect <code>value</code> to be narrowed to <code>Sequence[str]</code>, but that's not the case. As far as I could find, that should be valid typing. I tried to find some related issue, but no luck with search.</p>
<p><code>encode_b</code> is just an attempt to investigate further, but it's interesting how that causes ty to not narrow at all.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! This is basically the same as #1578. ty is warning you here that it's entirely possible for an object to be an instance of both <code>int</code> and <code>Sequence</code> simultaneously: they're not disjoint types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&gt;&gt;&gt; from typing import Sequence
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(int, Sequence): ...
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can fix the diagnostic here by using <code>if not isinstance(value, int)</code> instead of <code>if isinstance(value, Sequence)</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a way to annotate that such subclass of <code>int</code> is not allowed? In the actual use in my code base it does already <code>if isinstance(value, int)</code>, but the actual type is <code>int | Mapping[str, JsonType_RO] | Sequence[JsonType_RO]</code> and adding a <code>not isinstance(value, Mapping)</code> doesn't work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, Python's type system doesn't currently support a way to annotate &quot;exact types&quot;, and we don't have any extensions to the type system for that currently in ty. Such types would unfortunately not be very useful unless you used them <em>everywhere</em>, but in most cases it isn't desirable to distinguish between &quot;any instance of <code>T</code>&quot;, and &quot;any object that is an instance of <em>exactly</em> <code>T</code>&quot;. So I think the use cases for types like this would actually turn out to be pretty limited, unfortunately.</p>
<p>If you're willing to use the <code>ty_extensions</code> module, you could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from ty_extensions import Intersection, Not
from collections.abc import Sequence

type JsonType_RO = Intersection[int, Not[Sequence[object]]] | Sequence[str]


def encode_a(value: JsonType_RO) -&gt; None:
    if isinstance(value, Sequence):
        sequence_value: Sequence[str] = value
</code></pre>
<p>But note that the ty_extensions module doesn't actually exist at runtime right now; you need to import it in an <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> block if you want to use it in a <code>.py</code> file.</p>
<p>I'm curious to know more about this, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>adding a <code>not isinstance(value, Mapping)</code> doesn't work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why doesn't that work in this case for you? Can you give another minimal example? :-)</p>
