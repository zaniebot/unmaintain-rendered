            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>We don&#x27;t emit a diagnostic on this snippet... but we should, because <code>_T_co</code> is not defined 😆</p>
<pre><code>class SupportsNext:
    def __next__(self) -&gt; _T_co:
        raise NotImplementedError
</code></pre>
<p>We infer <code>_T_co</code> as being available here because of its definition in <code>builtins.pyi</code> <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/07b69ab9e92dbe4ca55c48b1c23ebf34b41538f1/stdlib/builtins.pyi#L83">here</a>. But that definition should be treated as private-to-the-stub, I think.</p>
<p>Possibly we should just filter out typevar definitions when falling back to the builtin scope in name lookup? The same could also be said for type-alias definitions and protocol definitions in <code>builtins.pyi</code>, but they&#x27;re arguably both more useful and less confusing to have available (you might want to use them quoted in type annotations, e.g. <code>x: &quot;_PositiveInteger&quot;</code> wouldn&#x27;t be an unreasonable type annotation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pyrefly, mypy and pyright all filter out all &quot;type-check-only&quot; symbols (private type aliases, private typevars/paramspecs/typevartuples, private protocols) from the builtins fallback:</p>
<pre><code>reveal_type(_PositiveInteger)  # mypy, pyright, pyrefly: &quot;`_PositiveInteger` is undefined&quot;
reveal_type(_T_co)  # mypy, pyright, pyrefly: &quot;`_T_co` is undefined&quot;
reveal_type(_SupportsSynchronousAnext)  # mypy, pyright, pyrefly: &quot;`_T_co` is undefined&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Mypy and pyrefly allow you to use these types if you explicitly import them, however, whereas pyright just views them as entirely private to the stub:</p>
<pre><code># pyright: ❌, mypy/pyrefly: ✅
from builtins import _PositiveInteger, _T_co, _SupportsSynchronousAnext
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;d prefer to go with mypy/pyrefly&#x27;s behaviour here:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#x27;d rather not treat the <code>builtins</code> module differently to any other <code>.pyi</code> module when it comes to explicitly imported symbols</li>
<li>I think it&#x27;s often useful to import typeshed&#x27;s protocols/aliases in <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to forbid users from ever importing these type-check-only symbols in <code>.py</code> files</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems reasonable. I&#x27;m assuming that this would still take <code>__all__</code> into account like if the <code>_T_co</code> variable isn&#x27;t included in the <code>__all__</code> of <code>module.pyi</code> then it would still raise a diagnostic.</p>

<p>We don&#x27;t take <code>__all__</code> into account currently -- we only take <code>__all__</code> into account for symbols that are defined via imports in stub files. (These are always assumed to be private-to-the-stub unless they are included in <code>__all__</code> or they use a redundant alias.)</p>
<p>We could add a rule that says that these type-check-only symbols are treated as completely undefined if <code>__all__</code> exists and they&#x27;re not included in <code>__all__</code>. But again, I think that would end up being annoying if you have an explicit import of one of these symbols in an <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> block. And I&#x27;d prefer to keep our rules for <code>.py</code> files and <code>.pyi</code> files as consistent as possible -- we generally allow you to import something from a <code>.py</code> file, even if that symbol is not included in the <code>__all__</code> of that <code>.py</code> file.</p>
