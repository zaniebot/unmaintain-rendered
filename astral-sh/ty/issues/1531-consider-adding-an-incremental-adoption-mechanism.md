# Consider adding an incremental adoption mechanism

_Issue opened by @ewilazarus on 2025-11-12 16:53_

Hey coming from `mypy`, there's this https://github.com/orsinium-labs/mypy-baseline/ project that I have successfully used in an existing codebase to aid incremental type-checker adoption over time.

It would be great if `ty` could have something like this built-in!

- https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1074
- https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/913
