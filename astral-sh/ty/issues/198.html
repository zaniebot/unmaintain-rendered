            <div class="timeline-body">Description
<p>There are a number of extra error codes not enabled by default in mypy, many of which are very handy:</p>
<pre><code>enable_error_code = [
    &quot;deprecated&quot;,
    &quot;explicit-override&quot;,
    &quot;ignore-without-code&quot;,
    &quot;mutable-override&quot;,
    &quot;possibly-undefined&quot;,
    &quot;redundant-expr&quot;,
    &quot;redundant-self&quot;,
    &quot;truthy-bool&quot;,
    &quot;truthy-iterable&quot;,
    &quot;unimported-reveal&quot;,
    &quot;unused-awaitable&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>It would be useful for these to be reimplemented under <code>ruff</code>/<code>red-knot</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>Just skimming through. To me it seems that most of them require multifile analysis to be useful and Ruff doesn&#x27;t support that yet. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m inclined to close the issue as it isn&#x27;t actionable until we implement multifile analysis (which we&#x27;re working on but it isn&#x27;t just around the corner).</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also likely that we implement some of those checks as part of red-knot, our work-in progress type checkers.</p>

<p>Sorry - yes - this was intended as raising interest w.r.t. that work rather than as lint rules for ruff (and for tracking).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this issue is too broad for it to be useful for us right now, and many will be covered by work we plan to do as part of other issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>deprecated</code>: this is covered by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/153">astral-sh/ty#153</a></li>
<li><code>explicit-override</code>: this is covered by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/155">astral-sh/ty#155</a></li>
<li><code>mutable-override</code>: we plan to do this as part of our implementation of the Liskov Substitution Principle (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/166">astral-sh/ty#166</a>)</li>
<li><code>possibly-undefined</code>: this is already implemented (though it is currently disabled-by-default)</li>
<li><code>unimported-reveal</code>: this is already implemented</li>
</ul>
<p>It could be useful to add an issue per error code for the remaining ones, but they all seem like relatively low priority for us right now. I won&#x27;t object if you want to do that, but I won&#x27;t take it on myself ;)</p>

<p>No worries. I may do in the future, but may as well wait to see how things develop and what the gaps are later 🙂</p>
