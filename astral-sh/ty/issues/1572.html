            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Apologies if this question has already been answered, I searched but couldn't find it.)</p>
<p>Is there a way to get a typed AST from <code>ty</code>? Ideally from a Rust API using ty as a library.</p>
<p>Similarly, is there any plan to release ty as a crate? Or any examples of people using that way today?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There is currently no way to get a typed AST, no. ty does not build a typed AST internally, so this would need to be built as a new public interface.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There is currently no plan to release any of the crates that ty uses, and I'm not aware of any projects that use ty's crates, except for the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/main/crates/ruff_python_parser">parser</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/main/crates/ruff_python_ast">untyped AST</a> which ty shares with ruff (see e.g. here how to use them as a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/pyrefly/blob/03131fd1c7fea035d07a219d00c26ac793efd27b/pyrefly/Cargo.toml#L46-L47">Git dependency</a>).</p>

<p>We do have an API (<code>SemanticModel</code>) for querying a type for any given AST node, which is sort of the same thing.</p>
<p>But yeah, none of this is supported for external use, or planned for release as a crate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks both, this is very helpful. I'm fine with git dependencies.</p>
<p>If I wanted to use ty as a Rust library but get type errors back as text (ultimately to send to an LLM), any idea how hard that would be, or if there's any prior art?</p>
