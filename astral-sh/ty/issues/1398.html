            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Here&#x27;s the project topology:</p>
<pre><code>myproject/
├─ src/
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  ├─ utils.py
│  └─ something.py
├─ tests/
└─ pyproject.toml
</code></pre>
<p>with <code>something.py</code> importing like <code>from .utils import utilityfunc</code>.</p>
<p><code>ty</code> doesn&#x27;t like that at all. debugging gives:</p>
<pre><code>2025-10-19T18:52:58.723460Z DEBUG ty_python_semantic::types::infer::builder: Relative module resolution `.utils` failed: too many leading dots
    at crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/infer/builder.rs:5010 on ThreadId(2)
    in ty_project::check_file with file=file(Id(c00))
    in ty_project::Project::check

</code></pre>
<p>So i guess <code>ty</code> finds the src directory and thinks it&#x27;s gone one time up too many.</p>
<p>Is there any way to support this project layout ?</p>
<p>(of course creating a subdir src/myproject or renaming src to myproject &quot;fixes&quot; the issue)</p>
Version
<p>ty 0.0.1-alpha.23 (5c51b8480 2025-10-16)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The issue here is that ty has spotted you have an <code>src</code> directory and assumed that you&#x27;re therefore using the standard <code>src</code> layout. As a result, it&#x27;s added <code>./src</code> as an import search path as well as the project root <code>.</code>, and <code>./src</code> takes precedence over <code>.</code> when resolving the import in <code>./src/something.py</code> because <code>./src/something.py</code> is relative to both paths, but <code>./src</code> is a subdirectory of <code>.</code>.</p>
<p>You can change ty&#x27;s behaviour here by specifying <code>tool.ty.environment.root = [&quot;.&quot;]</code> in your pyproject.toml file (https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/configuration/#root).</p>
<p>However, I would advise against this layout! This isn&#x27;t really an &quot;almost-<code>src</code> layout&quot; -- it&#x27;s the &quot;flat layout&quot;, but your package happens to have the name <code>src</code>. That means that an <code>src</code> package will be directly importable from the root of your project, which seems like it&#x27;s probably not what you&#x27;d want. I&#x27;m curious what build backend your using; I&#x27;d imagine this would confuse packaging tools as well as ty :-)</p>

<p>Thanks ! That actually does the trick.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I get what you mean. But actually this is a project with a long history, that is <em>always</em> installed as a deb package, so this is not an issue we can encounter (except when trying to run linters on the tests directory…)</p>

<p>dh-build, and it looks like it doesn&#x27;t have any issues with this layout. I think we manually describe which files goes where in the final package, that&#x27;s probably why ;)</p>

<p>Well i&#x27;ve been using pyright, mypy and other linting / type checking tools and they don&#x27;t have any issue with the current layout of the project. Maybe that&#x27;s something they detect and adapt to ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some other type checker implement a fallback where they do a relative search from the importing module. I think we&#x27;ll implement this behavior too, for better out-of-the-box IDE experience but there are a few drawbacks and we have to think how we can inform users that the fallback behavior is applied</p>
