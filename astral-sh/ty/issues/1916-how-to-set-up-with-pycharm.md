# How to set up with PyCharm?

---

_Issue opened by @joconal-atlassian on 2025-12-16 06:26_

### Question

I've read the documentation saying that I should just go to Python -> Tools -> ty, but I don't see that option in my IDE.

I'm running the latest version of PyCharm (2025.3) - I also tried upgrading to the RC1 of 2025.3.1, to no avail.

### Version

ty 0.0.1-alpha.34 (ef3d48ac4 2025-12-12)

I'm not sure why but your menu is much lighter than mine .Do you use the paid or unpaid offering?

According to the 'Manage Subscriptions' information, I am using a Pro subscription.

Turns out I had disabled the bundled Python plugin for some reason. Re-enabling that has fixed it.
