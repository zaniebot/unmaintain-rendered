            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Inlay hint feature is super useful in the area of active line, but when it is activated everywhere, it makes code kind of messy and in my opinion sometimes harder to read. It would be great if it can be displayed only near active line of coding, and not in other lines. similar idea from <code>Error Lens</code> extension:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the idea.</p>
<p>I'm not sure this is something that's in ty's control. ty is based on the language server specification and uses the inlay hint request to provide the inlays https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_inlayHint and it doesn't contain any information about where in the code the user currently is.</p>
<p>That means, only showing the active inlays is something that the client would have to do (in your case VS code?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this would part of the client implementation because the client knows where the cursor is and will be able to restrict the range in which to request inlay hints for.</p>
