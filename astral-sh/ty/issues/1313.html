            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have some user-triggerable cases that we just don't want to support at all (e.g. a custom typeshed without <code>object</code>), and want to just fail with an error. Currently we do this by panicking, but this emits an error message indicating that there's a bug in ty, which isn't the case here. We should have another way to &quot;fatal error&quot; that doesn't emit the &quot;this is a bug in ty, please report it&quot; message.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could consider panicking (unwinding) with a <code>Diagnostic</code> type that we than handle differently from other panics</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Leaving this out of stable for now; doesn't seem like we need to prioritize it unless we start getting a lot of bug reports about these &quot;not a bug&quot; panic cases.</p>
