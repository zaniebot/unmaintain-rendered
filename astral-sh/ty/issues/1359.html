            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Most of the time the feature with the type hints is very useful so for sure I don't want to deactivate that also not for single files. Unfortunately I just found the instructions how to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to deactivate type hints for single lines?</strong></p>
<p>For example like with the error messages for one line with # ty:ignore</p>
<p>In the attached image one can see the issue with some of the type hints:</p>

<p>I copied a &quot;1&quot; for 500 times, that line was slightly longer than the hint...</p>
<p><img width="366" height="125" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/216e59f0-a38b-4a37-9b1b-06a1c8087516" /></p>
<p><strong>Would be amazing if you can tell me how to do that or include this feature if it wasn't me who missed something in the documentation.</strong>
(I use v0.0.1a22 in neovim installed with mason v2.1.0)</p>
<p>Already now I like ty much more than pywright which is already uninstalled.
uv, ruff, ty - you guys are amazing 👍🏻</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this doesn't look very useful. There's no option to disable inlays for a single line. We should avoid rendering too long inlays, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/494</p>
