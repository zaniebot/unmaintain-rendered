            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a situation that I run into around once a year when copy/pasting code between projects. Sometimes a newly made file will be missing the <code>.py</code> extension, so despite looking correct and even having syntax highlighting thanks to VSCode recognizing it as a python file, it doesn&#x27;t work for seemingly no reason. It would be nice if ty gave an additional note in this case since tracking it down can be extremely frustrating.

<pre><code>PS ~\ty_issues&gt;echo &quot;import module&quot; &gt; main.py
PS ~\ty_issues&gt;echo &quot;&quot; &gt; module  # Note the missing .py extension
PS ~\ty_issues&gt;uvx ty check
error[unresolved-import]: Cannot resolve imported module `module`
 --&gt; main.py:1:8

1 | import module

info: Searched in the following paths during module resolution:
# Paths omitted for brevity
Found 1 diagnostic
PS ~\ty_issues&gt;echo &quot;&quot; &gt; module.py  # On fixing the extension everything works fine again
PS ~\ty_issues&gt;uvx ty check
All checks passed!

<p>The help could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>error[unresolved-import]: Cannot resolve imported module `module`
 --&gt; main.py:1:8
  |
1 | import module
  |        ^^^^^^

help: Found matching file named `module`, but it is not importable due to missing `.py` extension

<p>It would also be extra-extra nice if that help also showed up in the on-hover-error-display in VSC.</p>
