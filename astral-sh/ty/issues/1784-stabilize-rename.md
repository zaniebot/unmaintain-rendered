# Stabilize rename

---

_@MichaReiser_

I'm not aware of any issue that ty renames too much or the wrong thing. All known issues are about ty missing references

Even a partial rename is more useful than having to rename everything by hand and clients union the results if they're connected to multiple LSP.

That's why I think we should remove the experimental gating
