            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>ty fails to detect when a <code>Final</code> class attribute is overridden by a property in a subclass while other type checkers detect it correctly. I have tested this code on various type checkers including: <code>zuban</code>, <code>pyrefly</code>, <code>ty</code>, and <code>mypy</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Final

class Parent:
    id: Final[str] = &quot;xyz&quot;

class Child(Parent):
    @property
    def id(self) -&gt; str:  # Overriding Final
        return &quot;abc&quot;

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    print(Child().id)
</code></pre>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ty 0.0.1-alpha.23</p>
<p>This issue might be worth taking a look at in my point of view!</p>

<p>Sorry for that, I have pasted the wrong code example since I have more. The correct title should be: Ty allows Final class attribute to be overridden by property</p>
<p>I have changed it to the correct title. Sorry for the confusion!</p>
