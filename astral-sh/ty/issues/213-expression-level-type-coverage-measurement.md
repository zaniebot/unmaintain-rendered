# expression-level type coverage measurement

---

_Issue opened by @carljm on 2025-01-23 17:17_

### Description

Real-world type-checker users often want to get a sense of how well-covered their code is with static types. One granular way to measure this is "percentage of expressions typed with a dynamic type".

We would also have an internal use case for measuring "percentage of expressions typed with a Todo type" as a measure of red-knot progress.
