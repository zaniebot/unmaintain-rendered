            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We currently emit a diagnostic when an invalid <code>types.UnionType</code> instance is used as the second argument to <code>isinstance()</code> or <code>issubclass()</code>. But we do not currently detect this if the <code>types.UnionType</code> instance is nested inside a tuple.</p>
<p>It's probably not high-priority to fix this because I'm not sure why you'd write code like this, but it's a known edge case that we don't handle currently, so it seemed worth opening an issue about.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Literal

    if isinstance(x, str | Literal[42]):  # diagnostic (good! this fails at runtime)
        reveal_type(x)

    if isinstance(x, (int, str | Literal[42])):  # no diagnostic
        reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Unknown

    if isinstance(x, (int, (str, (bytes, memoryview | Literal[42])))):  # no diagnostic

<p>Hmm, I think that's actually a separate issue relating to us not understanding recursive type aliases properly yet? Currently we infer the type of <code>isinstance()</code> as being</p>
<pre><code>def isinstance(obj: object, class_or_tuple: type | UnionType | tuple[Divergent, ...], /) -&gt; bool
</code></pre>
<p>But ideally we would understand <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/416e2267daaf9699c26ec73c644a03356e3de7f2/crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/stdlib/builtins.pyi#L3736-L3739">this recursive PEP-613 type alias</a>, and that would lead us to flag <code>isinstance(42, (None,))</code> calls because <code>tuple[None]</code> is not assignable to <code>tuple[_ClassInfo, ...]</code> (<code>None</code> is not an instance of <code>type</code>/<code>UnionType</code> or a tuple thereof.)</p>
<p>This issue is about something different (and it's lower-priority than the one you're talking about): even once we understand recursive type aliases, we <em>still</em> wouldn't flag the example I gave above, because <code>str | Literal[42]</code> <em>is</em> a <code>types.UnionType</code> instance (and therefore permitted according to typeshed's recursive type alias), it's just a <code>types.UnionType</code> instance with invalid elements in it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see - the diagnostic you're talking about here is not a failing assignability check to the parameter type in typeshed, it's an additional diagnostic we offer when special-casing <code>isinstance</code> calls, to mention if the PEP 604 union has invalid elements in it. So it's checking something that isn't expressible in the typeshed annotations, since <code>UnionType</code> doesn't express anything about the types of its elements. And that additional check doesn't recursively descend into tuples.</p>
<p>I'll probably just open a separate issue for recursive PEP 613 type aliases, with <code>isinstance</code> as an example case.</p>
