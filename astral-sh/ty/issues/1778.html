<p>Just as with traditional <code>TypeVars</code>, a user may include the same <code>ParamSpec</code> multiple times in the arguments of the same function, to indicate a dependency between multiple arguments. In these cases a type checker may choose to solve to a common behavioral supertype (i.e. a set of parameters for which all of the valid calls are valid in both of the subtypes), but is not obligated to do so.</p>
<p>Ref: https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/generics.html#semantics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21445 does not add this functionality but it seems good to have.</p>
