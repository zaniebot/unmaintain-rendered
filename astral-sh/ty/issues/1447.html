            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>KnownFunction</code> lets us detect particular functions that need to be handled specially in our type inference logic. We use this for things like <code>is_subtype_of</code>, to implement &quot;evaluation&quot; rules that are visible in the inferred return type of the function.</p>
<p>With our constraint set work, <code>ty_extensions</code> is become more complex, and now has a <code>ConstraintSet</code> type that we use in some return type annotations, and which has overridden dunder method for things like rich comparison and <code>bool</code> coercion.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/96b60c11d9efbfbf97faa5394fc3f7cb0a5c40c5/crates/ty_vendored/ty_extensions/ty_extensions.pyi#L45-L59">some functions</a> that would ideally be implemented as methods on <code>ConstraintSet</code>. (And <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21010#discussion_r2464978109">more</a> are in the works!) But those are currently implemented as top-level functions in the <code>ty_extensions</code> module, since that is what works with our <code>KnownFunction</code> machinery.</p>
<p>It would be nice to extend <code>KnownFunction</code> to work with class methods too.</p>

<p>Ah that looks perfect, thank you! I had been looking mostly in <code>class.rs</code>, thinking that I would need to hook into <code>own_class_member</code>.</p>
