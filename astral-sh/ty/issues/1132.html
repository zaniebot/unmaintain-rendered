<p>Code for reproduction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import typing

a: typing.Hashable = &quot;GOOD&quot;
a: typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable] = [&quot;GOOD&quot;]
a: typing.Hashable | typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable] = &quot;GOOD&quot;
a: typing.Hashable | typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable] = [&quot;FAILS&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>ty==0.0.1a19</code> it passes but with <code>ty==0.0.1a20</code> the last line fails:</p>
<pre><code>error[invalid-assignment]: Object of type `list[@Todo]` is not assignable to `Hashable`
 --&gt; x.py:6:1
  |
4 | a: typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable] = [&quot;GOOD&quot;]
5 | a: typing.Hashable | typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable] = &quot;GOOD&quot;
6 | a: typing.Hashable | typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable] = [&quot;FAILS&quot;]
  | ^
  |
info: rule `invalid-assignment` is enabled by default
</code></pre>
<p>If I change <code>Hashable</code> to <code>str</code> or <code>Sequence</code> to <code>list</code> then it works. But <code>typing.Hashable | typing.Sequence[typing.Hashable]</code> is a common type in Pandas. E.g. https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/3c14b71c8f965ff316b22dfb3d87839361f55297/pandas/core/frame.py#L6319 I'm not sure how to call those methods with <code>ty==0.0.1a20</code> if I want to pass in a list of strings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report!</p>
<p>The issue here is that <code>Sequence[Hashable]</code> is (according to all normal rules!) a subtype of <code>Hashable</code>: <code>object</code> defines a <code>__hash__</code> method, therefore <code>object</code> is <code>Hashable</code>; and <code>Sequence[Hashable]</code> is a subtype of <code>object</code>, which therefore means that <code>Sequence[Hashable]</code> is also <code>Hashable</code>. The fact that <code>Sequence[Hashable]</code> is a subtype of <code>Hashable</code> means that the union <code>Sequence[Hashable] | Hashable</code> is redundant; ty eagerly simplifies this union to simply <code>Hashable</code>.</p>
<p>Since all types in Python are subtypes of <code>object</code>, and <code>object</code> is a subtype of <code>Hashable</code>, this implies that all objects in Python are subtypes of <code>Hashable</code>, which is... absurd -- that's obviously not true! This is a tough problem to solve, however, since the rules around hashability in Python disobey all normal rules a type checker generally assumes when inferring types and checking code. Unhashable classes often inherit from hashable classes, and hashable classes often inherit from unhashable classes; this all deeply violates the Liskov Substitution Principle. There's a comment to this effect in typeshed's stubs here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/7ee863b6d7df2757a16dbbff59ca5a04b993d57a/crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/stdlib/typing.pyi#L869-L875</p>
<p>The problematic nature of <code>Hashable</code> affects ty much more severely than it affects other type checkers, because of the fact that ty will eagerly simplify redundant unions; other type checkers generally only simplify unions lazily. If we left the union unsimplified here, we would recognize <code>list[str]</code> as being a subtype of <code>Sequence[Hashable] | Hashable</code> -- it is a subtype of the first element of the union but not the second, even though the first is a subtype of the second. (Subtyping is not necessarily transitive when the Liskov principle is violated!) We're considering doing less eager union simplification in some situations; that might help this issue. Another possible solution here is to eagerly simplify <code>Hashable</code> to <code>object</code> (since both types -- in theory -- represent the set of all possible Python objects, they're the same type under all normal rules!). That would fix the false positive here (<code>list[str]</code> will easily be recognised by ty as a subtype of <code>object</code>), but might produce some unexpected behaviour in other situations.</p>
<p>I also really wish pandas would use <code>Hashable</code> less in their annotations, though... even if we fix this behaviour in ty so that we have more intuitive behaviour, there's no way to use <code>Hashable</code> in a type annotation that won't cause unfortunate surprises and unexpected behaviour in some situations. I've had this conversation with them <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-pyi/issues/283#issuecomment-1248095891">before</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think in the short term we should simplify <code>Hashable</code> to <code>object</code>. That is correct, according to the definitions of <code>object</code> and <code>Hashable</code>. That should eliminate false positives from this issue. What it gives up is type-checking of things actually being hashable, but the whole idea that the Python type system can safely provide that today is a lie anyway.</p>
