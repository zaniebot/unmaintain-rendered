            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I have two examples of this issue, not a new problem in ty, happened for as long as I&#x27;ve used it in the last few months.</p>
<pre><code>from dateutil import rrule  # type: ignore

class A:
    def rrule(cls) -&gt; rrule.rrule:  # Function `rrule` has no attribute `rrule` (unresolved-attribute)
        ...
</code></pre>
<pre><code>from dateutil.rrule import rrule  # type: ignore

class A:
    def rrule(cls) -&gt; rrule:  # Variable of type `def rrule(cls) -&gt; Unknown` is not allowed in a type expression (invalid-type-form)
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>In playground: https://play.ty.dev/f820338c-0294-4a14-a04f-3a805b70e369</p>
<p>I can see how it could be considered intentional behavior, but I don&#x27;t know if it is for ty, so I&#x27;m bringing it up. Thanks in advance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is the same as #580 (and I think there was another clearer issue but couldn&#x27;t find it <code>:/</code>)</p>
<p>This happens because with the 3.14 possibly differed name semantics, the <code>rrule</code> annotation will always resolve to a class member first before the global import.</p>
