            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have lots of rules that complain about invalid method overrides of one sort or another, and we'll be adding more in the future. The <code>invalid-method-override</code> rule is specifically about Liskov violations, but its name doesn't reflect that currently. <code>unsound-method-override</code> might be better, though it's still not great. Maybe <code>incompatible-method-override</code>?</p>
