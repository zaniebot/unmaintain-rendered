            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Many of our problems with understanding implicit type aliases (particularly generic ones) are ultimately based in our conflation of value types and type-expression types for names. Many of these problems would be solved by separating these. This would mean eliminating <code>Type::in_type_expression</code>. When we see a name used in a type expression, rather than resolving its type as a value expression and trying to re-interpret that type as a type expression, we could instead go through a separate resolution path for that name to resolve &quot;what it means as a type expression.&quot; This means that the RHS of an implicit type alias would be inferred twice, once as a value expression (in order to catch any runtime-invalid operations performed in it) and separately also (assuming it is ever used in a type expression) as a type expression.</p>
