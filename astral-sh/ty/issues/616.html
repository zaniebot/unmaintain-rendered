            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>mypy and pyright both support inferring this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">b = (-1) ** (1 / 2)

reveal_type(b) # revealed: complex
</code></pre>
<p>but we currently infer as int</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. The right-hand side here is evaluated by ty as being a value of type <code>float</code>, so a simpler repro is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">b = (-1) ** 0.5
reveal_type(b)
</code></pre>
<p>As with your repro, mypy and pyright both infer this correctly as <code>complex</code>, but ty infers it incorrectly as <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because of <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/8f5a80e7b741226e525bd90e45496b8f68dc69b6/stdlib/builtins.pyi#L385-L391">the overloads for <code>float.__rpow__</code></a>, which is the method that ends up being called to evaluate this operation. The first two overloads both use type aliases for their annotations. Unfortunately, we don't support old-style type aliases yet, so we end up inferring both aliases as <code>Todo</code>, which is assignable to anything. That means that we incorrectly pick the first <code>float.__rpow__</code> overload when we should be picking the second -- because we (incorrectly) think all three overloads are possible matches, we just pick the first one.</p>
<p>So this should get naturally fixed as soon as we support old-style type aliases.</p>
