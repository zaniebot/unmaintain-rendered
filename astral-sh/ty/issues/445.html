<p>Before opening an issue on this repository, note that ty is currently in preview and not ready for production use.</p>
<p>That said, we are very much interested in getting feedback. Before opening a new ticket, please search the issue tracker for existing issues. In particular, please take note of the following known ty issues that users are likely to run into on larger projects — if your issue is captured here, we're aware of it and there's no need to open a new issue.
