            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I expect the return value to be properly typed with no errors, because following the <code>if</code> condition, <code>res</code> should be known to be a <code>dict</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! We actually know too much about the type of <code>res</code> here -- we know not only that it is a dict, but also that it is always truthy (that is, not empty). In some cases this is useful; in this case it causes problems with invariant generics.</p>
<p>We should either eliminate <code>AlwaysFalsy</code> and <code>AlwaysTruthy</code> from unions/intersections when solving generics, or possibly always remove them from unions/intersections, after allowing them to possibly simplify away other types.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll try to address this. Let me explain my understanding and clarify the problem.</p>
<p>I don't think it's generally wrong to infer that <code>Data(foo=res)</code> is <code>Data[dict[Unknown, Unknown] &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy]</code>. My understanding is that it's okay for an instance of <code>dict[Unknown, Unknown] &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy</code> to be empty at some point. The type <code>dict[Unknown, Unknown] &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy</code> means &quot;the set of instances of <code>dict</code> <em>or its subclasses</em>, excluding those that <em>always</em> evaluate to <code>False</code>.&quot;
This is a type that can't be simplified any further, and is fundamentally different from <code>dict[Unknown, Unknown]</code> (Note that a subclass <code>SubDict[K, V]</code> of <code>dict[K, V]</code> created using class syntax satisfies <code>SubDict[K, V] &lt;: dict[K, V]</code> regardless of the variance of <code>K, V</code>). The problem is that this guarantee (<code>&amp; ~AlwaysFalsy</code>) is unnecessarily strong, and can't be discarded once typed.</p>
<p>One idea here is to use a type context to tell that the expected type here is <code>Data[dict[Unknown, Unknown]]</code>, disabling narrowing on <code>res</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I agree with your analysis. And I agree also that using the return type annotation as a type context for the <code>return</code> expression would help in this particular case. Though I think there are other cases where we don't have an immediate type context where we may get more intuitive results by discarding <code>&amp; AlwaysFalsy</code> or <code>&amp; AlwaysTruthy</code>.</p>
