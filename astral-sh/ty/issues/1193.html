            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Consider the following source code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f(x: int) -&gt; None: ...

def _(x: str):
    f(x)

def f(x: int) -&gt; None: ...

def f(x: int) -&gt; None: ...
</code></pre>
<p>I see the following diagnostics for the <code>f(x)</code> call:</p>
<pre><code>    Argument to function `f` is incorrect: Expected `int`, found `str` (invalid-argument-type) [Ln 4, Col 7]
    Argument to function `f` is incorrect: Expected `int`, found `str` (invalid-argument-type) [Ln 4, Col 7]
    Argument to function `f` is incorrect: Expected `int`, found `str` (invalid-argument-type) [Ln 4, Col 7]
</code></pre>
<p>Playground: https://play.ty.dev/8b8a0d58-1ba4-4bec-bb87-32179a6fa8e5</p>
<p>So, the number of diagnostics corresponds to the number of function definitions that exists which I think is because ty checks all function definitions. I think this is a bit confusing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, we consider the type of <code>f</code> within the nested scope to be the union of all reachable definitions in the outer scope, since it isn't feasible to do a full analysis of where in the outer control flow <code>_</code> could possibly be called. So I think this is really about more intelligent presentation of redundant-seeming errors in calls to union types. Though I'm not sure this specific example should motivate prioritization of those improvements; it seems like an unusual case.</p>
