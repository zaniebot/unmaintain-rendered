            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For example, in <a href="https://play.ty.dev/337ceb56-569f-4db8-aa55-f00b635b3be3">this snippet</a> we should not emit a <code>possibly-unresolved-reference</code> error on the use of <code>x</code> inside the <code>if</code> block, because we can only reach the inside of the <code>if</code> block in a case where the assignment expression has definitely executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def _(flag: bool, number: int):
    if flag and (x := number):
        reveal_type(x)
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that we disable <code>possibly-unresolved-reference</code> by default, so to reproduce this on the command line you'll have to use <code>--error possibly-unresolved-reference</code>.)</p>
<p>This was previously fixed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18010, but the fix caused a large performance regression in some cases (see https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/431 for details) and was reverted in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18150. So one useful way to approach this issue is to reapply the previous fix and explore the cause of the performance regression (and add a benchmark that would catch that regression in future.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just adding a quick note here that I'm currently doing a major rework of the visibility/reachability constraints system. I don't want to block work on this, but it would probably be more efficient to wait until #365 is resolved. And it might even make the implementation of this easier.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I reproduced the performance issue with a single file with 1000 <code>if x and y: ...</code> lines.
I found something that seems to fix the issue, but then I got #365 in the mdtest suit, so I stopped there. Maybe we should wait for #365 before putting extra work on this</p>
