            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ty normalizes its unions. It should, therefore, not be necessary to test for redundancy of elements in a union that&#x27;s being added to another union. At least if both unions were built using the same context.</p>
<p>I tried implementing this optimisation in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22071">astral-sh/ruff#22071</a> and the result looked promising but there were some ecosystem changes that I didn&#x27;t fully understand and I didn&#x27;t had the time to dive deep on figuring out what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>I think we should either give this optimization another try or build an understanding of why it isn&#x27;t correct.</p>
