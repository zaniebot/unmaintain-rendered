            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ty normalizes its unions. It should, therefore, not be necessary to test for redundancy of elements in a union that&#x27;s being added to another union. At least if both unions were built using the same context.</p>
<p>I tried implementing this optimisation in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22071">astral-sh/ruff#22071</a> and the result looked promising but there were some ecosystem changes that I didn&#x27;t fully understand and I didn&#x27;t had the time to dive deep on figuring out what&#x27;s going on.</p>
<p>I think we should either give this optimization another try or build an understanding of why it isn&#x27;t correct.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To clarify terminology: in ty, we use &quot;normalized&quot; to mean something more extreme, where a union has a fixed ordering and all types within it are also normalized. Unions in ty are not necessarily &quot;normalized&quot; by this definition -- most are not.</p>
<p>What is true of most unions in ty is that they are simplified -- redundant elements are removed. But this is not true of all unions: cycle normalization creates non-simplified unions (because simplification requires <code>has_relation_to</code> checks, which can then cause cycles in cycle handling...). So given that non-simplified unions can exist, I don&#x27;t think this optimization is currently safe. We would have to track an extra bit in every union marking whether it had already been simplified or not.</p>
