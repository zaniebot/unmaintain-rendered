# Support auto-fixing diagnostics

### Question

I've briefly explored using https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check for automatically fixing static type problems. 

Just wondering if there are plans to support this feature in `ty`? Thanks!

Yes, we want to support fixes long term, similar to Ruff in situations where it is possible. However, it's not our main focus for the initial stable release.
