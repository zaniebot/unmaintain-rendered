            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I work on a Django application and I use both ty and Pyright for type checking.</p>
<p>I need to ignore typing on <code>Meta</code> classes, otherwise Pyright complains about <em>reportIncompatibleVariableOverride</em>:</p>
<pre><code>    class Meta:  # type: ignore[reportIncompatibleVariableOverride]
</code></pre>
<p>But this comment triggers ty rule <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#unused-ignore-comment"><code>unused-ignore-comment</code></a> (<em>Unused blanket <code>type: ignore</code> directive</em>), incorrectly because the directive IS actually used, by Pyright.</p>
Version
<p>ty 0.0.11</p>

<p>Oh I&#x27;m so sorry I didn&#x27;t pay attention.</p>
<hr>
<p>That said, I would like to suggest an other behavior.</p>
<p>The <code>type: ignore</code> is actually handy because I don&#x27;t have to ignore both ty and Pyright rules.</p>
<p>I could ignore the ty rule with:</p>
<pre><code>class Meta:  # type: ignore[reportIncompatibleVariableOverride] # ty: ignore[unused-ignore-comment]
</code></pre>
<p>But the fact is the ty rule <code>reportIncompatibleVariableOverride</code> does not exist...</p>
<p>So does it make sense for you to trigger <code>unused-ignore-comment</code> only if it an actual ty rule AND it is not used?</p>
<p>And eventually add an other rule to check if <code>type:</code> is used with an unknown rule?</p>

<p>That&#x27;s exactly the feedback I was looking for :) Thank you. Yes, I think splitting the rules makes sense. We just didn&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any demand for it, that&#x27;s why we initially deferred it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s not clear to me exactly what behavior we intend to implement in this issue. What @lypwig proposes (basing the behavior of <code>unused-ignore-comment</code> on whether a code is used that we recognize or not, and then having a separate diagnostic for &quot;type: ignore with unknown code&quot;) does not sound to me like any behavior we&#x27;d previously discussed when we discussed &quot;splitting the rule.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, sorry. I didn&#x27;t read the response carefully enough.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable with that because it assumes that no two type checkers have overlapping rule names.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is that we make it a separate rule so that projects using multiple type checkers can disable the <code>type: ignore</code> one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And eventually add an other rule to check if type: is used with an unknown rule?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this would work if you use multiple type checkers as ty would warn about rules that it doesn&#x27;t know but those might be pyright rules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I agree with all of that.</p>
<p>So then I just want to make sure that we properly understand @lypwig&#x27;s use case, if we are going to take it as feedback in favor of two separate rules.</p>
<p>@lypwig I&#x27;m not sure I understand this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class Meta:  # type: ignore[reportIncompatibleVariableOverride] # ty: ignore[unused-ignore-comment]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you set <code>respect-type-ignore-comments: false</code>, then you wouldn&#x27;t need any <code># ty: ignore</code> there.</p>
<p>So can you clarify what is the problem you find with setting <code>respect-type-ignore-comments: false</code>? Is it that you have some <code>type: ignore</code> that should actually be respected by both ty and pyright? To me, in that case it actually seems better to use a separate <code>type: ignore</code> for pyright and <code>ty: ignore</code> for ty, because then you can use a rule code for both. If you use a single <code>type: ignore</code> to silence both, then (since pyright and ty don&#x27;t share rule codes) it would have to be a blanket (code-less) ignore, which is more error-prone.</p>
<p>(Somewhat separately, I do wonder about our current behavior of interpreting any <code>type: ignore</code> with an unrecognized code as a blanket <code>type: ignore</code>. It seems unlikely to me that that will be the desired behavior for anyone -- but I&#x27;m also not sure what would be a better behavior.)</p>

<p>The use case is that only ty is used (so this option should be deactivated by default I think).</p>

<p>If you set respect-type-ignore-comments: false, then you wouldn&#x27;t need any # ty: ignore there.</p>

<p>Yeah, I finally removed <code>respect-type-ignore-comments: false</code> in the settings.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>So can you clarify what is the problem you find with setting respect-type-ignore-comments: false?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use Pyright and ty, and in some file I have many lines with poor typing, so I need disable type checking on them, including <code>class Meta:</code> detected by Pyright.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If <code>respect-type-ignore-comments</code> is set to <code>true</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I get the warning <em>&quot;Unused blanket <code>type: ignore</code> directive (ty unused-ignore-comment)&quot;</em> on the <code>type: ignore</code> used by pyright.
So I have to add &quot;unused-ignore-comment&quot; on that line like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Meta: # type: ignore[reportIncompatibleVariableOverride] # ty: ignore[unused-ignore-comment]
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><strong>If <code>respect-type-ignore-comments</code> is set to <code>false</code></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I have too many warnings for both type-checkers that I need to disable with a comment, and some them are going to be a bit long:</p>
<pre><code># type: ignore[reportGeneralTypeIssue] # ty: ignore[invalid-key,possibly-missing-attribute]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point I just share my current use-case, I&#x27;m not really sure what is the best for ty, it&#x27;s up to you to decide.</p>

<p>There&#x27;s an existing rule to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/rules/#ignore-comment-unknown-rule">catch unknown rules in ignore comments</a> but it only applies to <code>ty: ignore</code> comments.

<p>You can however use pyright specific rule suppression comments (<code># pyright: ignore</code>); they are ignored automatically by ty:</p>
