            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At runtime, names bound in an except handler are <code>del</code> ed at the end of the except handler block. We should model this as if there were a <code>del</code> statement for the name at the end of the block. And we should also support real <code>del</code> statements.</p>
<p>In both cases, it should take the form of a <code>Definition</code> that causes the name to be unbound.</p>
