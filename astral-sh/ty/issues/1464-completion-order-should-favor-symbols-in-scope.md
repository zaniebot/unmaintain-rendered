# completion order should favor symbols in scope

### Summary

This example shows that even if we have something in scope, it is not favored over currently unimported symbols, this seems wrong.

This is also spoken about in https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1274, and this is probably a duplicate of that.

@AlexWaygood mentions this [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1274#issuecomment-3345942698) too.
