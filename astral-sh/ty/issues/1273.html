            <div class="timeline-body"><p>the new generic syntax is got a significant downgrade compared to the old syntax where you can no longer explicitly specify the variance.</p>
<p>it would be nice if ty had a way to work around this, eg:</p>
<pre><code>from ty_extensions import In, Out, InOut

class Foo[In[T]]: ... # contravariant
class Foo[Out[T]]: ... # covariant
class Foo[InOut[T]]: ... # invariant
</code></pre>
<p>(the names <code>In</code> and <code>Out</code> are taken from other languages like typescript, but perhaps for readability they could just be called <code>Covariant</code>, <code>Contravariant</code>, etc)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the feature request. Unfortunately your proposed way of spelling this is invalid syntax, so -- while I think in general we&#x27;re open to adding experimental special forms where they can help move the type system forward -- this specific spelling wouldn&#x27;t work, as it would be (correctly) rejected by CPython&#x27;s parser at runtime and also our parser:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo[In[T]]: ...
  File &quot;&lt;python-input-0&gt;&quot;, line 1
    class Foo[In[T]]: ...
                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m also not sure I agree that this kind of special form would move the type system forward, however, I&#x27;m afraid. It was a deliberate decision -- discussed at some length -- to avoid adding a way to explicitly specify variance as part of PEP-695. My impression is that a significant majority of Python developers are very happy that they no longer have to worry about the variance of type parameters when typing their code. There <em>are</em> cases when you need to force a type checker to accept a typevar as being covariant even though it would &quot;naturally&quot; infer the typevar as invariant (or similar), but I think they&#x27;re pretty rare and usually unsound. Personally, I&#x27;m happy to say that users should be forced to use the more verbose legacy syntax in the unusual situation that they need this kind of thing.</p>
<p>For now, I&#x27;m going to close this -- even if we did want to consider this feature request, we certainly wouldn&#x27;t get to it any time soon, as there are many more pressing features that we still need to implement. But I&#x27;m happy to reconsider an alternative spelling if I can see evidence that it would be helpful to other developers too.</p>

<p>my bad, i should&#x27;ve checked that it was valid syntax before opening this lol</p>

<p>i&#x27;m not proposing that users are forced to specify the variance explicitly (though i would suggest an optional rule to do that), but i don&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s a rare edge case to want to specify them. if you&#x27;re developing a library i think it&#x27;s essential to <em>always</em> specify the variance explicitly. otherwise you could unknowingly publish a breaking change to your API if you accidentally turn a class with a covariant generic into an invariant one by adding a new method.</p>
<p>i&#x27;m also convinced that while many users would consider it convenient that they don&#x27;t have to think about variance, all hiding it does is make it more confusing when they encounter variance-related type errors.</p>

<p>I know you weren&#x27;t!</p>

<p>but this is where I still disagree :-)</p>
<p>I sympathise with what you&#x27;re saying about library development, but I think the vast majority of programmers using Python typing are not library developers! And I think even for library development, you can usually ensure that your type annotations are working as expected by adding tests that make use of functions such as <code>static_assert</code> and <code>assert_never</code>.</p>
<p>So I am still open to reconsidering this if we see meither more real-world use cases or more evidence that others agree with you. But for now I still see little value in reopening this :-)</p>

<p>to add to this i want to point out a recent example: the unintentional breaking change to frozen dataclasses introduced in python 3.13. see https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/discussions/11012</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood I&#x27;d be inclined to leave this open in &quot;wish&quot; state; that makes it more findable for other developers who want to provide &quot;real-world use cases&quot; or &quot;evidence that it would be helpful to other developers too&quot;.</p>
<p>I agree it likely won&#x27;t be a priority for us anytime soon, absent a PEP to standardize it. (But I do find the library-developer use-case pretty convincing; it&#x27;s a lot more verbose to write assertion tests about the variance of a library class than to specify the variance of a typevar.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As @carljm noted in https://discuss.python.org/t/should-variance-inference-ignore-underscore-prefixed-attributes/102978, it is unclear whether underscore-prefixed attributes should influence variance, as that would require the intent behind them. As far as I can tell, that&#x27;s a pretty big class of use &quot;real-world use cases&quot; already.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@jorenham Explicitly specifying variance of a typevar doesn&#x27;t solve that problem, though -- you still need to agree on rules around the use of &quot;private&quot; variables, in exactly the same way, or else you just end up moving the errors to places where the type-checker says &quot;you explicitly said this typevar is covariant, but you&#x27;re using it contravariantly/invariantly.&quot; So I don&#x27;t think this alone constitutes a use case for explicit specification of variance. (I do find &quot;library authors want to ensure they don&#x27;t accidentally break their own intentions&quot; to be a reasonable use case.)</p>
