            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Somehow mypy makes this work, but you can see that https://github.com/adamchainz/time-machine/blob/main/src/time_machine/<strong>init</strong>.py#L409 is hidden behind an <code>if HAVE_PYTEST</code> conditional, meaning that it is mentioned by <code>ty</code> as a <code>possibly-missing-attribute</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think mypy has any special handling here, it simply doesn't keep track of the fact that the module attribute might actually not be defined. And you don't see the &quot;undefined symbol&quot; error on <code>if HAVE_PYTEST</code> because it's a 3rd party dependency?</p>
<p>mypy <em>does</em> have a feature where you can configure that it should assume certain variables/constants to exist (e.g. https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#confval-always_true). We don't have such a feature, but can certainly consider adding this, such that users could specify a list of variables that ty should consider being set to <code>True</code>/<code>False</code> (similar to how <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> is treated in a special way).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there are several possible things we could do to improve this scenario, roughly ranked from easiest to hardest:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the &quot;possibly undefined import&quot; diagnostic disabled by default, because it is prone to this kind of false positive. (Same rationale for why we already disabled the &quot;possibly undefined local variable&quot; diagnostic.) I don't know of any other type checker that offers this diagnostic?</li>
<li>Add the feature @sharkdp mentions, so the user can just explicitly configure that <code>HAVE_PYTEST</code> should always be considered <code>True</code>.</li>
<li>Add sophisticated handling of <code>try: import ...</code> / <code>except ImportError:</code> such that we consider it a &quot;statically known branch&quot; based on the known presence or absence of the module in our environment.</li>

<p>I've been thinking about this recently, and for what it's worth, we sort-of support this today. If you can somehow turn something that is either of type <code>&lt;module 'xyz'&gt;</code> or of type <code>Unknown</code> into a <code>Literal[True]</code> / <code>Literal[False]</code>, you can define this <code>HAS_XYZ</code> constant and use it to conditionally hide parts of your code, if the optional dependency <code>xyz</code> is not available. I'm not saying we should suggest that users use <em>this exact</em> pattern, but as a demo, this is how this can work today:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">try:
    import xyz  # type: ignore
except ImportError:
    pass

HAS_XYZ = bool(is_subtype_of(TypeOf[xyz], ModuleType))
</code></pre>
<p>And here is a playground that shows how this can be used to conditionally add an overload, if a given optional dependency is available (something I discussed with @MichaReiser the other day):</p>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/c4512390-e8c2-4cd8-acd6-a160b42c01f3</p>
<p>(try removing/renaming the <code>xyz.py</code> tab to simulate the situation in which that dependency is not available)</p>
