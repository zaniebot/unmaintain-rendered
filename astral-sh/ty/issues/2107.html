            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>ty reports <code>division-by-zero</code> errors even when the division is guarded by a conditional check like <code>if x &gt; 0</code>.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>ty version: 0.0.4</li>
<li>Python version: 3.14</li>
<li>OS: Ubuntu 24.04</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reproduction</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Example:
    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
        self.total_requests = 0
        self.rate_limited_requests = 0

    def get_statistics(self) -&gt; dict[str, str]:
        return {
            &quot;rate_limit_percentage&quot;: (
                f&quot;{(self.rate_limited_requests / self.total_requests * 100):.2f}%&quot;
                if self.total_requests &gt; 0  # ← Guard is present!
                else &quot;0%&quot;
            ),
        }
</code></pre>
<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
<p>No error - the division is only executed when <code>self.total_requests &gt; 0</code>, making division by zero impossible.</p>
<h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
<pre><code>error[division-by-zero]: Cannot divide object of type `Literal[0]` by zero
</code></pre>
<p>ty correctly infers that <code>self.total_requests</code> is initialized to <code>0</code>, but doesn't recognize that the <code>if self.total_requests &gt; 0</code> guard narrows the type to exclude zero before the division occurs.</p>
<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>Currently using <code>division-by-zero = &quot;warn&quot;</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> to suppress these false positives.</p>
<h2>Related</h2>
<p>This is similar to how type checkers handle None checks - after <code>if x is not None</code>, the type is narrowed. The same narrowing logic should apply to numeric comparisons before division.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey -- yeah, our <code>division-by-zero</code> check has quite a few false positives like this. This is why it's currently disabled by default.</p>
<p>I'll leave this open, as it's <em>possible</em> we might add support for narrowing <code>Literal[0]</code> out of a union by using <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code> checks. I don't think it's a priority for us, though, as it would add some complexity to our model and I think this specific check might be the only rule that would benefit from this narrowing currently.</p>
<p>We should maybe also add a note to the documentation for this rule that it's known to have false positives, and that this is why it's disabled by default.</p>
