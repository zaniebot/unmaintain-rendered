            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Playground code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def foo(x: int, y: str) -&gt; None: ...

foo(1, &quot;&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The signature help shows up after <em>moving</em> the cursor after the closing parentheses (<code>)</code>) that ends the call. The closing parenthesis was added automatically when I added the opening parenthesis but I explicitly typed <kbd>)</kbd> which <em>moved</em> the cursor beyond the closing parenthesis. And, at this point, the signature help was shown which highlighted the first parameter.</p>
<p>Although, it's interesting that adding the closing parenthesis manually doesn't trigger the signature help. I haven't tried this out in an editor though.</p>
