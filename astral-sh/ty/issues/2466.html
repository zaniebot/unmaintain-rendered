<p>It is not uncommon for me to type something and see a flood of test functions from one of the dependencies. (I'll show a demo in a subsequent comment.) Unless we are in a context where we are writing tests, I don't think we ever want to see these.</p>
<p>The main challenge here is just figuring out what it means for:</p>
<ol>
<li>A symbol to be part of tests.</li>
<li>To be writing tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>We could look at how other completion systems work. And also look at what pytest does for test detection.</p>
