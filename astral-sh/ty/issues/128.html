            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This gets more interesting when parameters aren&#x27;t annotated, but doing it for functions with annotated parameters is a good start.</p>
<p>I think this is an important feature for a good IDE (and later linter) experience. Without it, Red Knot won&#x27;t be able to provide many IDE features, such as go-to definitions, completions, on-hover, and useful inlays for any function without an annotated return type. That means, Red Knot won&#x27;t be very useful on unannotated code.</p>

<p>Yes. This is where Pyright&#x27;s inlining strategy (for small functions) comes into play, for example.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am skeptical of this feature. It can easily lead to false positives on un-annotated code with inheritance, which can only be resolved by adding annotations. This violates the gradual guarantee, and potentially makes red-knot <em>less</em> useful on un-annotated code, because of false positives.</p>
<p>In the scenario below, what type should red-knot infer for the return types of <code>A.method</code> and <code>B.method</code>, and should it issue any error for Liskov violation?</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def method(self):
        return None

class B(A):
    def method(self):
        return 1
</code></pre>
<p>(Edit: perhaps it would be more accurate to say, I see the value in this feature, but I also think there are significant design problems with it that we need to sort out our answers to before we merge an implementation of it. I also think it is low priority for the alpha.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems that mypy and pyright behave differently in this regard.
In mypy, if the return type of a function is not annotated, it is simply set to <code>Any</code>, while in pyright it infers it.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/4409">a discussion on mypy</a> about inferring function&#x27;s return type, and the main argument against it was that there are &quot;functions with an obvious return type&quot; and &quot;functions with a less obvious return type&quot;, and that inferring the return type may cause false positive errors in the latter, and that the distinction between the two is not so clear.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, I still think that this feature has a lot of utility. Inferring only the return type of functions that can be inferred &quot;confidently&quot; rather than that of all functions is an arbitrary but not so bad solution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My issue with it is not solved by distinguishing &quot;obvious&quot; vs &quot;non-obvious&quot; return types. IMO that would simply make the feature more confusing, because it would be arbitrary when you make some change to your function and suddenly your inferred return type goes away.</p>
<p>My issue is summarized by my question above, and we need some answer to that question before we move ahead with the feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://pyright-play.net/?pyrightVersion=1.1.352&amp;enableExperimentalFeatures=true&amp;code=MYGwhgzhAECCBcAoaLoBMCmAzaBbDALgBYD2aAFBBiFgJRKqPQBOhArswHbQByJnGRIlCQYAIXKx6yVJhz5iZStToMmKVgQ7cAjEA">Pyright&#x27;s answer</a> is that <code>A.method</code> is inferred as returning <code>None</code>, and <code>B.method</code> is inferred as returning <code>Literal[1]</code>, and pyright then emits a diagnostic because <code>B.method</code> is an invalid override for <code>A.method</code> (<code>Literal[1]</code> is not a subtype of <code>None</code>).</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a good answer, because it violates the gradual guarantee. We now have a (possibly false positive) diagnostic on (possibly valid and working) unannotated code, which can only be removed by <em>adding</em> an annotation <code>-&gt; int | None</code> on <code>A.method</code>.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the original un-annotated code, if the author assumes a possible return type of <code>int | None</code> when they call <code>.method()</code>. Their code only <em>becomes</em> wrong when we assume (without the author having said so) that <code>A.method</code> defines a method which must always (including in all subclass overrides) return <code>None</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While thinking about this issue, I came across <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17301#discussion_r2043056913">the following comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The union <code>Unknown | Literal[1]</code> expresses the gradual type &quot;some type at least as large as <code>Literal[1]</code> but possibly larger&quot;, which has the nice property that if you ever try to use it somewhere you can&#x27;t use an integer, it&#x27;ll error -- but it&#x27;ll allow things other than <code>Literal[1]</code> to be assigned to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about using <code>Unknown | &lt;inferred return type&gt;</code> when the return type of a function is not annotated?</p>
<p>Since <code>is_assignable_to(Unknown | T, Unknown | U)</code> holds for all types <code>T, U</code>, the gradual guarantees regarding method overriding should hold.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@carljm Sorry for not responding earlier here. I discussed this with Micha in one of our 1:1s, and we weren&#x27;t sure if this would always be safe to do. I did not think about inheritance when writing this issue. Are there also issues with free functions, or would it be okay to use the union of all return expressions there?</p>
<p>I guess overloaded functions could also complicate the situation.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that&#x27;s a great idea. We would infer <code>Unknown | None</code> for the return type of <code>A.method</code>, which would reflect the fact that the &quot;correct&quot; annotation could be <code>None</code> or anything larger, like <code>int | None</code>. The return type can not be smaller than <code>None</code> though; otherwise the function body would be incorrect.</p>

<p>I agree that we would probably still infer <code>Unknown</code> as the return type of most un-annotated functions. But I think it can still be useful when calling into un-annotated code from a typed code base, for example:</p>
<pre><code>number: int = untyped_library.function_that_I_expected_to_only_return_int()
</code></pre>
<p>where we could raise a diagnostic if we would see that <code>function_that_I_expected_to_only_return_int</code> can (implicitly or explicitly) return <code>None</code>, for example.</p>

<p>Thanks, I will make a correction to astral-sh/ruff#17371 with the policy that for non-final class methods, the union with <code>Unknown</code> is the inferred return type.</p>

<p>It seems good to use the explicitly specified return type of the superclass method.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m not sure if this is OK to apply to dunders/special methods. Even if the documentation specifies the return type, that &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; is often ignored (e.g. <code>numpy.ndarray.__eq__</code>, <code>pathlib.Path.__truediv__</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/118">astral-sh/ty#118</a> @dcreager raised another consideration here -- return-type inference will allow some types to &quot;escape&quot; from functions that could never be spelled in a return annotation, and at least some of these types will then behave differently from any other type we currently have. Consider:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    class C:
        pass
    return C
</code></pre>
<p>Without return-type inference, you could not possibly annotate <code>f</code> to indicate that it returns the type <code>&lt;class &#x27;C&#x27;&gt;</code>, or even <code>type[C]</code>, because the name is not in scope. Nor could anyone annotate (outside the scope of <code>f</code>) that a value is of type <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>This allows us to safely make some assumptions that we currently make in the type system: that a class literal type is a singleton type, and thus that instances of a class literal type are all instances of the same type at runtime. But in the above case, these assumptions no longer apply! Each call to <code>f()</code> returns a brand-new separate class <code>C</code>, which has a separate identity and will not compare equal to the class <code>C</code> returned from a different call to <code>f()</code>. How can we reflect that in the type system?</p>
<p>We can see this unsoundness <a href="https://pyright-play.net/?strict=true&amp;code=CYUwZgBGAUCUBcBYAUBNEDGAbAhgZzwgGF4IAHfPFdCAJxABcBXWgO2JRQHMIBeKOHE7IAlpBF4RrPAxysMIaFwA0A2AmroKBIA">in pyright</a>, where it wrongly thinks that every <code>C</code> returned from <code>f</code> is the same <code>C</code>, and draws wrong conclusions from this.</p>
<p>Similar problems exist with a function returning a nested function.</p>
<p>If we don&#x27;t do return-type inference, none of these problems exist, because you would be forced to annotate the return type as a more general type (a <code>Callable</code> type perhaps, or a <code>Protocol</code>), which we don&#x27;t make these same assumptions about.</p>
<p>For inferred function return types, I think we could address this by instead abstracting to a general callable type, if we infer a function return type.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s less clear what we can do about classes. We could perhaps synthesize a <code>Protocol</code> type, but that seems like going quite far. It may be more reasonable to just refuse to infer a return type in this case (or infer <code>type[Any]</code>).</p>
<p>(Of course another option could be to decide that practically the unsoundness resulting from failing to understand that multiple &quot;copies&quot; of a class may exist at runtime isn&#x27;t likely to matter, and we can just return a regular ClassLiteral type as an inferred type from a function.)</p>

<p>This is a problem that other ecosystems have to (TypeScript, Rust). For Rust, it&#x27;s mainly because you can&#x27;t spell the type because of visibility constraints but I think there are also instances where this is the case when returning lambdas or <code>impls</code>s (which have no named type)</p>
<p>For TypeScript, it&#x27;s a mix of missing visibility (the type isn&#x27;t exported so you can&#x27;t name it) or that the type is from a nested scope.</p>
