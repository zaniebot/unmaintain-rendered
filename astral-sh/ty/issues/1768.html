<p>I found this crash by mutating some existing Python samples.  Unfortunately, my fuzzing set-up is completely local for now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a fuzzer that we run in CI (we currently just use it as a baseline of things that we know we didn't previously crash on -- we don't yet run ty on randomly generated samples in CI).</p>
<p>Our existing fuzzer is very useful. But its strength is that it's very good at generating unusual combinations of Python <em>syntax</em> -- it's not so good at generating unusual uses of typing-module special forms. And I think mutation-based fuzzing would probably be excellent at that kind of thing. So if you ever feel like contributing your script, I think we'd find it very useful!</p>
