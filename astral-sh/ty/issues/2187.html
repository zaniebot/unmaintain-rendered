            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>First, I want to say thanks to the developers of ty for making an awesome type checker!</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Phable is a modern Python toolkit for working with <a href="https://project-haystack.org/">Project Haystack</a> tagged data, <a href="https://github.com/Project-Haystack/xeto?tab=readme-ov-file#overview">Xeto</a> specs, and <a href="https://haxall.io/">Haxall</a>.</p>
<h2>Possible issue</h2>
<p>Below are from the phable docs:</p>
<p>Project Haystack data types are immutable, but Python's lists and dicts are mutable. Type checkers can use <code>typing.Sequence</code> and <code>typing.Mapping</code> to detect mutations while giving programmers flexibility to use either mutable (list/dict) or immutable (tuple/frozendict) types at runtime. Native frozendict support may be added in Python 3.15.</p>
<p>It would be great to use ty with Phable, however, ty does not raise an error when expected.  Below is an example.  Any feedback would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Any, Mapping

x: Mapping[str, Any] = {&quot;a&quot;: 1}
x[&quot;b&quot;] = 2  # Should error: Mapping doesn't support item assignment
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! The issue here is that we currently will infer a more precise type than the annotated type, so we know that <code>x</code> is actually a dict even though you've annotated it as a <code>Mapping</code>. If you use a <code>Mapping</code> annotation in a place where we #136 t have any more precise information, you will get an error on mutating it. See https://play.ty.dev/b4fac217-c389-4d80-ad41-aed130a34eff</p>
<p>That said, we plan to change this behavior, see #136</p>
