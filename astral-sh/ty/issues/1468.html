            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Say I'm using ty to check my codes and I put it as one step of my pre-commit. Although I set &quot;include&quot; in <code>pyproject.toml</code> to just check some specified files, if I change some file not in &quot;include&quot; and be to commit it, pre-commit would still let ty to check it.</p>
<p>I know that ruff has a feature to ignore the entire file, that is writing a comment &quot;# ruff: noqa&quot; on the very top of the file. So I wonder if ty has similar features or other method to ignore the entire file. Thank you!</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ty 0.0.1a24</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you can add a <code>type: ignore</code> at the top of the file, as seen <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/suppressions/type_ignore.md#file-level-suppression">here</a></p>
<p>However, I'd consider this more a workaround. The &quot;proper&quot; solution on the ty side is to add a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#force-exclude"><code>--force-exclude</code></a> option similar to the one in ruff, that force exclusion even for path explicitly passed to ty.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another option is that you repeat your <code>exclude</code> configuration in pre-commit https://pre-commit.com/#regular-expressions</p>
<p>I understand that this is rather annoying because you want a single source of truth for which files are excluded but it avoids the need to clutter your files with <code>type: ignore</code> comments.</p>
<p>I also opened  https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1469 to add a new CLI flag to improve the pre-commit experience.</p>

<p>A better pre-commit-specific solution would probably be to set <code>pass_filenames: false</code> for the hook (https://pre-commit.com/#hooks-pass_filenames)</p>

<p>Oh nice. That should work well for as long as all files have no errors. I suspect that this would lead to errors being shown for unstaged files.</p>
