            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I have a workspace with 4 packages that depend on each other. I install them, three of them get installed, the last one is silently dropped. A minimal reproducible example is in the attached archive. I also added the logs of <code>uv sync --verbose</code>. There is no mention of why the last package would not be installed in the workspace. What is weird is that in the <code>uv.lock</code> file the missing package is marked as <code>virtual</code>, even though it is the same as others and is required in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The one that&#x27;s missing does not declare a build system, and is consequently treated as a virtual package. This is similar to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14608">astral-sh/uv#14608</a>#issuecomment-3070039304 and something we&#x27;re planning to change the default for in the next breaking release.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was staring at this for hours and not even gemini noticed it. Thanks. That makes sense and adding a build system fixes it. I think it would be good to provide a warning or something. Want me to close this then?</p>

<p>Yeah sorry about that, we know it&#x27;s a surprising default, hence the desire to change it :)</p>
