            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have maybe 20 venvs for different projects on my laptop, all using python 3.12.
There are two different &quot;batch update&quot; operations I would like to perform on all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the minor version of python to the latest 3.12.x</li>
<li>Update a package in all of them, e.g. ruff</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like the first operation could be be useful to more people besides me.
I can see how the second operation would be less useful to people working more carefully with lockfiles and CI processes to periodically update the lockfiles, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do the former if you install Python with the preview flag enabled, e.g., <code>uv python install --preview 3.12 &amp;&amp; uv venv &amp;&amp; uv python upgrade</code>. It's just not a stabilized behavior yet.</p>
<p>The latter doesn't really match our virtual environment per project workflows, I'm not sure we'll add first-class support for that.</p>
