            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, a <code>ResolvedDist</code> does not always have a hash. This is a problem for the lock file where we'd ideally want hashes for <em>at least</em> direct URL dependencies. We currently also don't have hashes for Git or Path dependencies, but I think we probably don't want those. (Cargo doesn't use hashes for that case either.)</p>
<p>So I think we need to fix this:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e33ff95575e8165078799548070210947d1cfad0/crates/uv-resolver/src/lock.rs#L688-L695</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e33ff95575e8165078799548070210947d1cfad0/crates/uv-resolver/src/lock.rs#L601-L607</p>
<p>And then probably update the data structures so that <code>hash</code> isn't required for the <code>git</code> and <code>path</code> sources.</p>
