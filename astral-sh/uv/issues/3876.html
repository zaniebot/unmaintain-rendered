            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We never add uv to the virtual environment because there’s no need. uv doesn’t need to be installed in a given environment — your global uv can install into any environment.</p>
<p>If you want to include pip, you can run “uv venv —seed”.</p>

<p>Sorry, I must not be familiar enough with virtual environments. What exactly do you mean here? How do I use my &quot;global uv&quot; after I've activated a uv-created environment?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Like, typically, if you install uv globally, then you'd run <code>uv venv</code> and <code>uv pip install</code>, and uv will install into the activated environment even though it's not installed into the environment, because the <code>uv</code> in <code>uv venv</code> will resolve to the uv installed outside of the environment, and uv supports that just fine.</p>
<p>If you can't run uv directly due to company policy (any idea why this is?), then I guess you do need to install it into the environment? Because <code>python -m uv</code> won't work once you've activated the environment. So in that case, I think you'd need:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv --seed
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install uv
uv pip install flask
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(<code>--seed</code> is intended for compatibility with non-uv workflows -- it installs <code>pip</code> into the virtualenv, as you would get if you ran <code>python -m venv</code>. We omit <code>pip</code> by default since you typically don't need it if you're using uv already.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We use Airlock which blocks anonymous <code>.exe</code> files from executing on the system, which includes <code>uv.exe</code> in a virtual env. I could submit a ticket for an exception but it's easier to just use pip to create the env at this point, especially if I'm trying to get others set up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok -- in that case, <code>uv venv --seed</code> will enable you to install <code>uv</code> into the <code>venv</code> with <code>pip install</code>.</p>

Install uv from an elevated terminal and it will be available from within virtual environments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK I am commented my less-than-good experience here in hopes of helping others and hopefully leading to some improvements!</p>
<p>I am following the docs. I need to create a globally accessible virtual environment. So I did:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv uvvenvs/gen13
source uvvenvs/gen13/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>note: gen13 is the name because it is &quot;general&quot; python 3.13, a scratch-like env not tied to a specific project. I need one for each Python version for my use-cases.</p>
<p>Both <code>uv</code> and <code>pip</code> are not available in this environment, so I had to back out. I don't know how to install anything. So, I ran:</p>
<pre><code>deactivate
rm -rf ~/uvvenvs/gen13
</code></pre>
<p>I try to create the gen13 venv again, only this time using <code>--seed</code> <em>and</em> the path to the venv:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv uvvenvs/gen13 --seed
</code></pre>
<p>OK so it looks like it gave me <code>pip</code> now? Cool, I will use that.</p>
<pre><code>source uvvenvs/gen13/bin/activate
which pip
&gt; /Users/antazoey/uvvenvs/gen13/bin/pip
pip install -e /Users/antazoey/path/to/my./project
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Things I don't understand:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What is the point of <em>not</em> using <code>--seed</code>? Why would you need a Python environment which you can't install anything in? It seems like I am not understanding how to use <code>uv</code> yet.</li>
<li>Why am I stuck using <code>pip</code> in my venv? I thought <code>uv</code> was the new, faster <code>pip</code> but I still have to use <code>pip</code> anyway?</li>

<p>You don't need <code>pip</code> because you have uv. You can do <code>uv pip ...</code> instead of <code>pip ...</code> — it's a compatible interface.</p>

<p>I need scratchy envs for each python for experimenting and frequently changing packages, it is for adhoc development of a vast series of annoying python libraries</p>

<p>Similar issue where I can not install uv as a privileged user, so calls to uv pip install don't seem to find my .venv. Including uv as a seed would avoid an extra execution when rebuilding a venv.</p>
<p>py -m uv venv --seed

pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt</p>

<p>@zanieb Many install scripts use pip. You expect me to modify vendor install scripts to replace 'pip' with 'uv pip'? Your answer is not a solution.</p>
