# Active venv using uv

---

_@ChaitanyaYeole02_

### Summary

Active venv using uv instead of using source,

Like: `uv activate .venv` this will be ran as `source .venv/bin/activate`

This will just make the user experience smoother and more easier to understand that uv is integrated with everything.


I can work on this, I just need a confirmation that people like this idea.
