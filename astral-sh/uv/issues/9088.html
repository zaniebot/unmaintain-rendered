Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>I am new to uv.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>When I tried to initialize a new project, I received the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">❯ uv init TestProject --verbose
DEBUG uv 0.5.1 (f399a5271 2024-11-08)
DEBUG Reading Python requests from version file at `/Users/edmund/Downloads/.python-version`
DEBUG Searching for Python interpreter with executable name `3.10-dev`
DEBUG Checking for Python interpreter at executable name `3.10-dev`
error: No interpreter found for executable name `3.10-dev` in virtual environments, managed installations, or search path
</code></pre>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>Removed the <code>.python-version</code> present in the root folder from where I was trying to create the new project.</p>
<h2>Longer term fix</h2>
<p>I'm not sure if there is a better way to report the error, or dare I say use the version of python that I installed using <code>uv</code>.  I don't know enough to have a POV.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think your issue is that <code>uv</code> is reading the python version from a <code>.python-version</code> file in your downloads folder.</p>
<p>That version is not valid (use <code>uv python list --all-versions</code> to see valid versions if im not mistaken).</p>
<p>This line shows your issue:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for filing. @Kanerix is right that we're reading <code>3.10-dev</code> from your <code>.python-version</code> file. Then, because it's not a valid version, we assume it's the name of an executable, and we can't find an executable named <code>3.10-dev</code>. Agree it would be nice if the error message included more context here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>New to <code>uv</code>, this also just caught me out - took me some time to work out what was going on.</p>
<p>I had an existing <code>~/.python-version</code> file containing the name of a pyenv virtualenv (my default venv that every shell picks up automatically until I intervene), and <code>uv</code> did not like this at all.</p>
<p>Is there a way to add pyenv-managed virtualenvs to <code>uv</code> so that it can handle them better?</p>
<p>My workaround for now is to remove <code>~/.python-version</code> while I try out <code>uv</code>, but it breaks my pyenv set-up which I use all the time, so I'm probably not going to make the switch, unfortunately.</p>
