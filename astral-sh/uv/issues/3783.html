<p>Installing a package from github via ssh with</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install git+ssh://git@{enterprise-git-repo}/{username}/{package}.git
</code></pre>
<p>hangs at &quot;Resolving dependencies&quot;, <em>unless</em> I run with --verbose, in which case it takes me to my public key passphrase and works after that.</p>
<p>I do briefly see the password prompt flash by during the &quot;Resolving dependencies&quot; stage but it disappears instantly.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m still on 0.1.45 (mirror is only updated weekly), apologies if this has been fixed but I didn&#x27;t see much I could tell was relevant in the releases since then.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report, this shouldn&#x27;t have changed since then. We don&#x27;t technically support providing authentication interactively, I&#x27;m surprised it even prompts — we&#x27;ll need to investigate that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just ran into the same issue on a completely new work setup and it took me a while to figure out the problem. Using the <code>--no-progress</code> flag seems to be another workaround besides increasing verbosity. But this should probably work without having to specify any flags.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Same issue occured. It is only clear when I specified <code>--verbose</code> when running <code>uv sync</code> to see why it hangs there forever. It has been waiting for my github name and password:</p>
<pre><code>Password for &#x27;https://github.com&#x27;:
</code></pre>
<p>For the record, it wasn&#x27;t the case last week when setting up the same repo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>#11744 seems to address HTTP auth, not SSH auth, which this issue was originally reported about. I can reproduce this with latest uv (0.7.9).</p>
<p>(I think this is the same issue as #12685 at this point.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We use <code>uvx --from git+https://github.com/org/repo</code> as means to setup <code>stdio</code> MCP servers from VSCode and custom tooling.</p>
<p>Triaging this error took quite some time until a user seeing a &quot;Resolving dependencies&quot; typed their ssh key passphrase &quot;because reasons&quot;... <code>--verbose</code> showed it&#x27;s waiting for an exclusive lock on a file in <code>~/.cache/uv/git..</code>. Running with <code>--no-cache</code> mitigated the problem, but is no real workaround as not all users control a managed config.</p>
