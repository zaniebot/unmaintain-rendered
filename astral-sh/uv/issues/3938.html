Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>The git tag is not preserved when compiling (unless I missed a config option) -- This is also an incompatibility with <code>pip compile</code> which preserves this information.</p>
<p>for example</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;uv @ git+https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git@0.2.5&quot; &gt; r.txt

uv pip compile r.txt
</code></pre>
<p>results in:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile r.txt
uv @ git+https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git@47db418ba26dd4b720ec968b2520f2483842419d
    # via -r r.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The above should be:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile r.txt
uv @ git+https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git@0.2.5
    # via -r r.txt
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Understood for security reasons, is there any possibility of adding a CLI flag to allow this as it does break direct 1:1 compatibility when moving from pip-compile, so that this can be re-enabled?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I've run into a case where this causes an error.</p>
<p>If resolved and the downstream repo lists the tag, then the upstream repo that installs using this file causes a resolution error because the tag does not match the SHA.</p>
<p>This would be considered a bug as it generates an invalid requirements file that can't be installed.</p>
<p>Can this issue be reopened for discussion regarding this?</p>
