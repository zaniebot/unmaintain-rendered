It's likely there was an error establishing connection from your machine to the Huawei mirror. Retry in another time, I suppose.

This looks like a problem where the registry is not reachable. If the connection to the registry itself is working, you can try limiting the downloads with (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#concurrent-downloads).

Using pypi is the same problem, but I uninstalled the original python and reinstalled the new same version of python solved the problem (https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases), although I don't know why.
