            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, first just wanted to say thanks, uv is a really great tool!</p>
<p>We're trying to use torch cpu by default on Replit, including for transitive dependencies, and have run into a few of the other issues that are open such as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9647. While those are being fixed, we were wondering if there is an easy way to expose package resolution information so that we can work around it?</p>
<p>As far as we know the closest thing is <code>uv tree</code> but that requires the package to be installed so we'd have to install cuda torch, do <code>uv tree</code>, and then override the torch version with cpu, which isn't ideal.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>What kind of information are you looking for? Like, what is your ideal API? You want to provide a package + version, and see the <code>METADATA</code> file?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that sounds good, as a concrete example, something we want to be able to deal with is if someone wants to install <code>easyocr</code> then we can see what that depends on, which includes a certain <code>torchvision</code> version and then try to install the cpu version for that explicitly instead as a workaround. Something like <code>uv resolve foo&gt;=1.2.3,&lt;2 --format json</code> that emits some subset of the <code>METADATA</code> and possibly some information about why a particular version and index was chosen would be nice.</p>
