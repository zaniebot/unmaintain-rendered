            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello and thanks for your work!  This is a non-issue kind of issue, more of a discussion / show &amp; tell.</p>
<p>Curious to learn about what's your view and vision for using <a href="https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi">Pixi</a> and uv together?  It seems to me like they complement each other, and belong together.  So I started a pet project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy">Pup </a> is a single script that transparently wraps around Pixi and uv.  Think of puppy as a recipe for using Pixi and uv together (or just as their fur baby, if you're so inclined).</p>
<p>I've been thinking about how I want to organize my python work going forward, and the wishlist converged around the following design criteria.  Essentially, we're looking at a two-tiered environment.  The outer tier is managed by Pixi; the inner tier by uv.</p>
<ul>
<li>base python should be:<ul>
<li>not system python</li>
<li>non-invasive, isolated from any existing python, easy to setup and tear down without leaving a trace</li>
<li>easy to swap versions (up or down as needed)</li>
<li>bring along tools needed for other languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>environments should be<ul>
<li>super easy, oneliner-easy, to create, use, modify, freeze, take down</li>
<li>reside in the same folder as the base python rather than all over</li>
<li>easily ported to other machines or containers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the whole thing<ul>
<li>should work on Linux and Windows</li>
<li>should support Conda and PyPI</li>
<li>should be easy to recreate without relying on memory or Bash history</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/liquidcarbon/pup-fileserver">Here's a HuggingFace app</a>, built with <code>pup</code>, showing you the file structure you get.  Container base is <code>debian:latest</code>, and the python end can be constructed with the same <code>pup</code> commands you would use locally.

<p>If you'd like to give it a try and offer feedback, it would be much appreciated!</p>
