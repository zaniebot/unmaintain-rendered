            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, it's because the <code>RegistryIndex</code> is keyed on package name. So if you have two versions of the same package in a single resolution (which <em>can</em> happen when building source distributions), it will fail. E.g., right now, in the cache, I have all of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">typing-extensions-4.8.0-py3-none-any.json
typing_extensions-4.7.1-py3-none-any.whl
typing_extensions-4.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
typing-extensions-4.7.1-py3-none-any.json
</code></pre>
<p>So when I try to install 4.8.0, we can't find it in the cache; and then we also can't install it later, because the JSON version already exists.</p>
<p>@konstin - before I invest any time... what's your plan there, for changing the <code>RegistryIndex</code>?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Specifically for this, #543. Longer term it should report what is installed and its direct_url contents and hand over to caching layers such as <code>DistributionDatabase</code> to figure out what of the installed packages is fresh and what need to be replaced by a different version.</p>
