            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>after i commit 'uv cache clean' , the ~/.cache/uv is clean, but when i use 'uv tool install' something in the next time, i thought uv will redownload the same package which it have been used in some tools in ~/.local/share/uv/tools/ , and the good hard link functionality is invalid. i hope a new feature is add, that can regenerate cache base on the  tools or projects library in order to make the hard link functionality work again.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we probably won't support this kind of thing (regenerating cache entries after cleaning), just because it seems to have limited usefulness and would be fairly complex. Thank you for writing in though.</p>
