Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>It'd be nice if <code>--exclude-newer</code> supported resolved git tags. For example, if <code>UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER</code> is set to <code>2024-06-01</code> and the <code>v1</code> tag of a project was created on <code>2024-06-12</code>, then requesting this would fail:</p>
<pre><code>UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER=2024-06-01 uv pip install 'my-package @ git+https://github.com/my-org/my-package.git@v1'
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, when requesting branches, the resolved revision would only be older than the requested date.</p>
<p>Let me know if this makes sense or whether it's even possible 😅.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just learned about the <code>exclude-newer</code> flag of UV and it won over my heart.</p>
<p>Came here to suggest the same thing. From my perspective, allowing commit resolution for branches seems more widely useful compared to gut-checking whether git commits were re-tagged. (Everyone commits to branches; very few users move tags.)</p>
<p>Specifically, I'm interested in this for when working in jupyer notebooks, so that a version-controlled jupyter notebook will still work in colab if checked out. (assuming it's set to match the date of the checked out commit)</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this @edgarrmondragon!</p>
