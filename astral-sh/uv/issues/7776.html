            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice if I could find out whether any of my installed tools have upgrades available.</p>
<p>Relatedly, currently <code>uv tool upgrade</code> upgrades every tool&#x27;s dependencies even if the tools themselves cannot be upgraded. I would prefer an option (e.g. <code>--quick</code>) where the command does nothing unless the tool itself can be upgraded to a new version. Less importantly, there could also be more advanced options that update the minimum number of packages to upgrade to the new version of the tool.</p>
<p>More fancifully, even with <code>--quick</code>, <code>uv tool upgrade</code> could upgrade dependencies for which there is a security advisory. (And it could even downgrade if there is a security advisory about the newest version). But that is probably a separate feature.</p>
