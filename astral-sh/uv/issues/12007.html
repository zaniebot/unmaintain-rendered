            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>For me, it would be nice if running <code>uv sync --group build</code> with</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># [project]
# ...

[dependency-groups]
build = []
</code></pre>
<p>does not result in this error</p>
<pre><code>error: Group `build` is not defined in the project's `dependency-groups` table
</code></pre>
<p>but rather be a noop (maybe printing a warning). PEP 735 doesn't seem to prohibit the use of empty dependency groups.</p>
<h3>Use case</h3>
<p>My use case is that I have multiple services that should be interchangeable. I build them using the same Dockerfile so the build process should be ideally identical. Some services require some additional packages and some don't.</p>
<p>So it would be nice if I could just install the group that potentially contains the extra deps without worrying about errors.</p>
<h3>Versions</h3>
<ul>
<li>uv 0.6.4 (Homebrew 2025-03-03)</li>
<li>macOS 15.3.1</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does it work if you recreate the lockfile? Or invalidate it in some way?

<p>Even though, you addressed this super quickly, I could confirm that re-locking as you suggested made it work 👍</p>
