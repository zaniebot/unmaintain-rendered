# Add an option to dump PEP 517 metadata

_Issue opened by @leodevian on 2025-11-07 18:06_

### Summary

Hello,

[pypa/build added an option to bump PEP 517 metadata](https://github.com/pypa/build/pull/940). I would love to be able to use this option with the `uv build` command.

### Example

This command would display the project version, whether it is dynamic or static:

```bash
uv build --metadata | jq -r '.version'
```

It could be used in CI/CD jobs to verify the deployment of packages to package indexes or to remove them though API requests.

```bash
uv build --metadata > metadata.json
name=$(jq -r '.name' < metadata.json)
version=$(jq -r '.version' < metadata.json)
...
```
