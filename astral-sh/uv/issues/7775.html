            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am using <code>uv 0.4.17 (d2e7b40ce 2024-09-27)</code>.</p>
<p>The docs for <code>uv tool upgrade</code> are a bit confusing. The description of the <code>-U</code> option mentions the <code>--refresh</code> option that does not exist for this command. The description of <code>-P</code> option mentions a similarly nonexistent <code>--refresh-package</code>.</p>
<p>Moreover, <code>-U</code> is turned on by default, which is unclear from the help (but there's a message explaining it when you try to use <code>uv tool upgrade -U</code>).</p>
<hr />
<p>The reason I got caught up in this, by the way, is that I wanted an option that does not update the tool's dependencies unless the tool can be updated as well. See #7776 .</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>These options come from a shared struct which contains all options for commands that resolve and install. We should probably override and omit them though, as I don't think <code>--upgrade</code> and <code>--upgrade-package</code> don't make sense here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You see the explanations for those options by asking for the help for <code>uv tool install</code> rather than <code>upgrade</code>. Maybe, just adding a line &quot;see also the help for <code>uv tool install</code>&quot; could be enough.</p>
