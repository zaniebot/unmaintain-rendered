# uv tool binaries

_Issue opened by @powercoconola on 2025-05-29 23:49_

### Question

Hello, the documentation states:

```
Installation of tools will not overwrite executables in the bin directory that were not previously installed by uv. For example, if pipx has been used to install a tool, uv tool install will fail. The --force flag can be used to override this behavior.
```

Is there a way to choose to not install an executable in the UV `~/.local/bin` when running `uv tool install <package>`. I imagine it would be something like `uv tool install <package> --no-bin`. I tried various commands in the `uv tool install` documentation but I could not figure out. Asking question in case I missed a way to do this.

Thank you.

### Platform

Windows 10/11

### Version

uv 0.7.8

What does it mean to install a tool without adding it to the `bin/` directory? i.e., what are you trying to accomplish?

The tool executable would still show up in `UV_TOOL_DIR` in the Scripts directory, which is where I mainly run it. In my case, that is `%USERPROFILE%/uv`. I don't want to mess with anyone else's `pipx` installations and run `--force`.

Can you set [`UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_tool_bin_dir) instead?
