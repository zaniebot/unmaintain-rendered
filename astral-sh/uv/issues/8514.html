            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran a long-overdue <code>brew upgrade</code> on my system yesterday, and since <code>python@3.12 3.12.4 -&gt; 3.12.7_1</code>, I knew I'd have to nuke my venvs (which is related to #1495 – since my venvs are in <code>~/venvs</code>, I don't need to hunt them around my project folders...) since the base interpreter is gone.</p>
<p><code>uv tool</code>s also break (though <code>pipx</code>-installed tools haven't broken! I suppose <code>pipx</code> doesn't fully resolve a symlink Python executable and just uses <code>/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12</code> instead of <code>/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.7_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3.12</code>?), and <code>uv tool list</code> doesn't make it perfectly easy to recover:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv tool list
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/akx/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/jupyter-core/bin/python3`
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/akx/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/pre-commit/bin/python3`
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/akx/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/segno/bin/python3`
</code></pre>
<p>Happily, I have Fish shell history to help me, so I knew to <code>uv tool install segno --with qrcode-artistic</code> and <code>uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv</code> (and get rid of Jupyter, that was just for testing).</p>
<pre><code>$ uv tool list
pre-commit v4.0.1
- pre-commit
segno v1.6.1
- segno
</code></pre>
<h2>Ideas:</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>uv tool reinstall-all</code>? Looks like tools' <code>uv-receipt.toml</code>s contain the requirements, so <code>uv</code> could just Do The Thing.</li>
</ul>
