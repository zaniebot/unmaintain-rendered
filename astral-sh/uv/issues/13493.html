            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Note: I did see this issue <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12753">astral-sh/uv#12753</a></p>
<p>I&#x27;m in somewhat of an odd situation and looking for advice on how to handle this.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m trying to write a <code>uv.toml</code> file that can be used as the system-level config file for a large userbase. We&#x27;re using Jfrog Artifactory as our package repo and it has a mirror of pypi, which I&#x27;d like to set as the <code>default</code> index.</p>
<p>In addition, we have another index for in-house packages, let&#x27;s call that pypi-custom.</p>
<p>My issue: years ago a former employee uploaded a copy of <code>urllib3</code> and <code>requests</code> to pypi-custom (I don&#x27;t know why) - and only the source (no whl). Moving from <code>pip</code> to <code>uv</code> my resolutions now <em>always</em> use the old versions of those packages from pypi-custom. It can even cause errors if some other dependency requires a newer version of those two packages.</p>
<p>I like <code>uv</code>&#x27;s behavior of checking extra indices before checking the default, for security, so I don&#x27;t want to globally disable that (but that would be one possible solution).</p>
<p>Before I saw the above linked issue, I thought perhaps I could just override the <code>sources</code> globally for those two packages to refer to pypi.</p>
<p>One option could be to just delete the packages from pypi-custom, but then I think that would break existing lock files.</p>
<p>Another option would require everyone (at least those who care enough) to add <code>sources</code> to their project (<code>pyproject.toml</code> or <code>uv.toml</code>). However, this is a pretty nuanced issue as far as my userbase is concerned, so it would require education/documentation. It is also kind of a nuisance to have to carry around that boilerplate.</p>
<p>Is there an elegant solution I&#x27;m missing?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice and for the wonderful tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for writing this up. I think it&#x27;s the same as <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6772">astral-sh/uv#6772</a> -- we&#x27;d need to allow you to put sources in the system-level configuration, which isn&#x27;t allowed today. I don&#x27;t know of a better solution than replicating it in each project, as you described, but you should follow-along in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6772">astral-sh/uv#6772</a>.</p>
