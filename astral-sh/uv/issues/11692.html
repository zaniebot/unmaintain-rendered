            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When a new project is created by the init command, <code>.gitignore</code> is also automatically created, probably here:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/88aa6e26d15828af514038ba04459830ee2ed00b/crates/uv-configuration/src/vcs.rs#L69
However, currently, the gitignore file is constant and does not respect anything, especially build-backend options.
Users currently need to add additional specifications to gitignore by hand after the project is created.
For example, when I used maturin for the build-backend, I had to add several lines to gitignore.
Of course it was completely fine to add lines by hand, but I was wondering if it was intentional that, say, the <code>target</code> folder was not ignored, and a bit confused.
Maybe adding all possible gitignore lines would be useful although I'm not sure if it could cause potential conflict.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would indeed be cool/nice, although it's a bit difficult when the entire premise of build-backends is that anyone can make a new one because they follow a rigid structure. We don't really have much build-backend-specific code at all as a result, so this would potentially add a big hazardous maintenance burden.</p>
<p>The most likely place where we might do something here is with <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11446">our own build backend, uv_build</a>, where we can safely and accurately maintain the gitignore without stepping on any other project's toes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>💡 Suggestion: Add support for custom <code>.gitignore</code> templates in <code>uv init</code></h3>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
Currently, <code>uv init</code> can initialize a Git repository via <code>--vcs git</code>, but it doesn’t allow specifying or customizing a <code>.gitignore</code> file. It either creates a default one (if any) or leaves it to the user to add manually.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal:</strong>
Add an option such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv init --gitignore &lt;path or template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept a path to a custom <code>.gitignore</code> file, or</li>
<li>Support predefined templates (e.g., <code>python</code>, <code>rust</code>, <code>none</code>) similar to GitHub’s <code>.gitignore</code> templates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefit:</strong>
This would streamline project setup, reduce manual steps, and make <code>uv init</code> more flexible for teams with standard repository configurations.</p>
