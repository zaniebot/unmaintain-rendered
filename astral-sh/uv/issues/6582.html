            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently use a mix of pyenv, pipx, and Poetry in our Python projects and I'm very interested in uv's potential to replace all of these tools.</p>
<p>One of the things that we want to be able to do is to use the public PyPI index by default, but use our internal Artifactory index for  specific organization-internal dependencies. We don't want to search the public PyPI index for those private dependencies in case there's a public one with the same name, and we don't want everything to go through our Artifactory index because of the impact on cost from the data transfer.</p>
<p>With Poetry, we can do this via <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#explicit-package-sources">explicit sources</a> - is there a way to accomplish the same sort of behavior with uv?</p>
<p>For example, our pyproject.toml file would include this configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = &quot;&gt;=3.11,&lt;3.12&quot;
my-private-package = {version = &quot;^0.12.0&quot;, source = &quot;private_artifactory&quot;}
rich = &quot;^13.7.1&quot;

[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = &quot;PyPI&quot;
priority = &quot;primary&quot;

[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = &quot;private_artifactory&quot;
url = &quot;https://&lt;organization host&gt;/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi/simple&quot;
priority = &quot;explicit&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No prob! One thing to note: if you set your Artifactory index via <code>extra-index-url</code>, then by default, uv will <em>not</em> look in PyPI at all if a package exists in your Artifactory index. This differs from pip's behavior but protects you from dependency confusion attacks (your first requirement).</p>
<p>(I know it doesn't solve the second requirement of skipping your own index to save on data transfer.)</p>
