# uv doesn't respect pyproject.toml dependencies

_Issue opened by @ac130kz on 2024-02-16 05:13_

I'm trying out a very basic example, and it simply ignores what is specified in the PEP 621 dependencies section of a pyproject.toml. I get that there should be a lock file requirements.txt in the final environment, but in a lockless scenario it has to install everything, right?

uv version 0.1.1

```bash
user@hostname ~/w/e/o/example> uv pip install pyproject.toml

Oh, sorry, there's actually a `-r` flag, which I forgot.
