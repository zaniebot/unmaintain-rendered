            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Is it possible to use <code>uv run /absolute/path/to/some/script.py</code> and have it use the script's project directory. For example, given a project like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">my_project/
├── scripts/
│   └── foo.py
├── src/
│   └── ...
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to use <code>uv run /path/to/my_project/scripts/foo.py</code> virtual environment. I know this is possible with <code>--directory</code>.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.12 (e4e03833f 2025-04-02)</p>

<p>It's part of a RPA workflow in Power Automate in which the user passes a path to a script, which is assumed to be part of a <code>uv</code> project. These projects are not meant to be installed per se, but are more dev projects.</p>
<p>Also, the scripts are located in <code>my_project/scripts/</code> directory and are not part of the package namespace; I tried the <code>file:///${PROJECT_ROOT}/&quot;</code> workaround from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9495 to create a self-contained <code>uv</code> script, but that only works if the script is executed from the project directory it seems.</p>
