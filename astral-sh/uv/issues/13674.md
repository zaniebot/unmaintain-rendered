# uv pip install doesn't install CLI tools properly

_Issue opened by @PantiL on 2025-05-27 10:18_

### Summary

Hello.
I encountered a problem that has already been described here.
[https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4151](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4151)
I repeated the installation commands exactly as indicated here.
```
$ uv init my_project
Initialized project 'my-project' at '/home/pan/projects/fastapi/my_project'
$ cd my_project/
$ uv venv
Using CPython 3.12.3 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python3.12
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
$ uv pip install fastapi

$ which fastapi
/home/pan/projects/fastapi/my_project/.venv/bin/fastapi
$ fastapi --help
To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]"

Traceback (most recent call last):

    sys.exit(main())
             ^^^^^^

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RuntimeError: To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

```
But the problem remains.
The problem was solved only by installing fastapi-cli manually
```
$ uv pip install fastapi-cli

The first time you install fastapi via `uv pip`, you don't install the `standard` extra.
The second time, you run `pip install "fastapi[standard]"`. This `pip` refers to the user/system installation, uv does not include it in the venv.

Try running `uv pip install "fastapi[standard]"`in the first place.

👍 Yeah, this all looks correct -- you need to run `uv pip install "fastapi[standard]"` to use the FastAPI CLI. That's not specific to uv.
