# What's the best way to cite this project?

---

_Issue opened by @Pacatro on 2025-06-03 15:02_

### Question

Hi! I'm currently working on a project that uses `uv`, and I was wondering if there is a way to cite this repository in [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/) format. I've seen that some GitHub repositories include a "Cite this repository" option, but that doesn't seem to be available here.

Would it be possible to add support for this feature, or could you provide a recommended citation format for referencing `uv` in academic or technical work?

Hey! Can you share an example you've seen in another repository?

Yep, that's what I'm talking about.

uv doesn't have a publication, so you can cite it like an other website or `@misc`. In your journal's citation guidelines, there may be specific notes on software or GitHub that you need to follow.

@zanieb  As a suggestion, `uv` could be archived with [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) like any other scientific software. That would generate a DOI and a corresponding citation. The source code would also be preserved as well.

For example, Conda is archived on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10055409.

edit: it looks like even [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/news/2021/05/22/conda-forge-is-now-citable/) created a [Zenodo entry](https://zenodo.org/records/4774217) to be citable as well. This is what their [`CITATION.cff` looks like on their repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/CITATION.cff)

For posterity, I looked into this briefly...

- I am supportive of publishing each release to Zenodo
- It turns out they have a GitHub Integration that just "does this" using a webhook on release
- However, they require admin permissions to webhooks, which is unacceptable for us for security reasons
- There's not a way to set up a GitHub Integration with a manually added webhook, maybe that's a feature request
- We can add a job that manually performs the upload to our CI
- I futzed with some AI to generate a GitHub Action / bash script we could use on release, but it doesn't seem entirely trivial
- We can't prioritize adding something like that to our release process, though I would review a contribution if it is high quality and tested on a fork with the Zenodo sandbox
