# universal-lock: ignore dependencies that are disjoint with a forked resolver state's marker expressions

---

_Issue opened by @BurntSushi on 2024-06-10 12:49_

This is very similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4102, but for general marker expressions. For example, if a resolver state was forked via a dependency specification like `quux ; sys_platform == "linux"`, and then we come across a dependency specification like `foo ; sys_platform == "windows"`, then we should ignore that dependency entirely in that specific fork of the resolver because it can never happen.
