# No way to install libraries on specific python `--system`

---

_Issue opened by @SkeletonMask on 2025-06-03 14:46_

### Question

I got a few python versions installed, how to specify an installation of packages on a specific python version (not in venv)

`--system` defaults to 3.10 no matter which python version i pin with `uv python pin 3.X`

### Platform

Ubuntu 

### Version

uv 0.7.9

`--system` selects a Python that is not managed by uv, presumably that's just the version you have on your system?

`uv pip install --system -p <version>` might get you what you want?

Indeed, `--system -p` only works on python that is not managed by uv?

```
pixel@pop-os:~$ uv pip install requests --system -p 3.13
error: No system Python installation found for Python 3.13
```

python 3.13 was installed by uv

As I said, `--system` selects a Python that is not managed by uv. It selects one that is found on your system.

We don't support installing into our managed Python versions, you'd need to create a virtual environment and just activate it by default, e.g., as in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#using-the-environment
