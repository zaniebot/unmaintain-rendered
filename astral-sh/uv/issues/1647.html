            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install ruff # installs the latest version
&gt; uv pip install --resolution=lowest ruff
Audited 1 package in 0ms
</code></pre>
<p>I expected that this would install the lowest version of ruff.
I think that either changing the behaviour, or documenting this is suitable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think our behavior here is actually okay, because it's consistent in general with how <code>pip install</code> works: if you have a satisfactory version in your environment, it defers to that. But we should document it somewhere / somehow.</p>
