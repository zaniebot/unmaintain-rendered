            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried following the installation configuration <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/installer/#changing-the-install-path">documentation</a> in order to set-up uv in another custom path, but it seems that later, when using its binary, some paths and configurations are still pointing to the local fs, under <code>/home/user/...</code>. Like sometimes when I call <code>uv run</code> or <code>uv sync</code> there is a warning about copy failing and fallbacking to copy-link. That is intented because I mount a remote a fs between my machines in order to share the installation and the envs. I wish uv to be able to install and use only this remote mounted fs whichever the machines I am sshing into. How can I do it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you'll want to set <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code>, <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code>, and <code>XDG_STATE_HOME</code> to a location on your other file system.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. Is it planned to implement this by dedicated uv envs instead of exporting system/user shared envs?</p>
