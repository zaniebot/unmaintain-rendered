# Conda-pack like feature for venv?

---

_Issue opened by @zarif98 on 2024-10-29 03:05_

Is it possible to have something like this: https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/ for moving environments around? We have a ton of tools that run our software and it would be nice to be just able to copy/paste an environment when needed.
