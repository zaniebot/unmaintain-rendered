<p>I&#x27;m guessing this is somewhat intentional, but seems like a footgun?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should probably (1) preserve the specifier, and (2) error if the specifier is a URL and sources is set. Can you merge with #4604 and #4603 if correct?</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s a little different than #4604, though the fix for #4604 may resolve this. #4604 / #4603 are checking for coherence between the resolved source and the PEP 508 dependency. Here, I&#x27;m complaining that the PEP 508 dependency is not validated <em>independently</em> of the source. The resolution without sources needs to be valid to publish the package.</p>
<p>Do you think we should close in favor of those still?</p>
