            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hi, congrats on 0.3.0!</p>
<p>I've noticed one very useful pipx option that <code>uv tool</code> is currently missing: <code>--install-deps</code>. It means that it also adds the CLIs of packages it depends on. This is crucial for something like Ansible where the essential commands are hidden in sub-packages.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be great if this could allow multiple dependencies to be installed in the same venv and for all of their executables to be exposed. More info in this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/issues/1061">rye feature request</a>. This would allow me to install ansible,ansible-core and ansible-lint in the same venv, saving disk space and negating version mismatch issues.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The way it works in <code>rye</code> is that <code>--include-dep</code> names the particular dependency and installs then the tools that that particular dependency provides so it's not quite as crazy as installing all.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that was what I meant, as long as you can specify multiple dependencies that way. My main issue with rye was that it allowed you to only specify 1 dependency to include executables from (or at least I couldn't get it to work with more than 1).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had a look at all the linked issues and also asked some feedback out of band; I sketched some code to implement this, and I want to recap the proposed behavior. I'm not interested in debating the specific flag name right now, so let me call it <code> --i-want-ponies</code> for the moment.</p>
<p>Using ansible as an example, I'll highlight these three packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ansible</code>: top-level package tool, provides the <code>ansible-community</code> executable and depends on <code>ansible-core</code>.</li>
<li><code>ansible-core</code>: mainly exists as a dependency of the above, provides 11 executables (including for example <code>ansible-playbook</code> and <code>ansible-inventory</code>).</li>
<li><code>ansible-lint</code>: sits on its own and provides the <code>ansible-lint</code> executable.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>uv</code> can offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv tool install ansible</code>: installs <code>ansible-community</code>.</li>
<li><code>uv tool install --i-want-ponies ansible-core ansible</code>: like the previous, plus it installs all the 11 executables from its <code>-core</code> dependency (including for example <code>ansible-playbook</code> and <code>ansible-inventory</code>).</li>
<li><code>uv tool install --i-want-ponies ansible-core --i-want-ponies ansible-lint ansible</code>: like the previous, plus it brings in an extra package <code>ansible-lint</code> and installs its executable. It doesn't need an explicit additional <code>--with</code> if the package is not already a dependency of the top tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a side note, at some point this may end up bringing in too many executables (e.g. from fat packages like <code>ansible-core</code>), so possibly there will be a need to grow an additional flag to specify an allow-list of globs to filter executables by name. I'll leave that for a separate ticket.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a nice fix for the simple ansible case, but if my goal is to use ansible-lint I think I would have to install the tools as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv tool install ansible-lint --with ansible

<p>In one invocation, then in a separate tool install:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv tool install ansible-core --with ansible
</code></pre>
<p>which would mean that ansible-lint and the rest of ansible could get out of sync, which seems like it would be a nightmare if the two tool environments ever fell out of sync.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@gaby: out of curiosity, how many packages do you have with that problem? Of the 15 I'm installing, I <em>only</em> have the missing-executable-problem with ansible, to my surprise. What I'm installing is mostly individual tools like &quot;ruff&quot;, &quot;docutils&quot;, which apparently don't have dependencies with executables.</p>
<p>If you have a &quot;tool-collection-of-my-company&quot; package which groups useful tools as dependencies: yeah, that'll quickly become a pain to install currently.</p>
<p>(I'm all in favour of <code>--include-deps</code>, btw.)</p>

<p>It seems way to easy to pull in a bunch of random executables this way? It sounds like what you need is some sort of <code>uv tool show &lt;name&gt; --include-deps</code> so you can just see the executables up front.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@reinout Yes, besides ansible, pylint, ruff, uv, jc, gitlab (which has sdk/cli), the main use case is internal enterprise tools. Most of them are <code>Typer</code> or <code>Textual</code> apps that are bundled/distributed together in one or many wheels.</p>
<p>@zanieb You mean like before installing? Or if a tool is installed already to be able to see which apps it provides?</p>
<p>Right now we install things using pipx:</p>
<p><code>pipx install --global MyEnterpriseApp --include-deps</code>. This install the app in a Global VENV (/opt/pipx/venvs/myenterpriseapp) and also adds each app cli to <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.</p>
<p>These are multi-user systems were most users dont have sudo, they just use the provided tools by the system (python typer apps).</p>

<p>Could you explain the risk you are concerned about? With <code>pipx</code> if you use the <code>--include-deps</code> argument, you are specifically asking to install the executables from dependencies, which I wouldn't describe as installing &quot;random executables&quot;.</p>
<p>Perhaps including a <code>--dry-run</code> option would help to ease concerns? e.g. <code>uv tool install --include-deps --dry-run ansible</code>. You already have the dry-run feature available in: <code>uv pip install --dry-run</code>. This could be extended to show the executables installed by each package when called with <code>uv tool install</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps random was not a great word choice. There can be arbitrary transitive dependencies. It worry about it (1) being surprising which executables are installed and (2) that these executables could conflict with other tools.</p>
<p>A <code>--dry-run</code> option is a solution. I prefer a more explicit interface over <code>--include-deps</code> though.</p>

<p>I think I still disagree with the term &quot;arbitrary&quot;. If I use the <code>--include-deps</code> argument, then I'm specifically making an informed decision that I want all of the dependent executables installed too, there's nothing arbitrary about it. Sure, I might be surprised that Ansible includes the &quot;ansible-doc&quot; executable, which I've never used or needed, but I'm fine it being there in case I ever want to use it.</p>
<p>With regards to conflicting executables - isn't this only an issue when the executables are linked from the bin directory? And uv already handles the case where an executable already exists in the bin directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let's talk specifics.  With <code>pipx</code> I like to install ansible and various ansible-related tools (ansible-lint, molecule) in the same virtualenv, which I do with</p>
<pre><code>pipx install --incude-deps ansible
pipx inject ansible dnspython  # some of ansible plugins I use depends on dnspython
pipx inject --include-apps ansible ansible-lint
pipx inject --include-apps ansible molecule</code></pre>
<p>(incidentally, I'd love it if <code>uv tool</code> supported <code>inject</code>.  pipx remembers all the packages I've injected in a little .json file somewhere in the virtualenv and can reinstall them all at a later time with <code>pipx reinstall-all</code>, which is very helpful when I upgrade my system python from, say 3.12 to 3.13).</p>
<p>The thing here is that pipx inject has three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pipx inject</code> with no flags installs the extra packages but doesn't symlink any binaries into ~/.local/bin</li>
<li><code>pipx inject --include-apps</code> installs the packages and symlinks their scripts, but doesn't symlink any scripts from transitive dependencies</li>
<li><code>pipx inject --include-deps</code> installs packages and symlinks everything</li>
</ul>
<p>If I'd used <code>pipx inject --include-deps ansible-lint</code>, then I'd get an extra, unwanted ~/.local/bin/black, since black is one of the dependencies for ansible-lint.  I don't want my generic Python code formatter to be managed as part of an ansible-related tool virtualenv; I want to install and upgrade it separately and explicitly.</p>
<p>I guess this is the concern that @zanieb had: installing scripts from all transitive dependencies is sometimes undesireable.  I found that pipx's solution (a separate pipx inject command) allows me to control this in a fine-grained way, and I'd be happy if uv adopted the same solution (<code>uv tool inject [--include-apps|--include-deps] ...</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wanted to expand on the &quot;enterprise&quot; use case that gaby and reinout mention above (which I also have), since this thread has a lot of ansible examples, but I think this has at least one or two more use cases beyond that.</p>
<p>In my org, we ship an internal CLI application, that declares an optional extra <code>bins</code>, which is a collection of other CLI tools that are frequently used at the company.  It's nice to be able to <code>pipx install internal-cli[bins] --include-deps</code>, and get not only our org-internal CLI, but these other useful tools available on the $PATH in one shot.</p>
<p>One particularly nice thing about this approach is that as new versions of the internal CLI are published with updates to the <code>bins</code> optional extras dependency list, people only need to <code>pipx upgrade internal-cli</code> to get these new tools which can easily be aliased into a <code>self update</code> command in our org CLI.  self-update would be harder to implement if we needed to use a separate <code>pipx install</code> for every extra bin tool or something like <code>--executable</code> to explicitly list everything, though it's certainly not impossible!</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope that motivates a use case beyond &quot;making ansible + uvx cleaner&quot;, but totally understand if you don't want to support this :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My use case is that I want to install jupyterlab as a tool but have access to the <code>jupyter</code> executable, which I used to get with <code>pipx install jupyterlab --include-deps</code>.</p>
<p>It seems that the suggested <code>uv tool install jupyterlab --executable jupyter</code> would be a good solution to this. Is there a workaround to this for now?</p>

<p>It's not a bad idea per se, but it means the user would have to know beforehand the names of all the executables. And some packages (e.g. Ansible) have many!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Any updates on this? I think the solution to this issue would greatly increase the value of using uv for me because it means I can safely get rid of pipx which I only use for that purpose (and <code>ansible</code> specifically).</p>

<p>Now i install ansible with following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool install ansible-core --with-executables-from ansible --with-executables-from yamllint --with-executables-from ansible-lint --with-executables-from molecule

<p>There is an example specifically for Ansible also in <code>uv</code> web documentation at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/#installing-executables-from-additional-packages</p>
<p><code>uv tool install --with-executables-from ansible-core,ansible-lint ansible</code></p>
<p>In my case works well, like the traditional <code>uvx</code> does.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using <code>--with-executables-from</code> is such a bad UX. Now I have to keep track of every dependency with executables.</p>
