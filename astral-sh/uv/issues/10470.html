            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A member of one of my workspaces has the following build-system section in its <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]
requires = [&quot;pdm-backend&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;pdm.backend&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>When running <code>uv lock</code> from the workspace, the section for the global workspace reads:</p>
<pre><code>
[[package]]
name = &quot;my-workspace&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
source = { virtual = &quot;.&quot; }
dependencies = [
    { name = &quot;member&quot; },
]

[package.metadata]
requires-dist = [
    { name = &quot;member&quot;, virtual = &quot;visualization&quot; },
]
</code></pre>
<p>If I add the build system section, it is correctly detected as a <code>directory</code> dependency.</p>
<p>I would have expected an error or a warning from <code>uv lock</code>. I realise this can be used for recursive workspaces: in my case, I would have spotted the issue much faster if <code>uv lock</code> had printed a recap of the workspace structure at the end of its run.</p>
