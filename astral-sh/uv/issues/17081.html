            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Completions generated by <code>uv</code> include a bunch of hidden options and subcommands, in some cases these hidden options are beneficial to keep in the completions (e.g. <code>--no-</code> variants of certain flags) but in other cases such they should probably not be included as they're misleading.</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>InitArgs::backend</code> - this exists to redirect users to the correct option (<code>--build-backend</code>)</li>
<li><code>ToolInstallArgs::from</code> - redundant option</li>
<li><code>GenerateShellCompletionArgs</code> - broadly the options in here don't do anything and seem to just exist to avoid errors?</li>
<li><code>BuildBackendCommand</code> - this isn't meant to be used directly by end users at all</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably other arguments/subcommands like these.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Power users would find it easier to tab complete options they want, and newer users would avoid confusion when they discover invalid/intentionally hidden options through the completions.</p>
