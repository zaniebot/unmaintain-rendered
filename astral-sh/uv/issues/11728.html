            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When I run:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install pytrec-eval-terrier==0.5.6
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following certificate error:</p>
<pre><code>...
&quot;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/urllib/request.py&quot;,
      line 1351, in do_open
          raise URLError(err)
      urllib.error.URLError: &lt;urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]
      certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
      (_ssl.c:997)&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>but this does not happen with pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install pytrec-eval-terrier==0.5.6 
</code></pre>
<p>As I understand, this is caused by the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#http-authentication">difference</a> in how certificates are handled. However, I don't know how to work around this. I have read through the linked docs as well as searched for related issues (e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6572#issuecomment-2594166728 which suggest enabling <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#native-tls"><code>native-tls</code></a>).</p>
<p>This issue is specific to this package</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>MacOS (Darwin 24.3.0 arm64)</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.2 (6d3614eec 2025-02-19)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_native_tls">UV_NATIVE_TLS</a> if you don't want to modify your pyproject.toml. Note, it's possible you have <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/https-certificates/">global.cert </a> configured via pip config hence why you may see pip working but not uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thanks @samypr100. Playing around with the global.cert, I have resolved the issue (or at least moved on to a new one).</p>
<p>I will close this issue - thanks for the help!</p>
