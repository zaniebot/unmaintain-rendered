We end up persisting to a directory that we then remove. You end up with errors like:

```
error: Failed to read metadata for: uv==0.2.27
  Caused by: failed to open file `/Users/crmarsh/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/hatch/lib/python3.12/site-packages/uv-0.2.27.dist-info/METADATA`
  Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

We should actually just reject this combination, there's no way to make it work.
