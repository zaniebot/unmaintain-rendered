            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell, <code>tool.uv.dependency-metadata</code> are not supported for Path sources.</p>
<p>For some motivation, I have a piece of proprietary software which installs a wheel file at a specific location in Windows, say <code>C:/Program Files/ProprietaryFoo/foo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl</code>. I'd like it to be an optional dependency for the project so I have</p>
<pre><code class="language-TOML">[project]
optional-dependencies.foo = [ &quot;foo; sys_platform=='win32'&quot; ]

[tool.uv.sources]
foo = { path = &quot;C:/Program Files/ProprietaryFoo/foo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl&quot;, marker = &quot;sys_platform == 'win32'&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>This works fine locally, but then on CI running Linux, the resolver will try to access the path, which doesn't exist, similar to #8389.</p>
<p>As a temporary workaround, I'm just going to create a dummy <code>.whl</code> at that location on the CI.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Ideally, I'd like to be able to declare <code>dependency-metadata</code> over-rides to make it possible to avoid resolving this path when the markers don't match. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-TOML">[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-dist = [ &quot;protobuf&lt;6.0.0,&gt;=5.29.0&quot; ]
</code></pre>
<p>However, as it stands, this doesn't seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>Perhaps as an aside, it would also be nice if the dependency over-rides kicked in even when the markers match (e.g. if the proprietary software wasn't installed on Windows). I don't think it should be necessary to access the wheel file unless actually trying to install the optional dependency (it's optional, after all).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is for a (local) path dependency (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#path), not a URL dependency.</p>
<p>In terms of a minimal reproduction, try setting <code>pyproject.toml</code> to the following and running on Linux:</p>
<pre><code class="language-TOML">[project]
name = &quot;demo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.13&quot;
dependencies = []
optional-dependencies.foo = [ &quot;foo; sys_platform=='win32'&quot; ]

[tool.uv.sources]
foo = { path = &quot;C:/Program Files/ProprietaryFoo/foo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl&quot;, marker = &quot;sys_platform == 'win32'&quot; }

[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-dist = [ &quot;protobuf&lt;6.0.0,&gt;=5.29.0&quot; ]
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect <code>uv sync</code> to run successfully on Linux in this case, since the <code>foo</code> dependency has its metadata declared explicitly, and resolving from the (non-existent) path shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>Similarly, on Windows, the following <code>pyproject.toml</code> should reproduce:</p>
<details>

<pre><code class="language-TOML">[project]
name = &quot;demo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.13&quot;
dependencies = []
optional-dependencies.foo = [ &quot;foo; sys_platform=='linux'&quot; ]

[tool.uv.sources]
foo = { path = &quot;/foo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl&quot;, marker = &quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot; }

[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-dist = [ &quot;protobuf&lt;6.0.0,&gt;=5.29.0&quot; ]
</code></pre>
</details>

<p>Which gives the following log when running <code>uv sync -vvv</code>:</p>
