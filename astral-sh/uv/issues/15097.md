# uv fails to find a wheel that pip finds

---

_Issue opened by @sidnarayanan on 2025-08-06 02:59_

### Summary

With python 3.13.5 and uv 0.8.4, the following fails (I don't have a Rust compiler installed on this system):
```
uv pip install outlines-core==0.1.26
Resolved 7 packages in 9ms
  × Failed to build `outlines-core==0.1.26`
  ├─▶ The build backend returned an error
  ╰─▶ Call to `setuptools.build_meta.build_wheel` failed (exit status: 1)

      [stdout]
[...]
      error: can't find Rust compiler

      If you are using an outdated pip version, it is possible a prebuilt wheel is available for this package but pip is not able to install from it. Installing from the wheel would avoid the need for a Rust compiler.

      To update pip, run:

          pip install --upgrade pip

      and then retry package installation.

      If you did intend to build this package from source, try installing a Rust compiler from your system package manager and ensure it is on the PATH during installation. Alternatively, rustup (available at
      https://rustup.rs) is the recommended way to download and update the Rust compiler toolchain.

      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
```

pip is however able to find the corresponding wheel:
```
pip install outlines-core==0.1.26

(figured it out - the pip executable was resolving to another venv)
