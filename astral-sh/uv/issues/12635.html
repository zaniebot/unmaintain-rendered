            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I tried running the following command to install on Windows: <code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</code>. From the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/">installation docs page</a>. This command worked for me previously.</p>
<p>But I'm getting the following error now:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/095aa375-0bd0-4abe-b468-ca2353f41f06" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>This is on my work laptop (corporate IT-managed 🤮). But as I said, this command worked for me previously. Has something changed on the uv side that would cause this error? Or do I need to talk to our IT department?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
