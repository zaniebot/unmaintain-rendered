            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We recommend not backing up venvs and not adding them to version control. Instead, the venv should be treated as ephemeral, something you can always recreate with <code>uv sync</code>. The &quot;source of truth&quot; would be <code>uv.lock</code> which contains all the information about how to create the venv and should be checked into the git repository.</p>
