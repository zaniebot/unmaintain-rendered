# Add `--no-upgrade-package` to opt-out of upgrading a specific package

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-09-07 18:42_

Originally mentioned in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6781#issuecomment-2318265988

An inverse of `--upgrade-package` so you can do `--upgrade --no-upgrade-package foo` to avoid upgrading a single package.
