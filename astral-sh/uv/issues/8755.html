            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In CD workflows, it's handy to have a tool that can read and write the version of the project in its <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version"><code>poetry version</code></a> (with no arguments) prints the project's version (in one of a few formats), and <code>poetry version x.y.z</code> updates the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file and sets <code>tool.poetry.version = x.y.z</code>.</p>
<p>I use both of these features in Harlequin's CD workflows, first to<a href="https://github.com/tconbeer/harlequin/blob/29faeb7f9d8ef4558269b1d8df5a5c34bf9de3a2/.github/workflows/release.yml#L54-L55"> set the version</a> from the release branch name, and then to <a href="https://github.com/tconbeer/harlequin/blob/29faeb7f9d8ef4558269b1d8df5a5c34bf9de3a2/.github/workflows/publish.yml#L50-L63">create a GitHub release</a> after the package is published. I would love to use uv instead.</p>
<p>(Poetry also includes a feature to bump the version based on a &quot;bump rule&quot; like <code>minor</code>, but I don't use that feature personally).</p>
<p>Today <code>uv version</code> and <code>uv --version</code> both display uv's version, not the project version.</p>
<p>This feature is similar to #5975 , and might be a subcommand of <code>uv info</code> or <code>uv show</code> (or <code>uv project</code>): <code>uv info version --short</code> etc. For CD use cases, it's important that the version number is easy to extract from the output.</p>
