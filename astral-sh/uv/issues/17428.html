            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>My organization is considering adopting uv but I have a question.  For security reasons, we&#x27;d like to have uv use a version of Python that has been centrally installed so that it is kept up-to-date.  If an environment has been set up to use this Python installation, and Python gets updated by system administrators, say from version 3.12 to 3.13, what are the consequences for existing venv&#x27;s?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess my question is what happens if the old one gets deleted -- short term this is not a problem but long term, old versions may be deprecated and may be centrally uninstalled.</p>
<p>And a related question is, if there are two Python versions installed, and UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON=&quot;true&quot;, which version of Python will uv use for new environments?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you delete it, the virtual environment will be broken. In projects, uv will generally transparently replace it with a new one on <code>sync</code>.</p>

<p>We&#x27;ll use the one that comes first on the <code>PATH</code>, unless you&#x27;ve pinned a specific one.</p>

<p>So for a broken environment, a uv sync will fix it?  Say Python is upgraded from 3.12 to 3.13, will the environment continue using 3.12 or does the NO_MANAGED_PYTHON flag force it to upgrade?</p>

<p>Ok, that&#x27;s useful to know.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by the <code>NO_MANAGED_PYTHON</code> part, but once you delete the Python installation how would uv continue to use 3.12?</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll see something like..</p>
<pre><code>warning: Ignoring existing virtual environment linked to non-existent Python interpreter: .venv/bin/python3 -&gt; python

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I&#x27;m wondering is whether uv would use 3.12 from https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone or if it would force a transition to 3.13.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We won&#x27;t use a managed version if you have it disabled, no.</p>
<p>If you have a <code>.python-version</code> file pinning to 3.12 and 3.12 is no longer available, we&#x27;ll just fail.</p>
