# uv 0.2.32 ignores development resolutions when running `pip compile`

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

The issue title isn't great, I'm not sure how to best describe this. However, here's a reproduction:

In `a.in`:
```
cffi
```

In `a.txt`:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile a.in -o a.txt
cffi==1.17.0rc1
    # via -r a.in
pycparser==2.22
    # via cffi
```

Now, run `uv pip compile a.in -o a.txt` and note that `a.txt` was modified to become:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile a.in -o a.txt
cffi==1.16.0
    # via -r a.in
pycparser==2.22
    # via cffi
```

Note that I'm not passing any sort of upgrade flag. This did not happen in `uv==0.2.26`. I can reproduce this on both Debian Linux and Windows. Found in https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/3043.

For context, there was some previous discussion about prereleases with pip compile in the out file: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3602.
