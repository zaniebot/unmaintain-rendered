            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First a big thumbs up for the great work you&#x27;re doing with ruff and uv! We have adopted both in our company, and we&#x27;re overwhelmed!</p>
<p>I have just a quick request for clarification: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/ implies that it is always necessary (or at least best practice) to have the file <code>.python-version</code> checked in. But for standards-compliant projects that define <code>project.requires-python</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, this seems obsolete. I tried it out, and in fact, uv correctly detects <code>project.requires-python</code> and installs the intended python version, even without <code>.python-version</code>.</p>
<p>In our project, I wanted to remove <code>.python-version</code>, so that we don&#x27;t have the python version defined in 2 separate places. But then I became insecure because of the documentation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think it would be helpful to add a remark to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/, mentioning that <code>.python-version</code> is obsolete in this case. WDYT?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>.python-version</code> file is not quite obsolete with <code>requires-python</code> -- they&#x27;re subtly different. <code>requires-python</code> is the range of versions supported by your project. <code>.python-version</code> is the exact version you want to use when developing. For example, if you&#x27;re working on a library, your <code>requires-python</code> might be <code>&gt;= &quot;3.10&quot;</code>. But when developing on your machine, you might want to use <code>3.12.4</code> by default -- so you&#x27;d set that in a <code>.python-version</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, I wonder if we can just add a <code>tool.uv.python-resolution</code> (which could be <code>highest</code>, <code>lowest</code>, <code>lowest-major</code>, <code>3.10.15</code>, etc.) but would be overriden if <code>.python-version</code> does exist.</p>
<p>This would save projects from one excess file (<code>.python-version</code>) in the git tracking. And would permit maintainers to specify a certain Python version for development, but give contributors a hook to change this if desired (and without altering any git-tracked file).</p>
<p>Happy to attempt a PR if this sounds reasonable!</p>

<p>Yeah; I&#x27;d like to have a <code>python-strategy</code> or something, it just hasn&#x27;t been implemented. If you&#x27;re interested, you&#x27;re welcome to give it a go.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand the need for specifically specifying a python version, but I would argue a better default behaviour for <code>uv init</code> should be to specify this as a separate setting within pyproject.toml with the same reasoning as in #8920 , AKA, not worth adding a whole new file to the root folder for.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>They have different meanings though. <code>requires-python</code> is not meant for that purpose -- it&#x27;s meant to indicate your minimum-supported Python version. They&#x27;re distinct concepts, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good practice to encourage them to be mixed like that.</p>

<p>No, I&#x27;m saying add a specific <code>tools.uv</code> setting like <code>python-version</code> inside pyproject.toml apart from the existing <code>requires-python</code> setting.</p>
<p>Yes there&#x27;s a need to specify a specific python version, but there&#x27;s no need for it to be specified in a separate file, much less dedicate an entire file for a single config setting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are already issues tracking that at <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4970">astral-sh/uv#4970</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4359">astral-sh/uv#4359</a></p>
<p>There is a reason to have it in a separate file — other tools can read it. For example, GitHub Actions&#x27;s <code>setup-python</code> action can read a version from a <code>.python-file</code> but not from a <code>[tool.uv]</code> option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, once those PRs are merged, I&#x27;d still argue that the default behaviour should still be to put it in pyproject.toml first, and if needed a user can always move it to it&#x27;s own file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO this issue should be wontfixed, since the <code>.python-version</code> file is not equivalent to the <code>pyproject.toml</code> <code>requires-python</code> field. The latter can be a range, which is not suitable/safe for bootstrapping/deployment purposes.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d love for there to be an official single-version field in <code>pyproject.toml</code> (where the single version can be either the full <code>X.Y.Z</code> version, or a major <code>X.Y</code> version), but until there is, there is no like-for-like replacement for <code>.python-version</code> defined in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> spec. (If people would like to see one, then I&#x27;d recommend starting a <a href="https://peps.python.org/">PEP</a> upstream)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree, we won&#x27;t be saying it&#x27;s obsolete. Perhaps there&#x27;s room to improve the documentation though? @charliermarsh I&#x27;m not sure if you were planning on revisiting that. Regardless, we can track in a clearer issue.</p>
