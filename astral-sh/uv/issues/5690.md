# Respect CLI option groups in reference documentation

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-01 16:14_

Follow-up to #5685, we should group options for readability (as they are in the help menu).

Where should we put the global options? If we create a separate page for each command, would that be better?

I worry about the noise of a separate page per command, I like that they're all in the TOC right now not the nav.

I think we could either: 

1. Show the global options in `## uv` then link to it from other commands
2. Show the global options repeatedly per command

Indeed, this was my first thought.

> 2. Show the global options repeatedly per command

And this is why I think it might be too noisy, and it would probably be better to display it on a single page when enabled.
