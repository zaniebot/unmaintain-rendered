# Windows CI fails with `note: LINK : fatal error LNK1318: Unexpected PDB error; LIMIT (12)`

Hey! You found this issue because your Windows CI job failed with an obscure error. The dev drive we use for improved performance just ran out of space — you can probably just increase the size, though note this comes with a trade-off in creation time.

Ah this issue is a great idea! Thank you for making it.

Here's a commit where I bumped the dev drive size to work around this: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5887/commits/a3b4d2625d7b9024597479329e4523d76fff68fa From #5887.
