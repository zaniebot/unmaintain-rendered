            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In case someone has not set <code>XDG_BIN_HOME</code>, it installs into <code>~/.cargo/bin/</code> on Linux.</p>
<p>A common convention is however to install into <code>$HOME/.local/bin</code>. Example: https://gist.github.com/roalcantara/107ba66dfa3b9d023ac9329e639bc58c</p>
<p>The benefit is of course the same as with anything else for the XDG spec. It keeps the home dir clutter free.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am trying to introduce uv into an organization, due to that it obviously is far superior to anything else for anyone who has followed the Python echo system for years. Though I know some developers will frown about creation of directories in the root of the home dir, so this change is, believe it or not, something I will want to wait for. Some devs can be pretty adamant about minor things 😄</p>
