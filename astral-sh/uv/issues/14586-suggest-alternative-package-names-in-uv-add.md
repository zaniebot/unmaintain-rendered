# Suggest Alternative Package Names in ``uv add``

---

_@FishAlchemist_

### Summary

I just saw PR-1(https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14579). 
Maybe we could have `uv add` suggest alternative names when adding a package if the package name is already in a list, similar to PR-2(https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7799). 



The primary reference is PR-1. If PR-1 A is ultimately not going to be merged, then this issue might also need to be closed.
