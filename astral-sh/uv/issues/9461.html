            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, I am from the Mediatek AI team.</p>
<p>We are currently using <code>rye</code> for our project management instead of <code>poetry</code>. However, I came across this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/discussions/1164#discussioncomment-9812734">post</a>, which indicates that Astral will migrate <code>rye</code> to <code>uv</code> instead.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there a full example of the <code>uv</code> configuration, similar to the one provided for <code>rye</code> <a href="https://rye.astral.sh/guide/config/#self">here</a>?</li>
<li>Are there any plans to allow proxy settings to be included in the configuration file? Currently, we use the <code>export</code> <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#https_proxy">method</a> to set the proxy, but in corporate networks, internal and external networks are often separated, so proxy settings are frequently required.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/</p>

<p>Done. The HTTP proxy setting is absolutely essential.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Generally settings like <code>http_proxy</code> or <code>https_proxy</code> should not be part of VCS as it can pose a security risk especially if it would now allow it to be defined on OSS projects. This type of setting goes better on a system / user level config like rye's config.toml.</p>

<p>Thank you for your input. I understand the security concerns associated with including settings like <code>http_proxy</code> or <code>https_proxy</code> in VCS, especially for open source projects. However, I believe it could be beneficial to support these settings in both <code>config.toml</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>For open source projects, it can be unsafe to use these settings in <code>pyproject.toml</code> since it is publicly accessible. But for private projects within a company, this security issue is less relevant because the projects are not accessible externally. In environments with strict PIM policies, having this flexibility can be quite useful. Your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I just found this tool which is great</p>
<p>https://github.com/lucianosrp/rye-uv</p>
<p>it can migrate rye config to uv config; I hope this package can be highlighted maintained by uv officially; it can be helpful for those people who use rye.</p>
