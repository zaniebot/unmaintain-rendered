# How to use the root directory as the search path

---

_Issue opened by @mushengLenzer on 2025-04-14 03:17_

### Question

When I execute uv run bin/main.py, Python will first use ./bin/ as the search path. But I found that the project root directory is also used as a search path on computer A. However, on computer B, the project root directory is not used as the search path. May I ask what the reason is and if it is possible to use the root directory as a lookup directory without setting PYTHONPATH

### Platform

Ubuntu

### Version

uv 0.6.14

Can you share a complete example of your project structure and what commands you're running?
