# `uv pip install` panics when using `*` under windows powershell

---

_Issue opened by @stefanhoelzl on 2025-04-25 08:05_

### Summary

When I run the following command under `powershell`
```uv pip install wheel-*.whl```

uv panics with the following message
```
thread 'main2' panicked at C:\a\uv\uv\crates\uv-pep508\src\lib.rs:464:71:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: InvalidNameError("wheel-")
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

thread 'main' panicked at C:\a\uv\uv\crates\uv\src\lib.rs:2065:10:
Tokio executor failed, was there a panic?: Any { .. }
```

When using `bash` this works. 

Powershell [supports wildcards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_wildcards?view=powershell-7.4).

But at least I would expect a proper error message instead of a Rust panic.

### Platform

Windows 11 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.6.10

### Python version

Python 3.13.2

We're fixing the panic in #13105, but it doesn't seem PowerShell is expanding the glob like bash does.
