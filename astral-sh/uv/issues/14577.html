            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> that includes a source like:</p>
<pre><code>my_source = { workspace = true }
</code></pre>
<p>I also have a dependency group like:</p>
<pre><code>my_group = [&quot;my_source&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>When I run <code>uv sync --only-group other_group</code> or <code>uv sync --package other_package</code> or even <code>uv sync --no-group my_group</code>, I would expect that <code>my_source</code> shouldn&#x27;t attempt to be resolved. It seems as though it&#x27;s doing this because it&#x27;s actually trying to build <code>my_source</code>.</p>
<p>In my case <code>my_source</code> only exists on some occasions (we have some bash scripts we&#x27;re running and in certain scenarios if it&#x27;s unable to reach a server to get the source, it won&#x27;t exist). This is undesirable since <code>uv sync</code>  fails even though it&#x27;s totally able to sync the group(s)/package(s) it needs to. I also imagine that in similar scenarios such as <code>my_source = { url = &quot;&quot; }</code> or <code>my_source = { git = &quot;&quot; } </code>, the remote server might be down, so the package is unable to be built.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there was some workaround to get <code>uv sync</code> working even if one of the dependencies in an excluded group fails to build.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We always lock everything; it&#x27;s required to build a lockfile. You can run with <code>--frozen</code> to skip the locking phase and use an existing lockfile, which is typically what you&#x27;d do if you (e.g.) check-in a lock but need to sync on some other machine that doesn&#x27;t support all the sources.</p>
