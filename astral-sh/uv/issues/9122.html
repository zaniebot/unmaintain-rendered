<p>Suggestions for ways <code>uv</code> could incorporate these:</p>
<ul>
<li>When adding a package to <code>uv.lock</code>, include the identity of the publisher in the CLI output</li>
<li>When upgrading a package in <code>uv.lock</code>, display (as a warning or error) the identity if it changes, or if it goes from identity-&gt;no identity</li>
<li>Some sort of configuration to allow pinning packages to a given identity (and erroring if they don't come from that)</li>
</ul>

Would be nice if <code>uv publish</code> could do the same so that it can be a full replacement for the action.</p>

Feel free to open a pull request, and we can take it from there. However, since attestations are security sensitive, note we may take longer to review the pull request or end up implementing it ourseves.</p>

Thank you for the feedback — I understand. I apologize for the bulk mention and will be more mindful moving forward. I’ll go ahead and open a pull request as suggested.
Totally understand that this may take time to review due to the security sensitivity.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Running attestation/provenance checks to link with the PEP740 data before install would be very interesting security wise. Typo / Slop-squatting is probably only getting a bigger problem with all those agents writing code now. Being able to limit to a list of approved publishers in uv for example would make the mandatory use of private mirrors in enterprises unnecessary and the tool stack much lighter.</p>
<p>It seems like the proposal to include a similar mechanism in pip is somewhat dormant, sadly.</p>
