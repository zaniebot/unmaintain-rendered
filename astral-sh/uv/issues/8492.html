<hr />
<p>I don't know if this is intentional, but the following project cannot be installed on Python 3.13 if I want to avoid building source distributions:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv init example</code></li>
<li><code>cd example</code></li>
<li>Use this <code>pyproject.toml</code>:<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;example&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;scipy &gt;= 1.13.1&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><code>uv sync --python=3.12</code> works (same for <code>3.9</code>, <code>3.10</code>, and <code>3.11</code>)</li>
<li><code>uv sync --python=3.13 --no-build-package=scipy</code> fails, even though it could (should?) use <code>scipy==1.14.1</code>, which is available as a binary wheel.</li>
</ol>
<p>This surprised me because I expected that by specifying <code>scipy &gt;= 1.13.1</code>, uv would automatically choose a newer version with a binary wheel for Python 3.13. Indeed, there are binary wheels for version 1.13.1 available for Python 3.9 through 3.12, but only version ≥ 1.14.0 has a binary wheel for Python 3.13 (though it no longer supports 3.9). However, it seems that uv is trying to maintain consistent package versions across <em>all</em> supported Python versions.</p>

<p>Maybe because it also uses NumPy 2.0.2 on Python &lt;= 3.12?</p>

<p>Overlapping version ranges are fine in uv's model, but you can also make them exclusive as in the example above.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's three parts of the uv resolver interacting here: requires-python, forking and wheel compatibility. uv will only select packages with a requires-python lowest bound at least as high as your project. For example, your project has <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;</code>, while scipy 1.14.1 has <code>Requires-Python: &gt;=3.10</code> (https://inspector.pypi.io/project/scipy/1.14.1/packages/64/68/3bc0cfaf64ff507d82b1e5d5b64521df4c8bf7e22bc0b897827cbee9872c/scipy-1.14.1-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_13_x86_64.whl/scipy-1.14.1.dist-info/METADATA), so we can't select this version and must choose an older version. (If we would select that version, you would get an error trying to <code>uv sync</code> on Python 3.9)</p>
<p>uv also has the forking mechanism (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/resolver-internals/#forking): Whenever we see that a dependency has different requirements for different markers in the same package, we fork and solve once for the one markers and once for the other markers (assuming the markers are disjoint, if they aren't we split some more until we have disjoint environments, there are some implementation details to it). Forking can tighten the requires-python range: If we know we're in an environment from a <code>python_version &gt;= &quot;3.12&quot;</code> marker, we can pick a more recent version - such as scipy 1.14.1 - since the <code>python_version &gt;= &quot;3.9&quot; and python_version &lt; &quot;3.12&quot;</code> range is already handled by the other fork, which can select an older version.</p>
<p>uv is conservative with forking, we only fork on above condition. In a single fork, we have to enforce that there is only a single version per package per resolution (since we can only install a single version). uv also tries to reuse versions between forks when possible, to reduce the divergence between them (less different versions, less things that can go wrong/need to be tested). The latter is the reason that you often have to add an upper bound on the version for getting the right forking results.</p>
<p>Pure python projects don't have an upper bound on their python compatibility: Usually a package published now will work on future python versions. Even for most compiled projects with per-python version shared libraries, you can use them on a newer version by building the source dist. For these and reasons related to how our universal dependency resolution works, we're discarding upper bounds on requires-python (long explanation in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4022).</p>
<p>For numpy, scipy and a number of related projects this assumption isn't true, they really only work for a specific Python range for each version, and you're also not supposed to build them from source (often failing to compile on newer Python versions). Here's the part where uv falls short and you need the manual intervention of specifying <code>python_version</code> markers: uv can't detect that we're trying a package that has compatibility and wheels only for a specific range, and we need to fork to satisfy the full Python version range from the lowest version your project requires to the latest version the dependency supports.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this detailed explanation! I do like how thoroughly uv has been designed, but given that the scientific ecosystem now pushes it beyond its boundaries, I feel like it makes it very hard to use uv in this context. In the simple example with just a single <code>scipy</code> dependency I have to manually specify constraints for <code>numpy</code>, but in a more realistic project there will probably be dozens of such constraints that I don't want to handle manually.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I understand what you're saying, but do you think that uv should do this automatically so that my original example &quot;just works&quot;?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also, <code>pip</code> resolves these requirements differently: it installs <code>scipy==1.14.1</code> on <code>&gt;=3.10</code> and <code>scipy==1.13.1</code> on <code>==3.9</code> (together with suitable binary wheels for <code>numpy</code>).

<p>Pick a numpy version, analyse the range of https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files, and if we see consistent range of compiled <code>cp3x</code> tags while there exists a newer version that covers a wider range, fork and so we can pick a newer numpy on newer Python versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You should never add an upper bounds to Requires-Python. Most packages don't know it until after they are released, and even for ones that know they won't support the next version (like numpy), the existing handing of this field is wrong and things like pip and poetry break if you cap. Looking at the binary wheels available to guide version ranges would be really helpful, though, I think, especially if #7190 wasn't the default. You could also check to see if classifiers are present, and only consider a classifier disappearing as you look at older packages to be the starting point of support for that Python version (for packages with universal wheels). Many packages don't have classifiers, but for the ones that do, having a classifiers is a sign of solid support. (That's a lot weirder, though, I don't think a single tool today checks classifiers during a solve).</p>
<p>https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12663 was a discussion about what to do with upper caps.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello @konstin  and @charliermarsh,</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure whether to post here or in #7190, but I wanted to take a moment to share some thoughts. The challenge @cbrnr has described is a significant blocker for <code>uv</code> adoption in both my company and several open-source projects I’m involved with.</p>
<p>In our use cases, we typically need to support multiple Python versions while ensuring that the latest possible versions of all packages are installed for each Python version. This is critical for us across local development, CI testing, and deployment workflows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the current workaround using <code>python_version</code> selectors to enforce forking isn’t feasible for us. With projects that have dozens of dependencies, adding what could amount to hundreds of additional (and repetitive) lines to <code>pyproject.toml</code> simply isn’t manageable.</p>
<p>As it stands, this issue is preventing our entire data science department—comprising hundreds of professionals—from adopting <code>uv</code>, despite the significant enthusiasm and interest we have for it.</p>
<p>I’d sincerely appreciate it if this issue could be re-prioritized, and I’m more than happy to assist with testing or provide further examples if that would be helpful.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your hard work, time, and dedication to this project! Your efforts are truly appreciated, and we’re excited about the possibilities that <code>uv</code> offers.</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Richard</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hoechenberger I wonder if you can clarify whether your need for the latest version possible on each Python is for libraries, applications, or both. A thought is that this non-forking approach currently taken is better for applications because it reduces the variations in a lockfile, and I'm curious what other people's needs are.</p>
<p>I'd prefer the forking behavior in applications as well, but I'm not sure whether that's just my library-maker brain having myopia because it's not getting what it wants right now.</p>

This is independent whether the project is a library or an app (the distinction is sometimes tricky anyway).

In addition, Python's official package manager <code>pip</code> has always done this, and now <code>uv</code> is doing something very different.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ryanhiebert In the beginning I was only thinking about libraries here, but I'm quite certain some colleagues of mine would want this behavior for their apps, too. I can definitely see some good arguments for forking when resolving app dependencies, but of course also plenty of arguments against it. I believe for libraries, the case is more clear-cut.</p>

<p>I believe this is actually an under-appreciated comment. Regardless of whether forking is the &quot;good&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; thing to do, I think we can argue that users and devs have been &quot;trained&quot; over the years to expect this &quot;pip resolution strategy&quot;. (I know, <code>pip</code> doesn't support universal lock files – but I'd suggest that this is beside the point here!)</p>

<p>I think that's worth a lot, and what I'd generally recommend. And if that's a generally good rule to follow for applications, then this exceptional behavior really only affects applications that need to simultaneously support multiple python versions. I suspect that's pretty rare; if I were distributing an application it would almost certainly be in a docker image, so the Python version would be specified as well.</p>

<p>@notatallshaw I really appreciate you chiming in! For libraries, it seems like the forking behavior would be the optimal default. For applications, I'm of two minds about it, and wish consistency was a good option, but I think for those moments where you really need your application to straddle Pythons it likely makes sense to default to avoiding forking.</p>

<p>Agreed. If that's the proposed way forward, <code>uv</code> adoption is sadly off the table for me and my colleagues.</p>

<p>Isn't this also Poetry's default behavior? And therefore the most common behavior among Python universal resolvers.</p>

<p>As a maintainer of resolvelib, the resolver for pip, and a regular contributor to pip's resolver code, I would say that isn't at all an accurate description of what pip does.</p>
<p>Pip only collects packages and requirements for a specific environment, that is, for all the environment markers defined by PEP 496, the resolver itself has no concept of a Python version.</p>

<p>I strongly support this, but comparing universal resolution which is aware of environment markers to pip's resolution is fundamentally flawed way of looking at this.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Pip is <em>not</em> an official standard. It is bundled into CPython to allow users to bootstrap their environment. Several core developers have expressed strong aversion to bundling a dedicated package manager.</p>
<p>Further, there are no standards for resolution, only standards for specifier on a set of versions. The standards documents are very careful to avoid saying anything on how resolution should work.</p>
<p>If you want a pip API from uv then use <code>uv pip</code>, it's very good, I rely on it heavily and am quick to report if there's any unknown deviation with pip.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm afraid this discussion is derailing a bit. The goal of uv is to replace existing tools like venv, poetry, pip, ...</p>
<p>It's no use to fight over what behavior is better or worse.</p>
<p>Ultimate it's a question of who's the targeted user group.</p>
<p>And all @cbrnr and I are saying: without the ability to change the resolution strategy, we and large parts of our professional networks will fall <strong>outside</strong> of this group. Which is totally alright, no hard feelings. We just wanted to make the uv devs aware of this.</p>

<p>You can definitely use <code>uv pip</code> to replace <code>pip</code> for everything you've said in this thread. If there's a missing use case there you should raise a separate issue on that.</p>

<p>Then I would lose all the nice things that <code>uv</code> brings to the table like being able to just <code>uv run</code> things 😢, and it would &quot;just&quot; be a faster version of pip. I hope that's not what <code>uv</code> is intended to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Regarding the &quot;specificity&quot; of use-cases, uv tries to use consistent versions whenever feasible — this is a fundamental design principle of uv's user experience. I think it's fine to allow you to opt-in to different behavior, but changing the default behavior seems inconsistent.</p>

<p>This is very use case specific, for all my current uses cases I would rather have the same version of the library where possible, as when I'm testing my application across Python versions I want to minimize the amount of differences there are when investigating issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FYI, this will often mean you'll be using an old version of a library on a version of Python that wasn't released when it was released. That's the issue this is referring to; NumPy (and most other major scientific libraries) support the last three releases, instead of the last 5 or 6 which is more common (due to EoL often being followed to some degree). And at least NumPy specifically never works on a newer version of Python. If any library you depend on has a restricted Python range (libraries should be allowed to drop old Pythons!), that means you will very often end up with a resolution that would be impossible for pip, an old library on a new Python. It would be nice (and I think possible) if this could be detected and auto-forked if it happens; you never want to resolve a version of a library that is older than the Python you are using if there's a newer release available! This is true even for applications.</p>
<p>I believe this is a case where &quot;consistent versions&quot; is unfeasible. Maybe three modes: <code>nofork</code>, <code>auto</code>, and <code>fork</code>, where auto will fork only if the python minimum required version causes back solving and therefore a non-ideal version for the latest supported Pythons.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO this <em>application</em> should work out of the box without configuration on Python 3.13:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;numexample&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;numpy&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Currently it takes almost two minutes to set up or crashes building NumPy, and likely has issues since it's using a NumPy (2.0.2) that doesn't support 3.13. I think the ideal case would be for it to fork on Python 3.9, so 3.9 has numpy==2.0.2, and 3.10-3.13 has numpy==2.1.2 (which takes 131ms to install).</p>

<p>As an aside, I'd like to understand this a little better. If you don't want to support old versions of numpy for your project, why are you resolving for versions of Python no longer supported by numpy?</p>

<p>It's the opposite. We want to support an older version, because we'd like to keep supporting Python 3.9 for example. But with uv, we get the old version for <em>all</em> Python versions, including a source build for 3.13.</p>

I'm not really interested in changing the defaults right now. But I am interested in supporting it. It is fairly challenging ~since (e.g.) the NumPy package metadata does not give any indication that (e.g.) NumPy 2.0.2 &quot;doesn't support&quot; Python 3.13, so it requires a variety of new and highly nuanced logic~. (Edit: I'll just leave it at &quot;fairly challenging&quot; since it's not worth debating why and what needs to change -- we understand why and what needs to change.)</p>
