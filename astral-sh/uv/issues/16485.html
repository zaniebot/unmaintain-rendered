            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Due to a copy-and-paste error, I was attempting to pin <code>mlx==0.29.3</code> while also having <code>exclude-newer = &quot;2025-10-11T00:00:00Z&quot;</code> set. That necessarily can't work because 0.29.3 wasn't published until October 18.</p>
<p>However, the debug output from <code>uv lock -vvv</code> was <em>not</em> helpful in working out what was wrong, as there was no mention that the date filter was being applied:</p>
<pre><code>TRACE Received package metadata for: mlx
TRACE Selecting candidate for mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ with 45 remote versions
DEBUG Searching for a compatible version of mlx (&gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+)
TRACE Selecting candidate for mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ with 45 remote versions
TRACE Found candidate for package mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ after 1 steps: 0.29.3 version
TRACE Found candidate for package mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ after 1 steps: 0.29.3 version
TRACE Exhausted all candidates for package mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ after 1 steps
TRACE Exhausted all candidates for package mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ after 1 steps
DEBUG No compatible version found for: mlx
</code></pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In the above output, I'd like to see a debug message along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG Excluding candidates for mlx published after 2025-10-11T00:00:00Z
</code></pre>
