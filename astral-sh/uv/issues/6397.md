# Bootstrapped Python `Failed to hardlink files;` Error

Here is the full flow that leads to this warning:

         If the cache and target directories are on different filesystems, hardlinking may not be supported.

The Python itself shouldn't be relevant here -- this is about the relationship between the cache directory and the drive you're installing on. I'm guessing your cache is not on `file:///E:`? You can use `--cache-dir` or `UV_CACHE_DIR` to set a different cache directory on `file:///E:`.

This is briefly discussed at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#cache-directory — let me know if think the documentation needs more.

I think it `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` could be more familiar for Windows user instead of `{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}`.

Hi, I am having same issues on a linux file system, and my target is a virtualenv and .cache is set to same file path as well. Is there a way to debug this further?

Hello

on windows 11 there is dev drive https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/#storing-package-cache-on-dev-drive

It would be great if the user have updated their pip cache directory, uv would be able to detect it too

> Pip cache (Python): Create a pip cache directory in your Dev Drive, for example `D:\packages\pip`, then set a global environment variable PIP_CACHE_DIR to that path, for example `setx /M PIP_CACHE_DIR D:\packages\pip`. If you have already restored pip packages and Wheels on your machine, move the contents of `%LocalAppData%\pip\Cache` to this directory. Learn more in the pip docs: [pip caching](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/caching/) and see StackOverflow to [Change directory of pip cache on Linux?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64180511/pip-change-directory-of-pip-cache-on-linux).

We can't read pip environment variable, their cache is quite different from ours.
