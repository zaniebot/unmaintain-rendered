            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! While migrating an existing Python project to <code>uv</code>, I encountered a situation where a command similar to <code>cargo update --precise</code> would be quite useful. Essentially, I would like to have the option to tell <code>uv</code> to set a package version (usually of a transitive dependency, one that is not specified in <code>dependencies</code>) in a lockfile to a specific version (that is semver compatible with the other dependencies).</p>
<p>I have the following use-case (related to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7018): I'm porting an existing Python project using a <code>requirements.txt</code> lockfile to <code>uv</code>. Let's say that I have a root dependency <code>a</code> that depends on a transitive dependency <code>b&gt;2.1</code>, and the latest published version of <code>b</code> is <code>2.3</code>. However, in my existing Python environment, I'm using <code>b==2.2</code>, and I want to continue doing that. In theory, according to semver, <code>2.3</code> is compatible with <code>2.2</code>, but theory is not always practice (especially in the world of Python package management :) ).</p>
<p>If I want to move to <code>uv</code>, I'll generate a new project, set <code>dependencies = [&quot;a==xyz&quot;]</code> and generate a lockfile. However, <code>uv</code> will forcefully set the version of <code>b</code> to <code>2.3</code>, the newest compatible version. I haven't found any way to tell <code>uv</code> to set a specific version of the transitive dependency (aside from manually modifying the lockfile, but that's really not a good solution).</p>
<h1>Workaround</h1>
<p>What I found to work is to do <code>uv add b==2.2</code>, which will update the lockfile, and then manually delete <code>&quot;b==2.2&quot;</code> from the <code>dependencies</code> array. This seems to work fine, but it would be nice if <code>uv</code> allowed me to do this in a more straightforward way, e.g. with something like <code>uv lock update b=2.2</code>.</p>
<h1>Related issue</h1>
<p>A bit similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6794, but I'm looking for a way to set the version of a specific package to a specific version, not just update everything.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I comment on some future upgrade options at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6781#issuecomment-2318265988</p>
<p>However, it sounds like you're looking for constraints or overrides:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#dependency-constraints</li>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#dependency-overrides</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I saw the constraints and overrides in the documentation, but it looks like a too big hammer for this use-case, I think. Here I mostly just want to take a one-time snapshot of an existing package environment. Also, in general, <code>cargo update --precise</code> is a useful tool for other use-cases.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to use the <code>--constraint</code> flag to affect the generation of the lockfile.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The workaround I generally recommend here is to snapshot the environment, add the versions as constraints, run <code>uv lock</code>, then remove the constraints (and we'll continue to respect those versions once set). But agree we should have a better workflow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that's exactly the workaround I described in the issue. Thanks for confirming that there probably isn't a better way for now 👍</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another related use-case that I encountered today is that dependabot told me to update a version of a transitive dependency in my lockfile. In Rust, I would do <code>cargo update &lt;package&gt;</code> or <code>cargo update &lt;package&gt; --precise &lt;version that dependabot told me to upgrade to&gt;</code> to achieve that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this should be possible today with: <code>uv lock --upgrade-package &quot;&lt;package&gt;==&lt;version&gt;&quot;</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ooh, that's it, thank you! I thought that I tried this before, not sure why I thought it doesn't work. This is essentially <code>cargo update</code>, and it solves this issue. Thanks :heart:</p>
<p>It would be nice to add some more visible information about this to the documentation, because I only found <code>uv lock --upgrade</code> to update everything. Do you think it would be good to add it e.g. <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#upgrading-locked-package-versions">here</a>? I can send a PR.</p>
