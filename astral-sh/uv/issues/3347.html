            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue tracks progress toward shipping robust cross platform lock files in <code>uv</code>. This is not something that is planned to be added to the <code>uv pip</code> CLI, but rather, as part of the workspace-aware <code>uv</code>. (Which hasn't been built out yet.)</p>

<h3>Non-blocking work items</h3>
<p>These shouldn't block shipping the universal resolver, but I thought it'd still be good to track them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While not every issue in the list has been completed, <code>uv lock</code> is currently shipping as a preview feature that folks can use. There is still work to do before it leaves &quot;preview,&quot; but I think that's better tracked by the release-ready project: https://github.com/orgs/astral-sh/projects/11</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi hey! thanks for doing all of this. much appreciated! Although I did notice the <code>lock</code> command, I wasn't sure how to use it to force UV to install from lock =&gt; landed on this issue to track progress. Now that you've closed it, I was wondering if there is a way for the public to track progress? The project is internal apparently...</p>

<p>I think you want <code>uv sync</code>.</p>
<p>Apologies about the project being private. I didn't realize that. We're working on fixing that (or publishing some other way to track progress).</p>
