            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am trying to install a nightly build of a package with this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv add vtk --index https://wheels.vtk.org --pre --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>which raises the following error and hint:</p>
<pre><code>error: Distribution `vtk==9.5.20251115.dev0 @ registry+https://wheels.vtk.org/` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on macOS (`macosx_14_0_arm64`), but `vtk` (v9.5.20251115.dev0) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux_2_17_x86_64`, `manylinux_2_28_aarch64`, `manylinux2014_x86_64`, `macosx_10_10_x86_64`, `win_amd64`; consider adding &quot;sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'arm64'&quot; to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels
</code></pre>
<p>Locking a previous version with an arm64 wheel works:</p>
<pre><code>uv add vtk==v9.5.20251101.dev0 --index https://wheels.vtk.org --pre --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>However, I would prefer a command that installs the latest wheel that is compatible with the user's platform (e.g., linux users could get the latest nightly build). Is there a way to do this with uv?</p>
<p>Apologies if this is in the docs / has been asked somewhere else before and I missed it!</p>

<h3>Version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's a primer on this here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#limited-resolution-environments. The gist of it is: if a package only ships wheels, and it's not a pure-Python package, it's not possible for us to guarantee a build for all possible environments. But you <em>can</em> tell uv that you require wheels for specific environments (hence the message referencing <code>tool.uv.required-environments</code>), which will do the backtracking you've described.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahh I see, thank you for the link to the docs and apologies for missing this.</p>
<p>I thought adding <code>&quot;sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'arm64'&quot;</code> to my <code>pyproject.toml</code> would make the package exclusive to mac, but now I see that's not the case.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and for uv!</p>
