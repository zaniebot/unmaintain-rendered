# Setting the data dir with config file

---

_Issue opened by @andersmmg on 2025-12-10 18:02_

### Question

I would like to have the persistent data directory on a different drive (using Linux) but there doesn't seem to be a config option to change that. The closest thing is env variables setting specific parts, but I want the entire thing somewhere other than $XDG_DATA_HOME

### Platform

Arch Linux

### Version

uv 0.9.16 (a63e5b62e 2025-12-06)
