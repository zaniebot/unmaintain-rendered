# Proxy for index

---

_Issue opened by @chrisoro on 2025-08-01 18:31_

### Summary

Similar to Git, where you can set up a proxy for specific URLs or remotes, it would be great if `uv` allowed specifying proxies for individual indexes.

This would be especially useful in corporate environments with multiple proxy configurations and PyPI repositories.


### Example

```uv.toml
[[index]]
name = "index1"
url = "https://index1.com/simple"
proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:11111"

[[index]]
name = "index2"
url = "https://index2.com/simple"
proxy = "http://127.0.0.1:22222"
```

Roughly a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6349

Ah, sorry, I didn’t find that issue earlier. You’re right, this is similar to what Charlie proposed a year ago:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6349#issuecomment-2392197432

Would you like to keep this open, since the other issue is quite convoluted and covers more than just the proxy topic?

I don't mind either way as long as they're cross-linked.

Can you describe whether https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11782 would work for you?

If I understand that PR correctly, it just introduces the option as either a CLI argument or an environment variable. I guess that’s a good first step, but I really think supporting this via `uv.toml` is the way to go.

In corporate environments, you often deal with proxies that don’t require authentication, and having all index information (name, URL, proxy) in `uv.toml` is a huge benefit. It's easy to share across machines and teams. Sure, setting a global environment variable works, but personally, I prefer not to define globals for something that’s only relevant to one tool.

Using an env var or CLI argument for every call feels a bit cumbersome. I’d probably end up creating aliases just to avoid copy/pasting the arg, which adds more overhead. By contrast, defining it once in `uv.toml` is a clean, fire-and-forget solution.
