<p>This runs by a machine loaded with a service account's credential, which will be configured by <code>uv tool install keyring --with keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth</code>. They should be valid because 0.6.x works without problem.</p>

<p>Does it mean that <code>uv</code> will look into the private index for dependencies of the private packages?</p>

<p>From the log it looks like it is looking into the private index for <code>keyring</code> which is a public package.</p>

<p>It seems like this is the case. But why is uv checking our private index to install <code>keyring</code> , which is a public package. We did not specify the index during the tool install step.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you so much for the help, @jtfmumm ! Yeah, simply switching the command order works.</p>
<p>Just another question unrelated to the issue if you would kindly answer.</p>
<p>We manage dependency groups in requirements.txt by <code>uv add -r requirements.group_x.txt --group group_x</code></p>
<p>Say we have 3 groups, where group_1 and group_2 share a common package, and group 3 doesn't (so there is no reason to make that package common across all groups). What would be the best way to update the common package and have the state/dependency versions maintained in the respective requirements.txt files? Currently, I am doing <code>uv remove common_package</code> from all the groups and updating the requirements.txt one by one and <code>uv add -r requirements.group_x.txt --group group_x</code> back. I wonder if there is a way to update the common package in one go?</p>
<p>This works</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @jtfmumm,</p>
<p>I have an issue similar to @andy971022.
Locally, in my setup, for the developers, the installation script relies on keyring by passing this parameters to the install:</p>
<pre><code>--keyring-provider subprocess
--extra-index-url https://&lt;username&gt;@&lt;private-repository&gt;/repository/&lt;org-name&gt;-pypi/simple
</code></pre>
<p>For the CI pipeline, those parameters still exist, however we have defined a global uv.toml file with the extra-index-url with the username and password hardcoded, for instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[pip]
extra-index-url = [&quot;https://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;private-repository&gt;/repository/&lt;org-name&gt;-pypi/simple&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Until uv 0.7.x everything worked fine. However, from 0.7.x our CI pipeline crashes because it tries to use keyring instead of relying on the credentials passed by the uv.toml file.</p>
<p>(This was the setup that we had with pip before migrating to uv)</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions about this issue?
Best,</p>
