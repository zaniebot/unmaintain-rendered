# Project version managment with uv

_Issue opened by @evan-young-icx on 2024-10-17 15:52_

Hello, feature request: Poetry has commands for managing the version of the project in the pyproject.toml file. I am able to execute a Poetry command to bump the version in pyproject.toml and then read that value into an environment variable and use that to label a docker image build. There doesn't seem to be any project version management in UV as yet. See Poetry Documentation at [https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version)

I think this issue is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6298, right?.

Yeah, makes sense to combine into that one.
