</code></pre>
<p>I assume this pertains to: https://github.com/rustls/hyper-rustls</p>
<p>Which as no issues regarding FreeBSD.</p>
<p>I'm no rust expert, but I've seen similar errors before when there's a new rust version that the code requires, and the package doesn't update the minimum rust required version. However, the actual issue could be totally different.</p>
<p>If the issue does seem to be with hyper-rustls, it seems like I should be able to reproduce it with <code>cargo</code>. If I can do that, I should be able to open an issue over there and link it to here.</p>
<p>Does this all sound good? Would I need to run something like <code>cargo install hyper-rustls</code>?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I may end up waiting till April to get on 1.76. Happy to close this out till then if it does take me that long. I'll have to build from source if not, which will probably take some hours.</p>
<p>That said, I think I misread the logs and it's actually pubgrub that has rust-version set incorrectly.</p>
<p>Your pubgrub is a fork and I can't make issues there. No idea what your long term plans for the project are, but it seems like you can test/set rust-version accordingly with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://crates.io/crates/cargo-msrv</li>
<li>https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/continuous-integration.html#verifying-rust-version</li>
</ul>
<p>(You may already be aware of this. I had no idea and just found out about it.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I could be missing this but it doesn't look like PubGrub <em>has</em> a minimum Rust version declared. Perhaps we should add one but regardless we require a newer version of Rust.</p>
<p>Hopefully it doesn't take hours to build from source, it's generally pretty quick.</p>

<p>I believe you can get the official prebuilt Rust binaries for FreeBSD using RustUp. https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If pubgrub set its MSRV, you would have gotten a better error message. The error message would have made it clear that the project would not work in less you upgraded your Rust. So the core of the problem would still be the same.</p>
