            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Today the utility of this flag is greatly diminished as if any of your packages don't have publish data it will fail to update requirements.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Although I understand the rationale behind that, one typically (hopefully) only needs this to work around things for a single package or two in situations like today's setuptools 78.0.1 fiasco, where you might reasonably expect the deps in question to be pinned / reproducible anyway (e.g. torch).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm on the fence after hearing your feedback. It seems if we fix the <code>build-constraint-dependencies</code> propagation for <code>uv sycn</code> we'll have the right lever of control to fix issues like the <code>setuptools</code> regression and keep CI systems happy, which is what I'm really after here.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that packages don't all have publish dates available. The vast majority do, but a single bad package spoils the entire process. <code>--exclude-newer-non-strict</code> is a mouthful but would do the job. I'll leave it up to y'all if you feel this usability change would be in line with the direction you want the project to take!</p>
<p>Thanks for engaging!</p>

<p>All packages on PyPI have an upload date, the issue is most third party indexes (torch, internal artifactory indexes, Azure etc.) don't support the required standards.</p>
<p>https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/simple-repository-api/#project-detail (the <code>upload-time</code> field).</p>
<p>It would be good if there would be people who reached out to the relevant indexes to request support, it would make a better Python ecosystem if such indexes would follow or interact with the standards process.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, the &quot;real&quot; fix here, I think, is to fix <code>uv sync</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>GitLab Package Registry also appears not to support it ... A single distribution package we depend on is published there. We need to publish it outside PyPI for it to remain private, which <a href="https://pypi.org/help/#private-indices">isn't supported by PyPI</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One thing to note is that there is no support for upload times in the HTML API (IIRC). So if you're trying to see if a registry supports it, you need to query via the JSON API.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As an alternative, consider an <code>exclude-newer</code> flag that can be placed on <code>tool.uv.index</code> entries. That way you could exclude newer packages from public registries like pypi, while also permitting unrestricted packages from your private package registry.</p>
<p>I suspect that might satisfy most use cases here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just ran into this with the custom <code>torch</code> registries. Since <code>torch</code> is explicitly pinned in my use case (and I use <code>sources</code>, so it's the <em>only</em> package retrieved from the custom registry), a <code>supports-exclude-newer = false</code> option in the relevant <code>tool.uv.index</code> entries would definitely work as a resolution.</p>
