# Why does `uv sync` with `--no-editable` care if a `README.md` is around?

_Issue opened by @omgMath on 2025-10-08 12:39_

### Question

Hi. I encountered the following behavior, which I found weird. Found this when trying a `Docker` image with only minimal amount of files, which did not include the `README.md`. The error I get is

```
  × Failed to build `foo @ file:///home/me/tmp/apps/foo`
  ╰─▶ failed to open file `/home/me/tmp/apps/foo/README.md`: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

The following should reproduce the error:

```bash
uv init
uv init --package --app apps/foo
uv add --package foo httpx 
uv sync --package foo
rm apps/foo/README.md
uv sync --package foo --no-editable
```

Is there a reason `uv` cares about the README in this case? Sure, I get that it is referenced by default in the `pyproject.toml`s, but from my point of view it shouldn't be required to `sync`?

Removing `readme = "README.md"` is a workaround.

### Platform

Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) on WSL

### Version

uv 0.9.0

Are you looking for `--no-install-project`? `--no-editable` does a regular wheel build, which needs all files of the package, which includes the Readme. Without this file, the built wheel would have a mismatch between what was declared as required in `pyproject.toml` and what is in the final wheel.

I see. Thanks for the explanation.

I used `--no-editable` because of what I found in [the docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#non-editable-installs). That sounded like it would add the local workspace files into the `venv` so that it the source code could be removed again from the `Docker` image.

Trying `--no-install-project` in my setup seems to work, but if I'm honest, I don't fully understand what it does from reading the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-install-project).

Did I get this right? Assume `foo` depends on `lib`, located in the workspace. Then `uv sync --package foo --no-install-project` adds the dependency `lib` to the `venv`, so `lib` can be used without needing a reference to the actual code anymore?

"If used improperly, these flags can result in a broken environment since a package can be missing its dependencies." from [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/#partial-installations) sounded a bit scary to use it without fully understanding what it does...

Package installation is binary: You can either install a package fully (having its Readme) or not at all. uv has the `--no-install-*` options for caching in Docker: You install only dependencies for a cacheable layers, while the project, which changes every time, gets its own layer near the end of the dockerfile.
