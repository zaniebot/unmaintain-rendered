            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sometimes uv's &quot;No solution found when resolving dependencies&quot; gives me extra requirements, and that I don't understand where they come from.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv venv -p 3.10</code></li>
<li><code>source .venv/bin/activate</code></li>
<li><code>uv pip install --dry-run --only-binary &quot;:all:&quot; &quot;python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0&quot;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only the following versions of python-nvd3 are available:
          python-nvd3&lt;=0.15.0
          python-nvd3==0.16.0
      and python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0 has no usable wheels, we can conclude that python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0 cannot be used.
      And because you require python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: Wheels are required for `python-nvd3` because building from source is disabled for all packages (i.e., with `--no-build`)
</code></pre>
<p>Where did &quot;python-nvd3&lt;=0.15.0&quot; and &quot;python-nvd3==0.16.0&quot; come from? And what are they trying to tell me?</p>
<p>Expected output:</p>
<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0 has no usable wheels, we can conclude that python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0 cannot be used.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think that's quite true, there are cases where we list available versions to state the proof and those are intentionally not collapsed.</p>
<p>Here, we shouldn't show the available versions at all and short-circuit to another framing, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because you require python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0, and python-nvd3&gt;=0.15.0 has no usable wheels, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably hard.</p>
