            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>We need to migrate the environment to an offline machine using uv sync, as the current development environment is offline. </br></br></h2>
<h3>We have attempted three methods (1-3), all of which failed:</br></br></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>1.Export the uv environment via pip freeze and then run uv add.</br>
However, the uv add operation failed because the TOML file contains Git URLs without specifying explicit Git versions or Git commit hashes, making it impossible to execute the add command successfully.</p>
</li>
<li><p>2.Directly run uv sync. This method also failed due to the presence of HTTPS links in the dependencies, which prevent direct synchronization in an offline environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>3.Install dependencies using uv pip (requiring dependency resolution in the order from low-level dependencies to high-level dependencies) with the command:</p>
<pre><code>pip download -r requirements.txt -d ./dist
</code></pre>
<p>The core issue here is that the dependencies cannot be sorted in the order of &quot;low-level → high-level&quot;. As a result, installation of high-level dependencies throws errors because their required low-level dependencies are not yet installed.</br></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>We are currently trying the fourth method:4. Set up a new environment in Docker and then migrate it to the offline machine.</h5>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, among the packages missing from the new machine, a large number are from the dev dependency group, with some others coming from the sub-dependencies of the dev group plus additional groups that may have been activated on the old machine.</p>
<p>Even though the --offline flag is added to enforce offline mode, the core cause of the error is clear: the corresponding file for the package ray==2.52.1 is not present in the uv cache on the new machine. The --offline flag only disables downloading new packages from the internet, but if the cache lacks the packages required for installation by the command, uv will still throw an error — this issue is related to &quot;installation triggered by sub-dependencies or dependency groups&quot;.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To prepare the cache, you need to run the same installation/sync commands on the online machine as you want to run on the offline machine. This way, all the packages will be in the cache and you can use <code>offline</code>. For example, if you run <code>uv sync</code> on the online machine with the same project and the same uv version, copy the cache to the offline machine and run <code>uv sync --offline</code>, all packages will be installed from the cache.</p>
