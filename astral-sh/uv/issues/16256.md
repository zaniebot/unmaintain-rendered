 (.venv)%  django-admin startproject main .

Not usually.

Are you sure you had the right virtual environment active? I'd recommend just using `uv run django-admin ...` to ensure you're in the correct environment instead of activating it.

Please use code blocks instead of screenshots in the future.

yes, i did run "which python" to test. Its the right one.
Also you can see in the attached image, I dont close and reopen the shell, but rather I run "source .venv/bin/activate" after it fails and that fixes it.

The activation script shouldn't change the available packages.

You can clearly see that `django-admin` was invoked from the wrong path in your logs

> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/bin/django-admin

rather than from within the virtual environment.
