# ssh username `git` obfuscated in 0.7.9

_Issue opened by @stolpa4 on 2025-06-03 06:35_

### Summary

I always use the command: `uv export -o requirements.txt --no-dev --extra train --format requirements-txt --no-editable --no-emit-project --frozen --no-hashes` to export dependencies to a requirements.txt file. I have a multitude of private repositories in my requirements. Before the 0.7.9 (0.7.8 and earlier), I executed the command and got my requirements.txt with lines in the following format:

`my-private-package @ git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org/some_organization/my_private_package.git@commit_hash`

Requirements in such format can be installed very easy, with pip install -r requirements.txt

With 0.7.9 version of uv I get:

`my-private-package @ git+ssh://****@bitbucket.org/some_organization/my_private_package.git@commit_hash`

Notice these stars, that are now added instead of a simple word `git`.
And because of these lines, I can't install it simply issuing pip install -r requirements.txt. Pip is then just unable to resolve such a dependency!

Is it a bug? How do I workaround this?

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04

### Version

uv 0.7.9

### Python version

Python 3.12.3

We met the same issue. The behavior is kind of a breaking change and is not highlighted in the release notes. It breaks all our scripts depending on "uv export".

I presume this is a side-effect of #13560, cc @jtfmumm

Although also perhaps a duplicate of #13791
