# `uv pip install` won't download a `.tgz` from the index

_Issue opened by @godlygeek on 2025-05-10 02:20_

### Summary

The package `pyratemp` can't be installed with `uv pip install`, but can be installed by `pip install`. This package provides only sdists, and those sdists have the nonstandard extension `.tgz` (rather than `.tar.gz`).

```shell-session
$ mkdir test
$ cd test
$ uv venv -p 3.13
Using CPython 3.13.1
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
$ source .venv/bin/activate
(test) $ uv pip install pyratemp
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there are no versions of pyratemp and you require pyratemp, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
(test) $ uv pip install pip
Resolved 1 package in 96ms
Installed 1 package in 260ms
 + pip==25.1.1
(test) $ .venv/bin/pip install pyratemp
Collecting pyratemp
  Using cached pyratemp-0.3.2-py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: pyratemp
Successfully installed pyratemp-0.3.2
(test) $
```

I'm unsure if this difference is intentional or not. I see other issues on the issue tracker, like #7081, that suggest that uv intends to support the `.tgz` extension in at least some cases.
