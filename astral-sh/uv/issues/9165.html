<p>For pair programming or shared sessions, I don't want to enter my password in plain text in editor windows. Why not use the Credential Manager built into the operating system or a third-party keystore? Login information is stored encrypted, the password entry is hidden and the login information can also be backed up and restored (depending on the credential manager). This would be much more secure than storing credentials in plain text in personal toml files.</p>
<p>I would like to see a way to configure private registrations in pyproject.toml without username or password so that they can be shared between different teams. Since now uv only takes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;private-python&quot;
url = &quot;https://username:password@artifactory.company.com/*/simple&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;private-python&quot;
url = &quot;https://username@artifactory.company.com/*/simple&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>to work with keyring.</p>
<p>My preferred solution I described here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8810#issuecomment-2521703207</p>
<p>Same ability would be nice to have for upload repositorys.
This would really enable to use uv in company teams with on prem indexes and repos.</p>
