            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not certain on this but in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3998, the test I added yields an entry in the lockfile like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[distribution]]
name = &quot;typing-extensions&quot;
version = &quot;4.7.1&quot;
source = &quot;registry+https://pypi.org/simple&quot;
marker = &quot;python_version &lt; '3.8' or python_version &lt; '3.11'&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The marker can be simplified to <code>python_version &lt; '3.8'</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, @charliermarsh</p>
<p>I am not familiar with the marker, but only from the above content</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python_version &lt; '3.8' or python_version &lt; '3.11'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>==&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python_version &lt; '3.8'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The condition has become <code>more stringent</code>. Now, it only requires that the Python version be less than 3.8.
Is this what we need?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry yes, the final condition should be <code>python_version &lt; '3.11'</code> -- it's <code>python_version &lt; '3.8'</code> that's redundant.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we need to do this during resolution - the redundant expressions don't get in the way, it only matters when we write the output to the lock file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ibraheemdev You might consider approaching this using &quot;smart constructors.&quot; That is, you guarantee that a <code>MarkerTree</code> is, by construction, as simple as possible. This approach means there is no separate recursive pass to do simplification. It just happens inductively as part of construction.</p>
<p>The downside of this is that it generally requires making it impossible to build a <code>MarkerTree</code> using standard enum variants. Instead, well, you have to use the smart constructors. You can still expose a read-only enum for easy case analysis.</p>
<p>I've used this pattern in <code>regex-syntax::hir</code> and I've been very happy with it.</p>
