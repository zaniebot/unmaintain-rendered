            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I asked about this <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/core-metadata-for-self-referential-extras/77793">here</a>. There wasn't consensus either way, but most people suggested it was fine for a backend to expand these (or not). I think we should <em>not</em> expand them, since it doesn't match the metadata you get from reading the <code>pyproject.toml</code> directly and it's actually sort of a lossy transform (you can't identify a self-referential extra afterwards).</p>
