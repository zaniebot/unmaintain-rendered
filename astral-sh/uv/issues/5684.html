            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv</code> is great thanks for the amazing package! Sorry if this is a duplicate I couldn't find it in the issue queue.</p>
<p>I'm on Windows 10, working in conda cli, Python 3.10.</p>
<p>uv version:  0.2.32 (38c232e46 2024-07-30)
Command used: <code>uv pip install tensorboard </code> (but I get the same error with any package).</p>
<p>Error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>thread 'main' panicked at crates\uv-client\src\base_client.rs:178:33:
Failed to build HTTP client: reqwest::Error { kind: Builder, source: Os { code: 3, kind: NotFound, message: &quot;The system cannot find the path specified.&quot; } }</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I downgraded to <code>0.1.31</code> installations proceeded without error.</p>
<p>Stack backtrace didn't seem useful, but here are some lines</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> I'm now getting the same error with version <code>0.2.31</code>. 🤷‍♂️ So I'm not sure <em>what</em> is going on. It doesn't seem <code>0.2.32</code> specific.  The installs work fine with <code>pip install x</code>.</p>

<p>It was an existing Python install, but a fubar ML env that I had piled up too much crap into. 😆 I'll try to recreate in a rational way, but my guess is it will be very hard and I'll end up closing this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I couldn't reproduce problem, I think I had just done one too many installs of packages in unrecommended ways (and probably had mixed pip, conda, and uv -- I was playing with fire in this environment). Things seem to be fine when I just stick with uv consistently as much as possible. Closing issue.</p>
