# Add universal resolution to continuous benchmarking

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-07-09 10:31_

Currently, we only benchmark single-platform resolution on codspeed. We need to add universal resolution to avoid performance regressions.

Keeping this open because we probably want to add more complex benchmark cases, but airflow ran too slow for CI.

Both warm cache transformers (`uv lock`) and universal airflow are now in the same speed category as airflow (~100ms vs ~110ms on my machine), so we could add e.g. transformers for more diverse coverage.
