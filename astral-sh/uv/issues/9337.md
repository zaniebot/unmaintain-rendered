<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


I have some project do not install currect project as python package, they are just python files in directory with venv and requirements.txt, and it's not buildable.

currently if I want to run some script I'll have to pass `--no-project` to `uv run` everytimes.

Hoping to have a env or config field to make it default.

for example, `UV_RUN_NO_PROJECT=1 uv run ... ` or `tool.uv.no-project = true` in config file
