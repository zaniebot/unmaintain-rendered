            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, I&#x27;m not sure if this is the place to post a question, but I would like to get some feedback/experience on relation of replacing poetry to uv.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m looking to migrate from Poetry to UV. But my only concern is that UV seems to not provide a build backend, so what is the recommended way to structure the pyproject.toml file? Should I still install poetry, pdm or hatchling as a build systems? In that case, isn&#x27;t a better option to just use poetry (for example) to manage the project and uv for venv etc... but not for the pyproject.toml file?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m specifically referring to this section:</p>
<p>[build-system]
requires = [&quot;poetry-core&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;poetry.core.masonry.api&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>UV currently doesn&#x27;t have a backend built, so it should be difficult to handle functions that require a backend.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8779</li>
</ul>
<p>However, besides build backend, there are still many replaceable functions, so it depends on whether the functions you need require a backend.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Be able to generate the .whl file, building and install the current project and probably prepare it to publish to PyPi requires a backend, right?
So what is the recommended way to proceed? which backend is recommended/supported to use?
Thank you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Until uv has its own backend, you can use hatchling or the pdm backend:</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[build-system]
requires = [&quot;pdm-backend&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;pdm.backend&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>uv works with all of them, you can use the backend you like best. For new projects, <code>uv init</code> has a <code>--build-backend</code> option, the default is hatchling, which should cover most use cases (also coming from poetry).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having personally passed a few projects from poetry to uv, I encountered an issue with hatchling, which had trouble to find the correct compiler.</p>
<p>Adding this fixed it:</p>
<pre><code>export CC=gcc 
export AR=ar
</code></pre>
<p>I believe it is related to this issue : <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8429">astral-sh/uv#8429</a></p>
