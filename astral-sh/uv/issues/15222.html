            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I found a (to me) inconsistent behavior of <code>uv run</code> when compared to <code>uv pip install</code>. In detail:</p>
<p>In the 'pyproject.toml', I have the following lines:</p>
<p>EDIT: in <code>[project.optional-dependencies]</code>!</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">spi = [
    &quot;spidev; platform_system == 'Linux' and (platform_machine == 'armv7l' or platform_machine == 'aarch64')&quot;,
    &quot;RPi; platform_system == 'Linux' and (platform_machine == 'armv7l' or platform_machine == 'aarch64')&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>so I can chose to install the required drivers when running on a raspberry pi. With <code>uv pip install &quot;.[spi]&quot;</code> I get</p>
<pre><code>Using Python 3.12.11 environment at: /Users/thomasa/.venv/matr1x
Resolved 187 packages in 331ms
      Built matr1x @ file:///Users/thomasa/SynologyDrive/Github/IFW_software/core_library
Prepared 1 package in 219ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 17ms
Installed 1 package in 4ms
 ~ matr1x==8.0.1 (from file:///Users/thomasa/SynologyDrive/Github/IFW_software/core_library)
</code></pre>
<p>and it works fine even when running on my desktop mac. It seems to skip the packages, just as I would have expected. However, if I run <code>uv run pytests --verbose</code> it first installs the package in a venv with (presumably) all optional dependencies checked and fails:</p>
<pre><code>warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=/Users/thomasa/.venv/matr1x` does not match the project environment path `.venv` and will be ignored; use `--active` to target the active environment instead
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (python_full_version &gt;= '3.12' and sys_platform != 'win32'):
  ╰─▶ Because there are no versions of rpi{(platform_machine == 'aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux') or (platform_machine == 'armv7l'
      and sys_platform == 'linux')} and matr1x[spi] depends on rpi{(platform_machine == 'aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux') or
      (platform_machine == 'armv7l' and sys_platform == 'linux')}, we can conclude that matr1x[spi]'s requirements are unsatisfiable.
      And because your project requires matr1x[spi], we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>My expectation is that either both fail or both work. Both working and skipping the packages would be my desired (and expected) behavior.</p>
<p>The current behavior would force me to put all dependencies that have a platform requirement in the 'dependencies' section of the toml.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the insanely quick answer :)</p>
<p>It still feels inconsistent to me. Couldn't uv come up with the following universal resolution:<code>spi = [ &quot;spidev&quot;,  &quot;RPi&quot;]</code> for the RasPi and <code>spi = []</code> for all other systems, because that would happen if I would run <code>uv pip install</code> on these systems. Or is there other (edge) cases where this behavior would be undesirable?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So... digging into it a little more. The error says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are no versions of rpi{(platform_machine == 'aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux') or (platform_machine == 'armv7l' and sys_platform == 'linux')}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe a dumb question, but... where is <code>rpi</code> coming from here? It's not on PyPI? https://pypi.org/project/rpi/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see now, that is embarrassing. It cannot resolve that for the RasPi platform, because even for that there is no package on PyPi.  It is a typo and presumable means <code>RPi.GPIO</code>. With that I did <code>uv pip compile --universal --extra=spi pyproject.toml </code> and it works! I apologize and appreciate the time you took.</p>

<p>This is a good example of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15092 where the markers make this error message more confusing than it should be.</p>
