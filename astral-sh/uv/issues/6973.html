            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hi all</p>
<p>i tried to install a package without any scripts defined. it told me &quot;No executables are provided by <code>certifi</code>&quot;, but it was a surprise to see that it additionally &quot;Deleting environment for tool <code>certifi</code>&quot; in the debug logs. i had expected the venv to persist. perhaps that could be made more clear?</p>

</code></pre>
<p>in the same vein, would it be possible to provide a script to uvx to be the executable?</p>
<p>for example:
<code>uv tool install certifi --script certifi=certifi</code>
or
<code>uv tool install certifi --script certifi=certifi.core:where</code>
or
<code>uv tool run certifi --script certifi=certifi</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If a package doesn't provide any executable scripts, yeah we'll remove the environment since there's nothing for us to expose.</p>
<p>It does seem reasonable to allow defining additional entry points. I'm not sure how easy it is, but it seems nice to have.</p>
