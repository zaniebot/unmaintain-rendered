# Enable testing of `required-environments` hint on Windows

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-06-06 19:12_

We added a Windows wheel to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13575 so we can test this on Unix, but we should be able to choose some other wheel file name that enables us to test on all our normal platforms?

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13888#discussion_r2132692172
