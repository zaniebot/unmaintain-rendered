# Don't show extra in progress bar

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-12-12 16:43_

When resolving a package with many extras the progress bar will switch between extras, e.g.
```
⠼ transformers[dev]==4.8.2
```
```
⠴ transformers[dev-tensorflow]==4.36.0 
```
or
```
⠦ transformers[modelcreation]==4.36.0 
```

We should show the package name without extra instead.
