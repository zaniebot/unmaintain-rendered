<p>We end up testing hundreds of boto versions. After a point, we should start fetching the version metadata in parallel for these cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is effectively blocked on being smarter with ranges for me, either by being a lot faster with intersections, or ideally having ranges with fewer segments.</p>
<p>Checking the first ~500 version of tf-models-nightly takes 12s for me, which are nearly exclusively spent on range intersection of ranges with a lot of segments, even though we should be able to merge the segments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is that with all the metadata cached? The fragmented ranges thing is similar to what @zanieb is looking at for error reporting and is related to an issue I filed on PubGrub about this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, it basically does not make sense to work on this until <a href="https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/issues/135">pubgrub-rs/pubgrub#135</a> is fixed or we have some workaround. We could try making intersections really fast but i think this would be effort spent in the wrong place when range shouldn&#x27;t be that large in the first place.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As an update, pubgrub is much faster now, and it will be even faster for this case with <a href="https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/177">pubgrub-rs/pubgrub#177</a> (the benchmark i used hits the boto case), so we can retry doing this.</p>
