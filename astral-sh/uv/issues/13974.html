            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>We currently don&#x27;t support requesting a previously defined index by name in various operations, but we should.</p>
Example
<p>e.g., where an index is defined in a <code>pyproject.toml</code>, I should be able to use</p>
<pre><code>$ uv add --index &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or when defined in a <code>uv.toml</code></p>
<pre><code>$ uv tool install --index &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So at least in <code>uv add</code>&#x27;s case. If only one index is provided, the requirements are pinned to that index. And then regardless of how many indexes are provided, the specified indexes are added/re-added to the pyproject.toml (such that any pre-existing entries appear at the top in the order they are passed on the command line (or from other sources)).</p>
<p>Regarding <code>uv tool install</code>, currently what you pass via <code>--index</code> seems to get checked after whatever is already in your <code>uv.toml</code>.</p>
<p>It seems like maybe we should be prioritising the index passed there?</p>
<p>As for how to achieve this, I&#x27;ve considered a few different ideas but I think what makes the most sense to me is something like: Add a new type for an <code>IndexOrName</code> which is what we would take on the CLI instead of an <code>Index</code>. The direct consumers of the arguments would then attempt resolve this from the pyproject.toml (or the embedded script toml) before treating it like a normal index.</p>
<p>Alternatively we could add some logic to <code>Index::from_str</code> which attempts to find the right <code>pyproject.toml</code> / script toml / <code>uv.toml</code> but this seemed a bit too dirty.</p>
<p>Happy to hear other suggestions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Two interesting quirks came up:</p>
<ol>
<li>We could technically allow <code>pyproject.toml</code> to reference <code>uv.toml</code> indices by name.</li>
<li>We could include also include the index name in <code>uv-receipt.toml</code> for a tool, instead of the index URL, if it is installed.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 seems like it could lead to surprises. I think #2 might be an okay idea. But for now, I&#x27;m going to not do/allow either of those... Just wanted to document this decision in case there were interesting objections to this choice.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As written, my PR makes passing <code>--index name</code> equivalent to passing <code>--index name=uri</code> which has the impact that, for a workspace child package, it will copy the index definition into it.</p>
<p>Additionally, this means that if you&#x27;re in the directory of a workspace child or using --project in the workspace root, and the child has its own index defined with a conflicting name, the definition will get overwritten by the workspace&#x27;s. This again matches the behaviour of doing <code>--index name=url</code> and the resolution logic matches our normal resolution logic (which honestly seems a bit unusual to me).</p>
<p>While it would in some sense deviate from the behaviour of <code>--index name=uri</code>, I think we shouldn&#x27;t write new index definitions when picking up an <code>--index</code> by name. Not quite sure how to make that happen yet though...</p>
