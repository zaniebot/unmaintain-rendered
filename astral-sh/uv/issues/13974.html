            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We currently don't support requesting a previously defined index by name in various operations, but we should.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>e.g., where an index is defined in a <code>pyproject.toml</code>, I should be able to use</p>
<pre><code>$ uv add --index &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or when defined in a <code>uv.toml</code></p>
<pre><code>$ uv tool install --index &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So at least in <code>uv add</code>'s case. If only one index is provided, the requirements are pinned to that index. And then regardless of how many indexes are provided, the specified indexes are added/re-added to the pyproject.toml (such that any pre-existing entries appear at the top in the order they are passed on the command line (or from other sources)).</p>
<p>Regarding <code>uv tool install</code>, currently what you pass via <code>--index</code> seems to get checked after whatever is already in your <code>uv.toml</code>.</p>
<p>It seems like maybe we should be prioritising the index passed there?</p>
<p>As for how to achieve this, I've considered a few different ideas but I think what makes the most sense to me is something like: Add a new type for an <code>IndexOrName</code> which is what we would take on the CLI instead of an <code>Index</code>. The direct consumers of the arguments would then attempt resolve this from the pyproject.toml (or the embedded script toml) before treating it like a normal index.</p>
<p>Alternatively we could add some logic to <code>Index::from_str</code> which attempts to find the right <code>pyproject.toml</code> / script toml / <code>uv.toml</code> but this seemed a bit too dirty.</p>
<p>Happy to hear other suggestions.</p>
