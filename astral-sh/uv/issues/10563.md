# SSL Verification Issue

_Issue opened by @sssaha on 2025-01-13 13:29_

Hello 
How can I avoid putting this string `pip --trusted-host=pypi.python.org --trusted-host=pypi.org --trusted-host=files.pythonhosted.org install ` every time I want to use UV to install packages via PIP? 
I have my original provided `.pem` set as ROOT certificate on the default python that I use to download UV.

Have you tried the native TLS option?

I tried the uv ADD and this always happens 

``` bash
error: Failed to fetch: `https://pypi.org/simple/pandas/`
  Caused by: Request failed after 3 retries
  Caused by: error sending request for url (https://pypi.org/simple/pandas/)
  Caused by: client error (Connect)
  Caused by: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer
```
