            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The idea of build constraints is fantastic.. but how does one generate such a constraints file in the first place?</p>
<p>If only <code>uv pip compile</code> had flags such as <code>--include-build-system-deps</code> and <code>--only-build-system-deps</code> -- things would be so much easier.</p>
<p>A possible complication, of course, is that project dependencies will in turn have their own build requirements, and those may well conflict with each other thanks to PEP 517 isolation. This is probably something that has to be resolved more systematcally within the <code>pylock.toml</code> spec (currently it does not track build system dependencies at all)</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
