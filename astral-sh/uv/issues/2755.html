            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I moved Scientific-Python's cookie over to uv, which due to the large number of installs needed when testing a cookiecutter with 11 backends, really saved a lot of time, taking some jobs from 6 minutes to 3 minutes. However, the jobs have become flakey. I've first noticed it with the PyPy job, but just got it with the CPython 3.12 macOS job:</p>

<p>That would mean an HTTP/2 <code>RST_STREAM</code> with the error code of <code>PROTOCOL_ERROR</code>. Received from the server.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, stream resets don't come with any extra info (in the spec), but figured I'd mention it in case that helps understanding the environment.</p>
