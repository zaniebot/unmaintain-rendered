<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Similar to the process when no lock file exists, it should ideally generate a new <code>uv.lock</code> file to replace the corrupted one. The lock file is corrupted since both <code>uv lock</code> and <code>uv sync</code> return <code>error: Failed to parse uv.lock</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think silently ignoring that lock like that seems a little dubious -- if it's due to a merge conflict, we'd basically throw away the merge conflict, which would be wrong. Cargo for example will error if you have a corrupt lockfile. It seems reasonable to me to expect the user to just <code>rm uv.lock</code>.</p>

<p>Agree. A &quot;corrupt&quot; lockfile is an exceptional event and I want to know when this happens.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After accidentally modifying the <code>uv.lock</code> file in Vim, I noticed that <code>uv sync</code> and <code>uv lock</code> stopped working and I had to delete the lock file.</p>
