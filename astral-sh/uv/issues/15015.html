            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Similar to Git, where you can set up a proxy for specific URLs or remotes, it would be great if <code>uv</code> allowed specifying proxies for individual indexes.</p>
<p>This would be especially useful in corporate environments with multiple proxy configurations and PyPI repositories.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-uv.toml">[[index]]
name = &quot;index1&quot;
url = &quot;https://index1.com/simple&quot;
proxy = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:11111&quot;

[[index]]
name = &quot;index2&quot;
url = &quot;https://index2.com/simple&quot;
proxy = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:22222&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, sorry, I didn’t find that issue earlier. You’re right, this is similar to what Charlie proposed a year ago:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6349#issuecomment-2392197432</p>
<p>Would you like to keep this open, since the other issue is quite convoluted and covers more than just the proxy topic?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't mind either way as long as they're cross-linked.</p>
<p>Can you describe whether https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11782 would work for you?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I understand that PR correctly, it just introduces the option as either a CLI argument or an environment variable. I guess that’s a good first step, but I really think supporting this via <code>uv.toml</code> is the way to go.</p>
<p>In corporate environments, you often deal with proxies that don’t require authentication, and having all index information (name, URL, proxy) in <code>uv.toml</code> is a huge benefit. It's easy to share across machines and teams. Sure, setting a global environment variable works, but personally, I prefer not to define globals for something that’s only relevant to one tool.</p>
<p>Using an env var or CLI argument for every call feels a bit cumbersome. I’d probably end up creating aliases just to avoid copy/pasting the arg, which adds more overhead. By contrast, defining it once in <code>uv.toml</code> is a clean, fire-and-forget solution.</p>
