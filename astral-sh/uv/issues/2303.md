# Document environment variables that uv reads

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-03-08 15:58_

uv reads a lot of environment variables, some as alternative to cli arguments, some through dependencies (e.g. `NO_COLOR`), and some custom (e.g. `PYC_INVALIDATION_MODE` in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2297 or `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT`). We should document them, esp. the ones not in the CLI docs, [like cargo does](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-reads).
