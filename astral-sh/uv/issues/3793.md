# Reduce verbosity of output in "Comparing installed with source" log

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-05-23 14:04_

From

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/95af1db0bb2cc7864fbf8ba0ca6758c70c8a08ce/crates/uv-installer/src/satisfies.rs#L23-L27

We get the output


> TRACE Comparing installed with source: Registry(InstalledRegistryDist { name: PackageName("anyio"), version: "4.3.0", path: "/Users/zb/workspace/uv/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/anyio-4.3.0.dist-info" }) Registry { specifier: VersionSpecifiers([]), index: None }
> TRACE Comparing installed with source: Registry(InstalledRegistryDist { name: PackageName("sniffio"), version: "1.3.1", path: "/Users/zb/workspace/uv/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sniffio-1.3.1.dist-info" }) Registry { specifier: VersionSpecifiers([VersionSpecifier { operator: GreaterThanEqual, version: "1.1" }]), index: None }
> TRACE Comparing installed with source: Registry(InstalledRegistryDist { name: PackageName("idna"), version: "3.7", path: "/Users/zb/workspace/uv/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/idna-3.7.dist-info" }) Registry { specifier: VersionSpecifiers([VersionSpecifier { operator: GreaterThanEqual, version: "2.8" }]), index: None }


It'd be nice not to dump debug representations of structs into the logs.

Agreed that the debug logging is bad. I'm kinda attached to those in general cause i regularly spend time debugging installation plan errors.
