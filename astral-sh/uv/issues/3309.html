            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to use the <code>--no-build-isolation</code> option, introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2258
It's necessary to make uv/pip use the current venv when installing or building packages.
It's largely used in build systems and environments where a venv is already prepared to build/install packages.</p>
<p>I am finding that the option is not working when set by an environment variable? I think it might not be implemented.
Or the environment variable name/value might be something else. I've tried a few variants I could think of but that did not help.</p>
<pre><code># pass
uv pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
</code></pre>
<pre><code># fail
UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=true uv pip install -e .
</code></pre>
<p>uv version 0.1.39 (latest as of today)</p>
