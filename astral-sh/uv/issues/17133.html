<p>Hi,
First of all a big thanks for all the amazing work :-)
We have a scenario where we have airflow and spark env, to manage the same we are using dependency groups in single <code>pyproject.toml</code>. All the common packages are part of dependencies and rest belong to their respective groups.
Now to setup env, we create multiple env and run
<code>uv sync --group airflow</code>
this way we setup our env's.
Now my question is as airflow usually have constraints and rather a long list, how can we sync any specific venv based on dependency group with constraints and not the other.
Let me know if u need more clarity, will be happy to share.
Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv builds a lockfile using all dependencies and all constraints together, so currently the only option would be to apply the constraints to the entire lockfile.</p>
