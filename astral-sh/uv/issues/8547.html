            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand there is an issue with UV not finding the TCL files.</p>
<p>However the 'quirks' document says &quot;On Windows, explicitly setting TCL_LIBRARY is not required as the default install layout of this project’s Python distributions allows CPython’s filesystem probing code to find the .tcl files. As long as the files from python/install/tcl are present (in a tcl directory under the directory where the python.exe is), things should just work.&quot;</p>
<p>I am on windows and I keep getting the message:
_tkinter.TclError: Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following directories:</p>
<p>And the directory where UV keeps TCL is not listed.
What should i do to get this working; the tcl files are indeed 'under the directory where the python.exe is'
thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at this again, working without UV, using a clean installation of python 3.13, the same thing happens. So it seems to be a python 3.13 problem, not UV. Id be very grateful if someone could suggest a solution - thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just found out that there is a bug in 3.13 that causes problems with TCL. Advice is to use 3.12 until 3.13.1 is released.
Fortunately, since I am using UV, that is easy! Thanks!</p>
