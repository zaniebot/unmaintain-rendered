            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi all! Thanks for the fantastic work on <code>ruff</code> and <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>Currently, PyPA's <code>pip</code> supports installing from <code>git</code>, <code>subversion</code>, <code>mercurial</code> and <code>bazaar</code>.
<code>uv</code> and <code>cargo</code> only support dependencies from <code>git</code> currently.</p>
<p>For most projects this is fine (since public packages are almost always on PyPI anyway), but it would be nice to have the option of VCS for installing private projects.</p>
<p>The problem with supporting multiple VCS systems is that they are a constantly moving target, and supporting them correctly is a massive increase is scope for <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12102#issuecomment-1540686779">Looking at <code>cargo</code>'s response to adding new VCS systems</a>, I'm wondering if this can be another area where <code>uv</code> can innovate by providing a means for developers to extend <code>uv</code> themselves with their own URL schemes.</p>
<p>Python already has a solution for delegating responsibility in this way with <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html#advertising-behavior">entry-points</a>, so I think <code>uv</code> is the perfect project to implement something like this.</p>
<p>In this imaginary system, a Python package could define some hooks as entry-points which <code>uv tool install</code> could check for, which would then be delegated to by the main <code>uv</code> program when it encounters that URL scheme.</p>
<p>Supporting a new URL scheme would be as simple as creating a Python package for it, and then <code>uv tool install uv-mercurial</code> for example.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are many complexities and performance considerations to this, so let me know your thoughts.</p>
