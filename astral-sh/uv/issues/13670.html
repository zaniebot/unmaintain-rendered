            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I would like to specify a project dependency that optionally exists locally as a workspace. If the workspace directory is missing, it gracefully falls back to however else the dependency is described in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
Use Case
<p>Consider a team with several in-house libraries, or plugins to a larger project. A team member would not necessarily ever bother pulling in the submodules or standalone repos to work on a library, but another team member might, in order to develop on that library. This feature becomes more useful the larger the team and number of libraries they manage. The <code>pyproject.toml</code> could be made to seamlessly work for all team members, whether or not they work on the libraries. &quot;Getting started&quot; and &quot;digging in&quot; to the project would both be painless.</p>
Implementation
<p>This could be implemented in a few ways, but I think the most obvious is to be able to mark a workspace as optional in the <code>[tool.uv.workspace]</code> table, ala</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.workspace]
optional_members = [
    ...
]
members = [
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>members</code> list wouldn&#x27;t have to duplicate the former.</p>
<p>Alternatively, this could apply more broadly in <code>[tool.uv.sources]</code>, but in my opinion, this is would take more careful thinking because it could touch other types of sources. There&#x27;s more going on in <code>sources</code>. Placing the change in <code>[tool.uv.workspace]</code> is the KISS approach.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to not make <code>uv</code> err out if a workspace is simply missing, and change nothing about the pyproject.toml. I count the current behavior as a feature though, rather than an oversight.</p>
