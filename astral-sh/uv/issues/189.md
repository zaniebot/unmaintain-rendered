# Avoid fetching package metadata if a version is already pinned in the lockfile

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-26 04:41_

Right now, we still fetch the package metadata (and the version metadata for the selected version). We should be able to skip this, which would mean no-op resolutions don't require any network requests.

(By lockfile, I mean `requirements.txt` -- but we do include the dependency annotations in there, so it should be possible to reify the graph from the `requirements.txt` for this purpose...)

(It could be fine to fire off these fetches, but ideally we wouldn't need to wait for them.)

Too high-level to be useful as an issue.
