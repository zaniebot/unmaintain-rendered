# Support multiple requires-python versions for dev versus deployment

---

_Issue opened by @dpranke on 2025-04-02 16:07_

### Summary

Hi,

I have a package ([json5](https://pypi.org/project/json5/)) that has no runtime dependencies and runs on 3.8 or later, so my package has a `requires-python = ">= 3.8.0"` in its pyproject.toml.

I also have a `dev` environment configured for the package that contains all the tools I need to work on the package (uv, ruff, mypy, etc.).

As tools are gradually dropping support for 3.8, I can no longer run the latest version of everything and still run the dev environment on 3.8.

It would be great if there was some way to specify that the dev environment required 3.9 or later, but the actual package only required 3.8 (i.e., I could have a 3.13 environment that would be able to build a package for 3.8). AFAICT, there isn't currently a way to do this except perhaps to use multiple pyproject.tomls, which kind of defeats the point. I don't know if it would be possible to implement this in uv or if it'd actually need changes upstream to the pyproject spec et al?

### Example

We're tracking this idea in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11606

Ideally it'd be added to the specification, but we can try it first.

Ah, thanks, I had looked for an existing bug but didn't see one. I'm not surprised that there's already one on file :).
