            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,
I am using uv for Python package management in my Dockerfile. Specifically, I use the following command to install Python and set up a virtual environment:</p>
<p><code>RUN uv python install 3.8 &amp;&amp; uv venv &lt;virtual_env&gt; --python 3.8 </code></p>
<p>In a corporate environment where internet access is restricted, uv tries to fetch Python binaries from the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">python-build-standalone repository on GitHub</a>. This often results in DNS or connection failures due to the restricted access. Below is the error message I receive:</p>
<p><code>error: Failed to install cpython-3.8.20-linux-x86_64-gnu   Caused by: Request failed after 3 retries   Caused by: error sending request for url (https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20241002/cpython-3.8.20%2B20241002-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-install_only_stripped.tar.gz)   Caused by: client error (Connect)   Caused by: dns error: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known </code></p>
<p>Feature Request
Is it possible to configure uv to pull Python from a mirrored repository (e.g., a corporate-hosted mirror of python-build-standalone)? If not, could this functionality be added in a future release?</p>
<p>This would allow us to maintain a mirror of the required Python versions within our network and bypass the need to access GitHub for downloading binaries.</p>
<p>Any guidance or alternative solutions would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thank you for your work on this project!</p>
