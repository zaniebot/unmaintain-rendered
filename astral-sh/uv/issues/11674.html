            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. Thank you again for working on this wonderful tool.</p>
<p>We are just getting hooked by the <code>uv tool</code> subsystem [^1], and would like to add a suggestion about it: While <code>uv pip install</code> accepts multiple package names, <code>uv tool install</code> currently doesn't. Maybe you can do something about it?</p>
<p>[^1]: That's really an excellent one. Thank you so much!</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool install --upgrade --compile-bytecode cratedb-toolkit grafana-import influxio mqttwarn
</code></pre>

<p>I think the hard part is that allowing installation of multiple tools in a single invocation would conflict with other options like <code>--from</code> and <code>--with</code>. We could add support and error if the other flags are used?</p>
<p>That's part of why we have <code>uv tool upgrade</code> as a separate interface.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see the conflict, thanks for explaining. Maybe it's not worth the obfuscation of the option parser: Feel free to close the ticket any time at your disposal.</p>
<p>Indeed, we had to use <code>uv tool install</code> together with <code>--with</code> just recently over here as a workaround.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to otherwise resolve this conflict. If this is a viable way to tremendously improve usability in likely &gt;80% of the situations, we will be very happy about it. If not, because obfuscation weighs in negatively too much, we can absolutely understand it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would be nice to have ability to install multiple tools at once, as <code>pipx</code> supports this.</p>
