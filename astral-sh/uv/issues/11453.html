            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have a use case where I have an application containing many different &quot;products&quot;. These products are collected together as dependencies for the application. We'd like to install the pinned dependencies of a given product without needing to <code>sync</code> the whole world.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>It would be nice if I could do <code>uv sync</code> and then pass a package name, and <code>uv sync</code> would only install that package and its dependencies, not the whole lock file. Something like: <code>uv sync --only-dep ruff</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure where we talked about this... but in discussion of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4028 I feel like we considered <code>--only-install-package</code>. Maybe another direction for this would be changing <code>--package</code> to allow arbitrary roots in your dependency tree (instead of just workspace members).</p>

<p>Yeah that would be acceptable too 👍 The one difference is that this would not be only the package itself, but a package and its dependencies.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An option for modelling this in the meantime would an extra per product, then selecting which product to install through its associated extra.</p>
