            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Question 1: The original environment is in Ubuntu, using uv to create a virtual environment, after installing the relevant dependencies, it runs normally, now the code is migrated to centos 7, and it can't activate the virtual environment under .venv, how to solve it?
Question 2: In an intranet environment, I can't install uv over the internet, but I download the whl file offline to install it, but it says that the whl file doesn't support the platform or it's not valid.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>centos 7 x86_84</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>centos linux 7.9.2009</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For question 1, can you <code>uv sync</code> again? Virtual environments aren't portable between systems or paths, they need to recreated.</p>
<p>For question 2, can you share instructions how to reproduce the problem, the list of wheel (<code>ls -l</code>) and the verbose log of the error (running uv with <code>-v</code>)?</p>
