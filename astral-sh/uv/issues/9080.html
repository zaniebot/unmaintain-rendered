            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv version - latest 0.5.1
platform - windows 10/11 with python 3.10.11</p>
<p>I have a validation code in my package that was doing below check, can be replicable even by using str instead six.text_type</p>
<pre><code>        if not isinstance(data, six.text_type):
            raise ValueError(&quot;Data must be of string type&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>when I install the compiled wheel with uv pip, the above check is bypassed when the data passed is [], {}, or integer like 123
The same if I install with pip and run the test works fine.</p>
<p>What could be causing this weird behavior? Why is the exception not raised and what role could uv pip play python type checks?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh yes, check it self is running. The test cases pass on linux distribution with same python 3.10 version and also if I install the wheel without uv in our ci the exception is caught correctly. I will try to provide a minimal reproduction soon. Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I tried creating a dummy package to reproduce the same function and test but weirdly it is unable to replicate so am guessing there could be some other side effect on my project package. I will investigate that, for now I will close this ticket or re-open if I am able to spot this issue. Thanks</p>
