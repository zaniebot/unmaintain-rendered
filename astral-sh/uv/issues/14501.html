            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if this issue is related to uv or Tensorflow, but uv cannot resolve Tensorflow on Windows for Python 3.10 and 3.11.</p>
<p>I've created a minimal example here: https://github.com/cbrnr/uv-tf/pull/1</p>
<p>Please see the output of the two failed checks.</p>
<p>For reference, this is from a larger (real-world) project, where I'm trying to switch from cibuildwheel to uv, and cibuildwheel has no problems setting up the environment on Windows using Python &lt; 3.12 (see https://github.com/cbrnr/sleepecg/pull/274).</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Windows</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.7.19</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, <code>uv pip install tensorflow</code> works on this platform, it installs <code>tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem==0.31</code>, which was the last version to provide a wheel.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can solve this by adding:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
    &quot;sys_platform == 'win32'&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>This resolves and installs successfully for Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 on Windows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#required-environments has a good explanation in it. In the tensorflow case, tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem broke publishing windows wheels (https://github.com/tensorflow/io/issues/2087 - It seems that this has been fixed on the tensorflow side now: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/82771). <code>uv lock</code> still selected the package lacking Windows builds because the universal resolution doesn't consider the current platform for stability between platforms, unless you tell it to consider a specific platform with <code>tool.uv.required-environments</code>. <code>uv pip install</code> is different in that it only needs to consider the current platform, so it directly skips over releases that don't have an installable wheel or source distribution.</p>
