# uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

_Issue opened by @qasymjomart on 2025-02-21 05:54_

### Summary

It seems like `uv pip install` cannot use `--index-url` of pip to install packages on the given url. If I use pip without uv, it can be handled.

So I would like to request adding that feature as installing torch for specific version of cuda from [pytorch's website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) is important for ML development.

Thanks

Sure it can — we fully support this. If you’re having trouble, I would need more information to help you (like the specific command you’re running and the output you’re seeing vs. what you expect). As-is, this isn’t an actionable issue.

Closing but can re-open if there's clear follow-up!
