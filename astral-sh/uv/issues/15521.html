<p>On that index, for the latter no corresponding package seems to exist.</p>
<p>The expected behaviour would be to only resolve for markers for which artifacts exist.</p>
<p>This issue also arises in <code>pylock.toml</code> files generated with <code>uv export</code> (using #14783), which subsequently raises errors in PEX, with which I&#x27;m trying to consume said lock files.</p>

<p>I only get the linux version of <code>cublas</code>:</p>

<p>this seems like the desired behaviour. This can not be resolved for macOS, so it&#x27;s not included in any package.
The same happens when I install <code>cuml-cu12</code> or both <code>torch</code> and <code>cuml-cu12</code>.</p>
<p>So why does it resolve with differently happen when I include <code>ray[data]</code>? That itself doesn&#x27;t depend on <code>nvidia-cublas-cu12</code> at all, not even transitively.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By looking at the lockfile, it&#x27;s clearly nonsense to produce an entry that can never be installed, but by the logic of the universal resolver, this is supported: Packages without source distributions only support a subset of platforms, so we can only produce a resolution for that limited set of platforms. Instead, we error on installation, saying that the platform isn&#x27;t supported.</p>
<p>For packages where different versions support different platforms, where you want to exclude a platform altogether or you want a version that supports a specific platform, you can define <code>tool.uv-environment</code> (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#limited-resolution-environments) or <code>tool.uv-required-environment</code> (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#required-environments). For your case this would be the following, which makes the empty entry go away.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
environments = [&quot;sys_platform == &#x27;linux&#x27;&quot;]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay thanks. This seems consistent with the <code>pylock.toml</code> <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pylock-toml/#packages-wheels">spec</a>, which, afaict, does not state that an artifact must be available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[[packages.wheels]]
Type: array of tables</p>
<p>Required?: no; mutually-exclusive with <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pylock-toml/#pylock-packages-vcs">[packages.vcs]</a>, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pylock-toml/#pylock-packages-directory">[packages.directory]</a>, and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pylock-toml/#pylock-packages-archive">[packages.archive]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;ll see if this can be accommodated when consuming the lockfiles.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve fixed Pex to deal with packages with no artifacts, but I think this is definitely a spec weakness. As an internal detail in <code>uv.lock</code> it makes total sense - uv code can deal with its own format as it sees fit. As an external detail in <code>pylock.toml</code> it seems sub-optimal if only because the spec is sub-optimal and, IIUC you can spell uninstallable for the current platform either by doing what uv does now - emit the package with no artifacts, or by simply not emitting that package at all in the lock. IOW the spec is under-specified here for, from what I can tell, is no good reason. It seems like just a confusion inducing unnecessary degree of freedom. All installers must handle both forms of absence.</p>
