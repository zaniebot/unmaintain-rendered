<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with `uv`.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

Hello! I've recently started experiencing issue when installing `fastembed` package. Seems like it depends on `pystemmer` library, which has some problems with building in `uv`. 

Trace:

```bash
❯ uv add fastembed-haystack
Resolved 181 packages in 76ms
error: Failed to prepare distributions

Any ideas how to fix it? Also fails with `uv pip install`.

uv version: 0.4.0.
platform: WSL2
python: 3.12.5, also fails on 3.11.9, 3.11.6, and seems like all 3.11+???

Why am I assuming that it might be related to `uv` specifically: I was able to install and build the same packages in `pyenv 3.12.0b4`.

UPD: Full logs: [log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16825770/log.txt).

UPD2: was able to install on python 3.10.12 (`uv`).

UPD3:  Was able to install on 3.12.5. I just installed pip using uv pip install pip and then added my dependency:

```bash
uv pip install pip # in case you dont have regular pip in your env
pip install pystemmer
uv add fastembed-haystack
```

Question: are there more elegant solutions, and how can i avoid doing those workarounds and just install normally in the future?

UPD4: Got a response in pystemmer github. Apparently, when you directly specify that you want to use a `gcc` instead of clang as a compiler during installing this package using regular uv means, it works:

```bash
CC=gcc-11 uv pip install pystemmer # or
CC=gcc-11 uv add fastembed-haystack
```

Is there a way to use gcc by default (instead of clang)?

I think this is likely necessary since the Pythons we use use clang by default.

Yeah, seems like that! I think the issue can be considered resolved. However, IMO it would be nice to have an option to choose default compiler used in uv without environment variables.
