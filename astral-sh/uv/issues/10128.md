# `uv python install` should recognize the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable

---

_Issue opened by @zeevro on 2024-12-23 22:43_

As of `uv 0.5.11`, `uv python install` installed the latest available Python, disregarding the value of `UV_PYTHON`.
```
❯ docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:debian bash
root@1ceb45ef5f74:/# UV_PYTHON=3.12 uv python install
Installed Python 3.13.1 in 1.46s
 + cpython-3.13.1-linux-x86_64-gnu
```
