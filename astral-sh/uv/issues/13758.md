# Can't get JupyterLab Real-Time collaboration work inside uv environment

---

_Issue opened by @2gn on 2025-06-01 03:29_

### Question

I've followed this instruction to use jupyter inside uv:

[Using uv with Jupyter > creating a kernel (docs.astral.sh)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#creating-a-kernel)

And then this guide to enable jupyterlab-collaboration: 

[Welcome to JupyterLab Real-Time collaboration documentation!](https://jupyterlab-realtime-collaboration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Since this guide wasn't using uv, I did the following instead:

```python3
$ uv pip install jupyter-collaboration
$ uv add jupyter-collaboration
$ uv tool install jupyter-collaboration
```

however, none of them worked, and jupyterlab-collaboration didn't show up in the extension panel

searching `collaboration` inside the panel shows the package and I think it's supposed to be in the `installed` list.

clicking on the `install` button gives the following error (username redacted for privacy)

### Platform

### Version

nvm, I found a solution.

1. [with a kernel](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#creating-a-kernel), install jupyter-collaboration from inside the notebook.

```
!uv pip install jupyter-collaboration
```

and then it showed up in the panel

fyi, I also had to set --ip=0.0.0.0 to share my notebook inside the network (which is not directly related to uv).
