# `uv self update` to respect the `required-version` setting

---

_Issue opened by @pratt-fds on 2025-09-24 12:02_

### Summary

It would be nice if `uv self update` would respect the `required-version` setting in the local pyproject.toml. Currently `uv self update` simply updates to the latest available version. Any attempt to use uv will then potentially error out with advice to run `uv self update <version>`

### Example

By respecting the pyproject.toml setting, it will allow developers working on multirepo codebases to more easily switch working context when switching between repos, improving the UX

I think https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11869 might better suite your needs

Maybe?

It feels very janky to call `uv tool run uv sync` though ...

Like, the internal implementation? I don't think we'd do what was implemented there specifically.

Not considering that specific implementation, just thinking about it from a user perspective :)

Maybe I misunderstood what your suggestion is - Do you mean that if I called `uv sync ...` with an incompatible version of uv installed, it would simply attempt to catch this and switch to a compatible version before erroring?

Yeah, it'd just run the "right" version of uv behinds the scenes.

I think that would in fact be ideal

This is a dupe of #10547
