            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the people who are entering python ecosystem for first time through job, including me, are not clear in managing virtual environments.</p>
<p>There is a legacy application with a clumsy requirements.txt file, which has to be installed in virtual environment. That's all the knowledge about virtual environments. When I am going through documentation of UV, most of the jargons are new and bit confusing when to use what! It's quite embarrassing to be honest.</p>
<p>I am proposing to create a guideline document, which will help in understanding package management, creating virtual environments, managing requirements, when to use pyproject.toml, why not to use requirements.txt etc.</p>
<p>This may not be a big ask, but the result would obviously guide many beginners to understand what is the standard way to create, handle and manage packages by UV.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let's try to chat through it asynchronously first. I think in part, this would be solved by #5200 but I'd love to hear more about what specifically was confusing.</p>
<p>The <code>uv pip</code> guide at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/ should be a good starting place for understanding how to use your <code>requirements.txt</code> with a virtual environment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Thanks for reverting quick. I believe there is a communication gap here. I am actually seeking for a &quot;opinionated&quot; standard for managing python projects from UV. It started with <a href="https://x.com/tusharisanerd/status/1829284911641252176.">this tweet</a>.</p>
<p>As a developer who have worked based on what it has been a standard at work, most of the time using <code>requirements.txt</code>, I am interested in knowing what will be right standard for managing projects? And why? what are the flaws in other approaches?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>pip use requirements.txt，but pip just record all dependency pkg and their sub dependency pkg plain, not tree structure,when you work in the huge project,more than one hundred lines pkg will let manage pkg version not friendly,and requirements.txt can not handle version conflict smartly.
In one word, requirements.txt like a log,not a smart package manage tools</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Cherrymelon Completely agree. So what should be the &quot;right&quot; way?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO,this topic may be too wide,such as add pkg that include two path,one is  switching from exist project,another one  is start from new project, the former need <code>uv add -r /path/to/pyproject.toml</code>  or <code>uv add -r &lt;requirements.txt</code> with removing duplicated sub pkg,the latter just run <code>uv init</code> or <code>uv init /path/your_work_pkg_path</code> for pkg level development in big team.</p>
<p>This just one little part of add pkg,besides, like the deploy action will be different in container and normal server machine , I think considering the most common situation and control  the size of  exposed information  also important and make reading friendly.</p>
<p>Anyway,it is a high-valued work</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/">Python Packaging User Guide</a> is a very good resource on this and getting better all the time.  I think a visible reference to this would suffice for most beginners.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@schlich Thanks for the suggestion. For a beginner this can be overwhelming and most of the content seems to be for the python packages, but not the projects we use in our workspace or so.</p>
