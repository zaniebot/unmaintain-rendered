# Allow setting a target version for `uv self update`

---

_Issue opened by @hofrob on 2024-08-26 12:34_

# what

Add cli/env parameter to `uv self update` to allow updating to a given `uv` version. Right now, running `uv self update` will update to the latest version. According to the docs (`uv self update --help` and `uv help self update`) there is no way to define the target version.

# why

This would help in the CI and dev environments. All these environments should use the same version to be able to reproduce bugs or dependency issues for example.

# side effect

No unnecessary API requests ("is there a new version?") during CI jobs.

# how

- `uv self update --target 0.3.3` (-t)
- `uv self update --target-version 0.3.3` (-t)
- `uv self update --uv-version 0.3.3` (-u)
- `uv self update --to 0.3.3` (-t)

# additional

Similarly, listing available versions + github release link via something like `uv self versions` might be a good idea.

This is supported upstream, e.g., https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/blob/c92b9a1ab36ff8fe0173c80a951a045eed81a760/cargo-dist/src/main.rs#L597-L607
