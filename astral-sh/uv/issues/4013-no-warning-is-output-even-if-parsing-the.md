# No warning is output even if parsing the workspace settings fails.

_@Di-Is_

The implementation has been designed to output a warning if the parsing of the workspace configuration files (pyproject.toml/uv.toml) fails.

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/crates/uv-workspace/src/workspace.rs#L38-L61

However, no warnings are actually output.

pyproject.toml
```toml
[project]
name = "sample"
version = "0.0.0"
dependencies = ["ruff"]

[tool.uv.pip]
# originally string type.
index-url = 1
```

command result
```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml 

Resolved 1 package in 383ms
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile pyproject.toml
ruff==0.4.7
    # via sample (pyproject.toml)
```

Specifying a URL that does not exist in `tool.uv.pip.index-url` will cause an error, which suggests that the configuration value itself is being read.

pyproject.toml
```toml
[project]
name = "sample"
version = "0.0.0"
dependencies = ["ruff"]

[tool.uv.pip]
# originally string type.
index-url = "http://aaa"
```

command output
```bash
uv pip compile pyproject.toml
