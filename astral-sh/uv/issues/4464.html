Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>It would be great if uv pip compile can produce a JSON format output with more information such as package dependencies, and origin URLs. As they are now not included in the requirements.txt</p>
<p>This will benefit other tools like PDM to integrate uv more easily.</p>
<p>I know <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/">PEP 665</a> is still under discussion so I just report it here to see if you have any interest.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If PEP 665 wasn't around I would definitely be interested in this, but as-is it's hard to add another output format given that we'd need to support PEP 665 too.</p>
