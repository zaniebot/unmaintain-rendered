            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello <code>uv</code> folks! Thanks again for making such an awesome tool; it&#x27;s optimized and streamlined so many parts our Python workflow.</p>
<p>We have a helpful little CI robot that builds our code from scratch every week without using our constraints files, to get the latest versions of various third-party Python packages we depend on. It then freezes these constraints files and opens a PR that updates them in the repository. This technique allows us to go &quot;back in time&quot; and get a set of first- and third-party packages that were used at the time of that historical build.</p>
<p>This strategy works great, but because we&#x27;re constantly upgrading to the latest versions of all of these packages, our local <code>uv</code> caches end up getting huge- mine was multiple GB when I last looked!</p>
<p>We can remember to clear the cache at regular intervals (or not, and just let it grow), but I was wondering if we&#x27;re missing a workflow that would keep our cache sizes reasonable, or if there&#x27;s a way to tell <code>uv</code> something persistent like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only cache the latest version of a package by default</li>
<li>Delete the earliest versions of packages when the cache exceeds a size threshold (LRU eviction)</li>
<li>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just came across this issue. For a single <code>uv sync</code> call, we gather around 1GB of data, I cannot image (<code>uv cache clean</code> is still running as I type this comment) how many GB we&#x27;ve gathered since March this year when I started to use <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>I would set a default time to expire uv cache, something around 90 days would be sensible, imo.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I started using <code>uv</code> a few months back, I&#x27;m up to 18GB already. A setting to cap this would be great.</p>
