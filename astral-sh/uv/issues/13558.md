# Any ETA for 3.14.0b1 support?

---

_Issue opened by @eliegoudout on 2025-05-20 17:56_

### Summary

Hello,

I was just wondering if it would be possible to get an approximate ETA for the addition of 3.14.0b1 to `uv`? I'm personnally interested in the annotation changes, and 3.17.0a7 differs from 3.14.0b1 in that regard.

Thanks, all the best!
Élie

The PR for 3.14.0b1 is over in the python-build-standalone repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/pull/602, you can follow it over there.

We cannot answer questions about ETAs.
