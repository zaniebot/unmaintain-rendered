# xgboost==0.90 fails to install on Windows 10

_Issue opened by @RyanBlace on 2024-11-04 06:33_

```
C:\Users\Ryan\xgboostinstall>uv init
Initialized project `xgboostinstall`

C:\Users\Ryan\xgboostinstall>uv add xgboost==0.90
Using CPython 3.12.7
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 4 packages in 14ms
error: Failed to install: xgboost-0.90-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl (xgboost==0.90)
  Caused by: RECORD file doesn't match wheel contents: Could not find entry for xgboost-0.90.data\data\xgboost\vcomp140.dll (C:\Users\Ryan\xgboostinstall\.venv\Lib\site-packages\xgboost-0.90.data\data\xgboost\vcomp140.dll)

C:\Users\Ryan\xgboostinstall>uv --version
uv 0.4.29 (85f9a0d0e 2024-10-30)

C:\Users\Ryan\xgboostinstall>ver
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5011]
```

This does work with pyenv. 

I realize that xgboost 0.90 is from May 2019, so this might not be worthwhile. But, I want to report it in case it hints at some larger issue.

Thank you so much for uv, it is changing how we work!

I've checked and confirmed that this is a bug in the packaging of that xgboost version:

In https://inspector.pypi.io/project/xgboost/0.90/packages/5e/49/b95c037b717b4ceadc76b6e164603471225c27052d1611d5a2e832757945/xgboost-0.90-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl/xgboost-0.90.dist-info/RECORD#line.18, it records only a `xgboost-0.90.data/data/xgboost/xgboost.dll`, but the package contains a `./xgboost-0.90.data/data/xgboost/vcomp140.dll` (https://inspector.pypi.io/project/xgboost/0.90/packages/5e/49/b95c037b717b4ceadc76b6e164603471225c27052d1611d5a2e832757945/xgboost-0.90-py2.py3-none-win_amd64.whl/).

Thank you for explaining what is going on.

Is there a switch to tell uv to ignore extra files missing from the RECORD? I'm guessing that is what pip is doing.

As far as i know, pip is basically just ignoring the RECORD. We need the RECORD properly, since we use it for uninstalling files. I recommend upgrading to a newer xgboost version that has this bug fixed.
