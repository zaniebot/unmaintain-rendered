            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When using uv as a drop-in replacement for pip, I encountered an issue where uv fails to download packages from a custom package repository due to the absence of the Content-Length Header in the response. The registry is getting proxied by nginx and it seems that strips that header(I unfortunately can't change that fact).</p>
<h2>Steps to reproduce:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Install uv and create a virtual environment.</li>
<li>Run the command <code>uv pip install --index-url &lt;custom_repository_url&gt; &lt;package_name&gt;</code>(You need a server that doesn't send the <code>Content-Length</code> header)</li>
<li>Observe the error message indicating that the Content-Length Header is missing from the response.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tested UV platform: Windows, Tried on Linux too</li>
<li>Used UV version: uv 0.2.24 (527b711bc 2024-07-10)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Error message:</h3>
<pre><code>error: Failed to download &lt;package_name&gt;
  Caused by: content-length header is missing from response
</code></pre>
<h3>Response headers:</h3>
<p>The response headers from the custom package repository do not include the Content-Length Header, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:38:49 GMT
Content-Type: binary/octet-stream
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
Etag: &quot;9b2d35955a25abe3acb5c94aa54ad3b1&quot;
Last-Modified: Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:34:01 GMT
Vary: Origin
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
</code></pre>
<h3>Expected behavior:</h3>
<p>uv should be able to download packages from custom package repositories even if the Content-Length Header is not present in the response. pip does not require this header, and uv should strive to maintain compatibility with pip.</p>
<h3>Suggested solution:</h3>
<p>Consider adding support for downloading packages without the Content-Length Header, or provide an option to disable the requirement for this header. This would allow uv to work seamlessly with custom package repositories that do not provide this header.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report.</p>
<p>This error is coming from a dependency</p>
<p>https://github.com/prefix-dev/async_http_range_reader/blob/f65c0c94ca4e3035b8561ee2ff8b1d5221b66abb/src/lib.rs#L319-L326</p>
<p>which we invoke at</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/d833910a5d210d72690ed25b03f4211607585f07/crates/uv-client/src/registry_client.rs#L578</p>
<p>We'll need to fallback to downloading the entire file — which we do support but we might need to make some changes to the stream library to handle streaming without a content-length?</p>
<p>Note this is going to drastically impact performance as we need to inspect each wheel for metadata and this will bypass our optimizations that avoid downloading the full file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With a little more investigation, it looks like <code>async_http_range_reader</code> needs the content length to allocate a memory map. It seems like a stretch to make it content-length agnostic? cc @baszalmstra (just a heads up)</p>
<p>I think we'd need a separate code path that doesn't do async streaming which sounds like a pain.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems to me like a problem the custom repository should fix 😅 and it would be an easy fix too, at least theoretically</p>
<p>still doesn't help users who want to use uv as a drop-in replacement for pip, though</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we already have a fallback path that avoids the async reader. This should just be another case of that... I'll look into it.</p>
