            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have an extremely weird issue with custom index URLs.</p>
<p>In one project I have a couple of deps pulled from gitlab:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.sources]
mypackage1 = { index = &quot;index1&quot; }
mypackage2 = { index = &quot;index2&quot; }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;mypackage1&quot;
url = &quot;https://our_current_host/api/v4/projects/1/packages/pypi/simple&quot;
explicit = true
authenticate = &quot;always&quot;

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;mypackage2&quot;
url = &quot;https://our_current_host/api/v4/projects/2/packages/pypi/simple&quot;
explicit = true
authenticate = &quot;always&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Because we're moving from <code>our_current_host</code> to <code>our_current_host2</code> I updated the URLs in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and replaced them in the lock.</p>
<p>However, uv still attempts to fetch from the old URL, despite it not being present in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>uv.lock</code>, or environment variables. Even running <code>uv cache clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf .venv</code> doesn't help.</p>
<p>I honestly have no idea where uv could even be finding the old URL.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.9.2</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.11.5</p>

<p>Updating the lockfile manually is not supported, you need to use <code>uv lock</code> to update the lockfile.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv lock</code> didn't correctly update the lockfile in this situation. To make matters worse, once in this state I have no idea where uv is even storing the old url state to fix the problem.</p>
<p>This also occurs when using uv pip directly, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip install mypackage --index-url https://our_current_host2/api/v4/projects/1/packages/pypi/simple
⠹ mypackage==0.2.3                                                                                                                                        error: Failed to fetch: `https://our_current_host/api/v4/projects/1/packages/pypi/files/HASH/mypackage-0.2.3-py3-none-any.whl`
