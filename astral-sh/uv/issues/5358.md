# ``uv init --python``  error message is inaccurate.

_Issue opened by @FishAlchemist on 2024-07-23 17:59_

**uv version:** build from source 5f1f9c82
**operating system:** Windows 11 23H2 x86-64
About this error:
```
error: No interpreter found for executable name `===0.0.*` in virtual environments, managed installations, system path, or `py` launcher
```
The error seems to only occur when there are issues with the provided ``version specifiers``.
Based on the results of the commands mentioned below, I don't think this error message is reasonable in the current behavior.
### Command One (Failure case)
```powershell
uv  init -p "===1.0.*" -v
```
**verbose output:**
```powershell
DEBUG uv 0.2.27
warning: `uv init` is experimental and may change without warning
DEBUG Searching for Python interpreter with executable name `===1.0.*`
DEBUG Checking for Python interpreter at executable name `===1.0.*`
error: No interpreter found for executable name `===1.0.*` in virtual environments, managed installations, system path, or `py` launcher
```
### Command Two (The case that should fail based on the error information)
```powershell
uv init -p "<=0.1" -v
```
**verbose output:**
```powershell
DEBUG uv 0.2.27
warning: `uv init` is experimental and may change without warning
Initialized project `example`
```

That's a funny one.

Is `"===1.0.*"` even a valid version specifier? A couple things here...

1. Maybe we should error instead of treating things that do not start with an alphabetical character as executable names
2. The second invocation with `<=0.1` is valid, but we should probably check that the requested version is in our supported range i.e. `>=3.7`?

As a note, the error message isn't "wrong" — we are attempting to resolve your Python request which is an executable name as the "final" interpretation of the request because it didn't match any of the other supported formats

@zanieb 
I'm not sure if ``===1.0.*`` is a valid format. I just don't know how to use it. I saw in the documentation that ``===`` is supported.
* ===: Arbitrary equality clause.
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#id5
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#requires-python


The provided Python version seems to be directly filled into ``requires-python``, but my computer cannot possibly have such a low version of Python. So I think it should be an error, not a successful create.

I don't think we should fail if someone asks for a Python version they don't currently have. We should definitely warn though.

I think we don't like the `*` with `===`:

```
❯ uv python install '===3.6' 
warning: `uv python install` is experimental and may change without warning
Searching for Python versions matching: Python ===3.6
error: No download found for request: cpython-===3.6-macos-aarch64-none
❯ uv python install '===3.6.*'
warning: `uv python install` is experimental and may change without warning
error: Cannot download managed Python for request: executable name `===3.6.*`
```

``===`` Arbitrary equality. 
It is actually not recommended for use, as stated in the Version specifiers specification.
> Use of this operator is heavily discouraged and tooling MAY display a warning when it is used.

Perhaps UV should also issue a warning when ``arbitrary equality`` is used?

Edit:
Poetry about Arbitrary equality
