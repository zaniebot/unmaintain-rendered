# Disable Git by default, so that the project does not start with Git

---

_@xteveg_

### Summary

Is it possible to have the option to disable the project from starting with git by default? I mean, apart from having to type '--vcs none', since not everyone always wants to create a repository. I would like to have an option in the settings to disable git by default when starting projects.

### Example

_No response_

I created a tracking issue for this concept https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12305 — there have been similar previous requests.
