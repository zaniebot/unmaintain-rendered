# uv venv includes system dependencies in fresh environment

_Issue opened by @xOctave on 2025-09-02 13:47_

### Summary

`uv venv` includes system dependencies in fresh environment

**Describe the bug**
When creating a fresh project with `uv venv`, the virtual environment unexpectedly shows all system-wide dependencies when running `pip list`. I would expect a clean environment containing only the standard library (and optionally pip if seeded), but instead the environment seems to inherit global packages.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Create a new directory:

   ```bash
   uv init uvdemo && cd uvdemo
   ```
2. Create a venv:

   ```bash
   uv venv --python 3.12
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. List installed packages:

   ```bash
   pip list
   ```
4. Observe that all packages installed system-wide appear here.
 
  ```[...]
python-debian         0.1.49+ubuntu2
python-markdown-math  0.8
pytz                  2024.1
pyxdg                 0.28
PyYAML                6.0.1
regex                 2022.10.31
rencode               1.0.6
requests              2.31.0
rich                  13.7.1
roman                 3.3
service-identity      24.1.0
setproctitle          1.3.3
setuptools            68.1.2
six                   1.16.0
soupsieve             2.5
ssh-import-id         5.11
systemd-python        235
textile               4.0.2
torbrowser-launcher   0.3.7
[...]
```
They should not be there !


**Expected behavior**
The environment created by `uv venv` should be isolated, with no system packages present. Running `pip list` should show only `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` if seeded, or nothing at all if unseeded.

**Actual behavior**
System dependencies from `/usr/lib/python3.12/dist-packages` (and potentially others) appear inside the venv. This makes the venv non-isolated and causes unexpected behavior.


**Additional context**

* The venv’s `pyvenv.cfg` has `include-system-site-packages = false`.
* `sys.path` inside the venv includes `/usr/lib/python3.12` and a system-installed `sitecustomize.py` gets loaded, which seems to bring in the system packages.
* This makes it hard to rely on `uv venv` for isolated builds.

You're not getting `pip` from the virtual environment, e.g., do `which pip`. We don't install pip by default in virtual environments, use `uv pip list` instead or `uv venv --seed`.
