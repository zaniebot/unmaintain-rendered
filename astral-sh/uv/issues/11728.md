# certificate verify failed when using uv pip as opposed to pip

_Issue opened by @KennethEnevoldsen on 2025-02-23 21:10_

### Question

When I run:
```
uv pip install pytrec-eval-terrier==0.5.6
```

I get the following certificate error:

```
...
"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/urllib/request.py",
      line 1351, in do_open
          raise URLError(err)
      urllib.error.URLError: <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]
      certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate
      (_ssl.c:997)>
```

but this does not happen with pip:

```
pip install pytrec-eval-terrier==0.5.6 
```

As I understand, this is caused by the [difference](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#http-authentication) in how certificates are handled. However, I don't know how to work around this. I have read through the linked docs as well as searched for related issues (e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6572#issuecomment-2594166728 which suggest enabling [`native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#native-tls)).

This issue is specific to this package

### Platform

MacOS (Darwin 24.3.0 arm64)

### Version

uv 0.6.2 (6d3614eec 2025-02-19)

I don't know that there's much we can do for you here apart from suggesting `native-tls`.

You can also use [UV_NATIVE_TLS](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_native_tls) if you don't want to modify your pyproject.toml. Note, it's possible you have [global.cert ](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/https-certificates/) configured via pip config hence why you may see pip working but not uv.

thanks @samypr100. Playing around with the global.cert, I have resolved the issue (or at least moved on to a new one). 

I will close this issue - thanks for the help!
