            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When using uv init to initialize a project on Windows, it creates a Scripts directory under .venv, while on Linux it creates a bin directory. This caused an error when I deployed a program written on Windows to a Linux server:</p>
<p>error: Project virtual environment directory xxx/.venv cannot be used because it is not a valid Python environment (no Python executable was found)</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep, you'll run into the same issue even using Python's venv itself. That's expected.
Why would you need cross-platform virtual environments? Generally, the use case is to run <code>uv sync</code> again in the new environment, rather than simply taking the virtual environment with you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 You generally can't take a <code>.venv</code> created on one machine and use it on another that's running a different operating system or architecture. You should re-run whatever commands you ran to create the environment, over on the new machine.</p>
