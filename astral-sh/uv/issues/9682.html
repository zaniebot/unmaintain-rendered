            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to support editable installs of a package and one of its dependencies, if the dependencies are already checked out locally.</p>
<p>This is what I tried:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;Test&quot;
version = &quot;0.1&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;humanize @ git+https://github.com/python-humanize/humanize.git/&quot;,
]

[tool.uv.sources]
humanize = { path = &quot;../humanize&quot;, editable = true }
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>uv pip install .</code> gives me</p>
<pre><code>  × Failed to build `test @ file:///C:/Git/bug`
  ├─▶ Failed to parse entry: `humanize`
  ╰─▶ Can&#x27;t combine URLs from both `project.dependencies` and `tool.uv.sources`
</code></pre>
<p>I read some <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-sources">documentation</a>, but I must admit I was unable to figure out if the above should be supported or not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh that&#x27;s a good question, since the documentation is rather sparse on this feature (unless I looked in the wrong place).</p>
<p>I think I would <em>expect</em> to happen whatever happens for this <code>pyproject.toml</code> (where the &quot;main&quot; source is now PyPI rather than GitHub):</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;Test&quot;
version = &quot;0.1&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;humanize&quot;]  # from PyPI

[tool.uv.sources]
humanize = { path = &quot;../humanize&quot;, editable = true }
</code></pre>
<p>In an ideal world, I would <em>want</em> <code>uv pip install -e .</code> to install &quot;Test&quot; and &quot;humanize&quot; in editable mode, from <code>.</code> and <code>../humanize</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>I am unsure what <code>uv pip install .</code> should do for &quot;humanize&quot;. I think both options would be fine for me (GitHub or <code>../humanize</code>), with a slight preference for the local editable install. I would like if the local install folder was optional: meaning, if it was missing, it should not impact installation of the package, at least in non-editable mode - maybe also generally.</p>
