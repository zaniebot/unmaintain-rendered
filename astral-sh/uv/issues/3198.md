# Release pipeline does not stop if part fails

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-04-22 20:06_

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/8789651447

We ended up publishing the tag and GitHub release with the build artifacts, but not the install script (#3196) and the PyPI publish was skipped.
