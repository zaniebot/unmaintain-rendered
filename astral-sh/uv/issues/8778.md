# Is it normal for `uv sync` to return an "error: No `project` table found" when used with `--group`?

Hi!

I want to ask if it's normal that `uv sync --group <group>`, along with `uv sync --group <group> --no-install-project`, `uv sync --only-group <group>` and `uv sync --only-group <group> --no-install-project`, exits on the following error:

```
error: No `project` table found in: `/my_ds_project/pyproject.toml`
```

With the following toy `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[dependency-groups]
ds = [
    "numpy>=2.1.3",
    "pandas>=2.2.3",
]
```

The commands work as intended when we add the `project` table, e.g.:
```toml
[project]
name = "my_ds_project"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependency-groups]
ds = [
    "numpy>=2.1.3",
    "pandas>=2.2.3",
]
```

I'm not sure the behaviour totally follows [PEP 735](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/) and I'm just misunderstanding it, or if it's a design choice to always require a `project` table in the presence of a `pyproject.toml` or it's just a bug on my platform.

I'm using:
- macOS, M1, Sequoia 15.0.1
- uv version: 0.4.29 (85f9a0d0e 2024-10-30)

I think you'd still have to comply with the minimum requirements of [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) to be able to leverage [PEP 735](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/) dependency groups. Hence, a `[project]` table would always be required unless the build backend generates it automatically on your behalf.

I think it's just a new feature and it will see more development soon. The following workaround has been mentioned (exactly this and no more needed), but it's an unintentional interaction of features..

```toml
[dependency-groups]
ds = [
    "numpy>=2.1.3",
    "pandas>=2.2.3",
]

[tool.uv.workspace]
```

Thank you for your responses @samypr100 and @bluss and for the workaround.

I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't an issue with my installation / platform or me just misunderstanding the [PEP 735](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/).
