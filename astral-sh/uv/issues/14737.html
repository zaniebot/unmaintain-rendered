            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On nightly, clippy notes that <code>OptionSet</code> is not sound, as we're doing equally comparisons with it:</p>
<pre><code>warning: function pointer comparisons do not produce meaningful results since their addresses are not guaranteed to be unique
  --&gt; crates/uv-options-metadata/src/lib.rs:74:5
   |
72 | #[derive(Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq)]
   |                           --------- in this derive macro expansion
73 | pub struct OptionSet {
74 |     record: fn(&amp;mut dyn Visit),
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |
   = note: the address of the same function can vary between different codegen units
   = note: furthermore, different functions could have the same address after being merged together
   = note: for more information visit &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/ptr/fn.fn_addr_eq.html&gt;
   = note: `#[warn(unpredictable_function_pointer_comparisons)]` on by default
</code></pre>
<p>It looks like we're only doing those comparisons in tests, though I wouldn't know how to replace them.</p>
