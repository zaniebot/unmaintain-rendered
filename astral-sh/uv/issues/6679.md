# Install uv with uv

---

_Issue opened by @ewjoachim on 2024-08-27 09:19_

Now that uv supports tools, is it a good id that uv manages its own installation ?
If I do:
```console
$ uv tool install uv
```

and then uninstall the uv I used to run this, am I likely to get into problems ?

Also, should that be what the install script does ? Is there a good reason that I need to add multiple paths to my PATH, and `uv` itself is not in `~/.local/bin` and instead in `~/.cargo/bin` ?

Hi! I think this is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6662 and #6400

Uhh.. I guess it'd work. I wouldn't recommend it.

What other paths do you need? Isn't there just one?

> and uv itself is not in ~/.local/bin and instead in ~/.cargo/bin ?

Yes, we want to move it but haven't for backwards compatibility. We will eventually.
