# Is it supported to set `native-tls` setting on system-wide uv.toml

### Question

Hi I noticed that the settings page lists that `native-tls` should be allowed in my system-wide uv.toml. Other pages however only mention env var or setting the config on a project specific toml. I've tried to set this configuration on my system-wide uv.toml but it doesn't get picked up. (generally the system-wide config was applied though)

Not sure if this is rather a doc issue or feature gap.

I think this should work, can you share the output of something like `uv run -v --show-settings`?
