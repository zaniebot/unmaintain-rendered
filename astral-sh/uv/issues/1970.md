# `pip freeze` command as an option for `pip list`

---

_Issue opened by @T-256 on 2024-02-25 20:24_

Now https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1662 is merged, we can consider `pip list --format freeze` instead of independent subcommand.

We should add `--format=freeze`, probably, to make it compatible with `pip`.

@T-256 already noted that `pip list --format=freeze` and `pip freeze` are not equivalent:

**pip list**
```shell
pip list --format freeze --editable
```

```text
PACKAGE==0.4.0
```

**pip freeze**
```shell
pip freeze | grep PACKAGE
```

```text
-e git+https://github.com/USER/REPO.git@COMMIT#egg=PACKAGE
```

I'll add the freeze format in a follow-up PR
