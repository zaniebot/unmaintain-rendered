# Build source distributions in parallel in pip-sync

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-11-21 12:41_

We currently first download wheels and source dists and then build source dists sequentially in the installer:

https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/blob/35fd86631b6a57e5c453055cad159abd672e20ee/crates/puffin-cli/src/commands/pip_sync.rs#L234-L237

We should download and built them in parallel
