# Support resumable downloads

_Issue opened by @wrp on 2025-12-02 17:47_

If a download is interrupted, uv should cache partial data and resume on the next run using HTTP range requests.

FYI pip implements this within a single command, i.e. if you do `pip install` and the typical connection retry fails it will start a new HTTP session and attempt to retry from the existing location if the remote index supports reading files from arbitrary byte locations: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip/#cmdoption-resume-retries

If that fails pip does not attempt to implement this across command attempts. So far we've not had anyone complaint, and it appears to have solved the UX for users on unreliable networks.

@notatallshaw I also have this problem with UV all the time. I think resumable downloads would be best, because now I have to download the whole package again, e.g., fails 688/700 MB, and then I have to start downloading again from 0 MB.

Also need this feature.

If you're hitting errors with downloads, can you share the error messages you get and some details about your network setup?

uv uses streaming unpacks, a lot of registries don't support range requests and generally failures that require a manual restart are a bad experience, so I'm interested in improving the reliably of a download as it is running.

@konstin Hi there,

I got a similar error where I try to download torch+cuda13 version. It kept giving fetching error (for different Nvidia whl each time). But, if I try to download some of the wheels that were failed during `uv pip install`, I can download easily and quickly. This is done all inside venv created by `uv venv`. Here is my log:
