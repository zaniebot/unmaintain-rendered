# No activate.bat Created with venv Command on Windows

---

_Issue opened by @bwanshoom on 2024-02-16 10:13_

activate.ps1 is created, but the Python module venv also creates activate.bat. Some of us still use cmd-compatible shells. It would be nice for compatibility sake for uv to create it as well.
