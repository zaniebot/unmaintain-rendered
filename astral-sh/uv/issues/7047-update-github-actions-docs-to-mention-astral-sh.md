# Update GitHub Actions docs to mention `astral-sh/setup-uv`

---

_Issue opened by @my1e5 on 2024-09-04 20:38_

Now that `eifinger/setup-uv` is under the Astral banner as `astral-sh/setup-uv`, perhaps the docs for [Using uv in GitHub Actions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/) could be updated to recommend using this action?
