# [project.scripts] invalid

_Issue opened by @thcpdd on 2025-05-29 10:51_

### Question

I want to define a script name to start fastapi convinently, so I write config file:
```
[project]
name = "uv-test"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.115.12",
    "uvicorn>=0.34.2",
]

[project.scripts]
dev = "uvicorn main:app"
start = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0"
```
But it has an error when I run `uv run dev`:
```bash
error: Failed to spawn: `dev`
  Caused by: program not found
```
The `main.py` file content:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI


app = FastAPI()


@app.get('/index')
def index():
    return {"msg": "hello"}

```


### Platform

Windows 11 x86_64

### Version

That's not how `project.scripts` works, see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#command-line-interfaces and https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#creating-executable-scripts

I think you're looking for #5903
