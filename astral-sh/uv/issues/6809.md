# Windows _netrc not recognized for pip auth

---

_Issue opened by @corby on 2024-08-29 12:39_

I cross compile a python application with lots of C libraries.
uv works fine on *nix based platforms, but on Windows the ~/.netrc file is called ~/_netrc (who knows why)

Copying the ~/_netrc to ~/.netrc fixed uv.
Can we have uv scan for ~/.netrc and fall back to ~/_netrc on windows platform?

Hm I presumed support was added when they did upstream https://github.com/gribouille/netrc/issues/1 but maybe not. We should follow-up here.
