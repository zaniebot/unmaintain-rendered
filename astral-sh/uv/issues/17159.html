First of all, I want to express my huge gratitude for this project. uv is incredibly fast and has significantly improved my Python workflow. It is truly a game-changer!</p>
<p>However, I would like to provide some subjective feedback regarding the CLI loading spinner/animation.</p>
<p>The current animation style (the rotating dots) reminds me a lot of the npm spinner. I personally find this specific style of animation visually uncomfortable (almost a bit dizzying/distracting).</p>
<p>While I understand this is a minor UI detail, it affects the user experience during those few seconds of waiting.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Could you consider adding an option to change the spinner style to something simpler (like a classic progress bar or a simple pulsating cursor), or perhaps providing a config to customize the TUI style?</p>
<p>Thanks again for building such an amazing tool!</p>
