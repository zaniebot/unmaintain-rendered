            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the same spirit as <code>twine check</code> (see #8641), there is a nice utility called <a href="https://github.com/jwodder/check-wheel-contents"><code>check-wheel-contents</code></a>.</p>
<p>Do we still need this tool now that <code>uv publish</code> exists? I mean, is <a href="https://github.com/jwodder/check-wheel-contents"><code>check-wheel-contents</code> checking for stuff</a> that <code>uv publish</code> does not?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not opposed to including these checks in uv, but ideally, these checks would already be performed by the build backed: We should error when building the wheel, ideally locally, instead of only failing during a publish run (on CI).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm now OK if there's no equivalent feature proposed by <code>uv</code>, as I trust <code>uv</code> to embed these kind of checks naturally during the build process.</p>

<p>Thanks for the thorough review! With time that's more or less the conclusion I reached out: <code>check-wheel-contents</code> was a stop-gap solution from where wheels production was messy. Now with <code>uv</code> most things are right by design.</p>
<p>I no longer rely on <code>check-wheel-contents</code> and trust <code>uv</code>. I propose to close this issue now that @konstin reviewed the list of lints.</p>
