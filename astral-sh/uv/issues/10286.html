            <div class="timeline-body"><h1>Goal</h1>
<p>I want to reduce network usage on my local runners and increase performance.</p>
<h1>Approach</h1>
<p>I've created a local cache in my server rack which is mounted to all my runners as an NFS share. I can access this share in all the jobs on my GitLab CI Runners.</p>
<p>I've mounted a directory in the NFS share as the uv cache. And use the <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> variable to configure uv in the pipeline.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">variables:
  UV_CACHE_DIR: /mnt/shared-cache/python/uv-cache
</code></pre>
<h1>Result</h1>
<p>Whenever I've multiple jobs running concurrently I get lock wait timeouts.
E.g.:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Waiting to acquire lock for /mnt/shared-cache/python/uv-cache/built-wheels-v3/index/0ab6a37ad624c78f/reportlab/3.6.13 (lockfile: /mnt/shared-cache/python/uv-cache/built-wheels-v3/index/0ab6a37ad624c78f/reportlab/3.6.13/.lock)

<p>Is this an issue in my configuration or is this something else?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Separately, I think you're on a fairly old version of uv (we renamed <code>built-wheels</code> a while ago). So you may want to upgrade first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Mmm, interesting. I've updated to the latest uv (0.5.14), but now I get an error a out hard linking. Which is very interesting to me, because previously I did not have any issue with this. After the weekend I can try updating the link mode to symlink and see if it solves the issue.</p>
<pre><code>warning: Failed to hardlink files; falling back to full copy. This may lead to degraded performance.
         If the cache and target directories are on different filesystems, hardlinking may not be supported.
         If this is intentional, set `export UV_LINK_MODE=copy` or use `--link-mode=copy` to suppress this warning.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Critically that's not an error -- just a warning. And it does make sense, because we can't hard-link across drives (and your cache and virtual environment are likely on separate drives now). I suspect the same thing was happening before, we just didn't show the warning.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems to be like it indeed. In that case this issue can be closed and unfortunately using symlink does not really increase the performance across the jobs it seems.</p>
