            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While working on #4266, I realized that the file paths we write to a lock file are platform specific. Specifically, on Windows, we use <code>\</code> as a path separator, while on Unix, we use <code>/</code> as a path separator. I believe this implies that if developers on Windows and Unix work on the same project, they will generate different lock files. This is, I believe, untenable.</p>
<p>I think we either need to find a way to not write file paths to a lock file at all (this is what Cargo does), or we need to ensure we normalize all file paths into a portable representation.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that the latter is strictly possible in all cases, but I think we are always writing Unix paths to <code>requirements.txt</code> by either converting <code>\</code> to <code>/</code>, or using <code>file</code> URLs.</p>

<p>We should perhaps still explore the design space of &quot;don&#x27;t write paths to a lock file,&quot; but Charlie makes the point that this would require reading the <code>pyproject.toml</code> in order to understand the lock file. I believe, at present, the lock file is &quot;hermetic,&quot; which could be conceivably useful (and it is at least conceptually simpler). My <em>very vague</em> thinking on the matter at present is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we wind up needing to read <code>pyproject.toml</code> and give up the hermetic lock file approach for some other reason. But I don&#x27;t know what that reason is yet.</li>
<li>I have a nagging suspicion that even by converting paths to Unix paths, there are still some cases that we&#x27;ll get wrong in the sense that it isn&#x27;t portable. But I&#x27;m finding it difficult to articulate those cases since, even if the paths aren&#x27;t in the lock file, they have to be somewhere (like <code>pyproject.toml</code>, which needs to be valid UTF-8 and thus inherently already prevents some kinds of file paths from being expressible as-is).</li>
</ol>
