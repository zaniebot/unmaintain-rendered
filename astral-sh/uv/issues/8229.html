            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn’t an issue, but since there’s no discussions tab, I’ll post it here.</p>
<p>Is it possible to install a tool with the appropriate python version it needs without knowing it in advance? (in an automated fashion)</p>
<p>Here’s my scenario: I have a package  for which I build a wheel file. I then move the wheel file to another server that has  uv installed. Let's say my package specifies python &gt;= 3.13, and the server has Python 3.12 installed. If I run uv tool install &lt;path_to_wheel&gt;, it doesn’t work because Python 3.13 isn’t installed on that server, which makes sense.</p>
<p>Is there a way to automatically detect the Python version of the tool (maybe that can be extracted from the wheel somehow) and install the appropriate version? I want to automate this process, so I’m wondering if there’s a trick or method that can make this work.</p>

<p>You want uv to automatically detect that 3.13 is the suitable python version to use. I want uv to detect that 3.12 is the suitable python version to use.</p>

<p>Yep similar issue, in my case I want to use uv as part of an automated deployment workflow for any random packaged application, manually specifying the python version is not really an option</p>
