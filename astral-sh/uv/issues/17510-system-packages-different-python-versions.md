# System packages different python versions

---

_@kocv59_

### Question

I want to install system packages with different python versions. Do I create a venv for every python version or for every package even if it shares a python version? Or can every package go to one system location?

Should folder layout be ~/.local/share/.venv-packagename1 and ~/.local/share/.venv-packagename2 or is there better way?
