            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>is this meant to work?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">  × Failed to download `XXX @ http://github.com/XXX/XXX-private/releases/download/XXX.whl`
  ├─▶ Failed to fetch: `http://github.com/XXX/XXX-private/releases/download/XXX.whl`
  ╰─▶ HTTP status client error (404 Not Found) for url (https://github.com/XXX/XXX-private/releases/download/XXX.whl)
</code></pre>
<p>I confirmed when I click on the link, it'll trigger a download in my browser. I think this is an issue with auth</p>
<p>is this where maybe a private index url helps?  but its not obvious what the index url should be?</p>
<p>I also tried <code>git+ssh://git@github.com/...</code></p>

<p>If you're logged in in your browswer, it has a login cookie that it sends for each request, authenticating the download. For uv, you need to create a token in git and pass it as an HTTP request auth token (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#git-authentication). You might also need to use <code>https:</code> over <code>http:</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey have this same question as well.</p>
<p>I'm trying to pull a wheel from Github releases on a private repo as a dependency. Notably, I want to avoid building the project and just include the wheel that is attached to a Github release as an asset.</p>
