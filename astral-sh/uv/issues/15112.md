# Add --target and/or --prefix to `pip list`, `pip freeze`, `pip show`

---

_Issue opened by @aivarannamaa on 2025-08-06 16:59_

### Summary

Given that `pip install` and `pip uninstall` support `--target` and `--prefix` options, it would be good if the in-between commands (`list`, `freeze`, `show`) also supported it.

### Example

_No response_
