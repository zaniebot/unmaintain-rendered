# uv resolves wrong version when using git source with a subdirectory

---

_Issue opened by @Jonas-Puksta-Sensmetry on 2025-10-17 13:15_

### Summary

The issue is that uv is unable to add a specific version of a git dependency to my project, at least when that dependency is in a subdirectory.

I will also note that I experienced some inconsistency with this bug. In my real project, uv fails to install the newer version, but in the small reproduction example below, it fails to install the older version, at least on my machine.

My reproduction might not be minimal, but the reproduction is still very small. It might be that having the dependency be in the git subdirectory is not necessary, but in my real project I only bump into this issue in that case.

To reproduce:
1. Clone https://github.com/Jonas-Puksta-Sensmetry/Bug-Repro
2. `cd bug_repro`
3. `uv sync`. This should install `dependency` version 0.2.0.
4. `rm -rf .venv && uv cache clean && uv sync --upgrade-package dependency==0.1.0 --verbose`. I delete the virtual environment and clean the uv cache to make sure that the issue is not due to caching (or at least not the virtual environment or uv caching).

The last command fails to install the specified version. The last commit on the `dependency-update` branch has `dependency` with version 0.2.0, but the previous commit has `dependency` with version 0.1.0, so the command should have succeeded.
The command returns this on my machine

This seems correct: The line below declares a dependency on https://github.com/Jonas-Puksta-Sensmetry/Bug-Repro/blob/dependency-update/dependency/pyproject.toml, which is at version 0.2.0, which forced version 0.2.0 for `dependency`, so no version 0.1.0 is available. For uv, URL dependencies such as Git URL override index dependencies and once a URL is selected, this URL is used over any index entries.

```
[tool.uv.sources]
dependency = { git = "https://github.com/Jonas-Puksta-Sensmetry/Bug-Repro.git", subdirectory = "dependency", branch = "dependency-update" }
```

Does uv always use the newest commit from the specified branch? There was an older commit on the same branch which was at version `0.1.0` (see https://github.com/Jonas-Puksta-Sensmetry/Bug-Repro/blob/ec9c37fd21ee39449a56b11909de7969d7d277b6/dependency/pyproject.toml#L10), so I thought `0.1.0` could be resolved.

We consider the branch as a pointer to a specific commit (the head of the branch), similar to how the Git CLI behaves; I don't think it's feasible performance-wise for uv to go through the branch to enumerate version numbers.

That's fair.
My initial problem was that uv couldn't update a dependency to the newest commit from a branch. When trying to reproduce that, it could update to the newest, but not go back to an older one, so I thought these issues might have the same cause.
That's not the case, and since I am unable to find a small example of my initial issue (and I was able to work around it), I will close this issue.
