            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I would really like to use uv, it seems a great tool. However at my company we have a lot of python packages in SVN, and currently pip can handle this no problem by specifying an svn url like this:
mypackage @ svn+https://svnserver.company.com/mypackage/tags/latest#egg=mypackage
I know that uv is a modern tool and I know that SVN is a dinosaur, but it is still very much in use at a lot of companies, and if uv tells about itself that it can be a drop-in replacement for pip, I think it would be nice to support dinosaurs as well :)
Thanks for any feedbacks.</p>

<p>I think Charlie's comment on the latter one sums up our stance</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could make sense to support it, it's just a matter of prioritization and I'd want to see more user demand before investing in it. Beyond the initial implementation, it's also a lot of work to maintain support over time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm also trying to sell our organization on UV, and while doing <code>uv pip install ...</code> is ok, it's definitely less ergonomic.</p>
