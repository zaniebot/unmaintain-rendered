# Can install pypi package pmtiles

_Issue opened by @giswqs on 2024-09-26 23:58_

Get the following error.  However, the pmtiles source distribution does have `setup.py`.  Any advice?

This looks like a cache bug (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7485) can you upgrade to a newer version of uv?

@zanieb Many thanks for your prompt response! Update uv to v0.4.16 solves the issue.
