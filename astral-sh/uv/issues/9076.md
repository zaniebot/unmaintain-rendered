# (🐞) `uv add` alphabetic preservation sorts prefixes after longer entries

---

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2024-11-13 04:04_

i would think that `pylint` would come before `pylint-module-boundaries`

```py
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
  # should be in alphabetical order
  "pylint>=3.2.6",
  "pylint-module-boundaries>=1.3.1",
  "ruff>=0.6.2,<7",
]
```
```
> uv add robotcode[analyze]==0.97.0 --dev
```
```py
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
  # should be in alphabetical order
  "pylint>=3.2.6",
  "pylint-module-boundaries>=1.3.1",
  "ruff>=0.6.2,<7",
  "robotcode[analyze]==0.97.0",
]
```

# ------------------------
```py
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
  # should be in alphabetical order
  "pylint-module-boundaries>=1.3.1",
  "pylint>=3.2.6",
  "ruff>=0.6.2,<7",
]
```
```
> uv add robotcode[analyze]==0.97.0 --dev
```
```py
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
  # should be in alphabetical order
  "pylint-module-boundaries>=1.3.1",
  "pylint>=3.2.6",
  "robotcode[analyze]==0.97.0",
  "ruff>=0.6.2,<7",
]
```

I would think so too!

(I'm not sure this is actually easy to fix, but hopefully it is!)

I think the issue is we (erroneously) compare the entire string including the specifiers -- so it's not `pylint` vs `pylint-module-boundaries`, it's `pylint>=3.2.6` vs. `pylint-module-boundaries>=1.3.1`.
