            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sometimes, I use go to definition in my editor and end up in a file in my project's <code>.venv</code>, make some edits and do not realize what I have done.</p>
<p>With package managers other than uv, this would be easily solved by deleting the <code>.venv</code> directory of that project and starting over.</p>
<p>However, due to the hardlinking going on with uv, my accidental change is now visible in all other projects I am working on. For people who do not know about uv's caching, this is hard to debug. To start over, the best way is probably to run <code>uv cache clean</code>.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to make the files read-only to prevent this scenario?</p>
<p>I verified the behavior with the following script:</p>
<p>It creates a library <code>venv_issue_dep</code> and publishes it as a wheel (using a local index on localhost).
It then creates two projects <code>project_a</code> and <code>project_b</code>, which use that dependency.
Finally, it makes an edit via <code>project_a</code>'s <code>.venv</code> and demonstrates that the change is visible also in <code>project_b</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, unfrotunately I don't think we can prevent this kind of manual cache poisoning if you're using hard-links. We use copy-on-write links on macOS for this reason, but they're not as readily available on Linux (it varies by filesystem). Making these files read-only would almost certainly break some expectations for packages.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @charliermarsh , I didn't know about copy-on-write links.</p>
<p>Can you expand on why read-only would break things? A package's files are read-only for a user if they are installed by a Linux system package manager, so I would have expected read-only would also work within virtual environments?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the Rust reimplementation of the <code>cp</code> utility (which does <code>--reflink=auto</code> by default) could be a source of inspiration for how to attempt reflinking with a fallback on Linux, if someone ever wants to give it a go for <code>uv</code> (and if the maintainers don't see an issue with that impl, of course) :) Can be found here: https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/tree/main/src/uu/cp</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Nice, thank you for sharing that! I believe you can also set <code>--link-mode=clone</code> on Linux, and it <em>should</em> work if they're supported.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@thorbenk -- Totally. I'm not referring to any <em>specific</em> breakage that I know of; it's more that it would be a significant deviation from / incompatibility with all other virtual environment-creators, and I'm very confident that it would lead to errors in some cases given the diversity in the ecosystem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going to close this as I think we're unlikely to change this. Perhaps we can use copy-on-write more as a default in the future though.</p>
