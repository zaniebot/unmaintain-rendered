            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Would it be possible to add a flag to <code>uv tool</code> that infers exact dependencies in published packages to also be dependency overrides?</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>I&#x27;m also open to other strategies. My use case is that I am trying to publish a wheel that pins its dependencies for use as a stable CLI via <code>uv tool</code>, like what is requested in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8729">astral-sh/uv#8729</a>. I have taken inspiration from the thread to add at build time a &quot;pinned&quot; extra with all direct and transitive dependencies pinned using ==.</p>
<p>When one of the dependencies is either (1) yanked or (2) violates a constraint, invoking the package through <code>uv tool</code> fails. During development, we can control this using <code>override-constraints</code>, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible yet through <code>uv tool</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The closest easy option we currently have is exporting constraints and passing them during tool installation:</p>
<pre><code>uv export --no-emit-workspace --no-hashes -o requirements-frozen.txt
uv build
uv tool install -c requirements-frozen.txt dist/foo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for responding! I considered this but it requires a separate mechanism to distribute the dependency overrides.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I have done to work around the &quot;overrides&quot; part of the problem is fetching the package metadata using the pypi_simple package, parsing the requirements, and creating an overrides file based on them.</p>
<p>The &quot;yanked&quot; portion of the problem for me was better captured and reported in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13569">astral-sh/uv#13569</a>.</p>
