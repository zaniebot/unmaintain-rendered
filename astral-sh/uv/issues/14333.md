# `OPENSSL_Applink` error on Windows with uv-managed Python

---

_Issue opened by @QuartzWarrior on 2025-06-27 20:49_

Hello,

When using a Python environment created and managed by `uv` on Windows, I encountered a fatal `OPENSSL_Applink` error when running a script that depends on OpenSSL.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1.  On a Windows machine, install `uv`.
2.  Create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
3.  Install a package that requires OpenSSL, for example, `nodriver`: `uv pip install nodriver`
4.  Execute a Python script that uses the `nodriver` library.
5.  The script fails with the error: `OPENSSL_Uplink(00007FFD54BC4AF8,08): no OPENSSL_Applink`

**Expected Behavior:**

The script should execute successfully, as it does with a standard Python installation.

**Actual Behavior:**

The script crashes immediately with the OpenSSL error.

**Workaround:**

The issue is resolved by switching to a standard Python installation (e.g., from python.org) and creating the virtual environment from it. The problem appears to be specific to the Python distribution bundled with or managed by `uv`.

**System Information:**

*   **OS:** Windows
*   **User:** @QuartzWarrior

This seems to be a significant issue for Windows users wishing to use `uv` for projects with certain common dependencies.
