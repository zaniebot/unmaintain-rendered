# Improve performance of `git` tests on Windows

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-01-15 21:16_

For example, the test `sync_stale_egg_info` which clones a couple git repositories can take upwards of 50s on a busy CI machine. What's this like for users? Are there improvements to be made here? Is it a test-only problem?
