# `uv <command> --help` should prioritise options specific to the command

_Issue opened by @shaunhegarty on 2024-08-30 09:21_

This is only a minor annoyance but I keep running into it. 

I typically use the terminal in VS Code, docked at the bottom, with code on top.

When I run `uv <command> --help` I expect to at a minimum see the command specific options first, since I assume this is supposed to be the quick reference. 
This is not an issue when using `uv help <command>` since it scrolls to the top, however this is the rich help and the purpose is different I think. 

Example, I want remind myself quickly what options `uv run` has:

The things I want to see are way up at the top.

I'm not sure what to do here. All of the details about the specific command are on top. It seems pretty weird to move the command-specific options to the bottom? I agree it's not great though. Unfortunately we have a lot of options!

Yeah I understand there's a lot of options. Possibly there's nothing to be done here that's worth doing. 

I was confused as to why all the options from `sync` were included. I thought maybe they just got appended in any case.
Reading the rich help in more detail, I found this to be surprising, at least in the specific case of `uv run`.
> When used in a project, the project environment will be created and updated before invoking the command.

So it's essentially doing a `uv sync` before and thus all of its options are required. Seems like `--no-project` is the only `uv run` specific command so it possibly wasn't the best example since all options are relevant.

How about `uv tree` instead? Are the index, installer, build and cache options etc. relevant for commands like this? _Edit: All the commands seem to have well trimmed options so they probably are._ 

Maybe just something to keep in mind since I imagine only more options will come in the future.

Unfortunately all of the resolver options are relevant for most project operations because we make sure everything is up to date. I wonder if we should hide more option sections by default and require `uv help` to see the full listing.

FYI, with the VS Code integrated terminal you can hit `Ctrl+Up` to scroll up to the previous command.
