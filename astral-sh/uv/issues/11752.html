            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello!
I am working on https://github.com/apache/airflow/
Thy are using workspace, after the recent package migration pyright stopped recognizing workspace packages.
I work in neovim but it's reproducible in vscode.
I am trying to wrap my head around it for a week and I don't understand what's going on.</p>
<p>Neither <code>uv sync</code> nor <code>uv pip</code> variants work. Only non editable installations provide half-working LSP.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
config-settings = { editable_mode = &quot;compat&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Is not working.</p>
<p>Maybe there is some obvious solution other than <code>PYTHONPATH</code> manipulation that I am missing?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.2</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's unrelated, sorry for bothering you. There is a hatchling build system there. So it cannot be setuptools related problem of &quot;modern&quot; editable install with hooks.</p>
