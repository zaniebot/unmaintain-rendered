# Connection retry support for `uv pip install`

---

_Issue opened by @dannysepler on 2024-07-02 20:47_

`pip install` supports the `--retries` command. According to `pip install --help`...

```
--retries <retries>         Maximum number of retries each connection should attempt (default 5 times).
```

I currently develop within an internal package index that can flake when fetching packages. It'd be great for `uv pip install` to support retrying on a per-connection basis as well. I don't have a preference for if it should retry by default.

I think we already support network retries, there's more discussion at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3514 which should cover what you're looking for. We also added some logging around retries:

- #3933 
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4725
