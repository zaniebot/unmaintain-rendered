            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>thanks for you work on uv!</p>
<p>The outout of <code>uv pip install --help</code> (uv version 0.1.139) does not offer an environment variable for <code>--link-mode</code>. As I'm commonly editing installed Python packages (to debug something), it would be of great help if I could set the default link mode to <code>clone</code> instead of <code>hardlink</code> (I'm mostly working on Linux).</p>
<p>In general, from the documentation it is not really clear why the OS-specific defaults were chosen (probably performance?) and how uv protects itself against stupid old-school developers like me when they accidentially modify cached files installed with link mode <code>hardlink</code>.</p>
<p>PS: At $WORK my Windows-using colleagues are very much looking forward to use <code>uv</code> to speed up the creation of tox venvs to not take several minutes anymore. 🥇 for the astral team and all the contributors!</p>
