# Index URL options do not parse "space separated" URLs as multiple options

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-19 16:01_

e.g. via `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` or `--extra-index-url` if you pass `https://foo/ https://bar` we will treat this as a single URL but it should be split into two.

It's unclear if space separated URLs are the best option. It seems brittle to split the input.

I will again remind users that specifying multiple non-mirror indexes with no guarantee of which index is being sourced for any given package is a **real** security issue.

E.g. https://pytorch.org/blog/compromised-nightly-dependency/

I'm the original reporter in #1688 . I don't know if `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` is correct? I hope it will work with `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` for drop in replacement of `uv` with `pip`.

Very much looking forward to this fix. This seems to be the last bit holding me back from using `uv` in our pipelines. Thanks.

I think they do just split on a space: https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/f4a543917eac822a3b06ab0fcc4df7c4e37e387a/src/pip/_internal/cli/parser.py#L249 and https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10374.
