# dask scheduler unavailable with latest uv

---

_Issue opened by @gavin74 on 2025-04-08 04:41_

### Summary

Hi. 
I'm really enjoying uv's speed and ease of use. 
I'd like to use it to improve a distributed project that uses dask. 
However...

When I create a new environment with uv, then add dask, I cannot start the scheduler. dask scheduler is not found. 
I tried this on Oracle Linux 9 and Mac OS 14.4.1. They fail in the same way. 

I'm looking for some guidance on how to address this please. 

Weirdly the only similar description I can find is [here](https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/7176). It is from 2022 and says it is a conda specific issue. 
I tried installing using uv pip install but unfortunately that did not work. 
It works in a separate conda install (see below), more dask commands are supported in the conda install for some reason.

### Example:
```

uv init mydask
cd mydask
uv add dask    
uv run dask scheduler
```
I get the output:
Usage: dask [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
Try 'dask -h' for help.

Error: No such command 'scheduler'.
mydask % uv run dask -h
Usage: dask [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Dask command line interface.

Options:
  --version   Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  config  Dask config settings
  docs    Open Dask documentation (https://docs.dask.org/) in a web browser.
  info    Information about your dask installation.

mydask % uv run dask --version
dask, version 2025.3.0

Note that the commands list is incomplete. 
I noticed that dask-scheduler does not exist in .venv, only dask. 

### Conda
When I install using conda, dask scheduler works as expected + others commands are available. 
I see dask-scheduler in the bin directory in the env, along with dask.  
Versions are exactly the same.:
dask_test % dask scheduler

I think per the "Pip" section at https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/install.html#how-to-install-dask you need to `uv add 'dask[complete]'`
