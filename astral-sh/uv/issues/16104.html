            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I ran into the issue that we uploaded wheels for an sdist in our private Cheeseshop but users were still seeing sdist compilation. I narrowed it down to the fact that the pinned requirements file didn&#x27;t have the hash for the new wheels, however rerunning <code>uv pip compile</code> wasn&#x27;t adding it.</p>
<p>In trying to see if this is a duplicate issue I found <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1530">astral-sh/uv#1530</a> which means this is a feature not a bug!</p>
<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to have a command that has the behavior pre-bug-fix, where the pinned version stays the same but the available hashes can change/grow (in this case including the hashes of the newly uploaded wheels).</p>
<p>I imagine the easiest way to do this is some new flag a la <code>--update-hashes</code> (but am not picky).</p>
<p>(I tried <code>--refresh</code> but that didn&#x27;t work. <code>--upgrade</code> doesn&#x27;t work because ideally I keep the existing pins if possible)</p>
Example
<p>Given https://pypi.org/project/uv/0.8.22/#uv-0.8.22.tar.gz as an example...</p>
<p>(Note <code>e6e12...</code> is the hash of the <code>uv</code> sdist)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Usually hashes do not change once a version was released, which iirc was the motivation for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2532">astral-sh/uv#2532</a>.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can use the existing resolution as constraints and generate a new one:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip compile requirements.in -c requirements.txt --generate-hashes --refresh
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;uv&quot; | uv pip compile - -c reqs.txt --generate-hashes --refresh
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The current functionality poses an issue if you are updating a subset of pinned package. If uv has re-locked uv.lock with the upgraded packages and you run <code>uv pip compile --generate-hashes</code>, it will bump the versions for the upgraded packages, <strong>but not the hashes</strong>.</p>
