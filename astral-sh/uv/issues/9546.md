# Conflicting dependencies for a test matrix

---

_Issue opened by @delfick on 2024-12-01 01:41_

Hi,

I want to make it so that I can run the tests for my project against `django==4.2` and separately against `django==5.1`, which means if I want that represented in the uv.lock I need to create conflicting dependencies.

But I can't figure out how to make this work and I end up with both versions of django in the virtualenv, which means it's always running the tests with django 5.1

```
old-django = [
    "django-stubs==5.1.1",
    "django==4.2.16"
]
new-django = [
    "django-stubs==5.1.1",
    "django==5.1.3"
]

[tool.uv]
conflicts = [
    [
      { group = "old-django" },
      { group = "new-django" },
    ],
]
```

Seems to be enough to make `uv lock` work, but then I do `uv run --group old-django pytest` and it is still using django 5.1

My branch where I'm trying to work this out is over at https://github.com/delfick/extended-mypy-django-plugin/pull/65

The way I'm doing it currently is `uv run --with django==4.2.16 pytest` and `uv run --with django==5.1.3 pytest` but this means it doesn't end up in the uv.lock.

I tried to reproduce this, but could not:

I believe this is a bug with the same root cause as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9289

We're writing ambiguous entries to the lockfile.

Will be resolved by a solution like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9370
