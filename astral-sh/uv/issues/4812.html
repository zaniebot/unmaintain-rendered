            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just wanted to make sure this wasn&#x27;t a typo... if locking is implicit shouldn&#x27;t the command be <code>uv sync --no-lock</code> or <code>uv sync --without-lock</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--locked</code> follows Cargo&#x27;s command line interface, meaning assert the lock file would not change.<code>--no-lock</code> feels ambiguous as it might hint that we won&#x27;t read or update the lock file — which isn&#x27;t true.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s their help menu:</p>
<pre><code>      --locked                Assert that `Cargo.lock` will remain unchanged
      --offline               Run without accessing the network
      --frozen                Equivalent to specifying both --locked and --offline
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahh I see, so <code>--locked</code> would imply that the lockfile is &quot;locked&quot; and be a signal to <em>not</em> update it. Got it.</p>
<p>I am used to the <code>ruff</code> CLI with <code>ruff check --no-fix</code> / <code>ruff check --fix</code> so my brain tripped up.</p>
<p>Is parity with cargo something you guys are shooting for? Personally I&#x27;m not sure how much overlap there is between Rustaceans and Pythonistas... I wish the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index</a> showed multilingual demographics. I&#x27;m a Python/C++ guy myself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh For my own understanding, could you explain why it should lock by default?</p>
<p>This was rather unexpected to me, as it deviates from the behaviour of most other package managers, and for most projects, it&#x27;s almost never the desired default behaviour.</p>
<p>I see that it makes sense for a <code>sync</code> command to also sync the lockfile, but seeing as there&#x27;s no separate <code>install</code> command that just install everything from the lockfile, running <code>uv sync</code> without <code>--locked</code> / <code>--frozen</code> seems to defeat one of the purposes of a lockfile: Consistent installs.
When I tell someone to check out my branch and run something, I&#x27;d like them to have the same packages installed as I do. Implicit updates is something I virtually never want, and might be consider a footgun instead :eyes:</p>
<p>This extends to other commands such as <code>uv run</code>, where I&#x27;d argue this is even more unexpected. For example, what is the benefit of e.g. <code>uv run pytest</code> updating my dependencies? If I execute that command twice in a row, I would expected to not to run into any issues, but it could actually update my dependencies on the second run, breaking my test suite :see_no_evil:</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Am I using uv wrong?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It generally matches Cargo, as an example. We <em>only</em> update the lockfile if it&#x27;s out-of-sync with the <code>pyproject.toml</code>, i.e., if you&#x27;ve added a new dependency. We don&#x27;t update arbitrary dependencies on <code>uv sync</code> or <code>uv run</code>.</p>

<p>Hm. That is the behaviour I&#x27;ve expected, but not the one I&#x27;ve experienced in a few cases. So, if <code>uv run</code> would update the lockfile without a change to the dependencies in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, that would be considered a bug? In that case, the next time this happens I&#x27;ll investigate / open an issue if I can reproduce this somehow</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification! So my expectations were correct, it&#x27;s just that either I&#x27;ve misconfigured something somewhere, or found a bug :)</p>
