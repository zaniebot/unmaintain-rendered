# uv pip install TA-Lib filename.whl Issue

_Issue opened by @SisypheGeek on 2025-01-24 14:57_

### Summary

Hi, 

I am facing an issue while trying to use uv to install TA-lib library using a wheel file. The command I am running  is uv pip install ta-lib@./ta_lib-0.6.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl, the wheel file is in my folder and i am running python 3.10.14.

The error I get is 
Resolved 3 packages in 64ms
error: Failed to determine installation plan
  Caused by: A path dependency is incompatible with the current platform: ta_lib-0.6.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

Did someone succeed in installing ta-lib with wheel file or knows how to make it work?
Thanks

### Platform

Windows 11 wsl

### Version

uv 0.5.14

### Python version

python 3.10.14.

Can you include the `--verbose` logs? Can you also try again with `uv sync --python 3.10` explicitly, to ensure you're using Python 3.10?

`win_amd64` can't be used in WSL, only in windows itself

Thanks for the reply.

Does it mean I should follow the linux method to install the library?
