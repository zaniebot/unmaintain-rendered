            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thank you for an awesome package management tool! :) I have a suggestion for a feature that I would appreciate very much when porting existing projects to <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>Dependencies of some existing Python projects are not managed very well, and they only exist in the form of a <code>requirements.txt</code> lockfile, or even just a set of installed packages in some virtual environment (from which you can generate the lockfile with <code>pip freeze</code>). Migrating such a project to <code>uv</code> is currently a bit annoying. The naive approach is to take all the dependency specifications in the lockfile and put them inside the <code>dependencies</code> array in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but that's usually not what you want, because it also contains transitive dependencies.</p>
<p>What would help automate this process is if there was a <code>uv</code> command that would read an existing (<code>pip</code>) lockfile, transform the packages into a graph, calculate a topological sort, and then separate the packages that are not depended upon by any other package in the lockfile (these form the &quot;root&quot; package dependencies with a high probability). It could then import these into the <code>dependencies</code> array, and potentially interactively ask the user what to do about the rest of the packages (but even just separating the root packages would be quite useful).</p>
<p>Why do I need to do this? Well, if I have an existing project with a set of packages, I want to make sure that after I migrate to <code>uv</code>, I will essentially have the same lockfile, to avoid any surprises. If I just took the known root level packages and migrated them to <code>dependencies</code>, the versions of the transitive dependencies would most likely be updated by <code>uv</code> (especially since there's currently no support for changing versions of transitive dependencies in a lockfile, AFAIK).</p>
<p>Let me know if it makes sense :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Kobzol this is roughly supported with <code>uv add -r requirements.in</code> or <code>uv add -r requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p>I don't think we'll try to infer which packages are actual direct dependencies in the near future — it seems hard to get right and I'm not sure what the interface would look like. It does sound cool and helpful though — if someone were to prototype it, I'd take a look.</p>
