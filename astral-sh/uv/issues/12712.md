# Install packages with uv inside docker container without environment

---

_Issue opened by @brunolnetto on 2025-04-07 10:31_

I want to install the requirement packages on an image container with uv. Below, there is an example with airflow and pip. I know, there are multiple ways to do it, but I know none. Could you help me?

Dockerfile

```
FROM apache/airflow:2.7.2-python3.10

USER root
WORKDIR /opt/airflow

# Install gettext (used by envsubst)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends gettext && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create DBT profile directory and fix permissions
RUN mkdir -p /opt/airflow/dbt_profiles && \
    chown -R airflow: /opt/airflow

# Copy only the requirements first to leverage Docker cache
COPY requirements.txt .

USER airflow

# Upgrade pip and install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the code after installing dependencies
COPY --chown=airflow:airflow . .
```

requirements.txt

```
apache-airflow==2.10.5
apache-airflow-providers-openlineage==2.1.1
dbt-core==1.9.4
dbt-postgres==1.9.0
pandas==2.2.3
protobuf==5.29.4
proto-plus
pyarrow[pandas]==10.0.1
requests==2.32.3
```
