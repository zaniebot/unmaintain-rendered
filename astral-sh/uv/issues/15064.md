_Issue opened by @lexicalunit on 2025-08-04 18:33_

### Question

It should use the latest point release, not `3.12.0`. How do I tell it to use the latest point release?

### Platform

Darwin 24.5.0 arm64 Darwin

### Version

uv 0.7.3 (Homebrew 2025-05-07)

I searched the the linked issue and found one mention of `requires-python`: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4022 -- This did not address my question though.

I then searched issues: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20sort%3Arelevance-desc%20requires-python%20latest%20point%20release

I found one issue that mentioned using `"^3.12"` but that does not work:

```text
error: Failed to parse: `pyproject.toml`
  Caused by: TOML parse error at line 111, column 19
    |
111 | requires-python = "^3.12"
```

I also found an issue mentioning `==3.12.*` but that does not work. It still just uses `3.12.0`.

I finally found this construction: `~=3.12` and that does seem to pick the latest version.

This is a fairly complicated thing that doesn't seem to have any documentation.

Can you share the commands you can and the their verbose (`-v`) output? It is not expected that 3.12.0 would be installed, we're generally installing the latest version.

Maybe I need more coffee? I have no idea why but I just retried the `">=3.12,<3.13"` construction and that seems to have used 3.12.8 (the latest version I have installed on my machine).

I then tried `==3.12.*` and that too now seems to use 3.12.8. I can't seem to make it use `3.12.0` like it was before any longer.

Apologies, I meant for you to look at the section header "What information to include". In order to help or fix the issue, typically they have to re-create the issue on their machines so they need more information.
