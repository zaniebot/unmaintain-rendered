# Add a way to upgrade or reinstall Python versions as needed

---

_Issue opened by @geofft on 2025-08-08 23:13_

### Summary

python-build-standalone only builds the latest patch release for each Python version, so if I want to pick up the benefits of some fix (e.g. the Tkinter fix), I need to either `uv python upgrade` or `uv python install --reinstall` depending on whether I already have the latest patch release or not, and these commands don't communicate whether I am. This confused me personally for a bit when I released 0.8.7 and saw matplotlib continuing to break, because apparently I was on 3.13.3 and uv didn't upgrade me.

I would like some command, perhaps `uv python upgrade --reinstall`, with the following behavior:
* If I don't have the latest patch release for a given Python minor version, upgrade it.
* If I do have the latest patch release, reinstall it. (At some point we can skip the reinstall if we know that I have the latest build, but we don't currently track that.)
* If I have any symlinks in ~/.local/bin/python3.x pointing at older patch releases, upgrade them, but do not create new symlinks when they do not exist.
