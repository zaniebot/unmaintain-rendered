<p>Hey, first of all: UV&#x27;s been great so far! Its speed really is something different.</p>
<p>I was looking into a workspace setup for a project I&#x27;m currently working on, and noticed the workspace packages weren&#x27;t being installed in editable mode. Installing all packages in the workspace and then changing one of the python files in a package would result in the old version of the code still being run.</p>
<p>Interestingly, reinstalling the local packages also wouldn&#x27;t update any changed files since the cached version of the package would be used, so running <code>uv pip install --no-cache</code> was required to fix that. I checked the version, updated it as well, but it unfortunately persisted.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
Git repo with an example, based on the same structure as https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/:
https://github.com/jeroenvdhoven/uv-example
Instructions on running it are in the included README</p>
<p>Please let me know if you want more information, I&#x27;m more than willing to help out.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv pip install -e .</code> only installs <code>.</code> in editable mode, and its dependencies in regular mode. I recommend <code>uv sync</code> over <code>uv pip install</code> for workspaces, it integrates much better with <code>pyproject.toml</code>, the workspaces concept and other advanced uv features.</p>
