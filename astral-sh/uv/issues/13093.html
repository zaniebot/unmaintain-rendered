            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It would be nice to show on the terminal the currently active dependency group, similarly to what venv/virtualenv/conda etc do:</p>
<pre><code>(dev) user@machine:~/git/projectname$  
</code></pre>
<p>This naturally wouldn't represent the environment per se (being <code>.venv</code>) but it would give clear indication of what dependency group is active.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately we don't actually &quot;know&quot; which groups are active -- that isn't tracked after the install. And what would we show if there are multiple groups?</p>
