Does your computer have two UV installed via winget at the same time?
Or, you might have installed the UV using another method, and version 0.7.8 is located earlier in your PATH, causing it to be found first.
```pwsh
 winget list --id astral-sh.uv
```

@nhjjgjjg Try this command
```pwsh
Get-Command uv
```

Edit:
If you only need to retrieve the content of the ``Source`` field, you can use the following command.
```pwsh
Get-Command uv | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Source
```
