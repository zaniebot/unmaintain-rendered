# Universal resolution issue with torch cpu / non-cpu

---

_Issue opened by @aachkar-samsara on 2024-12-17 10:50_

I am attempting to select a cpu build of torch for linux and the regular build of torch for darwin with the following minimal reproducer:

requirements.in
```
torch==1.13.1+cpu ; platform_system == 'Linux' and sys_platform == 'linux'
torch==1.13.1 ; platform_system == 'Darwin' and sys_platform == 'darwin'
```

(note: it fails also with just sys_platform or just platform_system; I was trying to force it)

command
```
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --universal --no-strip-markers --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu --native-tls --verbose
```

The output file is:

```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --universal --no-strip-markers --native-tls
torch==1.13.1+cpu ; (platform_system == 'Darwin' and sys_platform == 'darwin') or (platform_system == 'Linux' and sys_platform == 'linux')
    # via -r test.in
typing-extensions==4.9.0 ; (platform_system == 'Darwin' and sys_platform == 'darwin') or (platform_system == 'Linux' and sys_platform == 'linux')
    # via torch
```

This fails to install on darwin because the `torch==1.13.1+cpu` is only available for linux. The verbose log output is:

In particular, I am really confused why this line is occuring:

```
DEBUG Searching for a compatible version of torch{platform_system == 'Darwin' and sys_platform == 'darwin'} (>=1.13.1, <1.13.1+)
DEBUG Selecting: torch==1.13.1+cpu [preference] (torch-1.13.1+cpu-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl)
```

How can it be selecting a linux wheel here?

You need `torch===1.13.1`. `1.13.1+cpu` _is_ a valid version for `torch==1.13.1`.

That version is only available for a different platform though. So why is it being considered as valid for darwin?

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-12-17 21:42_

That’s not really what’s happening. It’s looking for a torch version, and it picks that version, and that version happens to be lacking macOS wheels. You can read this issue if you want more detail: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9711. There’s also a linked PR that would fix this automatically.

The logging you mentioned is also a red herring. We just pick an arbitrary wheel to determine the package metadata. It has nothing to do with whether the wheel is considered valid on macOS.
