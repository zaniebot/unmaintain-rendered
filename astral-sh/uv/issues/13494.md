# Referencing dependency groups from other packages in uv export

---

_Issue opened by @mgryszko on 2025-05-16 14:15_

### Question

I have two packages, `jobs` and `glue`. `glue` depends on `jobs`. My goal is to create requirements.txt combining dependencies from both projects using main and `dev` dependencies.

`uv pip compile` works:
```
uv pip compile --group ../jobs/pyproject.toml:dev --no-deps --annotation-style=line --no-emit-package=jobs  pyproject.toml
```

When using `uv export`, I cannot reference dev dependency group from `jobs`. This command causes an error: 
```
uv export --format requirements-txt --no-hashes --group ../jobs/pyproject.toml:dev
```

Is it possible to include a dependency group from other package with `uv export`?

`jobs` `pyproject.toml` (dependency list simplified):
```
[project]
name = "jobs"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"
dependencies =  ["polars==1.16.0"]

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["duckdb==1.1.3"]
```

`glue` `pyproject.toml` (dependency list simplified):
```
[project]
name = "jobs"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.12"
dependencies =  ["pandas==2.1.4", "jobs"]

[tool.uv.sources]
jobs = { path = "../jobs" }
```
