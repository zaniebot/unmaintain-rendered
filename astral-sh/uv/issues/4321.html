            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i'm trying to use rye sync with a python monorepo and root:uri</p>
<p>the resolution of folders doesn't seem to work.  for example</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;askluna-dotenv @ {root:uri}/../../packages/dotenv&quot; =&gt; error: Distribution not found at: file:///Users/shravansunder/Documents/dev/project-dev/askluna-project/packages/dotenv
error: could not write production lockfile for workspace

    &quot;askluna-dotenv @ {root:uri}/../packages/dotenv&quot; =&gt;error: Distribution not found at: file:///Users/shravansunder/Documents/dev/project-dev/askluna-project/askluna/apps/packages/dotenv

</code></pre>
<p>So for some reason, <code>../../</code> seems to traverse by more than 2 folders up instead of exactly 2 folders.   And <code>../</code> only traverses 1 folder up</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know that uv has any control over how that URL gets resolved. I believe we just ask Hatch for the metadata, and it returns the resolved file path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i'll create a issue in their repo as well.  https://github.com/pypa/hatch/issues/1570</p>
<p>Related question @charliermarsh so with uv (and ruff) whats the recommended mechanism to point to a local package in a monorepo.  I've searched all the issues and unable to find a solution that doesn't use absolute paths from user folder.</p>
<p>I can make a related discussion if that's better for this</p>
