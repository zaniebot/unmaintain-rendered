            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, when switching to <code>uv sync --resolution lowest</code> from <code>uv sync</code>, nothing changes, because we're using the existing preferences. This breaks the use case for <code>--resolution lowest</code>.</p>
<p>We should instead discard the preferences when using <code>--resolution lowest</code> or <code>--resolution lowest-direct</code>, since these two modes are not for regular development, but for testing your dependency specifiers.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think discarding preferences alone would change this. We'd also have to skip the &quot;resolve from lockfile&quot; behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps we <em>always</em> do both these things if <code>--resolution</code> is set explicitly...? Like, say that it implies <code>--upgrade</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The downside of that approach is that it wouldn't work for <code>uv pip install --resolution lowest</code>, which has also led to confusion before and would be nice to solve here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No obviously-good solution here... Options are something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>--upgrade</code> semantics whenever <code>--resolution</code> is explicitly provided. But, how does this work when <code>--resolution</code> is provided via a configuration file? We never pin? That wouldn't work.</li>
<li>Write the <code>resolution</code> and <code>prerelease</code> to the lockfile, so that we can rerun when they're mismatched. This is good, but it doesn't solve the same problem that already exists for <code>uv pip install</code>, which has been described before: #1647.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect we need to do the latter, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wonder if, eventually, we'd want to enable projects to have multiple locks for this purpose. Or enable the lockfile to contain multiple entries if they resolve with different input settings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like it depends on the use-case. Are you going to always run your project in <code>lowest</code> resolution because you prefer it? I don't know why you'd need multiple lock files in that case. Or is it a single invocation in CI to test if the lowest versions are correct? There, I don't think the lock matters at all?</p>
