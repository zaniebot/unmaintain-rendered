# `uv add` disregards venv called `venv`

_Issue opened by @paveldikov on 2024-11-20 10:28_

I think the insistence on `.venv` (with leading dot) is a bit too much. I get that the idea is to install in the project venv and not _any old venv_, but there should be a bit of give here.

Perhaps the heuristic should be:
- 'is `$VIRTUAL_ENV` a subdirectory of `dirname pyproject.toml`

rather than the current
- 'is `$VIRTUAL_ENV` equal to `$(dirname pyproject.toml)/.venv`

Also, note that `.venv` vs `venv` is a [somewhat controversial choice, with a bunch of people/systems feeling strongly either way](https://discuss.python.org/t/trying-to-come-up-with-a-default-directory-name-for-virtual-environments/3750). (FWIW, personally I don't, but I'd rather not have to exhort people to rename their venvs.)
