Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>The documentation of the <code>--no-package</code> flag of <code>uv init</code> says</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/3fd69b448e27841f7d003d79aab4e31c7995c242/crates/uv-cli/src/lib.rs#L2483</p>
<p>however, <code>uv init --no-package</code> does put a <code>[project]</code> table in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and in the absence of a <code>[build-system]</code> table, PEP 517 mandates a fallback build backend (<code>setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__</code>).</p>
<p>In summary, it's not entirely clear how not adding a <code>[build-system]</code> table is consistent with the promise of <code>uv init --no-package</code> of &quot;not set up the project to be built as a Python package&quot;?</p>
<p>(Comes from https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-735-dependency-groups-in-pyproject-toml/39233/351)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that's all correct. The project is still formally &quot;a package&quot; but we don't treat it as such when you run uv-specific commands like <code>uv sync</code> (i.e., we don't build or install it). You can mark it as a package with <code>package = true</code> under <code>[tool.uv]</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the very presence of a <code>pyproject.toml</code> effectively means that a project is &quot;a package&quot; -- you don't even need to have a <code>[project]</code> table, since omitting it means that &quot;The lack of a [project] table implicitly means the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Build-Backend">build backend</a> will dynamically provide all keys&quot;. So the rest is just convention for how tools behave in the presence of such files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this is a complicated decision we made. We wanted to be able to use the <code>[project]</code> table for dependencies in workspaces, even if the project itself was not intended to be packaged. As far as I understand, this isn't quite a specification violation since PEP 517 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the pyproject.toml file is absent, or the build-backend key is missing, the source tree is not using this specification, and tools should revert to the legacy behaviour of running setup.py (either directly, or by implicitly invoking the <code>setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__</code> backend).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note this isn't a &quot;MUST&quot;, and furthermore, we're not really acting as a build frontend in this context — we're acting as a project management tool. In contrast, when installing source trees from elsewhere, we are acting as a build frontend and follow the specification.</p>
<p>The <code>--no-package</code> option is intended as a direction to uv. Are you running into problems with this with other tools?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's possible we'll be able to do something else now that PEP 735 is accepted, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>No, or at least not yet. More than anything I'm trying to get a precise understanding of the terminology and the different moving parts so that I can teach this effectively.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I came here because I don't see any difference between a project initialized with <code>uv init myproject</code> and <code>uv init --no-package myproject</code>. The generated <code>pyproject.toml</code> files are identical. Does this option actually do anything?</p>
<pre><code>$ uv init example1/myproject
Initialized project `myproject` at `/home/lars/redhat/moc/uv-demo/example1/myproject`
$ uv init --no-package example2/myproject
Initialized project `myproject` at `/home/lars/redhat/moc/uv-demo/example2/myproject`
$ diff -u example*/myproject/pyproject.toml
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, it's the default behavior in the current version. It'll have an effect once we change the defaults in the future to setup a package by default.</p>
