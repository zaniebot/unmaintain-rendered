            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe I am the only one who ever does this, but especially when it comes to non-package projects I often like to reassess the dependencies of my project.</p>
<p>At the moment this can be done with <code>uv pip list</code>, but that a) shows the <em>currently installed</em> packages, not the dependencies as listed in <code>uv.lock</code> or <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and therefore b) doesn't show the constraints that are placed on the dependencies but rather the currently installed versions, and c) is part of the pip compatibility API.</p>
<p>Naturally just inspecting <code>pyproject.toml</code> is an option, but that kind of argument could be used to argue against the need for <code>uv add</code>/<code>uv remove</code> as well.</p>
<p>Is an equivalent <code>uv list</code> or something planned for the &quot;project&quot; API? Or should I expect to continue using <code>uv pip list</code> for the foreseeable future?</p>
<p>(It is of course also common to use <code>pip list</code> with flags for other purposes like <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2150">checking for outdated packages</a>.)</p>
<hr />
<p>By the way, just wanted to at the same time express my gratitude for the changes you introduced in uv 0.4! Having first-class support for non-package projects in this way, along with workspaces, has really improved its usability for scientific work, really makes uv stand out as a potentially universal tool, and it is really appreciated that you focussed on such use-cases even before the initial stable release. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Related to the actual use-case I alluded to, of trimming down dependencies that are no longer needed by the project, would it be an idea to have some kind of functionality to audit a project for unused dependencies? Thought I'd ask here before spamming you with another issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, no, I hadn't, I guess I overlooked it cause of the name difference. <code>uv tree</code> gives a really nice overview! Far more useful than <code>pip list</code>.</p>
<p>So I guess in part that answers my original question, if <code>uv tree</code> is the intended analogue to <code>uv pip list</code>.</p>
<p>But some way to display the list of dependencies as recorded in <code>pyproject.toml</code>/produced by the use of <code>uv add</code> would be nice though don't you think?</p>
<p>And as far as I can see none of the options of <code>uv tree</code> provide filtering by outdated or unused, right? Might these be future options, or are they out-of-scope for <code>uv tree</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv tree</code> shows the resolved lockfile rather than the environment, so I don't think unused would be relevant, but outdated could be.</p>
