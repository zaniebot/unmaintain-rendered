            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know if it makes a difference, but the reproduction is using a conda environment.</p>
<p>I have a couple of scripts that do something very similar to uv pip compile and sync by using a mix of conda and pip, I am experimenting if I can significantly simplify and speed them up with uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks as always for the lighting quick fix!</p>
<p>My aging work environment always seems to have a way to find interesting issues. I'll continue working to see if I can replace large parts of my logic with uv and if it finds anymore issues 🙂 .</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No prob, let me know if you continue to see Python 2 issues. It's tricky because we can't actually get a structured error here (we're passing <code>-I</code> to the interpreter which isn't supported prior to 3.4).</p>
