<p>Corporate network with ssl inspection firewall, custom ca on every site. Root certificate is trusted by windows, and environment variables REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE and SSL_CERT_FILE are setup. Python requests work fine. Pip install as well.  uv fails with error below.</p>
<pre><code>error: error sending request for url (https://pypi.org/simple/zeep/): error trying to connect: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer
  Caused by: error trying to connect: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do not respect the <code>REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE</code> variable, what do you set that to? We do respect <code>SSL_CERT_FILE</code> but if your certificate are registered with the Windows certificate store then that should not be necessary.</p>
<p>It may be worth seeing if there are any upstream <a href="https://github.com/rustls/rustls-native-certs"><code>rustls-native-certs</code></a> issues that apply to your situation and confirm that your certificates are available through the <a href="https://docs.rs/schannel/0.1.23/schannel/cert_store/struct.CertStore.html"><code>schannel</code></a> API.</p>
<p>All of the certificate loading and validation is done outside of <code>uv</code>, generally these issues are a problem with the certificate configuration or an upstream bug.</p>

<p>I'm unable to replicate the issue now, it was probably something transient within the host environment</p>
