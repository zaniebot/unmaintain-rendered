Note that this has a subtle problem. Using `*` causes git to ignore the `.gitgnore` file itself! This should more correctly have the contents

```
*
!.gitignore
```

That way everything is ignored *except* the `.gitignore` file. Otherwise, the `.gitignore` file will not be added to the repository. This is arguably not a problem since either way it will be ignored, but I think it misses the intent. Also, if someone somehow deletes the `.gitignore` file, it won't show up in git status output, but you'll now see the whole `.venv` directory as untracked which could potentially mistakenly get added.
