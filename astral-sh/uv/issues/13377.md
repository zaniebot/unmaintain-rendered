# Cannot install dependecy groups

_Issue opened by @PabloVD on 2025-05-10 10:51_

### Question

I have a pyproject.toml like the one below. It does not have dependencies but has dev dependencies for the documentation and tests. I would be able to install them in a dev environment, but I could not get it. I tried with `uv sync`, `uv sync --dev` but that is not working. Am I missing something?

```toml
[project]
name = "projectname"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Description"
authors = [
    { name = "Me", email = "whatever@gmail.com" },
]
dependencies = []
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">= 3.10"

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "matplotlib",
    "mkdocs",
    "mkdocstrings[python]",
    "mkdocs-material>=9.6.12",
    "tqdm"
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

### Platform

Ubuntu

### Version

uv 0.7.2

I removed the .venv, created a new one and `uv sync` installed the dev dependencies, so not sure what's going on. I didn't append a `--dev` flag.

We'd need an MRE to help here, I've never seen the development dependencies not sync.

`dev` is included in the `default-groups` so it's included during `uv sync` without `--dev`.

How are you concluding that it isn't working? Can you provide a clear list of reproduction steps that we can run on our own machine?

After I deleted the venv and created again with `uv sync` I cannot reproduce the issue. The dev dependencies are installed as expected with `uv sync`.
My guess is that I entered into a non-uv venv, created with `python -m venv`, and for that reason it didn't work properly, does it makes sense? (I'm testing migrating a repo from pip to uv, for that reason I had venvs created in different ways).
Closed since there is no issue anymore.
