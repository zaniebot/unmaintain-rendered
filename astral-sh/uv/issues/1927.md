# Support for Alpine on aarch64

---

_Issue opened by @ilanschnell on 2024-02-23 17:54_

On Alpine (3.19.1) on an aarch64 machine, I get:
```
# curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
ERROR: there isn't a package for aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-dynamic
```
It is necessary (or even supported) to compile uv from source against musl on aarch?
On x86_64 (thanks to fixing https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1427) I have no problems on Alpine.

I'm sorry you're running into this. This is an issue with our installer, see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1392. I think you can work around it by downloading the binary from GitHub releases in the meantime.
