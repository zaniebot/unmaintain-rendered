            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One reproducibility issue I have with using uv to install Python, when compared to conda, is I can&#x27;t pin the exact build of Python between uv versions.</p>
<p>This is a problem because it means if I have a script that creates the Python environment between two different users the Python build they get will be based on the uv version they have installed. And that uv version upgrades are coupled to the python-build-standalone build upgrades.</p>
<p>I understand there is a design issue here in how uv maps to python-build-standalone releases, but I would be happy with a verbose escape hatch, as I only need to install for one platform I would be fine with manually providing the url and any metadata uv needs about what Python version is I am installing.</p>
<p>Unless I am missing that some escape hatch already exists?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>personally, this would be useful for me. the current solution i have to do is make sure i &#x27;pin&#x27; which version of <code>uv</code> i install, but if i don&#x27;t it uses the latest version of <code>python-build-standalone</code>.</p>
<p>my usecase is that <code>uv</code> is in a much faster approval process to bring internally into my company since its a simple pip package, but internally hosting <code>python-build-standalone</code> is a much slower, and not as regularly needed occurrence, hence we are usually somewhat behind on which version of <code>python-build-standalone</code> we are using with our internal mirror.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can do rudimentary pinning now, see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/15314">astral-sh/uv#15314</a></p>

<p>did i do something wrong?
i have
<code>UV_PYTHON_CPYTHON_BUILD = &quot;20251014&quot;</code>
and
<code>UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=</code>https://......./python-build-standalone/`</p>
<p>within that mirror there is a folder marked: 20251014/ and has the binaries within.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It doesn&#x27;t work that way, it requires a <code>build</code> field in the download metadata and a <code>BUILD</code> file in the distribution.
