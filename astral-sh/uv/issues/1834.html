Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hey guys! As the title said, I wonder if the <code>uv</code> could hide <code>--index-url</code> and <code>--extra-index-url</code> if the <code>--emit-index-url</code> flag is not presented. Otherwise, if you have a private package index, this data could be accidentally committed to the repository. <code>pip-tools</code> hides the index and extra index both from the command in the comment and of course does not include them in the body of the compiled files.</p>
<p>I've created a small PR to do this, but if this is &quot;by design&quot;, than I'll just close it :)</p>

<p>Yes, exactly, only in the header comment, the body of the requirements is looking good</p>
