            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To go along with <code>uv publish</code>, it would be great if we could check our wheel files like <code>twine check</code>.</p>
<p>Most important would be errors like:</p>
<pre><code>Checking rockcraft/dist/rockcraft-1.6.0.post2+gfc6e711.d20241021-py3-none-any.whl: FAILED
ERROR    `long_description` has syntax errors in markup and would not be rendered on PyPI.
line 31: Warning: Cannot scale image!
Could not get size from &quot;https://snapcraft.io/rockcraft/badge.svg&quot;:
Reading external files disabled.
</code></pre>
<p>(Personally this is very low priority for my team as running <code>uvx twine check</code> isn't exactly a slow task.)</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that it does perform <code>twine check</code> equivalent checks? I've been searching, but I cannot find anything that suggests it does. I too would be glad to replace <code>twine check</code> merely for streamlining purposes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fwiw, <code>twine check</code> seems to only check that a RST readme gets correctly rendered on PyPI, which means it's not applicable to projects with a non-RST readme.</p>
