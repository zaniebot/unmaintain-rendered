            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I manage many Python projects, some of which share the same third-party dependencies. When installing dependencies, if I want to reuse the exact same versions already used in a previous project, I currently have to manually open that project’s pyproject.toml file and copy the dependency versions. Otherwise, uv will default to fetching the latest available versions (unless the dependency is already locked to the latest version).</p>
<p>It would be very helpful if uv could provide a query command—similar to cargo-cache—to inspect what versions of packages are already cached locally. This would make it much easier to reuse consistent dependency versions across projects without manual lookups.</p>
