            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should probably check that what we downloaded matches a specified hash, to prevent this being a supply chain attack route. But I'll grant you that the original action didn't do this, so this strictly isn't making things worse.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It'll be a few releases behind, but we <em>could</em> use the shellcheck that comes directly with GitHub's <code>ubuntu-*</code> runners:</p>
<p>https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/0c1310995d6f016d1acbb667eeeab13f470a42e0/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md</p>
<p>(There's also a secret-but-supported Linuxbrew on every Ubuntu runner, which could be used to bootstrap a newer version.)</p>

<p>It'd be implicitly pinned through the runner image in the first case, and in the second it'd be pinned through the Homebrew formula:</p>
<p>https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/880f28f21145efcfd79a2e6992d6467bb6c77424/Formula/s/shellcheck.rb#L9-L18</p>
<p>(I think in both instances the risk profile is small, since we already trust the runner to have a not-compromised shell and other binaries that we don't/can't hash.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The runner images change though?</p>
<p>I don't care about risk profile with the version pin, I care about new violations showing up without an upgrade</p>

<p>Oh, true. To my understanding this shellcheck version won't change until the Ubuntu version itself rolls over, but it'll still happen then.</p>
<p>We could probably do <code>apt install -y shellcheck=0.9.0-1</code> to explicitly prevent a new version from showing up.</p>

<p>I could probably live with that.</p>
<p>I don't have strong feelings tbh. Lots of viable solutions here.</p>
<p>(Claude attempted to invent a cool Renovate hash update syntax, but alas)</p>
