            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hey everyone,
First of all, I am sorry if this is duplicated from some existing issue. I couldn't find one with this question.</p>
<p>I have a wheel of a library, let's call it abc-1.2.3 both in a dist/ folder that I pass with --find-links parameter. However, the same wheel (with the same version) exists in a private pypi which is passed in the --extra-index-url. From my experiments, it appears that uv prefers the wheel existing in repository passed by the --extra-index-url instead of the one in the path passed in --find-links directory.</p>
<p>Is this the desired behavior? Or I am doing something wrong? Is there any way of prefer the wheel existing on the local /dist folder?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.6.7</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I think I was wrong. The wheel from dist/ folder is installed. The problem that I was having was related to the cache.
This happened during the build of a docker image where:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was building abc-1.2.3 and placing it inside dist/</li>
<li>Installing with other requirements passing both --find-links and --extra-index-url flags as mentioned.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the changes made locally were not reflected in the installed version. It seems that uv pip install command is not able to tell that the wheel changed.</p>
<p>I was able to obtain the desired behavior by passing the --refresh option to the pip install command.
Is this the correct solution?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an edge case with <code>--find-links</code>, since find links URLs are considered an index, and uv assumes the files in an index are assumed to be static. To ensure a file is not cached, with <code>--find-links</code>, you can pass <code>--reinstall</code></p>
