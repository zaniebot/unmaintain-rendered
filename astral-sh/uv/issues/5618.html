      can conclude that fork-overlapping-markers==0.0.0 and fork-overlapping-markers-a{python_version &gt; '3.12'}==2.0.0 are incompatible.

      And because only fork-overlapping-markers==0.0.0 is available and project==0.1.0 depends on fork-overlapping-markers, we can conclude that project==0.1.0 cannot be used.
      And because only project==0.1.0 is available and you require project, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.

<p>Specifically:</p>
<pre><code>Because fork-overlapping-markers-a{python_version == '3.12'}==1.0.0 depends on fork-overlapping-markers-a==1.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>If one is familiar with internals, this makes sense, because we have specific &quot;marker&quot; dependencies and &quot;normal&quot; dependencies, and they have a dependency relationship with one another. But from an end user perspective, they probably should be treated as just one package.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think pretty much anything that doesn't produce a resolution and involves markers will do:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/requirements.in
iniconfig
iniconfig==2.0.0 ; python_version &gt; '3.12'
iniconfig==1.0.0 ; python_version == '3.12'

$ uv pip compile /tmp/requirements.in --universal
  x No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  `-&gt; Because iniconfig{python_version &gt; '3.12'}==2.0.0 depends on iniconfig==2.0.0 and you require iniconfig{python_version &gt; '3.12'}==2.0.0, we can conclude that your requirements and iniconfig{python_version == '3.12'}==1.0.0
      are incompatible.
      And because you require iniconfig{python_version == '3.12'}==1.0.0, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>Although I suppose this will stop producing an error once overlapping marker support lands. :P</p>
