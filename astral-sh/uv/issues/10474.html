            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sometimes there is a situation where one of the package dependency does not specify properly upper version constraints for its dependency. So it may happen, that it resolves to not working environment,</p>
<p>The obvious option is to set upper constraints on this transient dependency, but then you need to remember to trace the dependency releases to check if a new version fixes the compatibility with its dependencies.</p>
<p>It will be nice to add (even fully uv specific) option to conditionally specify constraints.</p>
<p>My case was <code>nilearn==0.10.1</code> that was incompatible with NumPy 1.24+ So the <code>numpy&lt;1.24</code> lands in dependencies and no one noticed multiple releases of nilearn since this change.</p>
<p>It will be much nicer to be able to define somehow <code>if nilearn&lt;=0.10.1 then numpy&lt;1.24</code>. Then, if a new release of such dependency will still has some problems, the CI tests will show such problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@notatallshaw I do not found this part of the docs earlier. But I still not sure if I correctly understand. Does these constraints only apply to a given version or enforce this version?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is only apply to a given version, and they override all the requirements (not just add constraints).</p>
<p>It's not what you're asking for, but it's related and good enough for some use cases.</p>
