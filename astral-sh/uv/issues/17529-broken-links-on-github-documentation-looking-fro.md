Hello, 

BUG: On this page: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/docs/reference/index.md the links "**Commands**" and "**Settings**" take me to a 404

QUESTION: If possible, could you please provide the GitHub Link for this page https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli ?

Thanks in advance,
Michelle
