            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14007, I discovered that <code>uv publish</code> fails eagerly instead of at the end of the publish process. Unfortunately, this leaves a release in a bad state where it is missing a bunch of artifacts instead of just the one rejected distribution. We should upload everything we can, then fail.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As usual, ideally we had Upload API 2.0 which solves this cleanly. It seems reasonable to continue after errors if there was already a previous upload that had succeeded.</p>
