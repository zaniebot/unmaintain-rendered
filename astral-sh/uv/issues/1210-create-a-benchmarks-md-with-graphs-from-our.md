# Create a `BENCHMARKS.md` with graphs from our benchmark script

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-01-31 17:53_

I like what Orogene does here:

- https://github.com/orogene/orogene/blob/main/examples/render-benchmarks.rs
- https://github.com/orogene/orogene/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md

It should be straightforward since Orogene also uses hyperfine for this.
