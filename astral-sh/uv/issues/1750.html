            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the README.md <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/README.md">document</a></p>
<p>It says &quot;On Windows.&quot; , and then provides a Powershell-only compatible command. Running it in my command prompt gave me an error:</p>
<pre><code>'irm' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>It works fine in Powerhsell. I think the readme should say powershell only for that specific command</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed. Ideally we'd give a command that worked on both PowerShell and CMD (or at least instructions for how to do things with the CMD shell). But for now, just documenting that this is a PowerShell-specific command would be an improvement. PR welcome!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like you documented this as being PowerShell specific in #1751 -- thanks!</p>
<p>I'll leave this open for now, though, as ideally we'd document a CMD command that works as well (or have a unified command that works on both).</p>
