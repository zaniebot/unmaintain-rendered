# Caused by: Operator >= cannot be used with a wildcard version specifier

_Issue opened by @webcoderz on 2024-03-19 17:58_

 using `uv pip install -r "requirements_versions.txt" ` once gets to `torchsde==0.2.5` in the dependencies, 

it pulls in the metadata from the wheel which looks like this:
```

Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: torchsde
Version: 0.2.5
Summary: SDE solvers and stochastic adjoint sensitivity analysis in PyTorch.

```
i receive the following error:

```

It hasn't been released. We haven't released a new version since the fix was merged.
