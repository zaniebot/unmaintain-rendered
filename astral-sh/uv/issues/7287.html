            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here's a scenario where I have a tool (say, <code>pre-commit</code>) installed against a uv-managed python interpreter (say 3.12.5) which also happens to be my only uv-managed python 3.12. Trying to upgrade to Python 3.12.6 results in a broken state where Python 3.12.5 is dropped under my tool.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ uv python install 3.12.5 # important: there must be only point version of 3.12 managed by uv after this command
$ uv tool install pre-commit -p 3.12 --python-preference=only-managed
$ uv tool list
pre-commit v3.8.0
- pre-commit
$ uv python install 3.12 --reinstall
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
Found existing installation for Python 3.12: cpython-3.12.5-macos-aarch64-none
Installed Python 3.12.6 in 2.44s
 - cpython-3.12.5-macos-aarch64-none
 + cpython-3.12.6-macos-aarch64-none
$ uv tool list
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/clm/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/pre-commit/bin/python3`
</code></pre>
<p>I can fix my tools easily enough by manually re-installing 3.12.5 (in co-existence with 3.12.6), but I can see two approaches to improve the user experience here:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid uninstalling 3.12.5 (maybe raise a warning), seeing that it's used by tools (or at least ask for confirmation)</li>
<li>bring all tools installed against 3.12.5 along the ride (this may not be doable in the general case but I confess it was what I <em>expected</em> to happen, but not necessarily silently)</li>
</ul>
