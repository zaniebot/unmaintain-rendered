            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is common for virtual environment directories to be either .venv/ or venv/, but only .venv/ is currently supported in without needing to activate the environment. Since both are common names for virtual environments, could both be supported by default in uv? And/Or could there potentially be a config/environment variable that holds a user defined default virtual environment directory name that gets checked along with .venv/VIRTUAL_ENV/CONDA_PREFIX?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wonder why any hardcoding names are needed.
Just because a random folder is called &quot;.venv&quot; it is assumed a python virtualenv?</p>
<p>Why not checking  on the presence of &quot;pyvenv.cfg&quot; + &quot;bin&quot; / &quot;lib&quot;-folders?</p>
<p>Why would this need to be different?</p>

<p>how are you supposed to install a package when using a non-standard venv-name?
.venv is only used in an actual development-project.</p>
<pre><code>uv venv foo
cd foo

<p>That is a small performance-hit i'm very happy to endure,
compared to setting an environment every time you switch into a dozen directories.</p>
<p>the python-executable in a virtualenv is symlink to a global python,
yet it takes into account it's relative location to decide it is in a virtualenv and put its site-packages to its pythonpath.
if python can do that, why not uv?</p>
<p>I would love to see a uv-symlink in the venv's bin/  that only operates on the venv.</p>
<pre><code>uv venv foo 
cd foo
bin/uv pip install ...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>pyenv-virtualenv solves this by identifying the env to be used in a folder in a <code>.python-version</code> file, which is then looked up automatically every time you enter a folder, and auto-activated. I'd love to see that behavior in <code>uv</code>, which I describe here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1578.</p>

<p>I have a solution for my use-case:  symlink the foo-folder to a .venv-subfolder</p>
<pre><code>uv venv foo
cd foo
ln -s . .venv
uv pip install &lt;package&gt;

<p>@jkomalley this solves your use-case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, that does work for my use case. Thanks!</p>
<p>I still think adding &quot;venv/&quot; to the venv search makes sense since (IMO) it's just as common as &quot;.venv/&quot;, and both are listed as conventions in the venv <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">documentation</a>. The default one uv creates can be &quot;.venv&quot;, but both should be expected by default since both are so common.</p>
<p>I think an option for venvs with other &quot;non-default&quot; names is to specify them in the pyproject.toml like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
venvs = [&quot;env1&quot;, &quot;env2&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Or, since multiple venvs potentially means different dependencies or python versions for each, maybe something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.venvs.env1]
python=&quot;3.12&quot;
deps=[
    &quot;env1_dep1&quot;,
    &quot;env1_dep2&quot;
]

[tool.uv.venvs.env2]
python=&quot;3.10&quot;
deps=[
    &quot;env2_dep1&quot;,
    &quot;env2_dep2&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>For either, uv could then add &quot;env1&quot; and &quot;env2&quot; to the venv directory search.</p>
<p>When you make a new venv like <code>uv venv foo</code>, uv can add <code>foo</code> to pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>And when you run <code>uv venv env1</code>, and env1 doesn't exist,  uv could create the venv and populate it with the env1 dependencies specified in pyproject.toml.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I find myself in the situation to support windows-users.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When running <code>uv sync</code> for a workspace, uv doesn't seem to respect <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> or an active virtual environment. The docs are pretty clear about this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv.lock and .venv for the entire workspace are created next to this pyproject.toml.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, being able to configure the name to use somewhere would be very helpful. Any of CLI parameters, pyproject.toml, envvar, etc would work for my use case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was trying to work with <code>uv</code> and firebase functions, and it's such an amazing coincidence that BOTH don't support specifying the virtualenv directories. <code>uv</code> wants <code>.venv</code>, firebase wants <code>venv</code>, and so now I can't work with <code>uv</code> because of firebase functions.
Truly one of the design choices of all time.
EDIT: my bad, I just found out I can use <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code>. Apologies</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@smashedr Not at this time, no. Changing the environment name makes it harder to have consistent discovery mechanisms in editors, it's not intended to be a common pattern.</p>
<p>(I'm going to close this as we don't intend to add automated discovery of arbitrary virtual environment names and there are various ways to target other environments already)</p>
