# Spawning a process by its env path using uv run fails to expose host's env variable to the script

### Question

The title must be confusing, that's because the case is.

We have a separate tooling for various stuff, one of those modules is a "spider". It uses CDP and chromium executable to automate browsing. The issue is, when I do `py main.py` the underlying lib correctly find the `chromium-browser`executable from the env path, but when running the script via `uv run main.py` the lib complains about `chromium-browser`being non-existent. I read through the docs to find a way, but couldn't.

TLDR; How do you expose host environment variables / paths to uv's venv that it uses to `run` scripts?

```py
> py main.py                                            master UNTR  v3.13.5 12:44:23
[07/02/25 12:44:26] INFO     [SPIDER] Persistent stealth scripts configured successfully
...
```

```py
> uv run main.py                                        master UNTR  v3.13.5 12:44:37
...
    raise FileNotFoundError(_S._lang.join(_S._lang.BROWSER_EXE_NOT_FOUND))
FileNotFoundError: 
The browser executable file path cannot be found.
...
```

### Platform

Linux xxx 6.14.11-300.fc42.x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

We do forward the host environment, is it maybe that `uv run` uses a different virtual environment than `py`, and chromium-browser needs a specific venv?
