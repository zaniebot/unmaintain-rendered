            <div class="timeline-body"><p>in pyproject.toml was fastapi&gt;=0.113
uv sync -U will update fastapi to 0.114 in .venv, uv.lock
but in pyproject.toml still fastapi&gt;=0.113
all ok, but i think
will be better change on fastapi&gt;=0.114</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is the intended behavior — upgrading changes the locked version within the constraints you provide in your pyproject.toml: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#upgrading-locked-package-versions</p>
<p>It'd be weird for us to change the specification of the dependency itself on sync — it'd be best implemented as some other dedicated command. I think there are some other issues tracking support for that but having a hard time tracking them down right now.</p>
