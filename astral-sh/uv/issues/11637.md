# uvx does not work when installed with `pipx install --suffix=... uv`

---

_Issue opened by @cliebBS on 2025-02-19 20:25_

### Summary

When you install uv using `pipx install --suffix=... uv`, trying to run `uvx` results in the following:

```
❯ pipx install --suffix=@0.6.2 uv==0.6.2
  installed package uv 0.6.2 (uv@0.6.2), installed using Python 3.13.2
  These apps are now globally available
    - uv@0.6.2
    - uvx@0.6.2
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
❯ uv@0.6.2
An extremely fast Python package manager.

Usage: uv@0.6.2 [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
...
❯ uvx@0.6.2
error: Could not find the `uv` binary at: /Users/me/.local/bin/uv
```

We want to utilize the `--suffix=...` option with pipx to enable side-by-side installation of uv for multiple projects that have been tested against different versions of uv without constantly warring over what global version of uv is installed.

### Platform

MacOS 15.3.1

### Version

uv 0.6.2 (6d3614eec 2025-02-19), pipx 1.7.1

### Python version

Python 3.8.20

Hm, I guess we'd need to detect the suffix on the `uvx` binary and propagate it to the search for the `uv` binary? I'm sort of okay with that.

You might just want to alias `uv@...` as `uvx uv@...` — we can bootstrap ourselves just fine.

I'm trying to build this into a script (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11639) so that `uv` version management is invisible to the user, so I'd rather not be trying to edit their `.bashrc` (or equivalent) in order to fix `uvx`.

I don't think it has to be a literal Bash alias, if you're putting things on the `PATH` with `pipx` you could just as well have a simple executable. e.g, for each uv version you'd install with `pipx` you'd instead write a file

`uv@<version>`
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

uvx uv@<version>
```

Since it's `uvx@version` that's currently broken, wouldn't I want to do something like the following?

```
$ cat <<EOF > ~/.local/bin/uvx@version
#!/bin/sh

uv@version tool run "\$@"
EOF
$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/uvx@version
```

Yeah that'd work, or with less indirection 

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh

uvx --from uv==<version> uvx $@
```

e.g.,

```
❯ cat ./uvx@0.5.0
#!/usr/bin/env sh

uvx --from uv==0.5.0 uvx $@
❯ ./uvx@0.5.0 --version
uv-tool-uvx 0.5.0 (8d665267c 2024-11-07)
❯ ./uvx@0.5.0 ipython
Installed 15 packages in 61ms
Python 3.13.2 (main, Feb 12 2025, 14:59:08) [Clang 19.1.6 ]
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 8.32.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
```

It sort of depends if you'll have more logic in your `uv@version` files.

The constraint I was working under was that they system doesn't have `uv` or `uvx` available, and that uv is only installed in this suffixed form, which won't work with your solution.
