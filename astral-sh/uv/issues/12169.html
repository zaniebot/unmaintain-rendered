            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I don't understand why the same Python version must be stored in two separate files.</p>
<p>What is the user case for this and what is the proper way to handle these files when I need to change the Python version of my project? Must I manually edit both files?</p>
<p>I tried to see if <code>uv python pin</code> would lift the version from the .toml file and create a .python-version file but that does not work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Typically you would specify a lower bound for Python in <code>pyproject.toml</code>; that is, the oldest version of Python that your package supports.</p>
<p>In contrast, <code>.python-version</code> specifies which Python version, concretely, to use during development.</p>
<p>Example:
You want to use a development venv with Python 3.13, but indicate that your package runs with Python 3.10 and newer.
Here, you would have 3.13 in <code>.python-version</code>, and <code>&gt;= 3.10</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ohh ok, this clarifies a lot thank you very much.</p>
<p>One more question: is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8247#issuecomment-2475669567">this suggestion</a> also not planned? It seems like it would make this a quite easier to understand</p>
