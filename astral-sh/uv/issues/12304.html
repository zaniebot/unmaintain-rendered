            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Is it possible to have the option to disable the project from starting with git by default? I mean, apart from having to type '--vcs none', since not everyone always wants to create a repository. I would like to have an option in the settings to disable git by default when starting projects.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
