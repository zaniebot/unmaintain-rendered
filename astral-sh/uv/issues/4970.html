            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm slightly concerned this will lead to more fragmentation of where third party ecosystems (such as Heroku, GHA setup-python, Dependabot, ...) will need to check for Python versions when bootstrapping an environment.</p>
<p>If there was a field in <code>pyproject.toml</code> that was guaranteed in the upstream spec to be a single Python version (either <code>X.Y.Z</code> or <code>X.Y</code>) rather than a multiple major version range, then I'd be fine with the ecosystem consolidating around that, but as-is the existing <code>pyproject.toml</code> <code>requires-python</code> field isn't suitable for bootstrapping purposes, and so the <code>.python-version</code> file is the next best thing available - and pretty widely accepted at this point.</p>

<p>Agreed. That's why we've delayed implementing this. Unfortunately, we're getting quite a bit of confusion from users. I'm not sure how we'll address that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>just to opine on this: The number one issue I find when helping fellow python devs un-tangling their botched python dev setups, is the presence of a &quot;.python-version&quot; file in some directory, since it has potential far-reaching effects. If the user happens to have &quot;pyenv&quot; installed, then this file in the current (or parent) dir(s) will replace the default python interpreter, leading to expected commands not being available etc.</p>
<p>It is therefore problematic for uv to create and/or use this file, as it has side-efects far outside of uv itself (think developer just cding into a dir in their terminal in order to run some command).
The fact that &quot;.python-version&quot; is &quot;widely acceptable&quot; is the exact reason uv should <em>not</em> go anywhere near it - it should aim to minimize the risk affecting other aspects of a developer's environment. I would ask maintaines to consider at least supporting that an alternate filename like <code>.uv.python-version</code> or similar is supported as a fallback if &quot;.python-version&quot; is not found.</p>
