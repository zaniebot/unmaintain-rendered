### Summary

In this mode, all packages that need to a version change must be specified explicitly. The resolver should enforce exact pinning version semantics for all other packages. If additional package versions need to change, uv should exit with an error.

### Example

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13347 for discussion.
