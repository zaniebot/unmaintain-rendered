# lock file change `upload-time` --> `upload_time`

### Question

I've bumped up one dep and relocked, and saw a ton of changes in the lock file, while expected rather few:

It seems that the case of this key was changed?

```diff
 [[package]]
 name = "zipp"
 version = "3.21.0"
 source = { registry = "https://pypi.org/simple" }
-sdist = { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/3f/50/bad581df71744867e9468ebd0bcd6505de3b275e06f202c2cb016e3ff56f/zipp-3.21.0.tar.gz", hash = "sha256:2c9958f6430a2040341a52eb608ed6dd93ef4392e02ffe219417c1b28b5dd1f4", size = 24545, upload-time = "2024-11-10T15:05:20.202Z" }
+sdist = { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/3f/50/bad581df71744867e9468ebd0bcd6505de3b275e06f202c2cb016e3ff56f/zipp-3.21.0.tar.gz", hash = "sha256:2c9958f6430a2040341a52eb608ed6dd93ef4392e02ffe219417c1b28b5dd1f4", size = 24545, upload_time = "2024-11-10T15:05:20.202Z" }

+    { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b7/1a/7e4798e9339adc931158c9d69ecc34f5e6791489d469f5e50ec15e35f458/zipp-3.21.0-py3-none-any.whl", hash = "sha256:ac1bbe05fd2991f160ebce24ffbac5f6d11d83dc90891255885223d42b3cd931", size = 9630, upload_time = "2024-11-10T15:05:19.275Z" },
 ]
```

The only difference seems to be `upload-time` --> `upload_time` ?

Just calling this out in case this is unexpected.

Ugh, I see that it's the other way around: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13176
