            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We regularly get questions where users accidentally try to publish more versions of a package because they had an old <code>dist</code> around (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8033, https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13185, https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16028, https://python.plainenglish.io/overcoming-uvs-own-shortcomings-with-uv-02fe47885358). We should try to safeguard better against this.</p>
<p>There is a question whether this fits better into <code>uv build</code> or <code>uv publish</code>. One option is to have <code>uv build</code> remove old versions of the same package, unless <code>--keep-previous</code> is passed. This is a breaking change. Another option is that <code>uv publish</code> checks if there are multiple versions, and if so, prompts for confirmation, unless <code>--all-versions</code> is passed, similar to <code>uv pip install requirements.txt</code> or <code>uv venv</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I would like to tackle this issue, as my first uv contribution. Could I just go with the --keep-previous approach?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@m1guelperez I'm afraid this issue isn't yet a good first contribution opportunity, we first need to internally figure out which of the approaches we want to take, it's a difficult part of the uv design. Note that <code>--keep-previous</code> is a breaking change, so we'd only be able to merge this for the 0.9.0 release anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin alright. Maybe you could keep me up to date when you have internally decided on an approach? I would than eventually take up the issue again :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another option would be to add an option to <code>uv build</code> for producing machine-readable output. If every package produced would be printed on a line of its own (or separated by <code>\0</code> if no human-readability is needed), it becomes possible to iterate over the built packages and upload them. Additionally, no script would need to hardcode <code>dist/</code> anymore and that default could in principle be changed.</p>
