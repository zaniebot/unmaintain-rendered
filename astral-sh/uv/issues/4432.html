            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As previously encountered in Ruff https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2136, we've reached the default project size limit on PyPI.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this was encountered in the middle of the 0.2.14 release, which is now <em>partially</em> available. We're determining the next steps for that release, as only the <code>macOS 10.12+ x86-64</code> and <code>armv6l</code> wheels are uploaded (and no source distribution).</p>
<p>We'll be requesting a size increase and reporting progress here. Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've made the decision to yank 0.2.14 from PyPI. I do not believe any other artifacts are available and verified that our self-update and standalone installer both pull 0.2.13 still.</p>
