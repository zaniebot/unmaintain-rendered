# `uv build` includes hidden files in the package

---

_Issue opened by @skorokithakis on 2025-04-18 14:50_

### Summary

I ran `uv build` to build a package to upload to PyPI, and it unkowingly added my (`.gitignore`d) `.envrc` in the package and leaked a bunch of API keys :(

This is a pretty big footgun, what could be a mitigation against it?

### Platform

Ubuntu Linux

### Version

0.6.12

### Python version

_No response_

What build backend are you using? uv doesn't manage the files that are included in your distributions unless you're using the `uv_build` build system.

Oh hm, I'm using hatching. It was done by default by a tool that migrated my project from poetry, I'll look into hatching, thank you.

For posterity, turns out `hatch` ignoring the global gitignore was the problem: https://github.com/pypa/hatch/issues/1958
