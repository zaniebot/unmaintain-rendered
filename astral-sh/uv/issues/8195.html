Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>What's the difference between <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces">workspaces</a> and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/#editable-dependencies">editable-dependencies</a>? It seems that they all can make we add dir <code>packages/bird-feeder</code> as package <code>bird-feeder</code>.</p>
<p>Should all workspaces be editable-dependencies?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Editables are an older, standardized mechanism. They are a special mode to use with path dependencies. You could use them in <code>requirements.txt</code> to emulate workspaces, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>-e .
-e packages/bird-feeder
</code></pre>
<p>Editables don't say anything about the relationship these packages have to each other, they just a path dependency that says that a certain package should be built and installed in editable mode instead of in regular mode.</p>
<p>Workspaces are a uv feature that allows managing multiple packages in a single repository together. It does more than editables (or path dependencies in general), such as sharing a lockfile and sources. By default, all members of the workspace are installed as editables.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A workspace member is a package within a workspace. A package can be installed as editable or non-editable. By default, we install all workspace members in &quot;editable mode&quot;, but you can pass <code>--no-editable</code> to disable that.</p>
