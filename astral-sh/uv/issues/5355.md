# Improve copy of console command examples

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-23 17:42_

e.g.

```console
$ uv foo
```

cannot be copy pasted without the leading `$` in the documentation.

See https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/9204 for a bunch of discussion about this problem and potential solutions.

A possible solution is to use `bash` syntax instead and omit the `$` entirely, but this looses the context that a command is intended to be executed in a terminal :(
