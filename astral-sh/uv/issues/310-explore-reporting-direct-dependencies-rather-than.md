# Explore reporting direct dependencies rather than "root depends on"

_@zanieb_

Instead of saying "Because root depends on X, root is forbidden" (https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/issues/309#issuecomment-1792659410) we should be able to specify that X is a direct requirement.

We don't have any "root depends on" messages anymore.
