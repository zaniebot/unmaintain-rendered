            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Uv's script support is amazing for creating self-contained scripts that can be written once and then executed by anyone with uv months later, as long as the upper boundaries for dependencies were specified.</p>
<p>Being able to lock the dependencies for a script would be a huge boon in script preservation, all the same arguments that apply to <code>uv lock</code> and <code>pip-tools compile</code> apply here.</p>
<p>Preserving original requirement specifications would be beneficial, so after running <code>uv add --script example.py 'requests&lt;3' 'rich'</code> and <code>uv lock --script example.py</code> the <code>example.py</code> will contain something like (which is basically the result of extracting dependencies into requirements.txt, running uv pip compile and pasting the result back into the script):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># /// script

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PEP 723 has a sentence on this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A script runner may support injecting of dependency resolution data for an embedded lock file (this is what Go’s gorun can do).
--https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/#why-not-limit-tool-configuration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not interpret this as a recommendation, but it's definitely thought of when this was designed.</p>
<p>For me, this solution isn't as useful as I like it to be in the use case of &quot;a repository of python scripts (not packaged)&quot;. Adopting inline script metadata is still very difficult as not many of my of my users use <code>uv</code> or a 723-compatible runner. External lock files would support a wider compatibility. <code>pip</code> not supporting 723 makes this problem worse.</p>

<p>It also mentions that tool blocks are allowed. If we dumped the lock file contents into some tool.uv.xxx property there, I guess the benefit would be 2-fold; it gives non-uv-users a hint that their life would be easier with UV, gives us free reign to decide the name and number of properties we need to accomplish this</p>

The default value should be the standard <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I am not sure if this command generate the <code>requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/</p>
<p>It mentions that uv allows dependencies to be locked in the <code>requirements.txt</code> format.</p>
<p>I think it is confused for the users to manually modify the locked environments if uv creates both the <code>compiled_dependencies</code> field and <code>requirements.txt</code> file. What is the uv suggested method to modify the locked environments?</p>

<p>The point is that the dependencies are defined in the script per PEP 723 — I don't think we'd support other things here.</p>

<p>I think using <code>uv pip compile</code> would be the recommendation then — not the <code>uv lock</code> format (until PEP 751 is done). I think <code>uv pip compile --script &lt;path&gt;</code> would be fine to support for that purpose.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just want to add a voice <em>against</em> having <em>another</em> file next to the script, since if you're going to do that, why not make it a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, toss in a <code>uv.lock</code> and call it a project?</p>
<p>The whole benefit of PEP 723 is keeping the script self-contained, in my opinion.  I'll voice something that happens with other tools that embed metadata is it is <em>appended</em>.  What I'm thinking about here is signing of, e.g., PowerShell scripts where the signature is attached at the end.  I don't have knowledge of how <code>uv</code> is parsing code today to get the header in the first place to know whether it would be difficult to read a footer instead for locked dependencies.</p>
<p>To get this behavior today, I've been using <code>uv export</code> and dumping that into the <code>dependencies</code> value to get consistent resolutions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm sort of all for just having a way to write this metadata at the bottom. We're sort of in a tough place w.r.t. the specification though. It says things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there are multiple comment blocks of the same TYPE defined, tools MUST produce an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tools MUST NOT read from metadata blocks with types that have not been standardized by this PEP or future ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These feel relatively prohibitive towards embedding the lockfile in the bottom, though I don't think it's a firm blocker.</p>
<p>I think there's some benefit to locking scripts in projects without embedding the metadata so we can improve resolve / execute times for scripts and have consistent dependencies — but that's sort of a separate idea.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe <code>uv lock</code> could replace the <code>dependencies</code> block with resolutions, with varying levels of specificity (e.g., whether to include hashes or not, exactly pinned versions, et al.)?  I think there's some acknowledgement that we're editing these scripts with tools and they can fold the metadata header if the script needs to be changed.  This would fit within the spec, but could lead to confusing CLI experiences for people authoring the scripts, but the users of those scripts should at least be happy (which is my goal, working as a dev within a devops team).</p>

<p>@Halkcyon You would have to make sure all scripts' dependencies are cross-compatible. That's a big sacrifice from PEP-723 &amp; uv where I can run each script in its separate virtual environment.</p>

<p>I would recommend <code>.uv.script_name.lock</code> or <code>.script_name.uv.lock</code> as a naming convention for a lockfile for <code>script_name.py</code>.</p>
<p>As a convention so you 1) per-script lock specifications and 2) don't super long lock specifications inline within a file. If you want a single file I think https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#improving-reproducibility is sufficient and the full lock files should be an advanced feature.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounded like the conversation here was leaning towards including the lockfile at the bottom, but the current implementation produces a separate lockfile (with no option to generate the lockfile inline afaict). Is the goal still to also have the option/change the behavior to inject the lockfile at the bottom of the script or is this the current implementation final?</p>
<p>My two cents is that having a single file for a script would be very advantageous, and coupling this with a <code>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script</code> <a href="https://x.com/charliermarsh/status/1884448591617384688">shebang</a> would allow for fully executable, reproduceable, and portable Python scripts that only need <code>uv</code> to be installed.</p>
