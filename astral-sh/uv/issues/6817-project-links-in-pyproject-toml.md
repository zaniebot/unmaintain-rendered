# Project links in pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @fschulze on 2024-08-29 15:04_

The "Documentation" link in pyproject.toml currently points to the repository. It should be https://docs.astral.sh/uv

A link to the https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md would also be nice to have there.
