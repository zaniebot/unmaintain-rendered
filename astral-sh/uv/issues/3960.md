# Implement `uv remove`

As part of the Project API, we should have native `add` and `remove` commands.

Excuse my ignorance, but does this mean that uv agreed on a "native" API design? Is there a place where one can read about this?

Most of our design discussions about this are internal right now, but we're publicizing some of them (e.g. #3560) and all of the work is public and [labeled as preview](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Apreview) (e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3705, https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3263).
