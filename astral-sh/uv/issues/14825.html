            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be fairly invasive. @konstin has a slight preference for gating in a fork. We don't really want users to be building atop variant support pre-PEP anyway, I think, so it doesn't seem like a big loss.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just ignoring variants without preview is easy, I'm more worried about how many crates and types it touches (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12203/files - we can't isolate those out into a module) and how we'd review and test that, and also that there may be major changes in the PEP process.</p>
