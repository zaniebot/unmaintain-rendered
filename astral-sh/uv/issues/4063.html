            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My use case is <em>in general</em> I do not want to use sdists, but there are a small number of exceptions to this rule, either because sdists are required, or because I am referencing local sources.</p>
<p>So I either want to be able to say &quot;only use an sdist if no wheel is available at all&quot;, or I want to say &quot;only use an sdist for this list of explicit packages&quot;.</p>
<p>Pip allows both of these behaviors, the first can be achieved with <code>--prefer-binary</code> which has been discussed here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1794, and it appears it would be difficult for uv to support given it's design choices.</p>
<p>The second can be achieved by using <code>--no-binary &lt;package&gt;</code> to override: <code>--only-binary :all:</code> (though I have not checked if this is intentional or not, for pip I generally rely on <code>--prefer-binary</code>), e.g.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install --dry-run --only-binary :all: --no-binary yt yt

<p>I swear I only glanced away from my emails for a moment between &quot;Looking into this...&quot; and &quot;I put up a draft&quot; 😆</p>

<p>I agree it's not clear that this is what the user would want 100% of the time, but I think it does makes sense that the more specific requirement would override the less specific requirement.</p>
<p>If it's not agreed that uv should allow this, I think it would make sense to throw an immediate error on specifying <code>--no-binary &lt;anything&gt;</code> with <code>--only-binary :all:</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah we should definitely improve the error instead of attempting to resolve. I'll open some issues around that.</p>
