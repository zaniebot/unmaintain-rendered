            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It might make sense to start storing this in the lockfile -- it'd be useful for showing the &quot;most recent compatible version&quot; too. But it would also make the locks much larger.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm. Yeah it seems important to be able to show this for debugging things.</p>
<p>We could at least show them for direct dependencies and read from the <code>pyproject.toml</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could show them for a subset of the tree, yeah.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it will be a non-trivial increase to the lockfile though, maybe like 1.5x the size?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How bad would it be to resolve from the lockfile and create an in-memory lock with the additional information for cases like this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'd rather just add them to the lock honestly. They're useful for debugging and they'll almost certainly be required by the PEP.</p>
