# An error occurred while installing an older version of PyTorch.

_Issue opened by @wzr0108 on 2025-04-19 09:46_

The pip installation command is as follows:
```pip install torch==1.6.0+cu101 torchvision==0.7.0+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html```
The uv command I used is as follows:
```uv add torch==1.6.0+cu101 torchvision==0.7.0+cu101 --index https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html```
However, an error occurred. The error message is as follows:
```
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of torch==1.6.0+cu101 and your project depends on torch==1.6.0+cu101, we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.
```

I used the wrong parameter. It should be `-f` instead of `--index`.
