            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-drive/#what-should-i-put-on-my-dev-drive provides guidance on what files should be put on one's Dev Drive. I'm not sure what the equivalent guidance would be for uv as there a lot of potential storage paths to set. For example, I assume the package cache would go on the Dev Drive, but should tools as well as they pull directly from the cache?</p>
