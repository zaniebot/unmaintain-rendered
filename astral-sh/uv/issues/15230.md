# Add Debian 13 "trixie" as a base image for uv mirrors

---

_Issue opened by @anyidea on 2025-08-12 03:23_

### Summary

With the upcoming release of [Debian 13 "trixie"](https://www.debian.org/News/2025/20250809), it would be beneficial for developers on this new platform to have a dedicated uv base image. Currently, they would need to use images from other distributions or build from source, which is less convenient.

### Example
