            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I really like your idea of speeding up basic tooling for Python. It would also be very cool if you made <code>uv</code> available as a Python library that i can import into my Python source code.</p>
<p>I suppose there are many uses for this feature. Personally, I am the developer of the <a href="https://github.com/pomponchik/instld"><code>instld</code></a> - a wrapper around <code>pip</code> with superpowers. I am concerned about the slow speed of <code>pip</code> as a basic toolkit, and I would consider switching to <code>uv</code> in case it becomes possible to use it in library format.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like the idea of other tools using <code>uv</code> so that they benefit from the improved foundational tooling that we've built. However, I don't see us releasing an API soon because it will take us a while to reach a state where we feel comfortable committing to a stable API. Till then, I'm afraid the only option is to use the CLI.</p>
