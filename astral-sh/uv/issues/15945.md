_Issue opened by @knowaywood on 2025-09-19 10:50_

### Question

in project, there is a uv.lock and pyproject. I don't want to download all the package in it like `uv sync`. I want to add one of it, but with the constraint of the uv.lock. like `pip install -c requirements.txt `

### Platform

Can you use [`uv export`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export) to create a `constraints.txt` and then use it as `uv pip install-c constraints.txt <package>`?

We currently don't support `uv.lock` as constraints file directly, but it is a possible feature to add.

I've created #15947 to track this feature more generally.
