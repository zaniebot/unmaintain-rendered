            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we download a bunch of wheels, then fail while unzipping them, we should be left with some subset of zipped wheels in the cache. If we then re-run the command, we <em>should</em> just unzip those zipped wheels rather than re-downloading them.</p>
<p>After #568, this will require re-adding zipped wheels under their own cache shard, then modifying our <code>InstallPlan</code> and downstream consumers to respect that there could be zipped or unzipped wheels in the cache.</p>
