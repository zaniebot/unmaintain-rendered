Not sure if this is _precisely_ related to this Issue, but I'm also not certain it should be its own.

If one invokes `uvx <name>` and it _doesn't_ exactly match **but** there is only one entrypoint in the package, just use it? For example, my tool "Cuv'ner" ships in a Python package named [cuvner](https://pypi.org/project/cuvner/) but the only entry-point is ``cuv``.

It would be nice if users could invoke this via ``uvx cuvner`` instead of having to do ``uvx --from cuvner cuv``

Might come down to what uv's philosophy on "how to map packages to entry-points" is exactly.

I worry that'd be too confusing, i.e., because the executable you'd use if you did `uv tool install cuvner` would be `cuv`.
