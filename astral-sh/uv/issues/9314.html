Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>the project was created by uv init.
suppose that my current python version is 3.12.1,how can it be upgrade to 3.12.4.I am not sure if I can make it by changing pyproject.toml or .python-version.or I just use uv to manage dependencies?</p>
<pre><code>uv --version
uv 0.4.27 (36b729e92 2024-10-25)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Even though patch versions can cause compatibility issues, you can still switch the Python version for your virtual environment. Here's how: <code>uv venv -p 3.12.4 --allow-existing</code></p>
<pre><code>      --allow-existing                       Preserve any existing files or directories at the target path
</code></pre>
<p>However, I got this method from this comment (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8217#issuecomment-2455693139), so for more detailed information, you might need to refer to it.</p>

<p>what is the best practise,if the python version is required to be updated?I only use <strong>uv pip</strong> to manage packages now.
I am using conda as virtual env manager.when I want to change the python env,just issue <strong>conda activate {env}</strong>
uv is a tools to manage python packages and python environments,which can be recorded in file and committed in vcs.
how can I migrate from conda/venv  projects to uv projects?</p>

<p>If you want specificity at the patch level, I'd say update your <code>.python-version</code> to be explicit with <code>3.12.4</code></p>

<p>@zffocussss If you only use conda for managing virtual environments and don't need to install any dependencies with conda or have a centralized need for managing virtual environments, then you can use <code>uv venv</code> to create virtual environments instead.
As for the document of <code>uv pip</code>: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/
In essence, the choice to migrate is determined by your reliance on conda-specific features that are not offered by alternative tools.</p>
