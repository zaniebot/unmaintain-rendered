# Publish `rs-async-zip`

---

_Issue opened by @baszalmstra on 2025-11-04 15:37_

The astral maintained fork of `rs-async-zip` contains a large number of great improvements. Would it be possible to publish `rs-async-zip` to crates.io? Perhaps as `astral-async-zip`, similar to `astral-tokio-tar`?

I think this is pretty reasonable to do, yeah.

We published this crate as `astral-async-zip` and opened an issue asking about upstreaming: https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip/issues/173
