            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am writing an ansible playbook to install uv and set up a venv (uv venv --seed --python 3.10) on Windows 10 and 11 computers</p>
<p>uv gets installed as Administrator (via scoop), the virtual environment gets created as Administrator too.</p>
<p>After the playbook runs, I go onto the computer as non-admin and activate the virtual environment (.\.venv\Scripts\activate).</p>
<p>Running any python command (pip, pytest, python) yields
<strong><code>No Python at '&quot;C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\uv\python\cpython-3.10.16-windows-x86_64-none\python.exe'</code></strong></p>
<p>Navigating to that directory, it is actually there.</p>
<p>Even running the full path to ..venv\Scripts\python.exe yields the same error.</p>
<p>Running uv run <stuff> does give more info:
<strong>&quot;Querying Python at <venv path> failed with exit status exit code: 103&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Logically this would be because of administrator privileges, but I haven't tried reproducing this manually to confirm that.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I thought that uv didn't make symlinks on Windows? Why does the error talk about the Administrator python.exe instead of the venv .exe?</li>
<li>What are my options for fixing this?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Windows 10, Windows 11</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.10 (f2a2d982b 2025-03-25)</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.10.16</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Additional data point, opening Admin powershell and activating the virtual environment, Python commands work as expected. I'm wondering if there's a way to install the managed python version into a place where every user can use it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like the best solution for me was to set the UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR env variable to something outside the Administrator directory. Might also need to set ACL for that new directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this seems like a weird permissions problem. We might be able to improve that error case? But I think you'll need to set up the permissions correctly on your end.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do notice that if I delete the interpreter after its working, running the python or pip command creates the same error. This goes back to the symlink question, why isn't it a new copy in the virtual environment, isn't that the point?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Virtual environments are &quot;virtual&quot;, they usually just have a launcher that forwards to the real interpreter.</p>
<p>In fact, that error message is from the CPython virtual environment launcher: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/84be5244de75c92904fb41326c9a69f19051e7ab/PC/launcher.c#L1954</p>
