# Persist credentials as common environment variables during uv add

---

_Issue opened by @HenriqueAJNB on 2025-11-06 12:02_

### Summary

`uv` does not persist any kind of security information and that's awesome. 

But, it would be even better if it could persist it as some common environment variables and not the credential itself. Or could be an option for that.

### Example

For example (PAT as Personal Access Token from GitHub):

```bash
git add git+https://<PAT>@github.com/company/private-package
````

Instead of removing completely the credentials here:
```toml
[project]
name = "test"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "private-package",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
private-package = { git = "https://github.com/company/private-package"} <<< Credentials are removed here
```

It could left them as common environment variables like this:
```toml
[project]
name = "test"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "private-package",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
private-package = { git = "https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/company/private-package"} <<< Credentials as environment variable
```

Can you share more about _why_?
