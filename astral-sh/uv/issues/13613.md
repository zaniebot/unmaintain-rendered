# Standard Way of Updating Common Packages across Specific Dependency Groups

---

_Issue opened by @andy971022 on 2025-05-23 07:02_

### Question

We manage dependency groups in `requirements.txt` by `uv add -r requirements.group_x.txt --group group_x`.

Say we have 3 groups, where group_1 and group_2 share a common package, and group 3 doesn't, so there is no reason to make that package common across all groups. What would be the best way to update the common package and have the state/dependency versions maintained in the respective `requirements.txt` files? 

Currently, I am doing `uv remove common_package` from all the group, then updating the requirements.txt,  and finally `uv add -r requirements.group_x.txt --group group_x` one by one. I wonder if there is a way to update the common package in one go?

Thanks @konstin, I can see that people are doing a similar thing from the scripts -- removing packages one by one and adding them back probably because there isn't any official documentation or built-in solution for package updates. But I can't tell if we are being hacky or that this is the standard way recommended by the official maintainers.

The plan in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6794 is to implement a subcommand that does this properly, so you don't need to manually remove and add packages anymore.

I see, thank you so much!
