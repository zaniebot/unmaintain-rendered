            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is the sibling problem to #2777: Build errors often occur when using a package on an unsupported python version. Instead of using one of the wheels that exist, uv tries to build and then spills a build error about this package, with no indication about why we tried to build in the first place (the difference to #2777 is that we have a source dist).</p>
<p>In the specific example, <code>msgpack</code> had wheels for up to python 3.12, but we're trying to build on python 3.13. The solution is to downgrade to 3.12 again. We should hint users towards selecting a different python version and/or implementation. We should disregard <code>requires-python</code> in the error message, since the default <code>requires-python</code> value may be a too high one.</p>
<p>We could also provide hints for platforms and/or architecture, though those are less actionable since the user is likely bound to a platform and architecture.</p>
<p>Example reproduction: While the hint is correct, it should hint the user at the solution (<code>uv sync -p 3.12</code>) instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a scenario I see come up in support tickets a fair amount with pip fwiw - so any improvements here would be very welcome 😄</p>
<p>Thanks to wheels working pretty well most of the time it seems understandably many users aren't aware of what wheels are and how they differ from sdists - and definitely have no idea that their last successful build N months ago with a different Python version was using a wheel rather than an sdist for a particular package... so think the build failure is what needs to be fixed (by eg trying to install system packages).</p>
<p>I see the intro at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/build_failures/ already has an explanation of what a wheel is, which helps towards the education part of this problem. However, I wonder if it would be worth adding an additional debugging step of &quot;see if you can avoid building altogether&quot; to the docs, to complement any uv error message improvement?</p>
