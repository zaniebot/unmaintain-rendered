            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I have a project with fairly large dependencies (<code>.venv</code> folder is several 10s of GB large). I accidentally ran <code>rm -r</code> on my project root, but thankfully the first directory it started cutting away at was <code>.venv</code>, so I managed to catch it in time and save my project. However, part of <code>.venv</code> is now missing. When I run <code>python</code> I get some warnings saying editable modules cannot be resolved, but other than that <code>python</code> seems fine. I tried <code>uv sync</code>, but it exits cleanly, so it seems that <code>uv</code> is not detecting the environment corruption. I also tried <code>uv sync --refresh</code>, but it also did nothing. Can this be fixed with a single call to <code>uv sync</code>, or will I have to recreate my environment from scratch?</p>
Platform
<p>Linux 5.15.0-151-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
Version

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv sync</code> will only look at the <code>.dist-info</code> directories in the environment (which is kind of like the metadata that indicates a package is installed), so if those are intact, it won&#x27;t be able to detect that a given package is missing. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t think of a great way to recover from a &quot;partial deletion&quot; here.</p>

uv sync
</code></pre>
<p>Or is there another one?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s the recommendation. We use hard links from the cache into the environment on Linux so creating the virtual environment should be very fast after deletion unless your cache is on a different file system.</p>
