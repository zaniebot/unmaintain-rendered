            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a tracking issue and design for management of &quot;tools&quot; in uv, similar to <code>pipx</code> (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1173).</p>
<p>If this design does not fulfill your use-case, let us know in a comment describing what's missing. Please don't comment asking for status updates or a timeline — we'll be working on this actively and everything will be linked to this issue.</p>
<p><em>👋 Thanks for your interest in this design! I'll be editing this post to reflect the state of discussion, it will not be a static document</em></p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3613</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tools are packages that provide executable entry points.</p>
<p>Tools may be <em>installed</em>, allowing their executable to be used without activation of an environment, e.g. <code>uv tool install ruff</code> then <code>ruff</code> is available. Installation of a tool allows a developer to use the tool across all of their projects. Each tool is installed into an isolated Python environment that is abstracted from the user.</p>
<p>Tools may be <em>added</em> to a project, allowing their executable to be used via <code>uv run</code>, <code>uv tool run</code>, and detected by other tools such as IDEs. Adding a tool to a project allows developers to use a shared environment while working on a specific project. Adding a tool to a project differs from adding a <em>development dependency</em> in that the tool environment is isolated from the project’s environment by default. Tools in a project cannot depend on each other.</p>
<p>The environment used to provide the tool is intended to be abstracted from the user. However, in some cases the user may need to install multiple packages to provide the tool they need e.g. a main package and a plugin. This must be done at declaration or install time, editing tool environments is not supported.</p>
<p>The following commands would be provided</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv tool run</code>: Run a tool without installation</li>
<li><code>uv tool install</code>: Install a tool, allowing usage in a terminal</li>
<li><code>uv tool uninstall</code>: Remove an installed tool</li>
<li><code>uv tool add</code>: Add a tool to the current project</li>
<li><code>uv tool remove</code>: Remove a tool from the current project</li>
<li><code>uv tool upgrade</code>: Upgrade tools (either all or the specified tool)</li>
<li><code>uv tool list</code>: List available tools</li>
<li><code>uv tool show</code>: Show details about a tool</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running tools</h2>
<p>Tools can be run with <code>uv tool run</code>. This command will choose the appropriate version of the tool to run based on the working directory. For example, if in a project that contains configuration for the tool, the project's version of the tool will be used. Otherwise, the tool installed at the user level will be used. If the tool is not in the project or installed, the latest cached version of the tool will be used. If the tool is not cached, the latest version will be added to the cache. The <code>--isolated</code> flag can be used to opt-in to using the latest cached version instead of project or installed versions. The <code>--latest</code> flag can be used to force a check for a newer version (this differs from <code>--no-cache</code> in that the cache can still be used for the tool if it is the latest version and for the tool's dependencies). The user can opt-in to a specific version of the tool with <code>&lt;name&gt;@&lt;version&gt;</code> syntax, this will bypass different project or installed versions.</p>
<p>A <code>uvx</code> alias will be provided to run tools. Notably, this would be an alias for <code>uv tool run</code> not <code>uv tool</code> — this could be a point of confusion for users transition from <code>pipx</code> but avoids the need to type <code>uvx run</code>. If we're providing an alias, it should be for the most-used command not for the broader <code>uv tool</code> interface. This matches tools in other ecosystems, like <code>npx</code>.</p>
<p>Additional dependencies may be requested when running a tool, e.g. with a <code>--with &lt;spec&gt;</code> option. These will be installed in the tool's environment. If an installed tool's environment does not contain the request, a new, ephemeral environment will be created to fulfill the invocation — the installed tool's environment will not be modified. By default, the entry points provided by additional dependencies are not available. A flag may be provided to opt-in to this, e.g. <code>pipx</code> provides a <code>--include-deps</code> option.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>uv run</code>, the command name and requirement name are assumed to match e.g. <code>uvx black</code> will run <code>black</code> with an implicit requirement on the package <code>black</code>. Users may opt-out of this implicit requirement by providing a different package name e.g. with <code>uvx --package foo -- bar</code>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code># Run a tool command in an isolated environment
uvx ruff check
uv tool run ruff check

# Avoid ambiguity with flags
uv tool run -- ruff --help

# Request a specific version
uvx -v 0.2.0 ruff check
uvx ruff@0.2.0 check

# Request an additional dependency
uvx --with ruff-plugin -- ruff check

# Run a command provided by a package with a different name
uvx --package foo -- bar

# Force the latest version to be used instead of an older installed or cached version
uvx --latest ruff

# Ignore project and installed tools
uvx --isolated ruff
</code></pre>
<h2>Installing tools</h2>
<p>Tools can be installed with <code>uv tool install</code>. Tools can be installed into a user or system namespace, though the system namespace is more difficult to manage and should be considered a secondary objective during implementation. An installed tool is available on the <code>PATH</code> and usable from a terminal without activation of an environment. All entry points provided by the tool package are included by default. The user may opt to include a subset of entry points. If the entry points conflict with other managed tools at the same scope, installation should fail. If the entry points conflict with other executable names, a warning should be displayed during installation.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>uv tool run</code>, additional dependencies may be requested and the package may be manually specified.</p>
<p>The requirement name is used as a &quot;key&quot; for identifying the tool in subsequent interactions e.g. uninstall and upgrade. This behavior may be confusing, if a user requests an operation on a command name that belongs to a requirement. In this case, a hint should be provided explaining the relationship.</p>
<p>When installing a tool, uv will create an entry in its configuration directory to track tool state. This entry is considered the source of truth for the tool's environment.</p>
<p>When installing a tool, a Python environment must be created for its package and dependencies. This environment should be entirely abstracted from the user. The environment should be created in a uv application data directory (platform dependent path).</p>
<p>When installing a tool, its entry points must be linked to executables in a directory on the user's <code>PATH</code>.  Multiple candidate directories may be considered with a preference for a directory present in the <code>PATH</code>. If none of the candidates are present in the <code>PATH</code>, the XDG standard directory should be used and a warning should be provided to the user prompting them to add it to the <code>PATH</code>. The user may provide an alternative installation path e.g. <code>--root &lt;path&gt;</code> (as in <code>cargo</code>). This may be preferable to a <code>--system</code> flag.</p>
<p>As described in <code>uv tool run</code>,  by default, the entry points provided by additional dependencies are not installed. A flag may be provided to opt-in to installation of all entry points in the dependency tree, e.g. <code>pipx</code> provides a <code>--include-deps</code> option.</p>
<p>Each entry point is added to the directory with its normal name, and <code>name@&lt;version&gt;</code>. This suffix allows tools with conflicting versions to be used across different scopes. The user may customize this suffix with a <code>--suffix</code> flag. If a custom suffix is provided, we will not include the plain name executable during installation.</p>
<p>When specifying suffixes, the <code>@</code> is implied and will be included if the suffix begins with an alphanumeric character — if included by the user it will be trimmed for compatibility with <code>pipx</code> (which requires it to be included explicitly by the user). Leading characters such as <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> will drop the implied <code>@</code> allowing customization of suffixes. This behavior is not considered necessary for the initial implementation of this feature.</p>
<p>uv does not allow installation of multiple tools in the same scope with the same key. If installation of multiple versions of a tool is desired, a suffix must be used. If the user attempts to install another version of an already-installed tool, the existing tool will be replaced. If the existing tool installation contains dependency requests that are not requested in the invocation that would replace it, an error should be raised instead.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code># Install a tool into the user bin
uv tool install ruff

# Run an installed tool
ruff check

# Install a tool at a specific verison
uv tool install ruff==0.2.0
# Maybe: Allow pins with the same syntax as you would run with
uv tool install ruff@0.2.0

# Install a tool into the system bin
uv tool install --system ruff

# By default, we use the latest installed and compatible Python version for the tool.
# Install a tool with a custom Python version
uv tool install --python 3.8 ruff

# Install a tool with a subset of binaries
uv tool install --system foobar --bin foo  
</code></pre>
<h2>Tools in a project</h2>
<p>Tools can be added to a project with <code>uv tool add</code>. This is loosely an alternative to dependency groups — many uses of development dependency groups are for managing project-level tools. We may need to adjust this design depending on the status of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/">PEP 735</a>. This is likely the last part of the design we would implement, as it is the highest risk.</p>
<p>This operation requires a <code>pyproject.toml</code> to be available.</p>
<p>A user may opt-in to having their project’s dependencies available in the tool environment. However, tools may never share environments with each other.</p>
<p>Adding a tool to a project should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an environment at <code>.uv/tools/&lt;key&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Add an entry to the <code>[tool.uv.tools]</code> namespace in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</li>
<li>Link the entry points for the tool to the project's default virtual environment's <code>bin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Running <code>uv sync</code> should ensure that all project-level tools are available.</p>
<p>Project-level tools are <em>not</em> added to the <code>PATH</code> automatically. Tool executables must be invoked with <code>uv tool run</code>, <code>uv run</code>, or in an activated environment. <code>uv run</code> should detect and respect tool executables in the project. However, entry points provided by packages in <code>uv run</code> should take precedence over tools. Placing tools into the virtual environment's bin should allow other tools like IDEs to discover the entry points.</p>
<p>As described in <code>uv tool install</code>, suffixes must be provided for tools if multiple versions are needed in the project.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code># Add a tool to the project
uv tool add ruff

# Add a tool with a specific version to the project
uv tool add ruff==0.3.0

# Add a tool with an extra dependency
uv tool add --with ruff-plugin ruff==0.3.0

# Add a tool to the project that requires the project dependencies at runtime
uv tool add pytest --with-project
</code></pre>
<h2>Upgrading tools</h2>
<p>Tools can be upgraded to newer version with <code>uv tool upgrade</code>.</p>
<p>The scope will be determined by the working directory. If in a project, this will upgrade the tools in the project. Otherwise, this will upgrade installed tools. The user may explicitly select a scope with a <code>--project</code> flag (which will fail if not in a project) or a <code>--user</code> flag. The <code>--system</code> flag is <em>required</em> to upgrade system tools.</p>
<p>If no tool name is provided, the user will be prompted to confirm an upgrade of all tools. If one or more tool names are provided, we will upgrade the given subset. If any of the given names are not found, we should throw an error.</p>
<p>The uv tool entry will be consulted to determine the requirement specification originally used for a tool. By default, will only be upgraded within the specification e.g. if the tool is pinned to a version, it will not be upgraded or if the tool has an upper bound it will not exceed it during upgrades. A flag may be provided to bump pinned packages, but the design of this behavior and its interaction with package specifications with upper bounds is outside the scope of this design and consequently deferred. In the interim, it may be useful to provide a command to view outdated tools or tools that would be upgraded if the restrictions were loosened.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<pre><code># Upgrade a tool
uv tool upgrade black

# Upgrade a tool in the user scope (while in a project)
uv tool upgrade black --user

# Upgrade all tools in the project or user scope
uv tool upgrade

# Upgrade all tools in the system scope
uv tool upgrade --system

<li>I'm not too clear on the distinction between the <code>add</code>/<code>remove</code> and <code>install</code>/<code>uninstall</code> commands.

<li>I don't have an answer for your question 7 (deps for an installed tool), but I think an important use case is a type checker like mypy, which will depend on having the project's dependencies installed for type checking.</li>

<li><p>You mention system-level installs (as opposed to pipx-style user-level installs) in a few places. It would be good to specify those a bit more. Like how do we determine the system bin across platforms?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project-level installs that aren't development dependencies (hence separate from the project environment) are a great idea! It solves a real pain point in current packaging, namely dependency conflicts between the project and supporting tools (like those we saw when Flake8 capped importlib-metadata). I'm confused about the <code>--with-project</code> flag though. How does a project-level install with project dependencies differ from a development dependency?</p>

<li><p><code>What's the recommended workflow for adding dependencies to an already-added or installed tool?</code> Adding plugins to an existing tool over time is an important use case.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks great! Two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>As a user, why might I prefer to use <code>uv tool add</code> rather than adding the tool to the project's dev dependencies?</p>
</li>
<li><p>My workflow combines <code>pipx</code> with <code>pyenv</code> for managing available Python versions. If I'm installing a tool that needs a particular Python version, so far I've been doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pyenv install 3.11
pyenv global 3.11
pipx install my-tool
pyenv global 3.12  # reset global version
</code></pre>
<p>Notably, this means that running <code>python3.11</code> now emits an error:</p>
<pre><code>pyenv: python3.11: command not found

The `python3.11' command exists in these Python versions:
  3.11.6
  3.11.7
  3.11.7/envs/some-venv

Note: See 'pyenv help global' for tips on allowing both
      python2 and python3 to be found.
</code></pre>
<p>Yet the shim installed for <code>my-tool</code> continues to work since, in the tool's venv, <code>python</code> is symlinked to <code>/home/wlritchi/.pyenv/versions/3.11.7/bin/python3.11</code>. Will <code>uv tool install --python 3.11 my-tool</code> also pin the Python installation allowing a similar use case, or otherwise provide a way to use Python versions that aren't on the PATH?</p>

<p>For consistency, I suggest using <code>uv pip</code> interface which doesn't have <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> and <code>upgrade</code>. we could have a flag for them in install/uninstall instead of having them as separated subcommands.
(Or do you have plan to update <code>uv pip</code> interface to include <code>add</code>, <code>remove</code> and <code>upgrade</code>?)</p>

<p>The idea is that <code>uv tool add</code> adds a tool to your project in the same way that <code>uv add</code> will add a dependency to your project. I think once we introduce <code>uv add</code> this will be a bit more intuitive. However, I agree that it's still not quite clear what is a &quot;global&quot; operation and what is a &quot;project&quot; operation. The design suggests <code>--project</code>, <code>--user</code>, and <code>--system</code> flags to adjust the scope of operations. It's possible that separate top-level commands would make sense, but I think I prefer <code>uv tool add</code> and <code>uv add</code> to e.g. <code>uv project add-tool</code> and <code>uv project add-dep</code> or <code>uv project add --tool ...</code> and <code>uv project add --dep ...</code>. I think we're already making some progress by omitting a top-level <code>uv install</code> command, which is quite ambiguous but exists in other tools, e.g., <code>cargo</code> and <code>poetry</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree that system level installations would need to be specified more, basically figuring out where to put things. I don't think this is particularly clear yet. On each platform, we need a list of candidate directories, filtered by locations it would not be surprising if we wrote to, that we have write access to, and are on the current <code>PATH</code>. This is work that I'm attempting to push into the future. It's not quite critical and I'd rather focus on getting the rest of the implementation out there. Hopefully providing an escape hatch like <code>--root</code> or <code>--install-directory</code> allowing installation to arbitrary locations would buy us time here.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a great question and highlights how intertwined tool management and development dependencies are. The <code>--with-project</code> flag is intended to allow you to use tools that require your project's dependency tree in an isolated environment. In contrast, development dependencies are synced to the default project environment when you are working on the project. Development dependencies are available as <em>importable libraries</em> in your code, whereas tools are intended to operate <em>on</em> your code via an executable entry point. For example, <code>mypy</code> would be a tool you'd install with <code>--with-project</code> but a library you only import in tests would be a development dependency. A package like <code>pytest</code> lives in a bit of a gray area, but would probably need to be a development dependency, e.g. so you get proper type hints in your IDE.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This will definitely be supported by extending the entry for the tool in a <code>pyproject.toml</code>. For tools outside of projects, I'm hesitant. I do see it being a pain to re-specify all of the requirements and perform a new installation to add a single dependency. You could edit the <code>~/.uv/tools</code> entry but maybe that's not friendly enough. Perhaps not having an <code>inject</code> command would encourage declarative definitions of tool environments (which is generally a goal of environment management in uv). My qualm with <code>inject</code> might be rooted in its exposure of the virtual environment to the user. I think I'll need to consider this a bit further. If we add a command for this, it should work for both project and global tools.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to expand a bit on the difference here, we do not want to change the <code>PATH</code> based on the current working directory and we don't want to place shims on the  <code>PATH</code> for project-level installations. This makes project-level tools different from user-level installs — they are not on the <code>PATH</code> by default. In order to run a project-level tool, we suggest using <code>uvx</code> or <code>uv run</code>. However, this means that project-level tools are not discoverable by things like IDEs. In order to make them discoverable, we'll insert them into the virtual environment's bin directory.</p>
<p>Presumably, as you mention, a shebang can point to the proper tool environment. I guess that's how globally installed executables will be implemented as well :) I hadn't thought much about how we want entry points to work yet, but yeah of course it's fine running an executable that needs a virtual environment that differs from the current one. I'll update the document accordingly. Thanks!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A very simple example is that the tool's dependencies conflicts with your project's dependencies. We might also not support multiple development dependency groups as in, e.g., <code>cargo</code> vs <code>poetry</code>. If so, then this would be a way to define a separate environment for a &quot;development dependency&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are a couple parts to this, but the short answer is: yes, we hope to solve this. I think there's a bit of lurking complexity in when symbolic links are resolved and pyenv shims — I'm not sure I can guarantee that we will resolve that specific issue, there are similar issues already, i.e., #1795. However, we do intend to perform toolchain management (i.e. install and manage Python for you) and we've invested a lot of time into proper discovery of existing Python interpreters. For both of those cases, we'll need to handle upgrades and switched Python versions. Ideally you'll be able to request a Python version for you tool and it'll just work.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you highlighted this use-case though, we'll definitely need to be careful about interpreter resolution for tool environments.</p>

<p>We won't be using <code>uv pip</code> for new workflows, it is intended as a plumbing and compatibility layer. All of our new commands will be outside of the <code>uv pip</code> namespace.</p>

<p>Yeah I don't specify this command because I'm unsure if it's going to be necessary but we definitely care about this use case. For example, depending on how we implement entry points, we could just discover the latest interpreter automatically. We might also include a <code>uv tool reinstall</code> command though, it seems generally useful for recovering from problems. Maybe this would be better spelled as <code>uv tool sync [&lt;name&gt;]</code> which would ensure all (or the requested) tool environments match the initial request 🤔</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For <code>uv tool run</code>, would it respect pipx's entrypoint for tools that don't match? (https://github.com/pypa/build/blob/d852035e338bca6a06597cc0501f319d3bf03df4/pyproject.toml#L83-L84) Or would every tool have to add a new entrypoint for uv?</p>
<p>Also, pipx assumes if there's a single console entry point, that that' what <code>pipx run</code> should run, so build would actually work without that now, though IIRC it does print a notice that it's doing that.</p>
<p>Also, <code>pipx reinstall</code> is the only way to update all dependencies. For example, if you've installed <code>twine</code> in the past and now want METADATA 2.3 support, you have to <code>pipx reinstall</code> it since it's actually a dependency that is needed to get that, and pipx only upgrades the main package and anything that it has to. (Also I use reinstall-all after homebrew updates my Python)</p>

<p>I second @JelleZijlstra's concerns regarding the <code>add</code> and <code>install</code>, as I see it as a main point of confusion for users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is that uv tool add adds a tool to your project in the same way that uv add will add a dependency to your project. I think once we introduce uv add this will be a bit more intuitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see your point here, and if this was already implemented I would agree.
While it's not implemented, then the same case stands for both projects, where having <code>add</code> and <code>install</code> can cause a point of confusion, and could be solved via something like <code>uv dep add</code> or (while it wasn't clear to me what exactly a &quot;project&quot; means here) something like <code>uv tool project install</code>.</p>
<p>I may be missing something though, what are your thoughts?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When the cache entry is missing. Perhaps we'd allow a user to specify that they want to check for the latest version on <em>every</em> invocation but that seems like a rare use-case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why can't uvx auto update the PATH for the user?</p>

<p>We cannot mutate the environment of a running shell. We can request that the user add it to their shell startup script though.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Unclear. It'd probably make sense unless the user requested a specific version of Python.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I fully understand this. Could you provide an example please?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is actually an open question anymore. If you do <code>uvx ruff check</code> we will see the command <code>ruff</code> and install the package <code>ruff.</code> If you do <code>uvx --from ruff-fork ruff check</code> we'll install <code>ruff-check</code> and invoke <code>ruff</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I understand correctly, could uv tool add default to adding all projects requested from a particular file, similar to requirements.txt?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I follow. The idea with <code>uv tool add</code> is that you would be adding a tool <em>to</em> your <code>pyproject.toml</code>. When running that tool, your project's dependencies would not be available (its environment is isolated). The question is if we should allow the project's dependencies to be included and what the mechanism is e.g. <code>--include-project</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Should we allow alternative suffixes to @?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To what benefit?</p>

<p><code>pipx</code> feature parity or perhaps you want to do something like <code>foo@stable</code> and <code>foo@beta</code>.</p>

<p>This seems weird. I think I'd upgrade all of the packages in the environment</p>

<p>would it respect pipx's entrypoint for tools that don't match? (https://github.com/pypa/build/blob/d852035e338bca6a06597cc0501f319d3bf03df4/pyproject.toml#L83-L84) Or would every tool have to add a new entrypoint for uv?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oof I did not realize <code>pipx</code>-specific entry points were a thing. I feel like we'd just use normal entry points and not have a special case entry point? I think I need to do some more reading about this to have a strong stance though. Can you share more about the use-case for that?</p>
<p>Regarding the continued concerns about confusion w.r.t. <code>uv tool add</code> vs <code>uv tool install</code>, I'll need to think more about what we can do to address this. We'll probably do &quot;project-level&quot; tools <em>after</em> the user-level installs anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb first, thanks a lot for the link to unreleased docs! that's very revealing, both of the scope and state of the project.</p>
<p>I've been slowly trying to migrate one big project of mine to UV, and we are using poetry dep-groups besides development (docs, test, build) to various things. Most prominently in CI, so we could only install, say, &quot;docs&quot; without the project deps and just run <code>mkdocs</code> or only build (in our case we compile source to C with <a href="https://github.com/Nuitka">nuitka</a>).</p>
<p>This is essentially what PEP 735 is about.</p>
<p>From what I understood:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've dropped the project tools from the scope here</li>
<li>You've closed #4331 saying that it will be tracked in #3347 which is also closed, and I do not think anything has been done in relation to that</li>
<li>In #4036 Charlie mentions that you do create groups internally, but the current implementation enforces installation of the package dependencies =&gt; there is no way to install ONLY a development group</li>
<li>I literally read all of the <a href="https://docs-next.astral.sh/uv/">upcoming docs</a> - and couldn't find this use case addressed. Only a couple of brief mentions to dev-dependencies. Given the great level of details in the docs (awesome work!) this makes me think that the use case in on the back burner</li>
</ul>
<p>Given all of that, are there any particular plans for PEP 735 functionality? Like for example &quot;we'll wait for PEP 735 to be accepted and will not tackle the case until it is pending&quot;, or maybe &quot;we may get to it sooner o despite PEP 735 status but not earlier than X months from now&quot;</p>
<p>For now, I was going to create a bunch of separate requirement files, separate locks and then automate this via some taskfile commands. I do not think that <code>uv lock</code> and <code>uv sync</code> will be a viable option in my setup, but strategic combination of <code>uv pip install -r ...</code> in various combinations will.</p>
<p>PS. If it is a matter of resources - I've been doing some Rust stuff in my spare time lately, I may be able to land a hand here at some point.</p>

<p>It'd be nice to have a POC work on dependency groups (PEP 735) in uv. by that we can realize how it will improve interface of dev-dependencies (which also includes project dependencies) and build-dependencies (which isolated from project dependencies). I think to achieve that, at first step, we'd need to improve lockfile format to support locking groups and locking inheritances in single file.</p>

<p>I am pretty hesitant to support this without a strong, motivating use-case. I don't think packages should be defining entry points for specific tools (even if other tools can read it). If there's a compelling story here, maybe there should be a PEP to canonicalize it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The tool stuff is very nice, but sort of following on from a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/832#issuecomment-2163454490">previous question</a> I had about using tools and the environments/interpreters they are run with, I am still a little unsure about a specific tool example, namely how pyinstaller ought to be run within the uv concept.</p>
<p>(It possibly generalizes to a question of how the design intends tools to be run that rely on seeing/using the venv/dependencies of a project when run to do their job.)</p>
<p>As it is a Python package used via a command-line interface, I would imagine pyinstaller is something that fits into the concept of a &quot;tool&quot;. But to work, <code>pyinstaller</code> of course needs to have all the dependencies of the Python program available in the environment it is being run in. Since <code>uvx pyinstaller main.py</code> creates a new environment isolated from the project's, this doesn't work. So what should the approach be? As far as I can tell without testing, all of the below are viable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <code>pyinstaller</code> into the environment and don't run it as a tool but rather using <code>uv run pyinstaller main.py</code>? This feels wrong to me and unfitting to the design, as I said above, it feels like it is a tool. Or would you guys disagree?</li>
<li>As above, but have <code>pyinstaller</code> be a dev dependency, would maybe be neater but has the same counterargument.</li>
<li><code>uvx --with &lt;dependencies&gt; pyinstaller main.py</code>? This would be quite laborious of course for anything more than a few dependencies.</li>
<li><code>uv tool install --with &lt;dependencies&gt; pyinstaller</code>, then <code>uvx pyinstaller main.py</code>? This would mean I'd only have to pass the dependencies once, but if I was working on multiple projects that use pyinstaller, wouldn't this give me one massive isolated tool environment with all the dependencies from all the projects?</li>
<li><code>uvx --with-requirements requirements.txt main.py</code>? I would have thought most uv-managed projects wouldn't have a <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</li>
<li>Some as-yet-unimplemented <code>--with-pyproject</code> option which is similar to the above but works with <code>pyproject.toml</code>?</li>
<li>Some as-yet-unimplemented <code>--with-env</code> option that uses all the same packages as found in the project's <code>.venv</code>? I.e. it doesn't run <em>in</em> the venv per se but the temporary tool venv is set up to mirror it?</li>
<li>Some other option I haven't thought of?</li>
</ol>
<p>(Something I think would be incredibly cool is if uv offered a <code>uv bundle</code> command that essentially did what pyinstaller does and bundles together everything to afford an executable, so I opened an issue for that, but that seems a bit more high-concept than a solution to the concrete question and would not be relevant more generally.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd suggest <code>uv run --with pyinstaller -- pyinstaller main.py</code>, which is the intended pattern for running a command with your project installed and an additional dependency.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could do <code>uvx --with . pyinstaller main.py</code>. I think this is a little more nuanced, as we'd build and install your project into the environment instead of using it as-defined in the workspace — this could actually be beneficial if you're trying to make sure it distributes correctly though?</p>
<p>I think your use-case is pretty clearly addressed in the design though, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A user may opt-in to having their project’s dependencies available in the tool environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear when we'll implement project-level tools though.</p>

<p>Ah sorry, you're completely right, I moved over the project-level tools part a bit too fast. I agree that it's clear, consider my question void.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, these are nice solutions, especially the nuance of the second. The only thing I would say is that they are a little non-obvious to someone as green as me as they aren't just a direct transfer of the &quot;normal&quot; way to run pyinstaller, so I hope others find this if they ever need it. Since the more general question doesn't make sense anyway, I don't know if you can take my question and your answer out of this thread and put it in its own (closed) issue to make it more findable?</p>

<p>A uvx alias will be provided to run tools. Notably, this would be an alias for uv tool run not uv tool — this could be a point of confusion for users transition from pipx but avoids the need to type uvx run. If we're providing an alias, it should be for the most-used command not for the broader uv tool interface. This matches tools in other ecosystems, like npx.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have stats to indicate that <code>uv tool run</code> (or <code>pipx run</code>) is more used than <code>uv tool install</code> or <code>pipx install</code>? Personally, I have used <code>pipx run</code> maybe twice, but I use <code>pipx install</code> regularly. For me, I really like the <code>pipx</code> interface.</p>

<p>I have never used pipe run, but only because pipx puts tool alias into bin folder =&gt; there is no need to run <code>pipe run</code>, I just run the tool.</p>
<p>But running the tool should definitely orders of magnitude more often that installing one...</p>
<p>Based on the blog post, I figured uv is not creating a shebanged scripts to allow running tools as if they were binaries on the PATH...so it doesn't seem like a target use case as of today.</p>

<p>No, but you run things many times and you typically only install them once :) I guess if you have a strong preference for the full interface, <code>alias uvx=&quot;uv tool&quot;</code> would get you pretty close?</p>

<p>The problem is that you're not able to use that dependency as a <em>Python library</em>, just its CLI. That's why we've avoided terminology like <code>uv global add</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a separate tracker for the <code>Tools in a project</code> portion of this RFC? To be clear, the ask is different from a lot of the discussion above - it's not about having project deps in the tool env, it's about being able to define tools used by a project. In particular, the two behaviors I care about are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding a tool to a project should:
Add an entry to the [tool.uv.tools] namespace in the pyproject.toml.
Link the entry points for the tool to the project's default virtual environment's bin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running uv sync should ensure that all project-level tools are available.</p>
