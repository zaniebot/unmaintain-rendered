# Error if a package depends on itself via an optional group, but at the wrong version

E.g., if you're developing `attrs` locally, and you add `attrs==2.0.0` to an optional group, we should error. Right now, we effectively "ignore" it. (This would be an extremely weird setup in practice, but still.)
