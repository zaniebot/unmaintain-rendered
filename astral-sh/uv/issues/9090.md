# uv python install 3.12 -> but no python at command line

---

_Issue opened by @pitosalas on 2024-11-13 16:40_

I am trying to go all uv. I uninstalled python from home-brew so that all I have now is the default python that came with my Mac. It's an old one. So next I did:

$ uv python install 3.12

Which worked without error. But I want 3.12 to be the python I get at a bare shell, even without having created an environment or whatever the equivalent is with uv. I want it to work like pyenv.

Is that possible?
