            <div class="timeline-body"><p>UV Version: <code>0.2.11</code></p>
<p>Code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu # works as expected

uv pip install torch==2.3.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu # fails
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because torch==2.3.1 has no wheels are available with a matching Python implementation and you require torch==2.3.1, we can conclude
      that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>I saw #4252, #4253 which seemed very much related, but it seems to have been merged and included in the <code>0.2.11</code>. However, I am still facing the above issue, so I am guessing there is more to it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know why, but if you use <code>2.3.1+cpu</code> or don't specify a version, it should install successfully.</p>
<p>update:
This seems to be the limitation:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I guess this excerpt covers it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If only local versions exist for a package foo at a given version (e.g., 1.2.3+local exists, but 1.2.3 does not), uv pip install foo==1.2.3 will fail, while pip install foo==1.2.3 will resolve to an arbitrary local version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding <code>+cpu</code> sounds reasonable, let me proceed with that. Thank you both!</p>
