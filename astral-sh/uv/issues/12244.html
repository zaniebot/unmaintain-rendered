            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Whenever i resize my terminal window, I get spammed with the following (or similar) errors for as long as I am resizing my window.  I started getting these when a switch to using ghostty as my terminal app and am wondering if the refresh/repaint interval on the resize is just faster than expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At one level, what's going on here is that the shell completion generation code is trying to write a script but the reader is exiting/closing the pipe before it's done, which you can repro in isolation with e.g. <code>uv generate-shell-completion fish | head</code>.</p>
<p>So there's sort of two angles here. The first is, should uv exit quietly if that happens? I <em>think</em> the answer is yes. The traditional UNIX behavior is for programs to just exit quietly via the SIGPIPE signal defaulting to killing the process (just like SIGINT, SIGKILL, etc. do); indeed, <code>| head</code> basically expects that behavior. I believe that this is largely happening because Rust by default ignores SIGPIPE (rust-lang/rust#62569), and so if you actually do a write to a broken pipe, instead of the program exiting you get an error from the write syscall, which turns into this panic. (There might be something more complicated with Tokio but I think there isn't.) If uv resets SIGPIPE back to the default UNIX behavior, then it would exit quietly and you wouldn't see the error message. There is an argument that diagnostics about the fact that the completion wasn't fully written are useful &quot;explicit is better than implicit&quot;). I'm not sure if that's a real concern here.</p>
<p>The second angle is, why is this code running on resize, and why is it getting into a broken pipe situation? My initial guess is this has something to do with Ghostty's built-in fish integration. The <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#shell-autocompletion">uv setup instructions</a> encourage you to put a <code>uv generate-shell-completion fish | source</code> in ~/.config/fish/config.fish, and fish says that config.fish runs on <em>every</em> shell invocation, including non-interactive ones. Perhaps Ghostty is invoking a subshell on every resize step and terminating it before the next resize step, or something? That does seem like a lot of code to run on every single resize step, and it sort of feels at odds with the Ghostty philosphy (which uv shares) of being fast.</p>
<p>It does seem like it might be better anyway to <a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#configuration">only generate shell completion in the interactive case as the fish docs encourage</a>, e.g. something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-fish">status --is-interactive; and uv generate-shell-completion fish | source

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So i can definitely confirm that checking for interactivity first seems to solve the issue.  Maybe a minor adjustment to the docs are in order?</p>
