# Skip yanked packages

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-11-09 14:51_

We already have this metadata on `File` -- we should just skip any `File` entries that are yanked, unless the user requests that specific version or something. Apparently we have some leeway in how we treat yanked versions per https://peps.python.org/pep-0592/.
