# Support pip's --target

---

_Issue opened by @henryiii on 2024-04-01 03:53_

The recipe for making a Python zipapp is something like this:

```console
$ mkdir tmp
$ pip install --no-compile --target=tmp . dep_1 dep_2
$ cd tmpdir
$ python -m zipapp --compress --python=/usr/bin/env python3 --main=myapp.__main__:main --output=../myapp.pyz
```

However, uv is missing the `--target` option from pip. It would also be nice (for implementing this in a cross-installer way, inside something like nox) if `--no-compile` as a no-op in UV, rather than an error.

This is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1517, could you chime in there instead?

Regarding `--no-compile` we can definitely do that we have other arguments like that, that would be better tracked in a separate issue.

I thought I searched - okay, thanks, did that. Also opened #2771 for `--no-compile`.
