            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am on Linux Mint, and I would like to start using uv, but I have been taught not to trust arbitrary installer scripts like your https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh . Also, I would like to avoid <code>pip install uv</code>, since I cannot be sure this keeps my local Python environment stable.</p>
<p>So I would like to humbly ask for a Debian uv package.</p>
<p>(This might only make sense at a 1.0 release. Is there a road map for 1.0? According to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/milestone/1">this closed milestone</a>, uv is already feature complete.)</p>
<p>(Update: I have now used pipx for installing uv.)</p>

<p>Hmm, I can only use pip within a virtualenv, otherwise I get <code>error: externally-managed-environment</code> (even with <code>pip install --user uv</code>). However I have the feeling that I should be able to use uv <em>instead of</em> virtualenv (+piptools), not in <em>addition</em> to it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By default, uv doesn't install pip into the virtualenv. You can use <code>uv pip</code> or alternatively create the venv with pip by using <code>uv venv --seed</code>.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a download without running a script, you can get an archive from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest. You can also download and inspect the installer script before running it.</p>

<p>I think there's also a snap available for uv on Debian. I wouldn't recommend snap personally, but it might be what you want.</p>

<p>I recommend using pipx. It is distributed with debian (apt-get install pipx) and allows you to install arbitrary pip-delivered CLI tools. So pipx install uv will put uv in $HOME/.local/bin.</p>
<p>The benefit is that you can upgrade (pipx upgrade uv) when and how you'd like to the latest, without being constrainted by Debian's release cycle.</p>

<p>That's exactly been my setup for the past few months and it works fine, however uv aspires to cover pipx features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, <strong>pipx</strong>, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Providing Debian package right now would not benefit the users so much, since it's actively developed and releases are very frequent, but imo it should be considered after uv reaches some level of maturity (e.g. after 1.0 release).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that decision is a real pity. It is completely standard that pip install uv will complain about externally managed environments in most Linux distros. pipx is a user installation. It would be great if uv would offer at least one reasonable standardized way of installation system-wide, be that appimage, deb, or flatpak (and no, snaps don't count in that category).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI: Here is the tracking bug on the debian side of things. https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1069776</p>
<p>Sounds like as of Dec 1st, most of the rust dependencies were either not packaged or out of date. https://lists.debian.org/debian-python/2024/12/msg00000.html</p>
<p>Also, a possible issue I see with packaging uv, is that as far as I understand, the <code>uv python list</code> is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/crates/uv-python/download-metadata.json">hardcoded</a>, so a packaged/frozen version of uv will never be able to install python bugfixes or security fixes, unless someone regularly backports the python list, rebuilds, and republishes.</p>

<p>We're pretty on top of using the latest versions of packages. If things aren't packaged, it's usually because we're on the bleeding edge of what's available. Other downstream maintainers have opened issues tracking / requesting switching to a packaged distribution — feel free to do so for any blocking dependencies.</p>

<p>Also, a possible issue I see with packaging uv, is that as far as I understand, the uv python list is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/crates/uv-python/download-metadata.json">hardcoded</a>, so a packaged/frozen version of uv will never be able to install python bugfixes or security fixes, unless someone regularly backports the python list, rebuilds, and republishes.</p>

<p>This is only the case for versions managed by uv — we support using system versions. We'll explore supporting dynamic loading of new managed Python versions eventually, but it will require stricter versioning of the distributions from <code>python-build-standalone</code>, i.e., if the distributions change there an old version of uv will not know how to install it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note: My longer term plan, once I have feedback on it, would be to submit the uvrepo work as a PR to uv, so that astral can directly publish an apt repo of their artifacts alongside the direct downloads of tar files.  Assuming Astral is interested, but I can't imagine why not.  Until then my repo is building daily off the latest available uv release.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yup, that's me, updates are pushed the same day.
Added support to more architectures 3 weeks ago.
I'll also add in the near future instructions to ensure package signatures are only valid with my key pair.</p>
