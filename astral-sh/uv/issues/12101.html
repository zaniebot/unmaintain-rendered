            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Apologies for the vague bugreport now -- I intend to try on more Linux docker images tonight and see if there's more of a pattern to where this shows up.</p>
<p>On a fresh Raspbian 12 install, using the installer command at</p>
<pre><code>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
</code></pre>
<p>prints this at the end</p>
<pre><code>WARNING: The following commands are shadowed by other commands in your PATH: uv uvx
</code></pre>
<p>However, I don't think that's true -- <code>which -a uv</code> and trying to run it directly don't seem to indicate that it's currently available on $PATH (and notably, <code>~/.local/bin</code> is not on my path in that shell session yet).</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Raspbian 12</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.6.5</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.11.2</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just installed using sh script on arch linux and got the warning that uv and uvx are being shadowed.
I checked all dirs on my PATH and I don't find any other uv or uvx.
Should this be fixed or do I perhaps indeed have multiple uv and uvx binaries?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv: /usr/include/uv /home/mike/.local/bin/uv</p>
<p>Looks like the /usr/include/uv is libuv, but it's not on my PATH</p>
<p>I couldn't find any other references</p>
