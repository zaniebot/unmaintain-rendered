# `uv python upgrade --all` to update all managed Python versions

---

_Issue opened by @johnthagen on 2025-04-18 23:55_

### Summary

Similar to how `uv lock --upgrade` updates all Python _dependencies_ to their latest versions, it would be convenient if there was a single command that would update all currently installed uv-managed Python _interpreters_ to their latest patch releases.

### Example

If the user has Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 installed, rather than having to type:

```
uv python install --reinstall 3.11
uv python install --reinstall 3.12
uv python install --reinstall 3.13
```

The user could type

```
uv python upgrade --all
```

This also removes the need for the user to _remember_ which all versions are installed if they simply want to upgrade them all.

Related existing command `uv python uninstall --all`

I think `uv python install --reinstall any` might do this already, just as an fyi.

We actually want to expose a different way to do this, e.g., `uv python upgrade`.

I will also mention, in case it's useful, that as a new user it was a _bit_ strange that there was no `uv python update` command. As far as I can tell `--reinstall` is how you "update" a uv-managed Python version, but that name was hard to discover and feels like it expresses a different intent.

Perhaps a better UX could be `uv python update --all`.

@zanieb Posted at the same time 😄 . Yes, I think something like that would be great!

@zanieb I couldn't find `any` documented: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/

Is this part of the official public API or an internal implementation detail? Curious if it's something that can be relied on, or simply missing documentation? I'd be happy to contribute docs for it if it's intended to be something public/supported.

~~Well, it _does_ seem to work, so that's cool~~

Actually it doesn't _upgrade_ the versions, it only reinstalls the existing versions that are already installed.

```
$ uv python install --reinstall any
cpython-3.13.1-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 2.05 MiB/14.88 MiB
cpython-3.12.9-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 2.03 MiB/14.89 MiB
cpython-3.13.2-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 1.96 MiB/14.90 MiB
cpython-3.9.21-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 1.95 MiB/16.16 MiB
cpython-3.10.16-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 1.96 MiB/16.64 MiB
cpython-3.11.11-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 1.95 MiB/17.18 MiB  
```

 This is unlike running with a single version `uv python install 3.9 --reinstall`, which got the latest version (`3.9.22` vs. `3.9.21`):

```
$ uv python install --reinstall 3.9
cpython-3.9.22-macos-aarch64-none ------------------------------ 9.06 MiB/16.16 MiB
```

 Yeah the behavior of `uv python install <version> --reinstall` doing an upgrade instead of a reinstall is only around for backwards compatibility while we figure out the best way to expose upgrades. A little more context on that in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11072#discussion_r1934895986. Surprisingly, `uv python install --reinstall 3.9` won't actually remove 3.9.21 or upgrade your virtual environments to 3.9.22, it just adds 3.922 (and it will be used in subsequent requests). That's part of why we want to make some holistic investments into Python version upgrades.

> Is this part of the official public API or an internal implementation detail?

`any` is part of our `PythonRequest` type

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/91410acf82a958f1dbbc3c99a240e543de2d5255/crates/uv-python/src/discovery.rs#L51-L52

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/91410acf82a958f1dbbc3c99a240e543de2d5255/crates/uv-python/src/discovery.rs#L1388-L1394

it's not discussed in the documentation because it's not really an important part of the user interface (more of an internal concept), but you can rely on it — we won't break it outside of a breaking release (and I don't know why we'd ever break it). You could add documentation for it if you want, but I'm not sure what we'd say? The fact that it's useful in` uv python install --reinstall` is sort of a hack.

@zanieb Thanks for the context! I agree that leaving the status quo as-is until some kind of `python upgrade` is implemented would be best.

Hopefully this issue can help others curious about this topic as well in the meantime.

i'm finding this issue because i was searching for a way to upgrade the minor & patch versions i have installed

i recently switched from homebrew to uv to manage my installed python executables, and i am used to using `brew upgrade` to bump the minor & patch versions. i searched [the documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#installing-python-executables) and the `uv python -h` output and don't see a way to update the installed version i have
