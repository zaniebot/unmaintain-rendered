# 🍑 Dependencies in packaged project with scripts (x4 questions)

---

_Issue opened by @michellepace on 2025-09-02 15:32_

### Question

Hello there,

I am new to UV and have a few questions on dependencies. I have attempted the docs but have not understood sufficiently. My project is running fine as far as I know.

**📗 PROJECT CONTEXT**
- My project is [here](https://github.com/michellepace/youtube-to-xml) created with `uv init -package youtube-to-xml`
- It has a main dependency `yt-dlp` and 3 dev dependencies
- When I run `which python` it says `/home/mp/projects/python/youtube-to-xml/.venv/bin/python`
- I can run the main application, or a script
   - `uv run youtube-to-xml transcript.txt`, and
   - `uv run scripts/transcript-auto-fetcher.py <youtube_url>`
- the script needs `yt-dlp` but I'm busy incorporating the script into the main application and will delete it soon

**🦚 QUESTIONS**

*(in reference to my `pyproject.toml` below)*

**Q1.** Is it normal "right" that the non-dev dependency `yt-dlp` isn't in a group too?

**Q2.** I ran `uv add ut-dlp` and not `uv add --script scripts/transcript_auto_fetcher.py yt-dlp` and have nothing special at the top of [my transcript-auto-fetcher.py script](https://github.com/michellepace/youtube-to-xml/blob/main/scripts/transcript_auto_fetcher.py). Is this okay like this?

**Q3.** When I run `uv lock --upgrade` does this upgrade all my project dependencies to the latest stable availible versions inside my virtual environment? And if so, then why don't the version numbers in my `pyproject.toml` file update too (as, is the a reason)? As an example:

```bash
~/projects/python/youtube-to-xml git:(main) ✗ 
$ yt-dlp --version
2025.08.27

~/projects/python/youtube-to-xml git:(main) ✗ 
$ where yt-dlp
/home/mp/projects/python/youtube-to-xml/.venv/bin/yt-dlp

~/projects/python/youtube-to-xml git:(main) ✗ 
$ cat pyproject.toml | grep yt-dlp   
    "yt-dlp>=2025.8.11",
```

**Q4.** If I wanted to update the numbers to match what's actually in my virtual environment (e.g., "`yt-dlp>=2025.8.11`"), what's the best way to do this? ... more importantly, is this good to do?

**Q5.** Is my setting for `[project.scripts]` correct in having my main entry point in there (and not actually my scripts)?

**⭐ MY pyproject.toml FILE is [here](https://github.com/michellepace/youtube-to-xml/blob/main/pyproject.toml):**

```toml
[project]
name = "youtube-to-xml"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
authors = [
    { name = "Michelle", email = "" }
]
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    "yt-dlp>=2025.8.11",
]

[project.scripts]
youtube-to-xml = "youtube_to_xml.cli:main"

[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build>=0.8.4,<0.9.0"]
build-backend = "uv_build"

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "pre-commit>=4.2.0",
    "pytest>=8.4.1",
    "ruff>=0.12.7",
]
```

I would really be appreciative of a clear answer to each of my questions.

Thanks in advance,
Michelle

Yes.

Is this okay like this?

Yes, scripts are mainly used outside projects.

> **Q3.** When I run `uv lock --upgrade` does this upgrade all my project dependencies to the latest stable availible versions inside my virtual environment? And if so, then why don't the version numbers in my `pyproject.toml` file update too (as, is the a reason)? As an example:

Your looking for `uv sync --upgrade`.

> **Q4.** If I wanted to update the numbers to match what's actually in my virtual environment (e.g., "`yt-dlp>=2025.8.11`"), what's the best way to do this? ... more importantly, is this good to do?

There's an open feature request for automating this: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6794.

For libraries, you want wide version bounds in pyproject.toml, for applications, you can have tight version bounds because you have `uv.lock`
 
> **Q5.** Is my setting for `[project.scripts]` correct in having my main entry point in there (and not actually my scripts)?

This scripts entries look normal.
