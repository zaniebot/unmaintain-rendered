# Error adding dependency that uses setup.py & distutils when on Python 3.10

---

_Issue opened by @ntessman-capsule on 2024-10-19 21:04_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
I'm not sure if this is an issue with uv specifically or if it's some deadly combination of python versions, but I haven't found anything useful in my searches.

I have a repository pinned at 3.10.14, and I have a dependency that is using setuptools/distutils. When trying to install the dependency, Python is failing to find the distutils package. This is confusing to me for two reasons:
1. Since I'm on 3.10.14, distutils should exist in the stdlib but be deprecated.
2. Even if distutils doesn't exist, setuptools is being imported before distutils and should have patched it.

The other issues I've found are along these lines: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7183, but I'm not using Python >=3.12 so this feels like a different issue.

I'm in the process of porting the project repository from `pipenv` to `uv`. Pipenv installs the dependency without an issue, which leads me to believe it's something to do with uv. This error happens whether installing the dependency locally or from an index.

I'm using uv 0.4.24 via Homebrew on Apple Silicon.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Clone the [repro repository](https://github.com/ntessman-capsule/uv-repro)
4. Run `cd project`
5. Run `uv add ../dependency --verbose`

Command output:
```
~/work/uv-repro/project master ❯ uv add ../dependency --verbose

I can confirm this is still an issue as of `0.5.2`.

Thanks for the clear repro -- it's much appreciated. Candidly I'm not sure that this is a uv problem. I see the same behavior with pip when `--use-pep517` is enabled:

```console
❯ pip install --use-pep517 ../dependency

Weird. Thanks for confirming outside of uv, I wasn't able to (probably because I wasn't aware of the pep517 flag).

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-19 03:16_

No problem. Sorry for the hassle :(

---

_Comment by @ntessman-capsule on 2024-11-19 03:21_

I'm going to close this issue since it appears unlikely to be uv's fault. I'll update this thread if I learn anything more.
