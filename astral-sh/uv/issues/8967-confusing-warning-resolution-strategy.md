# Confusing warning - `resolution-strategy`

---

_@KasperZutterman_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

# Issue
Warning message contains `--resolution-strategy`, which is not a valid option.  
It should be `--resolution` instead ([docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#resolution-strategy)).

Warning got added here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5953

# Example 

`pyproject.toml`:
```
[project]
name = "test"
version = "0.0.1"
dependencies = [
    "urllib3",
]
```
Command: 
```
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt --resolution=lowest
```

Output:

```
⠙ Resolving dependencies... 
warning: The direct dependency `urllib3` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution-strategy lowest` to avoid using outdated versions.
Resolved 1 package in 1.30s
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt --resolution lowest
urllib3==0.3
    # via test (pyproject.toml)
```

Expected warning:
```
warning: The direct dependency `urllib3` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution lowest` to avoid using outdated versions.
```
