<p>Hi, new user here....</p>
<p>A colleague started a uv project and put it through CI/CD; then, I joined in and started to work on the project, too, and refactored a bit...but uv continues to install the one file that existed in the original location before the refactoring.</p>
<p>After a couple of tests, the concept of cache came to mind and sure enough, uv keeps cache around. Went to the docs, found <code>uv cache clean</code>, run it in my repo and now uv picks the correct file.</p>
<p>Since this cache thing is on a per-user basis; in other words, I cleaning my own cache in ~/.cache/uv has not effect in the gitlab-runner.....What&#x27;s the best practice to ensure that the CI/CD job does not get bitten by the same cache problem?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you be more specific about how you included the file, and during which change you would like to see it invalidated? uv tries invalidates the cache for a package on all significant changes, so manual intervention should not be necessary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><pre><code>#Original project structure: 
./pyproject.toml    # [project.scripts] spin = spin:main
./uv.lock
./spin.py
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#Next structure ./src style; 
#moved spin.py from top directory to ./src/spin/
./pyproject.toml    # [project.scripts] spin = spin.spin:main
./uv.lock
./src/spin/spin.py
</code></pre>
<p>When building or synching the virtual environment, uv kept bringing into the venv the <code>spin.py</code> that used to be in the top directory even though that one under <code>./src/spin</code> had aleady been modified  ( and added/committed/pushed to gitlab ).</p>
<p>Locally, it was only after a <code>uv clean cache</code>, that uv picked up <code>spin.py</code> from its new/only location.</p>
<p>For the CI/CD pipeline, I started to test for the existence of the <code>GITLAB_CI</code> variable and adding the option <code>--no-cache</code> to the uv commands so that it does everything anew.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv refreshes a package whenever <code>pyproject.toml</code> changes, so I&#x27;m surprised the file keeps reappearing. What build backend are you using? What commands are you using, and what logs do they output (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9452">astral-sh/uv#9452</a>)?</p>
