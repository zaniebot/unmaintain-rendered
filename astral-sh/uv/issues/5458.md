# Significantly reduce user-facing output in `uv run`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-25 18:25_

Right now, we show a bunch of information for both the base and the layered environment. We should slim this down substantially (at least, by default).

Also applies to `uv tool run` (i.e., `uvx`).

I swear there's an issue for this but I can't find it.

Oh sorry I didn’t even look. I’ll dedupe later when I’m back on my computer.

Maybe https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4213? Or is this more general.

Nah it is more general. Maybe it was mentioned outside of GitHub — I looked relatively hard, let's just use this one.
