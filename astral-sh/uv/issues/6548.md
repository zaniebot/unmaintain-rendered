# Clarify that `uv run python` gets you a REPL

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-23 20:58_

We could also provide another way to do this, eventually? Maybe just `python` when we have a shim. Maybe a bare `uvx`.

@zanieb 
Updated the docs and added the ```uv run python``` section in docs/scripts.

I just have a question regarding the use of single scripts projects... So for example:

In: `main.py`
```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "numpy",
#     "pandas",
# ]
# ///

import numpy
import pandas

def main():
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    print('Done!')
```


Then using uv produces no errors:

```bash
user@pop-os:~/Documents/GitHub/standalone_scripts$ uv run main.py 
Reading inline script metadata from: main.py
Done!
```

However when trying to get a REPL after an execution (maybe inspect some variables or have imports ready):

```bash
user@pop-os:~/Documents/GitHub/standalone_scripts$ uv run python -i main.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/user/Documents/GitHub/standalone_scripts/main.py", line 9, in <module>
    import numpy
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
>>> 
```

@Michallote we just don't support that yet! i.e., we don't read the metadata because you invoked `python` not the script itself. We can track that at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8064

 When I run `uv run python`, I get an interactive REPL as expected. However, changes to the source code aren’t reflected immediately — even re-importing the modules doesn’t help. I have to exit and restart the REPL to see the updates. The same issue occurs with `ipython`, even when using `%autoreload`. Is this expected behavior?

@IliasAarab could you open a new issue with a minimal reproduction?

@zanieb thanks for the response, see #12373
