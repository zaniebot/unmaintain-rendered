# VIRTUAL_ENV=/usr/local in dockerfile stopped working for uv 0.2 (error: No Python interpreters found in virtual environments)

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


this used to work:
```
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm

ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/usr/local
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv && \
    uv pip install --no-cache-dir pandas
```

but now it results in
```
error: No Python interpreters found in virtual environments
```


I was able to pin it down to recent uv 0.2 release, namely:
this works
```
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm

ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/usr/local
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir "uv<0.2" && \
    uv pip install --no-cache-dir pandas

```

but this throws the error:

```
FROM python:3.11-slim-bookworm

ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/usr/local
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir "uv>=0.2" && \
    uv pip install --no-cache-dir pandas

```


Output with verbose:


```
Step 3/3 : RUN pip install --no-cache-dir "uv>=0.2" &&     uv pip install --verbose --no-cache-dir pandas

Looks like `system interpreter not allowed` is the root cause in v0.2, how to work around it in Dockerfile?

note: seems to be fixed by adding the `--system` flag in `uv pip install` instead of VIRTUAL_ENV

Hi! This is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3782 and #3765.

I think it's better to opt-in to system modification than to pretend you're in a virtual environment.
