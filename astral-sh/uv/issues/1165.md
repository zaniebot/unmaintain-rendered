# Write a "pip tools for newbies" guide

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-01-29 11:58_

We should add some explanations what a virtualenv is, why you need it (and why not to install in any of the global envs) and how to activate it (or why you sometimes don't need to), what those `.in` and `.txt` files are and how to use them, why there's no pip in our virtualenvs, etc.

See e.g. https://github.com/PyO3/maturin#python-packaging-basics
