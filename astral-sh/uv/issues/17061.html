            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After the last upgrade (0.9.16) we cannot install <code>kinto==11.2.1</code> package anymore as it says incompatible platform:</p>
<pre><code>Resolved 41 packages in 1ms
      Built kinto==11.2.1
  × Failed to download and build `kinto==11.2.1`
  ╰─▶ The built wheel `kinto-11.2.1-cp3-none-any.whl` is not compatible with the current Python 3.14 on manylinux x86_64
  help: `kinto` (v11.2.1) was included because `b` (v1) depends on `kinto`
</code></pre>
<p>It is an old package (2018), maybe that time wheel naming was different/wrong. Asking authors to rename is rather no go, would be nice either include this kind of edge cases or an option to ignore that error (make it a warning?)</p>
<p>To recreate, try <code>uv sync</code> having <code>pyproject.toml</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;b&quot;
version = &quot;1&quot;
description = &quot;b&quot;
authors = [{ name = &quot;a&quot; }]
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.14&quot;
dependencies = [ &quot;kinto==11.2.1&quot; ]
</code></pre>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.9.16</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.14.0</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the first case, <code>cp3-none-any</code> is a semantically strange tag, while technically valid there isn't a proper use case for it (it says &quot;This package needs CPython 3.x specifically, instead of just Python 3, but it doesn't use any CPython specific interface, and also works on any platform&quot;). Newer versions of kinto fix that and use the standard <code>py3-none-any</code> tag, can you fix this by upgrading to a newer kinto version?</p>
<p>For the second case, the page you linked to is for <code>psycopg2-binary</code>, but the package that's being installed is <code>psycopg2</code>. The <code>-binary</code> here isn't information for a tool, it's an actual part of the package name, so uv can't replace one with the other.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We cannot bump version, we need to stick to this particular version of kinto. :( But in the meantime I saw https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17064 PR which might be helpful in this case, right?</p>
