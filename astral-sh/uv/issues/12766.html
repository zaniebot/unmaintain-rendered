            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I just added uv to see how I like it. PyCharm is telling me that I have no json schema. But there is no discussion in the docs about a &#x27;json schema&#x27;. In fact, on more than one of the supposed result pages, the only &#x27;schema&#x27; on the page is my search query. There is some discussion about schemas, but whether that&#x27;s exactly what PyCharm is screaming about, and if so <strong>which</strong> schema is totally a blank. Since you and or PyCharm clearly think not having a &#x27;json schema&#x27; is a big deal - because otherwise why would I have the warning permanently across the bottom of my window - could you please explain what that is, and have it findable with <em>exactly that phrase</em> in you search engine, and in the docs, please?</p>
