            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems pretty serious. If v0.5.12 <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10186">broke all network requests</a> and it can no longer self update to v0.5.13 that contains a fix for that, how can all v0.5.12 users upgrade to it? ISTM v0.5.12 should be recalled as soon as possible and instructions for alternative updating route should be made highly visible.</p>
<p>Also it seems strange how testing didn't catch a breakdown of such core functionality as networking.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry -- this is a bug in <code>reqwests</code> that I fixed last night (#10187), but didn't realize that the subsequent release failed. I'll get it out now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The reason it wasn't caught in testing is that it's specific to specific registries. All the reports in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10190 are from custom registries (like CodeArtifact, Gitlab, etc.).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should be fixed in v0.5.13.</p>
<p>If you're on v0.5.12, you may need to reinstall with cURL rather than via <code>uv self update</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
</code></pre>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience! It's my mistake for going to bed without double-checking the release pipeline.</p>
