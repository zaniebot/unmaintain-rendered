            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For some use cases, it's useful to have Python package dependencies in a machine-readable form. This could work like <code>uv tree</code>, but output a format like json. Cargo has this as <code>cargo metadata</code>; it could also be another type of <code>uv export</code> format.</p>
<p>We would use this, for instance, to know which parts of a larger monorepo need to be made available for building in an external service.</p>
<p>When developing on Darwin but running in prod on Linux, this would ideally include a way to resolve &quot;as if on Linux&quot;.</p>
