# Better support for extra package indexes

---

_Issue opened by @simenhu on 2025-11-12 12:20_

### Summary

UV is a leap forward in package management in python, but the support for extra package indexes is horrendous.

The only thing holding us back in our company is to support using our privata packages hostet on gcloud in a custom package index. But getting the keyring authentication to work is black magic!

This must be improved, if not then standard pip is unfortunately our only option!

### Example

_No response_

I have this working,
but you need to have a prior installation of  keyring, 
and have in on $PATH, before running  "uv sync"

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16684

Can you share what commands and configuration you tried, and what errors you got?

It sounds like you've discovered that using Python keyring plugins is a hacky way to authenticate — we're working on transitioning away from that ecosystem because of that.

We have documentation which may be helpful at:

- https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/alternative-indexes/
- https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/authentication/http/

Does extra index work with `~/.config/uv/uv.toml `or only on  `pyproject.toml` ?

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-11-28 17:27_

Both.

Could you please add sample to support multiple indexes on ` ~/.config/uv/uv.toml` at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/configuration-files/ ?
