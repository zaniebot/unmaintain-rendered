Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>For weeks, I thought <code>uv</code> did not have documentation available apart from the README. Then I stumbled upon <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">docs.astral.sh/uv</a></p>
<p>It would be great if this link could be advertised at least in two places:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the repository &quot;About&quot; section</li>
<li>Relevant sections in the README.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good comparison is <code>ruff</code>, which has a link to its docs in the repository &quot;About&quot; section and in various places in its README.</p>
