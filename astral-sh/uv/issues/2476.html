<p>One thing that business users like is GUI desktop apps. They&#x27;re willing to pay for them, even though they&#x27;re arguably &quot;just&quot; wrappers around functionality that&#x27;s available in the CLI. See, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitKraken (for git)</li>
<li>JetBrains DataGrip (for PostgreSQL)</li>
<li>Docker Desktop (for Docker); you only have to pay if your company is big</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI in my mind the most comporable GUI tool to something as &quot;uv but with a GUI&quot; would be the Anaconda Navigator. And indeed, it does require payment for companies with more than 200 employees.</p>
<p>I have no idea what astral&#x27;s future plans are, but there&#x27;s certainly room for disruption. I used to maintain an Anaconda distrubition with ~5000 active installs across the company, I was surprised I&#x27;d often get questions from data scientists and analysists whose primary method to interact with Python environments was via the GUI, as it was not a pleasent tool to use.</p>
