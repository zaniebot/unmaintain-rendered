            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv is an excellent project, thanks for developing it!</p>
<p>From what i read in the docs, the run and sync command will always try to update the lock file. This is not really the behaviour i want, so i need to pass the flag --frozen to those commands everytime. Other people involved in the project also need to remember to add that flag as well. It would be nice to have a setting i can put in pyproject.toml to indicate i want those two commands to always have that flag. Something like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
frozen = [&quot;sync&quot;, &quot;run&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe other flags could have this too? I mainly want the frozen because it's easy to forget and i had to revert the lock files a couple times. I'm also a bit concerned with the add command that also always updates the other deps, but the flag for that one would be &quot;no-sync&quot; right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm in the same boat, but I would actually prefer if this were a config option / &quot;install without updating&quot; a separate command. I prefer not having my uv config spread between env vars and <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and would rather it just be in one place. Maybe this can be reopened? :)</p>
