            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm running into <code>error: Failed to determine installation plan Caused by: A path dependency is incompatible with the current platform</code> when trying to use uv in cibuildwheel for macOS and Windows wheels (Linux is fine).</p>
<p>Windows fails right away with <code>deflate-0.8.0-cp38-cp38-win32.whl</code>; I'd speculate it might be a 32-bit Windows issue.</p>
<p>MacOS Intel is fine for CPython 3.8-3.10 then 3.11 fails on <code>deflate-0.8.0-cp311-abi3-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code>. 3.8-3.10 were not ABI3 wheels in this case, though, so it seems to be the ABI3 wheel.</p>
<p>MacOS ARM dies sooner, on <code>deflate-0.8.0-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl</code>, which is the first tested wheel (3.8 can't be tested on ARM since we use the Intel CPython install).</p>
<p>This might be a regression, as I know the Windows one worked a week or two ago.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I might be using the wrong Python when setting up the venv, let me reopen if I pin it down to uv again.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also saw the above error in building virtual env at test phase at https://github.com/munechika-koyo/cherab_lhd/actions/runs/13680318668/job/38250721212.
Here I think the below line has somthing to do with the issue:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv /private/var/folders/t8/r_s4tkhn46g6y0d15z25l36c0000gn/T/cibw-run-zf_mu_np/cp310-macosx_x86_64/venv-test-x86_64 --python=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>@henryiii Could you please tell me how you configured <code>--python</code> argument in the setup file (e.g. pyproject.toml)?</p>
