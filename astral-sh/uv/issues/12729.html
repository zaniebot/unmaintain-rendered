            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am looking into what it would take to add support for installing Pyodide wheels to uv. Supposing that I contribute it, would uv accept support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating Pyodide virtual environments, and</li>
<li>installing Pyodide wheels?</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I added Pyodide support to <code>uv pip</code> in #12731.</p>
<p>What about installing the Pyodide runtime? I'm not sure how to handle the node dependency -- how would you feel about relying on an appropriate node version lying around on the path?</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether/how to add an integration test to CI in #12731. Presumably it would be easier if <code>uv python install</code> knew how to install Pyodide, but perhaps in the short term it would make since to make an integration test that installs <code>pyodide-build</code> and have it install the Pyodide runtime for us.</p>
<p>Windows support is also a completely open question.</p>

<p>Resurfacing my previous suggestion here that we had decided to close earlier: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/issues/119</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think we could leave out Windows support until we support it upstream in Pyodide and in pyodide-build's CI, as it would be misleading if the <code>pyodide venv</code> command works with Windows when paired with <code>uv</code> and doesn't work with other Python builds.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well my thought was that <code>pyodide venv</code> may continue not to work on windows but using <code>uv venv</code> could make pyodide venvs that work on windows. It might be easier.</p>
<p>I do think it will be hard to support without getting a windows machine. And maybe supporting WSL is enough.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I know enough to say yet. What does installing the Pyodide runtime entail? Where and how would it be exposed to the user?</p>

<p>Generally, it's fine to install it however a user would. We have integration tests that install various Python distributions already.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds good. For #12731, I will make an integration test that installs the Pyodide runtime the normal way. We can discuss whether we want <code>uv python</code> to be able to install/run Pyodide later, after #12731 is merged.</p>
