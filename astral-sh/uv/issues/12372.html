            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I was a little surprised/confused when migrating to <code>uv</code> that the default <code>uv sync</code> did not enforce that the project was synced exactly to <code>uv.lock</code> or else error if not.</p>
<p>When reading through the docs, I found some references to <code>--frozen</code></p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#installing-a-project</li>
</ul>
<p>And then other references that used CI that didn't include it:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/#syncing-and-running</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw <code>--locked</code> and it wasn't immediately obvious the distinction between it and the closely related <code>--frozen</code>. Part of this stemmed from the expectation that <code>uv sync</code> would only <em>sync</em> and not change the project environment at all.</p>
<p>I think I can see where the convenience motivation for <code>uv sync</code> working as it does could come from, but in my opinion, it would be a much safer default that <code>uv sync</code> tries to only install the environment as currently specifies, or errors if something is not correct. Whether it's a new developer, a Dockerfile, a CI configuration, I think the most desirable thing is to fail fast and give a useful error message rather than silently move on if the lock file is not up-to-date. Again, this is just for the <code>sync</code> command.</p>
<p>The alternative is that if developers want to be safe about this, they need to duplicate <code>--locked</code> everywhere in their READMEs, Dockerfiles, CI configurations etc to be sure that something unexpected doesn't silently happen when the lock file is out of date.</p>

<p>I'm happy to close this issue if that's the direction <code>uv</code> is going.</p>
