# Uvx does not support @latest when using --from

---

_Issue opened by @RomainBrault on 2024-08-29 08:13_

I was expecting the following to work but it doesnt.

```console
> uvx --from Babel pybabel@latest
The executable `pybabel@latest` was not found.
warning: An executable named `pybabel@latest` is not provided by package `babel`.
The following executables are provided by `babel`:
- pybabel
```

The other option I thought of doesn´t work either:

```console
> uvx --from Babel@latest pybabel
error: Distribution not found at: XXX
```

I din't find any helpful information in the documentation
