# wheel Build output directory is getting respected

---

_Issue opened by @bakkiaraj on 2025-01-08 13:35_

[tool.hatch.build]
directory = "buildout"

I expected the wheel files go in buildout but uv still making under dist.

Is this expected?

This option is for the hatch frontend, not for the hatchling backend. When using hatchling through a different frontend, such as `uv build` or `python -m build`, the frontend sets the output directory (and uv doesn't read configuration from other tools).

Thanks @konstin , How do i set the output directory of wheel builds in UV?

You can use `uv build --out-dir <...>`

@konstin  , Thanks again , `--out-dir= ` works well. I spent long time in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build document but this option is not (yet) documented. 

`uv build --help` also did not show this `--out-dir`  option.

What platform are you on? It does show it for me on ubuntu 24.04:
