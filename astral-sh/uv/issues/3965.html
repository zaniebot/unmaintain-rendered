            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given a <code>requirements.txt</code> file that includes a relative path to a directory containing a distribution:</p>
<pre><code>../my-package
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>uv pip compile --unstable-uv-lock-file requirements.txt</code> the generated lock has the package resolved to absolute paths like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[distribution]]
name = &quot;my-package&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
source = &quot;directory+file:///home/me/path/to/my-package&quot;

[distribution.sdist]
url = &quot;file:///home/me/path/to/my-package&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is not ideal since I want to commit the lock file to a git repo shared with other people and they won't have the same directory structure I have.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it possible to update the lock files to instead retain the relative path that was specified in the requirements.txt file?</li>
<li>Is there any other way to declare relative path dependencies that would not have this absolute path resolution?</li>
</ol>

Specifying the dependency as <code>file:../my-package</code> results in the same output.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 Yeah this will certainly change. I am going to merge into https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3506 since it's meant to cover the same problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't believe there's any way around this with the lockfile right now. (It's not really intended for public use yet.)</p>
