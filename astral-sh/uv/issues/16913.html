            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When using <code>less</code> to view help pages, uv should use the <code>LESS</code> variable to set the prompt (<code>-P</code>) in a fail-safe way (either works or is silently ignored) to tell the user they're viewing <code>uv help</code> output and the command for which they're viewing it.</p>
<p>The <code>LESS</code> variable follows an odd format and may already have things in it (user specific customization). The prompt value may need to be cleaned/escaped for this.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Previously uv would try to set the <code>less</code> prompt to: &quot;<strong>uv help</strong>: <the command you asked for help with>&quot;. However, busybox less would break when passed <code>-P</code>, breaking the paging functionality (#16015). It was also spotted that everything after and including the colon was being dropped which meant that this feature wasn't serving its intended purpose. #16908 removed <code>-P</code> to avoid triggering the busybox issue.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Running <code>uv help run</code> and scrolling down, a user would continue to see information about the current page in the prompt (bottom left corner):</p>
