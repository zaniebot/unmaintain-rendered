# Is it intentional that UV_MANAGED_PYTHON can be set only to "true" and "false"?

### Question

I have just tried to use the newly introduced `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` like this:

```
UV_MANAGED_PYTHON="1" uv python list
```

I expected this to work, because it worked for `UV_FROZEN`, `UV_OFFLINE`, etc. However:

```
error: invalid value '1' for '--managed-python'
  [possible values: true, false]
```

Sharing this in case if this is a bug :) Otherwise, it is not a big issue at all.

### Platform

`macOS`

### Version

`0.6.8`

No, this should be updated to use the boolish parser like our other flags. Thanks!
