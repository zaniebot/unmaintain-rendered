Preface
<p><em>Note: I have observed the following issue with <code>poetry</code> too. Considering I believe <code>uv</code> shares this issue with <code>poetry</code>, I am opening a ticket with <code>uv</code> too. This ticket will resemble the aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/10151">python-poetry/poetry#10151</a></em></p>
<p><code>uv</code> appears to select an <code>onnxruntime</code> version which is incompatible with my system. With a very minimal <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;bugs&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;&quot;
authors = []
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9,&lt;4.0&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;onnxruntime&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p><code>uv</code> selects the <code>1.20.1</code> <code>onnxruntime</code> package. This is, however, incompatible with my system, as evidenced by pip index and I would expect a <code>1.19.2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv run pip index versions onnxruntime
WARNING: pip index is currently an experimental command. It may be removed/changed in a future release without prior warning.
onnxruntime (1.19.2)
Available versions: 1.19.2, 1.19.0, 1.18.1, 1.18.0, 1.17.3, 1.17.1, 1.17.0, 1.16.3, 1.16.2, 1.16.1, 1.16.0, 1.15.1, 1.15.0, 1.14.1, 1.14.0, 1.13.1, 1.12.1, 1.12.0, 1.11.1, 1.11.0, 1.10.0, 1.9.0, 1.8.1, 1.8.0, 1.7.0

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can solve this with:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;bugs&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;&quot;
authors = []
requires-python = &quot;==3.9.*&quot;

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps, I&#x27;ll give it a shot when I&#x27;m at my computer. That being said, it does feel wrong that uv picked a version of the package that is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/onnxruntime/#files">incompatible</a> with the current working interpreter.</p>
<p>Also I would like to avoid pinning the python version in my project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Of course, but it&#x27;s inherently a fairly hard problem. The package doesn&#x27;t publish source distributions and has limited platform support. It&#x27;s <em>impossible</em> to come up with a resolution that covers all possible platforms. This is a more narrow case, but that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t working here. We see a version that has support for at least one of the platforms you care about (i.e., platform support for Python 3.10 onward), and we choose that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(I agree the experience here should be better; just trying to explain what&#x27;s going on and why it&#x27;s difficult. We also don&#x27;t privilege the currently-running interpreter at all, which I think is correct -- we&#x27;re solving generically, ignoring your platform, Python version, etc., but also contributes here.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I kind of expected this to work:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;bugs&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;&quot;
authors = []
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9,&lt;4.0&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;onnxruntime&quot;,
]

[tool.uv]
environments = [
    &quot;python_version == &#x27;3.9&#x27;&quot;,
    &quot;python_version &gt; &#x27;3.9&#x27;&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a nicer solution in that you don&#x27;t have to change your supported Python range. But it&#x27;s not working as expected, so looking into that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay so I don&#x27;t think this is a uv issue. after discussing with the maintainers of poetry, I&#x27;ve learned that poetry relies on the python-requires value in onnxruntime&#x27;s project declaration rather than which packages are actually available for my python distribution.</p>
<p>uv likely does the same and that seems like a natural and good behavior.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m closing this ticket consequently. Please refer to the poetry ticket for the exact discussion.</p>
