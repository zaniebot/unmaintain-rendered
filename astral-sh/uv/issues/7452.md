<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


```uv venv --python 3.11.9```

when I use this on windows it works fine

but when I use it on linux ubuntu it shows 
 × No interpreter found for Python 3.11.9 
 
 
 In both linux and windows I'm using python 3.12.3

Can you confirm the output of `uv --version` on both machines?

In a clean Docker container on the latest version, we download Python 3.11.9 and create an environment

```
❯ docker run -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.4.10-bookworm-slim uv venv --python 3.11.9
