            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am a big fan of <code>--exclude-newer</code>. In many situations, it can give you 90% of the reproducibility you want for 10% of the UX overhead.</p>
<p>It occurs to me it could be neat to integrate this when building sdists. When creating the build environment to build an sdist from PyPI, we could install build dependencies with <code>--exclude-newer</code> equal to the release date of the sdist.</p>
<p>One wrinkle we might want is <code>exclude_newer = max(release_date_of_sdist, release_date_of_target_python_version)</code>. This will also increase your odds of support on new Python versions and Python upgrades are a natural time to lose environment reproducibility.</p>
<p>I think the 100% solution for reproducible build environments is really tricky and has a lot of UX overhead. But this could be a promising 90% solution</p>

<p>We're pretty likely to ship locking of build dependencies in the near future though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah it's pretty clever. Maybe as a setting? It shouldn't be too hard to implement, honestly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was picturing it as a hammer to make a (usable) lockfile possible to construct at all, in cases where the resolver can't figure out what to do. Possibly I'm overestimating the places you need that though.</p>
