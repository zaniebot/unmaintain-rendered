            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi, starting this as a question as I'm unclear if this is an actual issue, or a potential problem with my specific setup. I looked for similar issues and didn't find any.</p>
<p>That said, after installing uv via mise, I followed the documentation https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#shell-autocompletion to add zsh completions for uv and uvx. Unfortunately generate-shell-completion doesn't seem to be working for uvx.</p>
<p>Running this:
<code>eval &quot;$(uvx generate-shell-completion zsh)&quot;</code>
Gives this output:
<code>× No solution found when resolving tool dependencies:</code>
<code>╰─▶ Because generate-shell-completion was not found in the package registry and you require generate-shell-completion, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.</code></p>
<p>Was 'generate-shell-completion' removed for uvx and the documentation wasn't updated?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>macOS 14.6.1 ARM, Linux 6.1.0-31-amd64 Debian 6.1.128-1 (2025-02-07), Linux Debian 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.6</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did the same thing and ended up here after 30 mins. Perhaps more will fall into the same trap? It's a bit confusing with different syntax for uv and uvx shell completion.</p>
