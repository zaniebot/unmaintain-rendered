            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If I use a dependency group in the build system's requirements list, uv can't seem to find it. For example, for this sample project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;test&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;
dependencies = [
	&quot;group&quot;,
]

[build-system]
requires = [
	&quot;setuptools&quot;,
	&quot;group&quot;,
]

[dependency-groups]
group = [
	&quot;sampleproject&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following:</p>
