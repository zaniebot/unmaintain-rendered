I think this issue is a duplicate of issue https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3588. 
However, issue https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3588 has been around for quite some time, so I personally suggest letting the UV team decide whether to close this issue.

Thanks @FishAlchemist 

Let's track in #3588

@karthiknadig please don't use screenshots in issues, they're bad for discoverability. See #9452
