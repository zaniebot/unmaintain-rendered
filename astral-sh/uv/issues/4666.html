            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it makes sense to add <strong>some</strong> indication in the tree output when there are some transitive dependencies in the package and we do not show them. Nut it makes no sense to do when there are no hidden transitive dependencies.</p>
<p>If you do it this way (for example by adding <code>(*)</code> or <code>...</code> (which would by more pythonic IMHO), then suddenly there will be a lot less of those in the output - and only where it would actually indicate that the tree node is not complete.</p>
<p>Example (from Airflow):</p>
<p>It makes sense that requests down there has some indication that it's not a complete set of dependencies - and that you should look it up above to find out what those transitive dependencies are.</p>

<p>But here it makes completely no sense to add (*) for the second markupsafe occurence - because the tree is actually complete:</p>
