<p>A simple fix would be to filter out files.
It also complains if any subfolder doesn't contain a pyproject.toml. Would it be better if it would ignore them?
Being able to recursively search for pyproject.toml would also be nice.</p>

<p>You should mark any such directories as excluded via <code>workspace.exclude</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know about exclude, but I imagined it was to explicitly exclude a folder with a pyproject.toml while not erroring out of folder not containing any.</p>
<p>I can see it both ways..</p>
