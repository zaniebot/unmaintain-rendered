            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my workflow I make heavy use of env-files.</p>
<p>several tools support .env out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>docker / docker-compose</li>
<li>just  (https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_26.html?highlight=env#settings)</li>
<li>easy to support in makefiles</li>
<li>easy to support in python-apps</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be nice if uv could support .env-files in the $CWD or parent-dirs.

<p>pip supports a config-file pip.ini / pip.conf
all those values in that config-support can also be set as environment-variables</p>
<p>I have not yet seen a reference that <code>uv pip</code> supports such config-file or these envvars,
but many times I set such project-specific pip-envvars,  the same for twine.</p>
<p>some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL</li>
<li>RUFF_CACHE_DIR</li>
<li>TWINE_USERNAME</li>
<li>TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;project-dir&gt;
   .env
  .venv/
   docs/
   src/
   tests/
</code></pre>
<p>so my request is to support .env-files in $CWD,
and optionally in parent-levels (e.g in just this is configurable)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;project-dir&gt;

<p>to make ruff use the my .env to read RUFF_CACHE_DIR,
I currently have to install ruff in the .venv and use python-entrypoint to execute ruff (slowing things down)</p>
<p>I use my package  https://github.com/libranet/autoread-dotenv  to read the .env  via sitecustomize-hooks,
so the env-vars become available for any python-generated entrypoint.</p>

<p>I am launching machine learning demos for students, and I am currently using <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">Pipenv</a> which loads environment variables from a file named <code>.env</code>. That file contains variables like <code>DO_NOT_TRACK=1</code> and <code>HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1</code> which are applied for all the commands I run via <code>pipenv run</code>.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I can define them in my shell profile, but it would be great to have it natively supported by uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Supporting this in <code>uv run</code> seems like it could be really useful to me. When I'm working with Django I often have it pick up <code>os.environ[&quot;...&quot;]</code> for things like API keys needed by my application. <code>uv run ./manage.py runserver</code> to pick up those from a <code>.env</code> file could be a really nice pattern.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it would be useful to have a flag like <code>--env-file</code> or some section in the config file like PDM does.</p>
<p>But why limit it to <code>uv run</code> only? <code>uv</code> uses a set of environment variables in place of command line arguments, that way you can use different definitions for <code>uv</code> depending on your environment. I personally think it would be useful for situations like when you use a custom packages index for example.</p>

<p>Hi, I was also migrating from poetry to uv, and currently use <a href="https://taskfile.dev">taskfile</a> to handle .env variable passing to uv run</p>
<p>Example of the taskfile</p>
<pre><code>version: &quot;3&quot;
dotenv: [&quot;.env&quot;]
tasks:
  manage:
    cmds:
      - uv run ./backend/manage.py {{.CLI_ARGS}}
</code></pre>
<p>and then i can run stuff like
<code>task manage -- makemigraitons</code>
<code>task manage -- shell_plus</code>  etc</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another user-case: I supply environment variables to my dev server with a .env file. I've been using <code>poetry run bin/serve-dev</code> to start things with a dotenv loading plugin for poetry.</p>
<p><code>uv run bin/serve-dev</code> auto-loading my .env file would be nice, but to be honest <code>uv run --env-file .env bin/serve-dev</code> is fine too, if you want to limit the blast radius of this change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My use case is to use a separate project-specific Conan Local Cache when entering the respective venv. This simply means setting the <code>CONAN_USER_HOME</code> env var to the venv path with <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code>.
Currently, this is done by fumbling this into the generated activate/deactivate scripts. These scripts also vary between the Python versions so this also needs to be tested and updated for new Python versions :-(</p>

<p>It shouldn't be needed if you use <code>uv run</code>, though it's a bit more nuanced than that. Feel free to open a new issue if you run into problems there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like <a href="https://snarky.ca/use-toml-for-env-files/">Brett Cannon's</a> and <a href="https://micro.webology.dev/2024/03/13/on-environment-variables.html">Jeff Triplett's</a> takes on <code>.env</code> files, which identify the orthogonal purposes of using such files for configuration and for secrets. They also identify the issue with the lack of a standard of <code>.env</code> files, e.g. path separator variation and other nuances.</p>
<p>Brett posed the question, could we standardize on TOML for this? I think if <code>uv</code> picks this up, it could be done in stages, supporting <code>.env</code> today but with no promises on the unstandardized format, then eventually incorporating a more opinionated take inside <code>pyproject.toml</code> in a subtable of <code>tool.uv</code>.</p>
<p>Secrets management is it's own beast, of course.</p>
<p>The upside to <code>uv</code> tackling lockfiles is the standards discussion on that is already pretty mature, but there's no clear consensus on standardizing something for <code>.env</code>, so maybe that's a bridge too far.</p>

<p>The great thing about ruff is that it's essentially a drop-in replacement for pylint and other tools you were probably using before.</p>
<p>Doing the same with .env files would be a DX win.</p>
<p>Championing an emergent new format would be an interesting idea, as a separate and second step, but until it becomes comparable to .env in terms of adoption, it seems like a DX loss to deprecate .env.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I use <a href="https://direnv.net/">direnv</a> for this exact use-case. It is installed as a global binary on pretty much any OS, then activates any <code>.envrc</code> or optionally also <code>.env</code> when the folder is entered. This is a mature tool that does exactly this one job very well, with the bonus of not being restricted to only Python as it works on any folder, anywhere.</p>
<p>The big plus for me is that you need to <strong>explicitly</strong> enable the file for each folder (once off check) so it will not activate any random file you get in a cloned repo.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> doesn't need to do absolutely everything :wink:</p>

<p>I haven't tried it myself, but there is a windows download using <code>winget</code> offered, even though it does say only '*nix' compatible on their github 🤷‍♂️. Ignore me if you've tried this and it didn't work :grin:</p>
<p>EDIT: people have used it with varying degrees of success, this <a href="https://gist.github.com/rmtuckerphx/4ace28c1605300462340ffa7b7001c6d">gist</a> has a walk-through</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I had a bit of time so I booted into windows, updated powershell as it doesn't work in the default version, traced and sorted the issues it has by default and jumped through hoops (needs 3 badly documented env var set). Then came to the conclusion it is totally borked under windows. Sorry, carry on :grin:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there are two options here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Respect <code>.env</code> in <code>uv run</code> (but not elsewhere). So, <code>.env</code> would be for providing runtime environment variables, but <em>not</em> for configuring uv itself.</li>
<li>Respect <code>.env</code> everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>My inclination is to do the former (and I think we could get consensus on + ship that quickly). The downside is that you still need to provide <code>UV_</code>-prefixed environment variables (which could include credentials) through some other mechanism.</p>
<p>Maybe we start with (1) and we can always expand to (2) if it's well-motivated.</p>
<p>If we do (1), my preference would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Always</em> read <code>.env</code></li>
<li>Allow users to pass <code>--env-file</code> (or <code>UV_ENV_FILE</code>) to override the file.</li>
<li>Add <code>--no-env-file</code> and <code>UV_NO_ENV_FILE</code> to disable it.</li>
</ul>
<p>(In other words, I think it should be opt-out, not opt-in.)</p>

<p>In that scenario, if I had a development credential that was previously kept in an un-committed/.gitignored as, say, <code>GOOGLE_API_KEY=123456</code> would I need to prefix <code>GOOGLE_API_KEY</code> with <code>UV_</code> for uv to load it?

<p>I'm only referring to these. In other words, we'd pass the environment variables onwards to whatever <code>uv run</code> runs, but we wouldn't use them <em>within uv itself</em>.</p>

<p>I'd prefer the opposite, though I'm probably in the minority. I tend to exclusively use virtualenvs (and with <code>direnv</code> I don't even have to activate them), and a fair percentage of my code tends to run as services or sockets which would stil need a <code>dotenv</code>-type solution so i rarely use <code>uv run</code> even in development. I think making a new feature optional at least at first (if it's configurable by the <code>uv.toml</code> and well documented this should be usable?).
More importantly, <code>direnv</code> for example requires <strong>explicit</strong> permission (once) to load any <code>.env</code> file - i'd not like any repo i cloned to be able to set any ENV var it wants  - overwrite PYTHONHOME/PYTHONPATH or system stuff?</p>

<p>My first use-cases would be to set the env-variables equivalents of PIP_* and &quot;TWINE_&quot;

TWINE_REPOSITORY_URL='&lt;url&gt;'
TWINE_PASSWORD='&lt;password&gt;'
TWINE_USERNAME='&lt;username&gt;'

<p>Yes. opt-out via an externally managed variable makes more sense logically
(because all other vars are already managed outside .env)
than opt-in (use the .env) via a non-.dotenv managed variable.</p>

As someone who uses pipenv for day-to-day application development, I am excited for uv to gain auto-loading of <code>.env</code> files by default.

<p>'Flask run' is however less of a tool in the 'uv' mold than very specific to Flask users, not going to be used by EVERY Python project and environment you write. It's more equivalent to 'django-admin'.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One facet of it is that <code>uv run</code> is very versatile, and not just used in uv projects, but could be used in any directory, and with/without existing project or virtual environment. And you can also use <code>uv run</code> to run things in a different directory like <code>uv run --python ./path/to/venv</code> or <code>uv run --project foo</code>  which also puts some distance between the <code>.env</code> file and the installed python software. Anchoring env file support to a configuration or a uv project would be a more consistent model, possibly(?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After the migration from <code>pipenv</code> to <code>uv</code> our local Ansible environments are broken as <code>uv</code> does not read the <code>.env</code> file by default.</p>
<p>Also Docker ~and Ansible~ read <code>.env</code> by default.
<strong>Edit:</strong> My bad, Ansible is <strong>not</strong> loading the environment via <code>.env</code>, that's exactly the use case why I need <code>uv</code> to load it for Ansible on my local dev environment! 😀</p>
<p>In my case (what our company does): The <code>.env</code> files are only needed for local development where users also run <code>uv run ...</code> <strong>manually</strong>. Opt-in would be no comfort from the users perspective especially when projects will be migrated from tools like <code>pipenv</code> to <code>uv</code>. Also production systems get different environment variables that will be set for the run and will not use any <code>.env</code> file and if I would like to change that behaviour I will use the <code>UV_xx</code> environment variables.</p>
<p>So, maybe this approach will be accepted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use opt-out by default, so <code>uv</code> reads the <code>.env</code> file by default</li>
<li>Add <code>UV_xx</code> environment variables for not reading and reading <code>.env</code> files: You already planned this feature</li>
<li>Add another option for the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file so reading an <code>.env</code> file for a project can be set to opt-in instead of the default opt-out</li>

<p>My preferred choice would still be opt-in by default but I can see that's unlikely to happen 😂</p>
<p>I've never really used 'pipenv' (went pip to poetry to uv) so the whole concept of auto-loading env files is strange to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, option 3 would work but I'd really love a global setting in the configuration file too, so I can opt-out for every project and just forget about it. I've not sat down and gone through the PR in depth yet so apologies if this is already there.</p>

<p>@TheRealBecks fwiw this doesn't track with me as an argument for opt-in by default.</p>
<p>If you're already having to do various other config changes and generate new lock files (you almost certainly are) and anything else in the migration process I struggle to see how marginally tweaking the new tool's config isn't entirely <em>expected</em> anyway. Migrating between these tools isn't overly hard, but it's never as simple as literally just calling a different tool with 0 config changes either.</p>

If you have a <code>.env</code>-formatted file that you don't want auto-loaded by <code>uv</code>, then just name it something else.</p>
<p>Asking <code>uv</code> to force users to pass an &quot;opt-in&quot; flag every time (or set it via <code>uv.toml</code>) to load <code>.env</code> files is like saying <code>git</code> should require that users pass a <code>--use-ignore-file</code> (or equivalent in <code>.git/config</code>) to use <code>.gitignore</code>, or asking <code>bash</code> to require users to pass some flag to read <code>.bashrc</code>, etc.</p>
<p>I understand there are cases where opting out or explicitly passing a specific file would be needed (e.g. multiple dotenv variants (<code>.env.stage</code>, <code>.env.dev</code>, etc), dotenv files in other directories, etc) but having <code>uv</code> auto-load a plain <code>.env</code> file in the cwd is an absolutely reasonable default IMHO.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can give a practical example:</p>
<p><code>.env</code> and <code>.env.myenvironment</code> is the Python convention to store settings used by the code, and the code should decide if it gives priority to .env files or other sources. The settings must be managed by code, and the execution of the code the simplest and the same in all environments: <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<p><code>myenvironment</code> is a value obtained with an environment variable, so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dotenv = DotEnvSettingsSource(
    settings_cls,
    env_file=[&quot;.env&quot;, f&quot;.env.{os.environ[&quot;PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT&quot;]&quot;],
    env_nested_delimiter=&quot;__&quot;,
    case_sensitive=True,
)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, even if you're using <code>pydantic-settings</code> or a runner tool (<code>uv</code>), you'll need an environment variable.</p>
<p>So, we do agree, we need to provide an environment variable, but the issue is how.</p>
<p>With code is simple, but verbose (because we need this file in every project):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class ApplicationEnvironment(StrEnum):
    LOCAL = &quot;Local&quot;
    DEVELOPMENT = &quot;Development&quot;
    STAGING = &quot;Staging&quot;
    PRODUCTION = &quot;Production&quot;

    @staticmethod
    def get_current() -&gt; str:
        return os.getenv(&quot;PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT&quot;, ApplicationEnvironment.LOCAL)
</code></pre>
<p>and it'll be used this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dotenv = DotEnvSettingsSource(env_file=[&quot;.env&quot;, f&quot;.env.{ApplicationEnvironment.get_current()}&quot;],
</code></pre>
<p>This environment variable will be used for configuring the code itself, e.g. not adding telemetry if you're in localhost, adding secrets from Azure Key Vault if you're not in localhost, not showing the Swagger documentation in production, etc.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">docs_url = (
    &quot;/docs&quot;
    if ApplicationEnvironment.get_current() != ApplicationEnvironment.PRODUCTION
    else None
)
app = FastAPI(
    docs_url=docs_url,
    redoc_url=None,
)
</code></pre>
<p>So, the thing is, when we deploy an application, we provide an environment variable on the cloud or with <code>docker run</code>, and the proper <code>.env.myenvironment</code> file is read.</p>
<p>But in localhost we can't do that, so where do we specify the environment variable?</p>
<p><strong>.env files are for code configuration, so use another thing</strong>: pyproject.toml, mynewfile.json, etc.</p>
<p>In .NET we have a command for everything called <code>dotnet</code>, and it's the <code>uv</code> equivalent.</p>
<p>The launchSettings.json file is used in ASP.NET Core to configure how an application is launched during development, and you can specify environment variables and tool <code>dotnet</code> configurations.</p>
<p><strong>In summary,</strong> <code>uv</code> or your framework should provide a (configurable) default environment variable to run the project, but not from the code settings. And this environment variable will be different in each environment, not relying on different <code>uv</code> parameters to read from here of there.</p>
<p>What environment variables do you need? TBH I don't think more than the PYTHON_ENVIRONMENT variable is necessary. On the cloud, with user-assigned managed identities, you add for example the <code>AZURE_CLIENT_ID</code> environment variable, but when you run the code in localhost, you don't set it by hand, you execute <code>az login</code>.</p>

<p>Nope, it's a sign we're following best practices, and have writtten our code to already take care of this file, on our own terms.

<p>Setting in <code>uv.toml</code> would be a once-off system-wide thing.</p>
<p>Regarding the <code>pyproject.toml</code> - as already pointed out by others, there are always changes in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> needed coming from another tool to <code>uv</code> beore it works. Your argument also works the other way around - why should those who DONT want this functionality have to pass a flag or set an env each time?</p>
<p>You may never use this option in the settings or project toml but many people will, so why not have it implemented?</p>
<p>I understand the decision is already made and it's going to be opt-out regardless of this discussion, but please just at least give us a global option to set-and-forget to disable it 🤷‍♂️It's not something I'm EVER going to use as <code>uv</code> isn't used in a prod setting (for me) after the virtual env is setup.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another vote for load .env by default in build and run cases. A <code>.env</code> file is a sign a user is opting in, and being able to configure a build env with a .env file is incredibly useful for private repositories.</p>
<p>Pipenv has a nice <code>loading .env file</code> output when it runs if you have a .env file, which makes it clear what is going on. Also, uv is probably where most people are headed after escaping pipenv, so there is some reason to maintain an existing behavior. Where new uv users can just use an opt-out flag to get the behavior they want.</p>

<p>In https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8263, some commenters are making the case that this should be opt-in rather than opt-out. I want to open up the conversation for more opinions here before this ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know if it's too late now since that MR is merged. But, I'll try to outline a few arguments against making it a default:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dotenv files are often used in situations where a &quot;real&quot; configuration file (toml, json, etc etc) with an app defined schema would be more appropriate (easier to both organise, read and validate).</li>
<li>Environment variables are often given preference over configuration files. Dotenv files are usually hidden (due to the leading dot) and it is counter intuitive that a hidden file should override a visible file.</li>
<li>What <code>uv</code> makes default, a lot of people will think is good practice. It follows that if <code>uv</code> enters the space of app configuration, it should give at least some thought to what is considered best practice for app configuration. In my opinion, it does <em>not</em> involve automatic loading of hidden files into the environment.</li>
<li>Runtime &quot;environments&quot; such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Systemd services already offer ways of setting environment variables, and in my opinion their way should be preferred when running in those environments. They also all do it using non-hidden files (either explicitly configured environment files, or as part of their own service/resource configuration). In my opinion, it's fine for <code>uv</code> to similarly <em>allow</em> setup of environment variables, to enable locally running something that needs certain variables, but it should be explicit and opt-in, not opt-out.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A few points raised in this thread that I want to respond to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>variables like DO_NOT_TRACK=1 and HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 [...] As a workaround, I can define them in my shell profile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These &quot;purely preferential&quot; variables probably <em>do</em> belong in each developer's personal setup rather than having to be defined in every project he works on. So, I don't think this should be considered just a &quot;workaround&quot;. If you are making an application where some variables must always be set, you should probably make it part of the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's a non-Python example: Node JS added native support to this feature in September 2023 (<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V20.md#2023-09-04-version-2060-current-juanarbol-prepared-by-ulisesgascon">changelog</a>) and it has been supported by Bun/Deno for a while now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it seems Bun does automatically load the <code>.env</code>-file, going by their docs both Node and Deno appear to need an explicit <code>--env-file=config.env</code> argument, which is what I think should be required here as well. Besides, I would point out that most tools in other languages don't support this at all. <em>When</em> there is a blessed config provider, it is usually not environment files (instead you see e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/74046813"><code>appsettings.json</code></a> (C#), <code>application.properties</code> (Java), ususally <code>something.toml</code> (Rust)). However, although I think it is misguided to use environment files, I can certainly accept that there is already some usage of them among Python users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also feel like having simple pyproject.toml config like <code>read_dotenv_files = true</code> (or equivalent CLI option) should opt-in to that behavior being automatic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be a good way to also satisfy those who want it &quot;always on&quot;, but I think it should probably be a string option, i.e. <code>env_file = &quot;dev.env&quot;</code> (such that the option name matches the <code>--env-file</code> cli option).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'd like to know what to know what are the actual best security practices when it comes to publishing to a private index. I know we can do it with one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>use the CLI like <code>uv publish --publish-url &lt;url&gt; --username &lt;username&gt; --password &lt;password&gt;</code> or <code>uv publish --publish-url &lt;url&gt; --token &lt;token&gt;</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>But it seems like redundant / hassle, and I don't think it's the most secure way of doing (shell history, process list etc.).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>use environment variables, <code>UV_PUBLISH_URL</code>, <code>UV_PUBLISH_USERNAME</code>, <code>UV_PUBLISH_PASSWORD</code>, <code>UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not the most secure way of doing things as well and the environment variables are available globally (in the limits of the shell session).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I recognize this might be delving into the extreme side of security concerns, I’m curious about what would be considered the best practice in this context.</p>
<p>Would implementing support for a <code>.env</code> file (I think not the most secure as well when we consider the security risk for the CLI, but at least it reduces the hassle and increases the flexibility I guess) or another secure configuration method be worth exploring?</p>
<p>I guess we can always come up with a way to set up the environment variables from an <code>.env</code> file and then remove them 🤔</p>
<p>You can consider my comment useless 😅</p>

<p>Opt-in through CLI flags should be made illegal please.

<p>Since writing this I've moved to <code>.netrc</code> for the credentials and to <code>direnv</code> to load <code>.env</code> files and it's working pretty well. <code>direnv</code> is more flexible than pipenv's .env file loading so we were able to put shared variables in the root of the project and only have project-specific overrides in the project folders, which we couldn't do before and required some duplication. So in the end I feel like being forced to think about a different solution landed us in a better setup.</p>

<p>Yea, I put a <code>netrc.template</code> in the root of the project dir which users copy and paste into the <code>.netrc</code> file in the root of the project. Then, next to those files in the root there's an <code>.envrc</code> file which does:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">REPO_ROOT=$(expand_path .)

export NETRC=$REPO_ROOT/.netrc
dotenv $REPO_ROOT/.env
</code></pre>
<p>Inside each project folder (in our case <code>projects/foo</code>), I have the following <code>.envrc</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Load root .envrc first
source_env ../../.envrc

# Load .env file
dotenv_if_exists .env
</code></pre>
<p>Which loads the root <code>.envrc</code> file and optionally the project overrides in the adjacent <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could also just put the UV_INDEX_BLAH env vars in the root <code>.envrc</code> and not use netrc at all.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, pipenv (and not being configurable on the project level) has doing this has been <em>causing</em> us issues at work (older project we haven't had the time to switch to uv 😉 ). Since our programs cannot load <code>.env</code>, <code>.env.local</code> etc. in layers as pipenv reads the <code>.env</code> and puts those as system environment variables (with a system like Pydantic's configs, that can read the layered .env configurations, but won't override system environment). I've had to manually load our <code>.env.local</code> before initializing the config system that's supposed to automate that.</p>
<p>Not against this feature, just make sure it doesn't break existing workflows, or there's an opt-out that doesn't require adding a flag/venv to every <code>uv run</code> command!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So basically <code>uv pip</code> command is not a replacement for <code>uv run pip</code>. No support for pip.conf, no option to load .env file (using an environment variable to load a file with environment variables is absurd).

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv pip</code> and <code>uv run pip</code> are very different conceptually, and I don't think it would make sense to rename either of them.</p>
<p><code>uv pip</code> is a set of native subcommands that mimic the <code>pip</code> CLI.</p>
<p><code>uv run [command]</code> runs <code>[command]</code> in a project's virtual environment, after installing any necessary dependencies. <code>[command]</code> could be anything at all. In the case of <code>uv run pip</code>, that means &quot;run the <code>pip</code> executable that's installed within my project's virtual environment&quot;.  (It's generally a strange to command to run at all, because if you're using <code>uv run</code>, you probably want to use uv for dependency management, not pip.)</p>

<p>Pip doesn't support &quot;.env&quot; files, so you're using <code>uv run</code> to get env vars from a <code>.env</code>, equally you could use <code>uv run uv pip ...</code>.</p>

<p>Ah right - so <code>uv run --env-file .idontexist python</code> not erroring would be confusing to users? I guess erroring there helps highlight typos in the filename.</p>
<p>uv does support filenames or directory names in other configuration options, so I wonder what happens in those cases. I think:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--config-file</code>/<code>UV_CONFIG_FILE</code> - <strong>errors</strong> if file doesn't exist</li>
<li><code>--constraints</code>/<code>UV_CONSTRAINT</code> - <strong>errors</strong> if file doesn't exist</li>
<li><code>--excludes</code>/<code>UV_EXCLUDE</code> - <strong>errors</strong> if file doesn't exist</li>
<li><code>--overrides</code>/<code>UV_OVERRIDE</code> - <strong>errors</strong> if file doesn't exist</li>
<li><code>--cache-dir</code>/<code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> - <strong>creates</strong> the directory if doesn't exist</li>
<li>There are a few other directory options I haven't checked. AFAICS these don't have CLI versions - eg. <code>UV_CREDENTIALS_DIR</code>, <code>UV_INSTALL_DIR</code>, <code>UV_PYTHON_BIN_DIR</code> ...</li>
<li>Externally defined variables also include a large number of filenames/directory names I haven't checked</li>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><br />
<code>.env</code> files should not be treated as config, but as variable definitions loaded explicitly.<br />
Auto‑loading only makes sense in <code>uv run</code>; outside of it, it risks mixing system and project environments and leads to misuse.<br />
What is really missing in <code>uv</code> is support for centralized virtual environment folders, as pipenv, poetry, or venv already provide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't really understand this. Doesn't <code>uv</code> already allow loading a <code>.env</code> file using the <code>--env-file</code> parameter? ❓</p>
<p>Personally, I see <em>&quot;.env auto-loading&quot;</em> as a potential misuse of <code>.env</code> files, since they are meant to be variable definitions that may or may not be loaded into an environment.<br />
<em>(That is why it only makes sense in <code>uv run</code> and done explicitly with <code>--env-file</code>, because it creates the environment to run within)</em></p>
<p>I regularly use <code>.env</code> files (and variations) in projects, but they do not always match the actual environment variables in use.</p>
<p>I even disable <em>pipenv</em> auto-loading (via a system-wide env var), and similar tools, so that I can remain in full control of what gets loaded into the project's environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it would be useful to have a flag like <code>--env-file</code>, or a config section similar to what PDM provides.<br />
But why restrict it to <code>uv run</code> only? <code>uv</code> already uses environment variables in place of command-line arguments, so you can define different setups depending on your environment. This is particularly useful when, for example, you rely on a custom package index.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually an example of the common confusion around <code>.env</code> usage:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv command</code> runs on your system using your system environment.</li>
<li><code>uv run command</code> runs inside your project's environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <code>.env</code> files are not environment variables themselves. They are files containing variable declarations that may or may not be loaded.<br />
Making them auto-loaded by default could interfere or collide with the intended environment setup.</p>
<p>For example: consider running a Docker container with variables already defined, while a <code>.env</code> file is present.<br />
Which should take precedence? It is better to let the user decide, since this is purely environment-specific.<br />
Load your variables first, then run. (That is what <code>uv run --env-file env_file command</code> does inside the virtual environment, as far as I know.)</p>
<p>So, why limit the flag to <code>uv run</code>? Because system-wide environment variables should not be mixed with project-specific ones.</p>
<p><strong>In the end, the only use of <code>uv command --env-file xxx</code> would be treating the <code>.env</code> file as a config file, which is another common misuse.</strong></p>
<p>If I want to load a specific <code>.env</code> file into my environment, system or virtual, I prefer to do it explicitly. It is straightforward and ensures that the code runs in the environment as intended, regardless of whether such files are present. This is the behavior you would expect in Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, etc. In those cases the environment is already set up, and your code simply reads from it.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Explicit is better than implicit.&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I do not think so. That issue is about configuring UV system-wide with a central folder where all projects' <code>.venv</code> directories are created, not about using each project's internal <code>.env</code> file to inject system env vars. Doing so could affect two environments at once and even create conflicts.</p>
<p>The challenge with <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> is that it points to the specific folder for a single environment, not a folder containing multiple venvs. If you set it globally, you risk messing them all together. This reflects a design limitation in <code>uv</code>, since it uses an env var as a specific parameter instead of treating it as proper configuration.</p>
<p>i.e. what is actually needed is a <code>UV_PROJECTS_ENVIRONMENTS</code> (plural), where <code>uv</code> places all environments created, each in its own subfolder, similar to what pipenv and poetry already provide, and as requested by the OP there.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the fact that it is not currently easy to have centralized virtual environment folders, instead of a <code>.venv</code> in each project, makes it harder to move from tools like pipenv or poetry to uv.</p>
<p>Related to this issue, <code>.env</code> files are not the right place to configure <code>uv</code>. They affect how things run <strong>inside</strong> the project's environment, not the system's one.</p>
<p>The broader point is that <code>uv</code> is not a virtual environment manager like pipenv, poetry, or even venv itself. It creates the venv for you and can autoload it on <code>uv run</code>, yes, but that is the extent of it.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> is an excellent dependency manager, but its environment management remains a partially implemented convenience feature. That is why, to activate the virtual environment, you still rely on <code>venv</code> directly.</p>

<p>Maybe is the system administrator, the operations manager, who set the environment as is and those are the ones the code should honored and the <code>.env</code> file just slipped in during deployment (Seen that happen).</p>
<p>Don't think in terms of &quot;users&quot;, someones that runs his code personally and locally for himself, think on a project where you have developers, deployers, operations mngrs, etc. they may or not be the same ones (different hats), ...</p>
<p>Using <code>.env</code> files as config files creates this uncertainties, easy way is just not do it, you can always load a <code>.env</code> on environment if you really wants to  but &quot;automagic default features&quot; are always problematic.</p>
<p><code>pyproject.toml</code> is the perfect place to set up how is <code>uv</code> expected to behave <strong>inside the project as a dependency manager</strong>, nevertheless it's the &quot;project's file&quot;, but not the place to set how it should work as an environment manager, because your rig to develop may not be the same as mine nor the one to production deploy, environments management is not related to the project (code, app, you call it) it's related to the system hosting the virtual environment.</p>
<p>The right place to set up how 'uv' should behave could be a system's config file, system's env vars, system's something, so your <code>uv</code> will create envs where and how you like and mine will do as I like.</p>
<p>This is, for example, how git works with it's .gitconfig on your user's folder, as many other tools.
(Always local override of those files is possible ofc, but not taking advantage of other files, other files have their own purpose.)</p>
<ul>
<li>You like project's folder <code>.venv</code> and autoload <code>.env</code> file on you local venv? rigth, set up as that.</li>
<li>I do like centralized <code>.venv</code> folders and no implicit <code>.env</code> loading, I'll set as that.</li>
</ul>
<p>App's code should ignore <code>.env</code> files and rely on env vars, that way <em>&quot;operations&quot;</em> can decide how to set up those vars too on prod: using <code>.env</code> files, using kubernetes, docker-compose, dockerfile (i do not recoment harcode env vars on images but...) using whatever they do consider the best.</p>
<p>I think you get my point, is the same as stated on the <em><strong>12 factor app</strong></em>, the key point here is <code>.env</code> files are not config files nor environment variables, but something in between, if you think of them as &quot;presets for environment variables&quot; everything fits together.</p>
<ul>
<li>then you'll may have <code>.env.test</code>, <code>.env.production</code>, <code>.env.local_docker</code>, you name it.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.d: Just to illustrate the first point.</p>
<p>I do have <code>.env</code> file on my projects locally (.env should always be .gitignored) but those are only intended values when I run the code directly on the machine within a virtual env (which is just a session with tricked paths)</p>
<p>But when I run it inside a container I do not want that <code>.env</code> file to load, basically it does not provide right values for a container which may even be running a different OS, so I set the containers environment on the containers manifest.</p>
<p>But to have auto-reload features on code changes I mount the actual local code folder as a volume so the <code>.env</code> file is still present. Is just no one loads or reads it by default. It works as a charm for local, for remote and for deploy.</p>

<p>uv is an excellent dependency manager, but its environment management remains a partially implemented convenience feature. That is why, to activate the virtual environment, you still rely on venv directly.</p>

<p>The person responsible for the deployment could:</p>
<ol>
<li>If they call <code>uv run</code>, always specify an explicit <code>--env-file=.env.empty</code> and/or set <code>UV_ENV_FILE=.env.empty</code></li>
<li>Not use <code>uv run</code> at all (which seems to be what you do)</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently I have to add <code>pyauto-dotenv</code> to all my projects or always remember to pass <code>--env-file=.env</code>, it would be nice as a user if I can do the following workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone a project</li>
<li>Copy <code>.env.example</code> -&gt; <code>.env</code> and adjust the variables</li>
<li><code>uv run xxx.py</code> and it just works™</li>

<p>the ability to pick up automatically an .env file would likely solve https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1495 as well.
I really want to have my .venv outside the project folder, and setting UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT to some path would easily fix that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not think so. That issue is about configuring UV system-wide with a central folder where all projects' .venv directories are created, not about using each project's internal .env file to inject system env vars. Doing so could affect two environments at once and even create conflicts.</p>
<p>The challenge with UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT is that it points to the specific folder for a single environment, not a folder containing multiple venvs. If you set it globally, you risk messing them all together. This reflects a design limitation in uv, since it uses an env var as a specific parameter instead of treating it as proper configuration.</p>
<p>i.e. what is actually needed is a UV_PROJECTS_ENVIRONMENTS (plural), where uv places all environments created, each in its own subfolder, similar to what pipenv and poetry already provide, and as requested by the OP there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main issue there, or at least the branch I subscribe too, is that people don't want their <code>.venv</code> in the same folder as the project, so the project folder could be easily sync on a samba share, dropbox, etc; the fact that a <code>system-wide</code> config location has been proposed I guess is an artifact derived by how other tools works (e.g. poetry).ù</p>
<p>The main issue with <code>uv</code> and a <code>.venv</code> saved outside the project folder is that <code>uv</code> needs to know about it for any subsequent call, hence setting the <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT = &quot;~/&lt;path to cache&gt;/&lt;project name&gt;/.venv&quot;</code> take care of that. The problem is that this <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> needs to be set up for each terminal session. My workaround for that is to set the env variable in the .code-workspace so that each new terminal spawned by vscode will inherit it, but this is fragile since a random terminal session will ignore .code-workspace and also AI agent will don't know anything about. In short it require more manual setup and busywork.</p>
<p>What I envision is to have <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> set in .env file stored in the project folder, so that it will affect <strong>only</strong> uv command run in that project. I would even prefer if I could set up <code>uv</code> behaviour to pick up .env in the pyproject.toml, or in uv.toml (always local to the project folder).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Related to this issue, .env files are not the right place to configure uv. They affect how things run inside the project's environment, not the system's one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with you, .env file should only affect how <code>uv</code> run inside the project folder, not system-wide.</p>

<p>That's why I propose having the UV_PROJECTS_ENVIRONMENTS in plural, that's not were an specific project's <code>.venv</code> is created, that's where all project's <code>.venv</code> folders are created, then for project XYZ you'll always find its <code>.venv</code> folder at <code>UV_PROJECTS_ENVIRONMENTS/XYZ-Some-hash</code> avoiding the need to set it up on each session (and being aware that each session can only work on a project-service, with the obvious problem when dealing with multiservice-multirepo projects), we both agree on the core problem 😃</p>
<p>The problem of having the <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> set in <code>.env</code> file is that the <code>.env</code> file is supposed to be the values of the <em>&quot;project's running environment&quot;</em>, not the <em>&quot;hosting machine environment&quot;</em> where <code>uv</code> runs, if <code>uv</code> looks inside the <code>.env</code> file it will technically using some others environment values as it's own. (And you'll be storing foreign values on the project's environment)</p>
<p>An <code>uv.toml</code> or <code>pyproject.toml</code> file have the problem that they are shared files, they are in repository, and they should not be changing on each one of collaborators machines depending on their own preferences or host environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Where <code>uv</code> stores the <code>.venv</code> folder is irrelevant for the project itself, the project will run anyway as <code>uv run python app</code> for example, so where to store the <code>.venv</code> folder is more a personal preference on how to arrange and organize your own system.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why usually tools like <code>uv</code> takes their own configuration for some file on the system, because they work at host system level (at least the environment management part, for the dependencies part an in project file is the way to go obviously)</p>

<p>That's quite a hard asumption, I disagree that should be the defult behaviour, &quot;explicit always bet's implicit&quot; but I agree that's for example the <code>pipenv</code> way and that's why I always create an alias <code>alias pipshell='PIPENV_DONT_LOAD_ENV=1 pipenv shell' </code> I live perfect with alias, Opt in / opt out features and behaviors on this kind of highly opinionated things rules.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I gave later on the <code>P.d</code> and example of a real <code>slip in</code> case on a <code>local deployment</code> , I know I can make the dockerfile and manifests to filter out the <code>.env</code> specifically, and that's probably the best way to go, but I still believe the app shouldn't asume the <code>.env</code> file is there to be loaded, if I think an app needs to get conf from a file i'll make an specific conf file rather that take advantage of another purpose file that may be there, that way you avoid ambiguities and confusions, something like <code>app.conf</code> or <code>config.json</code> is clearer, more versatile and less problematic. Slipping in a <code>.env</code> file should not happen, but being a much more common and present file that an specific one ... Still I'm in general against pre-loaded config files to deploy, many things can go wrong in many points of control for that file.</p>

<p>No, I actually use things like <code>uv run python app</code> or <code>pipenv run python app</code> as entry points for the images, that helps a lot running without messing with base image environment, never the less the venvs are just a trick on paths not actual virtualization so the performance impact is nothing, ...</p>
<p>Ant that is why I see dangerous asume some file that may be there for other purpose or unexpected cause should be taken into account and I prefer to rely on pre-set environments (manifests or whatever ops sees fits better) or, in extreme case, pre-loaded specific config files.</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>That's exactly how I work, but the point is I prefer no load by default and use <code>uv run --env-file=.env.desired_env command</code> when I want to load.</p>
<p>I usually deliver several manifest <code>docker-compose-usage.yaml</code> or similar so I can there control what's passed in the environment so</p>
<p>But if I finally have to make an <code>alias uvrun = uv run --env-file=/dev/null</code> or like I'll do, of course.</p>
<p>I always think of my code aimed to be used as is directly from the clone by develop collaborators, testers or some kind of already aware and trained ones, not a final user, so the need to make it a &quot;single short command magic&quot; is not present.</p>
<p>It seems this is moving to an &quot;implicit by default Vs explicit by default&quot; disquisition, while I prefer explicit, meanwhile there are an env var or parameter I can set on an alias/entrypoint/manifest to make it behave my way I'll be in.</p>
<p>The real pain points I was trying to signal were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using &quot;internal environment configs&quot; (<code>.env</code>) to alter &quot;external environment behavior&quot;: <code>uv</code> behavior. <code>uv</code> belongs to the host machine not to the project, despite the project takes advantage of it you install it on the host, don't you?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using &quot;team shared configuration files&quot; to store personal machine/preferences configurations that may lead to constant conflicts or &quot;un-pushable modifications&quot;. (Same reason why usually you don't store on the repo your <code>.my-ide</code> config files)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those two can really add more problems than the value of the convenience short command they may provide.</p>
