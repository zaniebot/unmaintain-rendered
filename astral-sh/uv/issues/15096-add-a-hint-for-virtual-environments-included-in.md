# Add a hint for virtual environments included in wheels

---

_@zanieb_

We've seen several reports of this since we updated our behavior here, e.g.:

- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15086
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14834
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14897

We should add a dedicated hint that tells the user what's going on here.
