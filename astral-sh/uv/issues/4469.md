[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/cd2af3be73abd968b142cef3b8f279d47d578183/docs/assets/ruff-favicon.png) and [Rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/blob/main/docs/static/favicon.svg) each has its own logo. What about uv?

We do have a logo but I don't know if we've published the asset anywhere.

Now would be a good time to add it!

What's the use-case? I've added an svg icon in another branch: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/a80e4c880b5db04101d386c892a6e86bad6286a4/docs/theme/favicon.svg

Having a logo helps with identification and such, but I don't think it's necessary to have a concrete use case. It just looks nice!

I'm just wondering about the use-case so we know what kind of asset to provide :)
