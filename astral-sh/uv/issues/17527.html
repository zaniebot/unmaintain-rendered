            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Executing 'uv python install' should error out or at least warn when the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable is set.</p>
<p>With most uv/uvx commands when the UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON environment variable is set and the required Python version isn't available you get an error and hint &quot;A managed Python download is available for Python X.XX, but the Python preference is set to 'only system'&quot; however 'uv python install' will install any requested version.</p>
<p>Suggested behavior that then the environment variable is set that it errors and does not install unless a '--force' flag is provided; minimally should provide a warning even if install is allowed.</p>
<p>Preventing undesired versions from being installed is important in enterprise environments where security requirements which dictate allowed versions and authorized versions are installed external to uv.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
