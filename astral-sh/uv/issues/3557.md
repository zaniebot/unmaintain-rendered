# Global CLI flags cannot be passed to commands

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-05-13 17:38_

It's not a great user experience to need to be aware which flags are global and pass them in a different location.

e.g.

```
❯ uv run --isolated --with anyio -- python -c "print('hi')"
error: unexpected argument '--isolated' found

  tip: to pass '--isolated' as a value, use '-- --isolated'

Usage: uv run [OPTIONS] [TARGET] [ARGS]...

For more information, try '--help'.
```

vs

```
❯ uv --isolated run --with anyio -- python -c "print('hi')"
warning: `uv run` is experimental and may change without warning.

It's only `isolated` that's affected by this. The others work.
