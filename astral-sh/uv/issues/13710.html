            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm liking the tool and appreciate the tremendous amount of work into it.</p>
<p>However, this happened so need to report.</p>
<p><code>uv start python &lt;script&gt; &lt;param&gt;</code> removed .venv, requiring a rebuild</p>
<p>Possible issue was to do with permissions. I changed permissions .venv and children. However, they weren't enough to prevent .venv from being removed.</p>
<p>I know it removed it since it said it failed to remove the directory .venv Access is denied (os error 5) due to another process running the script, and I checked that it was there just before stopping the other process and then trying to <code>uv start ptyhon &lt;script&gt; &lt;param&gt;</code> again. (I assumed it was shuffling things around and doing a move)</p>
<p>(btw: in the bug report form it uses <code>uv self version</code> as an example when it should be <code>uv self --version</code>)</p>
<p>Thank you,
Adam</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the kind words.</p>
<p>Can you share verbose logs, e.g., <code>uv run -v ...</code>, as well as a minimum reproduction as described in the issue template and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9452?</p>

<p>This is because you're on an old version of uv, the command has since been added.</p>
