# Preserve case-insensitive sorts in `uv add`

---

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2024-09-30 03:52_

i like to keep my dependencies alphabetically sorted, it would appreciate it if `uv` did the same

`uv add` does keep them sorted if they were already sorted (but it does not sort unsorted dependencies). Are you seeing otherwise?

turns out it was because there was `PyYAML` in the list, i think the capitalization threw it off

I think it would be reasonable to check if the list is case-insensitive-sorted, and preserve that.
