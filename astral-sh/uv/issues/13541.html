            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>More and more projects using uv, that great! But the current guide only explains how to initialize a new project but not what to do when you start working on a project that already uses uv. This confused me at first, and many colleagues I have spoken to have had the same experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, I propose to add a small but explicit section on working on existing projects to the guide:</p>
<p>#13542</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I wouldn't move too much and have to maintain it in two location. Also, I like that the guides are rather compact and more details can be found under concepts. But it's a good point, what do you think about briefly introduce it and link to the page you mentioned?</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>## Working on an existing project

If you start working on a project that is already managed by uv, simply run `uv sync`. A virtual
environment will be created (if one does not already exist) and all dependencies from the `uv.lock`
file will be installed. Due to the automatic locking and synchronisation in uv, this also applies to other
commands such as `uv run` or `uv lock`.

See the [locking and syncing documentation](../concepts/projects/sync.md)
for details.
