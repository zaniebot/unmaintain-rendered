            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to propose as enhancement to provide the capability to configure additional module search paths in pyproject.toml</p>
<p>I have a project which needs to look for further paths, that do not corrispond to any package.</p>

<p>just pop in to say that there are massive discussions here and there, like: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/208
I hope this gives some context about how such a feature can be desired by some.
but don't get me wrong. I'm not coming to argue like whether tool A and B are / should be the same etc.
&amp; arguing whether a feature can be useful/helpful for people or whether a need is valid is almost never going to reach an end and the process can hardly be meaningful as well. perhaps we'd better skip to if this is technically possible and what are the main concerns to do or not do it</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for not answering earlier, I try to explain my need.</p>
<p>I have a lot of scripts on a git repository, which use as a dependency some classes developed by some colleagues (not packages) that are hosted in a different repository which I use as a sub-module of mine (e.g. in a subfolder ./ext/fancy-classes with respect to my scripts contained in ./python/ directory of my repo)</p>
<p>To avoid setting PYTHONPATH in the environment each time, currently with python -m venv, I am adding the directories where these directories in a text file in &quot;..venv\Lib\site-packages&quot;</p>
<p>Now I discovered this wonderful tool named uv, that dynamically manages and creates the venv way better, but my &quot;workaround&quot; is definitely weaker with this tool.</p>
<p>Since it has so many amazing features, I was thinking that there could be a way to set the PYTHONPATH in the pyproject.toml file, so that with uv run all my scripts simply work.</p>
<p>Hope that this better explains my need.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My take, maybe helpful:</p>
<p><code>export UV_ENV_FILE=.uvenv</code></p>
<p>.uvenv contents:</p>
<p><code>PYTHONPATH=./src</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At the moment I use <code>poethepoet</code> to set this PYTHONPATH environment variable.  Though I kind of wish <code>uv</code> just made an exception for <code>sitecustomize.py</code> I don't need it to scan through the whole folder.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>PYTHONPATH</code> has some drawbacks, for example that uv can't ensure dependency consistency and there's no proper venv for installing into attached to, and env vars can be edited and read from anywhere while being inherited to subprocesses. I highly recommend using venvs and editable installs where possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is already a venv unless you're saying I should just have as part of my poe script to copy the sitecustomize.py into the .venv not sure I tried that yet.</p>
