# `uv pip freeze` with `--quiet` does not output packages

---

_Issue opened by @thijsvandien on 2025-10-08 06:56_

### Summary

The `-q`/`--quiet` option makes `uv` a little too quiet in case of `pip freeze`. I intended just to skip the usual chatter (which environment is used and so on), but the command will have no effect at all this way.

```
> uv venv
> uv -q pip install ty
> uv pip freeze
ty==0.0.1a21
> uv -q pip freeze
```

The final line produces nothing.

### Platform

macOS 15.7.1 arm64

### Version

uv 0.9.5 (Homebrew 2025-10-21)
