### Question

In short I dont believe so. 

So `uv` appears to create a generic `.gitignore` file on `init`.

You could work around this by doing a global gitignore and initialising without creating a gitignore

> [--no-create-gitignore](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--no-create-gitignore)
> Do not create a .gitignore file in the output directory.

> By default, uv creates a .gitignore file in the output directory to exclude build artifacts from version control. When this flag is used, the file will be omitted.

That being said, it would be nice to have `uv` have a command like `--use-global-ignore` that would use the global gitignore.
