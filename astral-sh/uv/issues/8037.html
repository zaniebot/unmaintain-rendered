            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,
I couldn't find any command or options to <strong>Manage the Environments</strong> created once by <code>uv venv </code>and needed to be <strong>Modified/Removed/Switched Between</strong> appropriately, like the ones available in <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/">Poetry</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You are probably looking for the <code>uv pip</code> commands, e.g. <code>uv pip list</code>, <code>uv pip install</code>, ...</p>
<p>I kind of wish <code>uv pip</code> was renamed to <code>uv env</code>, and <code>uv venv</code> was <code>uv env create</code>. <code>uv pip</code> could still exist as an alias for <code>uv env</code>, as can <code>uv venv</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, <code>pip </code>commands are about managing the <strong>dependencies</strong> of the project installed in the <code>env</code>, not the <strong>virtual environment</strong> itself.
I'm looking for commands like: <code>poetry env remove</code>, <code>poetry env use</code>, ... to manage the <code>env</code>. (<a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/">check the link to the Poetry docs</a>.) that let you associate more than one <code>env </code>to a project and switch between them, remove unwanted ones, etc.</p>
<p>P.S
How can I Install the latest <code>[Python 3.13 (free-threaded) build](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20241008)</code> distribution (<strong>Windows10 x86_64</strong>), with uv? I couldn't find a way to tell that to <code>uv python install</code></p>
