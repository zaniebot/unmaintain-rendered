            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The progress bars are low contrast on light terminal backgrounds. They don't convey progress very well.</p>
<p>Comparing screenshots, the progress &quot;mark&quot; - how far have we come - stands out much better with dark background.</p>

<p>IMO pip's progress bars (I think it vendors rich) work well in comparison. One thing they have in favour of them is that they are a solid line in the horizontal direction(?), and they probably use non-ascii.</p>

<p>Maybe make the right portions light gray instead of green?</p>
