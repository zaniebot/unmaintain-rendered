            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a way to mark some dependencies to install without their dependencies with uv? This is similar to https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/10837 .</p>
<p>For example installing <code>pgmpy</code> but without <code>pytorch</code>. It's ok to add rest of <code>pgmpy</code> dependendecies directly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry why was it marked as completed? Is there an equivalent to <code>pip install &lt;package&gt; --no-deps</code> available now?</p>
<p>The hack mentioned above is hardly a solution to the problem,
Not only does it rely on an implementation detail (see the comment below: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4422#issuecomment-2255411693), but it doesn't serve the same purpose.</p>
<p>For instance, I want to use an internal library which has plently of &quot;<package> == <version>&quot; requirements which I know for a fact are abusive, and I want to relax.
But I don't want uv to not install at all those packages (e.g. <code>pandas</code>).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install &lt;package&gt; --no-deps 
</code></pre>
<p>The question was about overriding a specific dependency, which pip doesn't support, but uv does by using an override file or manually specifying the dependency metadata: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#dependency-metadata</p>
