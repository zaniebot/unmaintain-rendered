# PEP-723 requires-python version not downloaded with uv run

---

_Issue opened by @jmoudev on 2025-03-12 16:46_

### Summary

The documentation mentions the following in reference to PEP-723 style scripts:
"uv run will search for and use the required Python version. The Python version will download if it is not installed — see the documentation on [Python versions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/) for more details."
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/c1a0bb85ea7e16b998cf1fca41de5f6323dcd5a4/docs/guides/scripts.md?plain=1#L216-L218

However, when running a PEP-723 script uv errors out when the specified Python version in the requires-python doesn't exist:

Script header:
```Python
# /// script
# requires-python = "==3.8"
# ///
```

```bash
$ uv run --script main.py
error: No interpreter found for Python ==3.8 in virtual environments, managed installations, or search path
```

This seems contrary to the documentation guidance that the Python version should be downloaded.

Thanks in advance :)

You might be intending to use `==3.8.*`? `==3.8` is equal to `==3.8.0`, and I suspect we don't have a 3.8.0 build.
