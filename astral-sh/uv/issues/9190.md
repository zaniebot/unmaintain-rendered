# run scripts from [project.gui-scripts] with pythonw on windows

Scripts configured under `[project.gui-scripts]` should be run with `pythonw.exe` on Windows. However, they are run with `python.exe` and show a terminal console in addition to the application GUI window.

More on `[project.gui-scripts]` can be found here: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#entry-points

Just discovered this is actually a bug wit `python 3.13`. Using `python 3.12` works fine and no console is shown for the `[project.gui-scripts]`.
