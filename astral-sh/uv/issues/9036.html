            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given workspace pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.sources]
torch = [
  { index = &quot;pytorch-cu124&quot;, marker = &quot;platform_system != 'Darwin'&quot; },
  { index = &quot;pytorch-cpu&quot;, marker = &quot;platform_system == 'Darwin'&quot; },
]
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch-cpu&quot;
url = ...
explicit = true
# similar for cu124
</code></pre>
<p>And a workspace member project's pyproject:</p>
<pre><code>dependencies = [
  &quot;torch==2.5.1+cu124 ; platform_system != 'Darwin'&quot;,
  &quot;torch==2.5.1 ; platform_system == 'Darwin'&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>On MacOS, with 0.5.0 (and 0.5.1), the following error occurs:</p>
<pre><code>error: Distribution `torch==2.5.1+cpu @ registry+https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
</code></pre>
<p>In that registry, the following files exist (I've removed all but the python 3.12 ones)</p>
<pre><code>torch-2.5.1+cpu-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
torch-2.5.1+cpu-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl
torch-2.5.1-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl
torch-2.5.1-cp312-none-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl
</code></pre>
<p>Note that x64 linux and windows have <code>+cpu</code>, whereas the macOS wheels do not. Also, in case it matters, the <code>+cpu</code> wheels come before the macos one in the registry listing. This worked fine with 0.4, so I'm guessing this broke with the local version work from @ericmarkmartin.</p>
<p>(Man, pytorch really is the gift that keeps on giving... ;)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That does indeed fix it; I couldn't figure out how to constrain to &quot;without local version&quot;, makes perfect sense to just constrain to &quot;not the +cpu&quot; one. But man this is such a mess in pytorch. If this resolution behaviour is correct, then I guess pytorch should fix how they're publishing packages? Either move the things without +cpu to another registry dir, or make them all have +cpu... Gah.</p>
<p>Thanks for the fix suggestion. Works on both 0.4.30 and 0.5.1.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I'm really confused about why (above) the macOS versions <em>don't</em> have +cpu but the others do. Presumedly they're all CPU distributions? It's annoying because this has come up before :(</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's because on macos, there are no multiple-local-version wheels; there's just the single torch package. There is support for the Metal Performance Shaders hw accel framework, but it's all integrated into a single package. So I guess they omitted the +cpu because it's technically not just +cpu. Or something. :/</p>

<p><code>torch===2.5.1, platform_system == 'Darwin'</code> should work as well I think</p>
