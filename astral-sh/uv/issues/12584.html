            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-751-one-last-time/77293/150">PEP 751</a> is officially accepted.</p>
<p>Today, the PEP 751-style <code>pylock.toml</code> files are not sufficient to replace <code>uv.lock</code>. The biggest limitation is that there's no support for arbitrary entrypoints to the graph, because <code>pylock.toml</code> includes a fixed marker for each package entry rather than recording a graph of dependencies. Specifically, this means <code>uv run -p</code> could not be supported (i.e., we couldn't support installing a specific subset of the graph) within the standard.</p>
<p>Notably, though, unlike <code>requirements.txt</code>, <code>pylock.toml</code> also supports extras and dependency groups by extending the PEP 508 marker syntax. So markers can now express things like &quot;this extra was enabled&quot; or &quot;this dependency group was enabled&quot;. As such, we <em>could</em> potentially use PEP 751-style <code>pylock.toml</code> files for single-member workspaces. I don't think this is worth the complexity right now, but it is possible.</p>
<p>So for now, from uv's perspective, we can think of PEP 751-style <code>pylock.toml</code> files as a more modern <code>requirements.txt</code>. A <code>pylock.toml</code> file captures a set of packages to install, along with the source of those packages. Unlike <code>requirements.txt</code>, the format is fully standardized, and it can also model certain pieces of information that <code>requirements.txt</code> cannot (e.g., you can specify a package as coming from a specific registry).</p>
<p>As a first step, we want to support PEP 751-style <code>pylock.toml</code> files as an export format in <code>uv export</code>, and as an installable format in <code>uv pip install</code>. Like <code>uv pip install --group</code>, we may want to see how pip chooses to support these files before implementing <code>uv pip install</code> support. This requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding code to translate <code>uv.lock</code> to <code>pylock.toml</code> in <code>uv export</code>.</li>
<li>Supporting <code>pylock.toml</code> as a dependency source for <code>uv pip install</code>, or maybe <em>just</em> <code>uv pip sync</code>?</li>
<li>Extending our PEP 508 implementation to understand the new <code>extras</code> and <code>dependency-groups</code> markers.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, it was discussed at length but it was ultimately decided that it was adding too much complexity for a first draft / version of the spec. uv is also the only tool that supports this IIUC which made it hard to motivate standardizing around it right now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there an effort to work on a version 2 that would add support for it?😅</p>
<p>Do you have some plans on how to select when both lock files are present or what would UV lock generate by default? In the long term obviously, as this ticket says that we'll only support it via export.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There isn't yet, but there should be eventually. It was made fairly clear in the DPO discussion that if there <em>is</em> a Version 2 with support for these kinds of features, the expectation is that the PEP would need to be authored and driven by tooling authors (uv, Poetry, PDM, etc.).</p>

It seems that <code>uv.lock</code> is still generated, but then what should we add to the git repo?

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv.lock</code> is a lot more powerful than <code>pylock.toml</code>, and carries a lot of required metadata required by uv. We support <code>pylock.toml</code> as output format of a resolution and as input for installation, but uv can't make reliable incremental changes to it, for which we need <code>uv.lock</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So for the time being do we have to checkout both <code>uv.lock</code> and <code>pylock.toml</code>, or is <code>pylock.toml</code> enough and we can gitignore <code>uv.lock</code>. The most important part though, if the repository updates <code>pylock.toml</code> through something like renovate, is that picked up by uv (and maybe depending on IDE support) and a re-sync is done to update the user's <code>uv.lock</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's a lot of resolver details that need to be preserved for being able to incrementally change an existing lockfile, this isn't about a specific field, it's about the resolver strategies (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/internals/resolver/). We'd need to specify how a universal resolver works, including the marker forks that uv uses, the aforementioned workspaces, exclude-newer, freshness checks, the fork strategy, prerelease handling and required environments. Some that can be carried in a tool specific table, but if tools don't have the same understanding about how resolvers work, having them edit the same <code>pylock.toml</code> leads to a lot of churn with different resolution strategies as well as conflicts over unsupported features, ultimately leading to a worse user experience than with <code>uv.lock</code>.</p>
