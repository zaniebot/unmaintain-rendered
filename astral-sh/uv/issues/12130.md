# Allow multiple `--package` arguments to `uv sync`

---

_Issue opened by @gedemagt on 2025-03-12 07:19_

### Summary

I currently use workspaces to manage a mono-repo structure, but I would like to keep all my linting/test tools in the root project. 

In my CI/CD I would like to only install the dependencies of one workspace AND the root workspace. Currently, however, it seems to only be possible to either install ALL workspaces or only one. 

Would it be possible to allow for multiple `--package` flags in the `uv sync` command? 

### Example

```
monorepo
|-- repo_1
|   |-- pyproject.toml
|-- repo_2
|   |-- pyproject.toml
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- uv.lock
```
To only install root dependencies and dependencies for repo_2 one could call
`uv sync --package monorepo --package repo_2`

I think we could consider this. It makes sense conceptually. \cc @zanieb

I think we should add support for this, though I wonder if there's ambiguity for operations which target a specific child package? See also #12353
