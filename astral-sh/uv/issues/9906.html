            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since I'm new to uv I still did not get how to deal with different named venvs.</p>
<p>I want to have a venv311 and a venv312 in the same project. The python version can be pinned only once and uv sync ignores pre-existing venvs with defined python versions.</p>
<p>How to handle the case of testing different python versions on the same project?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Curious what the workflow is that is driving this?</p>
<p>uv's cacheing tends to be good enough to flip back and forth without much delay since it is just relinking rather than recopying (especially if you provide <code>--frozen</code> to use the existing <code>uv.lock</code> resolution).</p>
<p>I know that the <code>uv venv</code> command lets you create custom virtual environments to use with <code>uv pip ...</code>, but I don't know of a way to tell sync to use a custom environment. Possibly <code>--python venv311/bin/python</code>, but I'm not sure if that would have the intended function.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd use <code>uv run --python &lt;version&gt; ...</code> to test different Python versions. I agree with @nathanscain I'd be curious to understand why you want multiple static environments around.</p>
<p>Regardless, the workaround is</p>
<pre><code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=venv311 uv sync -p 3.11
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=venv312 uv sync -p 3.12
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a similar request to what the original poster asked.</p>
<p>My use case in particular is for a project that is a Python library. I want to be able to run tests across all supported Python versions. I recognize that uv manages to make it easy and fast to delete and recreate environments, but this feels kind of weird and is unnecessary disk I/O? Not to mention that this could disrupt things if you want to have a stable primary environment.</p>
<p>Supporting multiple virtual environments is something lots of other Python project management tools like <a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/environment/advanced/#matrix">Hatch</a>, <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/">Poetry</a>, and <a href="https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/venv/#create-a-virtualenv-yourself">PDM</a> all support.</p>
<p>What I want to have is a &quot;dev&quot; primary environment as the default one that gets used (this could be the <code>.venv</code> one that uv sort of considers the one and only environment right now), and then additional environments for tests for a matrix of Python versions. I believe this is a setup that these other tools have ended up making pretty common.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Awesome! This at least addresses my problem of clobbering the default project environment. Am I understanding correctly that an <code>--isolated</code> environment is completely throwaway and not reused? It feels wasteful to keep recreating the test environments, but I suppose uv is fast enough that I can live with this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah it's thrown away, we could consider changing that but I think we would need a concrete motivating example. It's a goal of uv to make environments disposable via speed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I develop on a project that supports Python 3.9 through Python 3.13. When CI catches issues affecting a particular Python version, it would be convenient to be able to switch my interpreter in my IDE to a virtual environment corresponding to that version to debug without needing to delete my current environment and reinstall everything. This is something I would have previously done with <code>conda</code> by having distinct environments for different Python versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah but the same could be said for, e.g., the combination of all dependency groups / extras, which is 2^N environments. I think we need more generalized solutions to these things rather than just creating and storing a bunch of them indefinitely. For example, a uv integration with your IDE could just create the desired environment on request.</p>

<p>I buy that. If it's fast and doesn't require a lot of manual commands to switch between configurations, I am all for a declarative approach.</p>
