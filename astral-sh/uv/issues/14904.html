<p>It seems that <code>environments</code> setting in <code>uv.toml</code> is ignored when writing uv.lock.</p>

uv sync

<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Found both a `uv.toml` file and a `[tool.uv]` section in an adjacent `pyproject.toml`. The following fields from `[tool.uv]` will be ignored in favor of the `uv.toml` file:

</code></pre>
<p>I.e. there aren't any dependencies for Windows present in uv.lock, anymore.</p>
<p>The <code>warning</code> is also not entirely correct in this case, as <code>uv</code> apparently uses the setting in pyproject.toml.
The same warning is shown, when the <code>environments</code> setting is only present in pyproject.toml, so it cannot really be ignored in favor of the uv.toml file, obviously.</p>
<p>Is this a bug or a mistake on my part?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Uhm, then let me vote for allowing environments in uv.toml, if I may.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Settings that affect project metadata aren't allowed in the uv.toml.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's probably a very good reason for that, but IMHO the line between project metadata and config settings is bit blurry. E.g. (maybe not the best example) you might want to set different <code>link-mode</code>s per environment. Or if you're developing in some container based setup where you don't really have &quot;machine&quot; configs. Here I'd like to copy just the uv.toml with my settings (including <code>environments</code>) and then just manage the pyproject.toml with <code>uv init</code>, <code>uv add</code> etc.</p>

<p>Thinking about this a little further, I wonder: Setting e.g. <code>environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;]</code> at the user or system level might be a little odd, but is it that bad as to prohibit it altogether?</p>
<p>And then there's the case where <code>uv.toml</code> is in the project directory. It's not really clear to me, why some settings would be mandatory to be set in pyproject.toml whereas others could be in both, I guess?</p>

<p>The warning does make sense from the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/configuration-files/#configuration-files">&quot;<code>uv.toml</code> files take precedence over <code>pyproject.toml</code> files&quot;</a> point of view though.</p>

<p>In our current model, we prohibit other settings like this so we'd need to reconsider the model more broadly to allow it.</p>

<p>Thanks, I appreciate it!</p>
<p>Again, you probably have good reasons for it. I just cannot entirely wrap my head around it ATM and from my perspective it seems somewhat confusing. I guess I'd need to hear those reasons to be able to understand it?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'd tend to agree at first. However, from my perspective there is a lot of precedence of other tools allowing either settings under the [tool] header in pyproject.toml or in tool.toml. I don't think I've seen a &quot;this setting has to live in pyproject.toml, but you can put others in tool.toml&quot;. With that in mind, special-casing project-level <code>uv.toml</code> files seems less weird than this alternative.</p>
<p>I'd also like to stress this again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>developing in some container based setup where you don't really have &quot;machine&quot; configs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. using a GitHub template repo to bootstrap setting up new projects. These can contain a uv.toml file with all settings relevant to the environment and serve as a de-facto system-level config file which just happen to live in the project directory because there is only one project per machine (i.e. container). In that setting, <code>environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;]</code> , is really more of a system-level than a project-level setting, because you're only developing in linux containers anyway.</p>
<p>It would be a bit clumsy for these templates to already contain a rudimentary pyproject.toml as you e.g. wouldn't be able to <code>uv init</code> the project.</p>
<p>I understand the requirement to not allow definite project level settings on the user- or system-level, but like I said, for some settings the lines are blurrier than others. I would probably add <code>default-groups</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>sources</code>, possibly <code>build-backend</code> in the blurry category.</p>
