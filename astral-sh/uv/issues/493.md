# Panic when ldd is not in path

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-11-23 09:48_

Granted, this one is exotic. Paths are for ubuntu 23.10.

```console
$ PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:/usr/sbin cargo run --bin puffin -q -- pip-compile -v --cache-dir cache-mst scripts/benchmarks/requirements/black.in
thread 'main' panicked at crates/platform-host/src/linux.rs:19:10:
failed to execute ldd: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

Can you expand on what the issue is here?

_Comment by @konstin on 2023-11-25 19:03_

We expect that `ldd` is in `PATH` at

https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/blob/9d35128840908020416d42e504c6fe256a1d82db/crates/platform-host/src/linux.rs#L16-L19

which is a reasonable assumption to make, but we should error instead of panicking when `ldd` isn't there.
