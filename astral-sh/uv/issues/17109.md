# uv fails to find wheel for split index/dependency

_Issue opened by @michael-o on 2025-12-12 19:06_

### Question

I am trying to implement split index for several dependencies which have native components, we target multiple OSes (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux, FreeBSD). The first three are available from PyPI and the last one I host myself in a custom index. Now, to have a decent lock file I have created a simple project:
```
$ cat pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "split-index-test"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"

dependencies = [
    "numpy==2.2.6",
]

[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
    "sys_platform == 'freebsd13'",
    "sys_platform != 'freebsd13'"
]

[tool.uv.sources]
numpy = [
  { index = "freebsd-wheels", marker = "sys_platform == 'freebsd13'" },
  { index = "pypi", marker = "sys_platform != 'freebsd13'" }
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "freebsd-wheels"
url  = "https://dw-eng-rsc.innomotics.net/FreeBSD/python-wheels/FreeBSD:13:amd64/simple"
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
```
According to pip I have:
```
$ pip debug --verbose | grep freebsd
WARNING: This command is only meant for debugging. Do not use this with automation for parsing and getting these details, since the output and options of this command may change without notice.
sys.platform: freebsd13

  py35-none-freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64
  py34-none-freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64
  py33-none-freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64
  py32-none-freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64
  py31-none-freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64
  py30-none-freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64
```
and the wheel in question:
```
$ curl https://dw-eng-rsc.innomotics.net/FreeBSD/python-wheels/FreeBSD:13:amd64/simple/numpy/
<a href='numpy-2.2.6-cp310-cp310-freebsd_13_5_release_p5_amd64.freebsd_13_5_release_p6_amd64.freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64.whl'>numpy-2.2.6-cp310-cp310-freebsd_13_5_release_p5_amd64.freebsd_13_5_release_p6_amd64.freebsd_13_5_release_p7_amd64.whl</a><br />
```
so uv should be able to satisfy the dependency, but fails repeatedly:

I have tried to rename the wheel according to the `sys_platform` and tried variations, but I fail to satisfy what uv expects to see.

Is it me being too stupid or is it a PEP 508 issue and therfore the markers don't work? I can see in the access log of HTTPd that only the index is retrieved, but not the wheel.

As soon as I remove `required-environments` it seems to work on one platform, but not the other.

I am basically trying to tell uv use this index for FreeBSD only. At worst, I have to pin indexes on a per-dependency basis, but it is very tedious.

### Platform

FreeBSD 13.5-RELEASE-p7 amd64

### Version

uv 0.9.17+10 (38ae41468 2025-12-11)

uv at the moment only knows what the `required-environments` markers mean for windows, linux and mac at the moment, as we have to manually map the markers to tags manually. We can add those mapping for more platforms.

By using `tool.uv.environments` we shouldn't error for now, though that may change with https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17118.

From uv's perspective, the ideal thing would be the freebsd index mirror the non-freebsd for its builds, so uv can operate on a unified index.

You may also want to make freebsd-wheels an explicit index.

I almost thought this, but it should be documented. It wasn't clear and I was banging my head against the monitor. What does it take to add them?

I have tried ust `too.uv.environments` as well. There was no remedy actually.

> From uv's perspective, the ideal thing would be the freebsd index mirror the non-freebsd for its builds, so uv can operate on a unified index.

This I noticed as well and went for a band-aid solution with proxpi, but I don't see a reason why uv should not work with split situations and the docs don't tell that this is not a supported approach.

> You may also want to make freebsd-wheels an explicit index.

I have tried and this does not work for two reasons:
* I have to list the source of every single dependency: tedious, error-prone, incomplete
* It ignores transitive dependencies and there are some which are being rebuilt and I refuse to promote them to direct dependencies just to satify the the explicit flag for uv.

It the code at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/f122387f898bca32ead6ffe461e8e3b3fa8c487d/crates/uv-distribution-types/src/prioritized_distribution.rs#L819

I agree this should be documented in the required-environments docstring.
