# Add `--local` flag

---

_Issue opened by @morags on 2025-01-21 13:15_

# Feature request

Add a flag that forces `uv` to work completely locally, with no changes to the global environment.

## Background

I have two use cases for which a completely local installation (no global python, no global cache, perhaps not even a global `uv`) is needed:

1. Distributing packages to systems that don't have, or can't have Python installed (see eg. [here](https://gist.github.com/morags/c1c7db99b911dfec259eec0a1bb97689)).
2. Installing a package that is sensitive to non-ASCII paths (eg. `C:\Users\Иван\AppData\Roaming\uv\`)

At the moment there are several flags and environment variables that allows you to control parts of this behavior, like `--cache-dir` and `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`, but it would be useful to have a single flag that concentrates all of them and forces `uv` to work in a completely isolated fashion.

## Suggested behavior

`uv <command> --local <folder>` runs a command in a given folder without touching the global environment, including caches, Python installations and configuration files.
