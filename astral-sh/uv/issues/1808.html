            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First of all, thank you for this awesome tool, its potential is enormous. 😄</p>
<p>Platform: Ubuntu + MacOs
uv version: 0.1.6</p>
<p>I guess this issue is related with https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1603, but wasn't resolved in v0.1.16.
The error occurs when trying to install a package that in turn has a dependency that is installed via URL</p>
<p>For example, If we have a <strong>requirement.txt</strong> like the following to install a requirement with a URL.</p>
<p><strong>requirement.txt:</strong></p>
<pre><code>packageA @ git+https://@github.com/alice-biometrics/uv-playground@main#egg=src&amp;subdirectory=issues/url_deps/packageA
</code></pre>
<p>And the packageA also have a requirement to install another package (packageB) from URL.</p>
<p><strong>pyproject.toml (from package A)</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">..
dependencies = [
    &quot;packageB @ git+https://@github.com/alice-biometrics/uv-playground@main#egg=src&amp;subdirectory=issues/url_deps/packageB&quot;
]
...
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">flowchart LR

    requirements(requirements.txt)

    subgraph packageA[packageA]
        pyprojectA(pyproject.toml)
    end

    subgraph packageB[packageB]
        pyprojectB(pyproject.toml)
    end

    requirements -.URL requirement.-&gt; packageA
    pyprojectA -.URL requirement.-&gt; packageB
    pyprojectB --&gt; pydantic
</code></pre>
<p>When I try to install it with my <strong>requirements.txt</strong> with uv (v0.1.16) i'm obtaining the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console"> &gt; uv pip install -r requirements.txt

</code></pre>
<p>Currently, it appears that <code>uv</code> is encountering difficulty resolving inherited dependencies (such as packageB) from URLs specified in the dependencies section of pyproject.toml for packageA. I've provided a reproducible example in the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/alice-biometrics/uv-playground/tree/main/issues/url_deps">uv-playground</a>.</p>
<p>When packageB is included directly in the main requirement.txt, <code>uv</code> successfully resolves the dependency. However, I believe <code>uv</code> should automatically resolve inherited dependencies from dependent packages, irrespective of whether they are specified by URL or not, similar to the behavior of pip.</p>
<p><strong>pip example:</strong></p>
<pre><code> pip install -r requirements.txt

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that this problem also affects <code>uv pip compile</code>.</p>
<p>One of our transitive dependencies is defined as <code>git+https</code>, which is not ideal but that's life, we don't really want to add it to our requirements because it's an unnecessary burden when updating the root package.
This makes <code>uv</code> impossible to use in our project.</p>
<p>Please, consider maintaining this behavior opt-in but having a flag to opt-out of it, otherwise this will be a complete stopper for some use cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @charliermarsh thanks for the response.</p>
<p>We're currently using poetry with editable dependencies for our monorepo</p>
<p>eg</p>
<pre><code>[tool.poetry.dependencies]
lib1 = {path = &quot;../../lib/lib1&quot;, develop = true }
</code></pre>
<p>Since any package can have dependencies on others we can have lib1 in this example having dependencies on lib2.</p>
<p>I understand that uv doesn't support poetry dependencies (yet), but we're able to <code>pip install /path/to/a/package</code> and it will install properly (though not respect the pinned deps in the lockfile).</p>
<p>What I'm noticing is that if I <code>uv pip install .</code> it complains not about the first line of deps, but about the second, eg lib2 in this toy example.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First of all, thanks a lot for all the great work you put into uv and ruff! Really appreciating how you improve developer experience in the python ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now to my question: is it intended to support URL requirements in transitive dependencies at some point in the future?</p>
<p>In my example, I have a dummy python package named <code>foo</code> that has a single URL dependency. The <code>pyproject.toml</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">[tool.poetry.dependencies]
pywrangler = { tag = &quot;v0.1.1&quot;,  git = &quot;https://github.com/mansenfranzen/pywrangler.git&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>When I install foo's wheel from a private index via <code>uv pip install foo</code>  I get the following error (running uv 0.4.5):</p>
<pre><code>`Package `pywrangler` attempted to resolve via URL: git+https://github.com/mansenfranzen/pywrangler.git@v0.1.1. URL dependencies must be expressed as direct requirements or constraints. Consider adding `pywrangler @ git+https://github.com/mansenfranzen/pywrangler.git@v0.1.1` to your dependencies or constraints file.`
</code></pre>
<p>To be honest, I'm bit confused about what is currently supported or not. The <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#transitive-direct-url-dependencies-for-constraints-and-overrides">documentation</a> makes clear that transitive URL deps aren't supported while @charliermarsh comments from April 1st mention otherwise.</p>

<p>I am also confused by the documentation for transitive dependencies. The docs say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If uv rejects a transitive URL dependency in either case, the best course of action is to provide the URL dependency as a direct dependency in the requirements.in file, rather than as a constraint, override, or transitive dependency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I interpreted this to mean that it is possible to install a package that has a dependency with a URL dependency (e.g. trying to install <code>A</code> from a repository that depends (non-URL) on <code>B</code> that has a URL dependency) by manually including the URL dependency in the <code>requirements.in</code> file alongside package <code>A</code>. But this does not work. So it's not clear to me if there is <em>any</em> way to install package <code>A</code> in this scenario.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>URL dependencies of URL dependencies are supported! But the following are not:</p>
<ol>
<li>URL dependencies of <em>registry</em> dependencies (i.e., a package on PyPI that itself depends on a URL dependency -- PyPI does not allow this anyway but your own custom registry might permit it).</li>
<li>URL dependencies of URL-based <em>constraints</em> (<code>--constraint</code>) or <em>overrides</em> (<code>--override</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The second is very rare but it's mentioned in the docs because it <em>is</em> possible for us to miss transitive URL dependencies if you provide the originating URL via a constraint or override. The documentation is intentionally nuanced for this reason but I can make it clearer.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Thanks a lot for clarifying! I'm struggling to understand the reasoning behind forbidding transitive URL dependencies for <em>registry</em> dependencies. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any documentation in related issues or docs regarding this conceptual design. Do you happen to have some further information on this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The most succinct explanation I can give is that we need to know the set of URLs upfront in order to fit them into the design of the resolver algorithm. So we recursively traverse any direct URL dependencies, resolving their own direct URL dependencies, etc. We can't do the same for registry dependencies, since we can't know what versions will be selected upfront and from which registry (unlike direct URLs, which tell us exactly where to find them).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we're relatively unlikely to support it. Are you depending on that behavior?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for your explanation. The rationale around the resolver algorithm helps me to get an intuition.</p>
<p>I don't strictly depend on this feature. We have a &quot;good-enough-workaround&quot; to convert the URL dependency into a proper <em>registry</em> dependency.</p>

<p>URL dependencies of URL dependencies are supported! But the following are not:
URL dependencies of registry dependencies (i.e., a package on PyPI that itself depends on a URL dependency -- PyPI does not allow this anyway but your own custom registry might permit it).</p>

<p>Thanks @charliermarsh, this is more clear than the (current) documentation and a helpful clarification (and does describe the situation I'm facing)!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>@mansenfranzen does your workaround cover the case of URL dependencies in a registry package? I'm not sure there is any way to handle this with <code>uv</code>, aside from creating a local fork of the registry package and manually changing the dependencies?</p>
