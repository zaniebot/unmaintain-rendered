# UV Behaving differently with administrator rights

---

_Issue opened by @MCRE-BE on 2025-06-13 06:36_

### Summary

uv behaves differently with `cmd` having administrator rights as without.
I would have expected that it can detect all the network drives regardless of the rights...

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

os.startfile(r"F:")
```

What happens if you just type "F:" in the command prompts? That should change the prompt from "C:\Users\..." to "F:". 

If that does not work for the admin user, then the admin user has not mounted the "F:" drive and this is not a uv issue.

Is that specific to uv, or does this happen with Python generally?

@m-ad  : You are indeed correct. F: does not seem to be mounted for admin. Strange, but maybe a company setting...

@konstin  : Fair point. Running the same command in a Conda environment (I don't have python system wide) raises the same issue.
I'll close as not related to UV specifically.
