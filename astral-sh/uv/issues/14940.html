            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>I am working on a project with C++ extensions that are built with <code>scikit-build-core</code>. To have proper editable installations, <a href="https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html#editable-installs">they recommend to use <code>--no-build-isolation</code></a>.</p>
<p>I have seen <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#build-isolation">in the uv docs</a> that this flag is properly supported for dependencies of your project, but nothing was mentioned on the <em>project itself</em>.</p>
<p>When trying to build it, it actually fails to build because uv doesn't pre-install the build dependencies.
I have put together a MRE in the <a href="https://github.com/tudoroancea/uv-build-isolation-current-project">following repo</a>.</p>
<h1>Current workaround</h1>
<p>Currently, the you have to preinstall the build dependencies yourself. You can create a dependency group <code>build</code> to simplify the procedure, and even add it to the default groups to avoid <code>uv sync</code> removing it. But either way, you have to duplicate the list between the <code>[dependency-groups]</code> table and <code>[build-system]</code> table since you cannot include a dependency group in the <code>build-system.requires</code>.</p>
<p>Please propose better workarounds if you have some.</p>
<h1>Question</h1>
<p>Is this expected behavior? Is there some limitation that I am not aware of? I would find it reasonable to expect <code>uv sync</code>/<code>uv run</code> to preinstall the build dependencies by themselves.</p>
<p>Thank you a lot for your help</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is expected. <code>--no-build-isolation</code> is sort of a hammer. Ideally, <code>scikit-build-core</code> would work without it.</p>
<p>fwiw, the documentation you link to says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you should preinstall your dependencies.</p>
