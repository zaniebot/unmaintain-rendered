Hi, I'm a big fan of uv! Thank you as always.</p>
<p>I have found the cause of this.
It seems that the tick of ResolverReporter is erasing the prompt for the git command.
Therefore, if this line is removed, no hang-up will occur.
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/ec8eee0fde0915e2e2cef3f19538856486cc144f/crates/uv/src/commands/reporters.rs#L323</p>
<p>Could you fix this?
If you don't have time, please point me in the right direction and I'll try to create a PR.
( I am not an expert in Rust, so this may take some time 😅 )</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">uv pip install &quot;git+https://github.com/typing/typing_extensions@main&quot;

<p>Note that the correct URL is https://github.com/python/typing_extensions. Without using the <code>--verbose</code> flag, I get the following output and it hangs forever:</p>

<p>I assume because the repo can't be found, <code>uv</code> delegates to the git CLI, and because the HTTPS URL was used, the git CLI will use HTTP auth (which is deprecated iirc, maybe it doesn't work anymore).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at the code and how to resolve this, I fear that an animated spinner is fundamentally incompatible with an interactive prompt. I suggest either removing the animation, or entirely replacing all interactive prompts with a failure. Either way, the current situation is a huge foot gun and source of confusion. (There may be a third solution of detecting interactive prompts and disabling the spinner only then, but that sounds like it would be a lot of work and very brittle)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is something I've ran into. It's not the ideal or common scenario but there are use cases for providing credentials interactively.</p>
<p><code>pip</code> does this well. <code>pipx</code> has the same problem as <code>uv</code> where the progress covers the prompt. I agree that disabling the prompt is better than appearing to hang, but it would be nice if an interactive prompt is at least possible with, for example, an <code>--interactive</code> option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An interactive prompt is still possible via git's SSH_ASKPASS configuration. uv does not need to bother handling these, as they start a UI element. I think there are other options for configuring git auth as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Confusingly, SSH_ASKPASS is not specific to SSH auth and can also prompt for basic HTTP auth. If no GUI is available, I recommend setting up a custom credentials-helper. I recently did this to pass the GitLab auth CI token into git via an environment variable</p>
<p>Of course it would be possible to have an option in uv to not set <code>GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0</code> while disabling the spinner animation, I'll leave this up to the uv devs to decide if such a feature would be worth its price</p>
