            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is more of a question:</p>
<p>We have a script that creates a copy of your venv (like a twin) and the special thing about this use case is that instead of installing <code>package_a, package_b, etc.</code> , we install <code>package_a==version_x, package_b==version_y, etc</code>. And because we have the full list, we can install them using <code>pip install --no-deps ...</code>. So, in this particular use case, we improved the speed of the creation of the twin by running pip in parallel, so that we install a group of packages in each parallel run. I tried to do this parallelization with <code>uv</code> but it looks like there's a lock, so there are no speed ups compared to unparalellized <code>uv</code>. Or is <code>uv</code> already smart enough out-of-the-box to do the parallelization itself given that we are using <code>--no-deps</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, uv already installs in parallel so there'd be no speed-up to (e.g.) splitting the packages in half and then running uv in a separate process for each subset. (This differs from pip, which does not perform a parallel install.) So, yes, uv should already be doing all the parallelization, and you shouldn't need to this package grouping.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Closing for now since you should just be able to do a single <code>uv pip install</code> here, but happy to answer any follow-up questions.)</p>
