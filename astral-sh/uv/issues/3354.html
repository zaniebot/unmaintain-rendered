            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, our resolver's state (managed across different calls to unit propagation) is tracked implicitly on the stack of our <code>solve</code> routine:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e33ff95575e8165078799548070210947d1cfad0/crates/uv-resolver/src/resolver/mod.rs#L288-L300</p>
<p>This state needs to get pushed out into its own type so that we can work with it more explicitly. For example, as part of #3350, we'll need to be able to fork the resolver and thus will need to be able to clone the state.</p>
