# Allow requested requirements to override base requirements in `uv run`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-04-17 19:03_

Following https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3101 we include the project requirements as a base, any requested requirements should replace those in the base project if duplicated instead of throwing an error.
