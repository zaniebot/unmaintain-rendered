            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Got it to compile on Nix (was a pain because of <code>openssl-sys</code> :) ). Now the problem is the venv being constructed with symlinks instead of copies. Would it make sense to have a <code>--copies</code>/<code>--symlinks</code> <em>a la</em> <code>venv</code>? Or symlink the core installation and write installed packages to the venv instead of the system directory?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am mounting my home directory to devcontainer to reuse my user configs, and I have a venv dedicated for my user. Without <code>--copies</code> to create a self contained venv, the user-wide venv may not find the python through the symlink, or symlinked to different version in the devcontainer.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're now supporting <code>uv venv --link-mode copy</code>, which will copy the installed packages, even though we're still symlinking the python interpreter.</p>

<p>I'm trying to resolve an issue where <code>.venv</code> in subfolders are not aromatically detected by vscode and saw that comment https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/14592#issuecomment-895945452</p>
<p>I'm not sure this is the source of my issue, but I wanted to try a copy with the interpreter included</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I used uv to bootstrap python for an old embedded armv7 platform that had no python3 or package manager. My goal was to create a venv folder that was portable enough such that I could deploy it to this platform multiple times without internet or needing the uv binary installed.</p>
<p>I tried forcing it by copying the interpreter into my venv folder but it seemed like some libraries were still linked or missing. I eventually set my <code>UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR</code> to install in my project directory and created a new venv so it looked like this</p>
<pre><code>project_dir
|- cpython-3.12.7-linux-armv7-gnueabihf/
|- venv/
|- my_python_script.py
</code></pre>
<p>This is the closest I could get to a portable project when bootstrapping with <code>uv</code>. If it's possible to build a venv that has copies of the interpreter and its libraries together I would be forced to sing uv's praises from the mountaintops.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If copied, would the interpreter binary function on its own without the rest of the files in an installation?</p>
<p>This would be an enabler for creating layouts. More on those here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11746</p>
