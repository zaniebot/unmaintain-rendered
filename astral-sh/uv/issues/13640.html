            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, there's some work in Debian itself to package a version of uv. It looks like it's making progress, but at the moment Debian is frozen in preparation for their release so this work probably won't pick up until later this summer (meaning it won't be in a Debian release until two years from now, though it might end up available through backports, and it could potentially be in Ubuntu 25.10). See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1069776</p>
<p>On the other hand, the version in Debian and Ubuntu will likely be quite a bit behind what you can get through the Astral website.</p>

<p>cargo binstall could work with uv, we provide binaries in the GitHub releases page. If cargo binstall extends its parser to read our format (I assume it doesn't recognize the <code>uv-</code> prefix), it can be used with uv.</p>

<pre><code>dl=&quot;$(python3 -u -c 'import hashlib,tempfile,urllib.request;r=urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/source.tar.gz&quot;).read();t=tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False);t.write(r);print(t.name);print(hashlib.sha256(r).hexdigest())')&quot; ;  # Download the latest uv release into the system temporary folder, print temporary filename and hash
hsh=&quot;$(python3 -u -c 'from urllib.request import urlopen;print(urlopen(&quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/source.tar.gz.sha256&quot;).read().decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;).split(maxsplit=1)[0])')&quot; ;  # Download the upstream SHA-256 hash

else exit 1 ;  # Exit code 1 if upstream hash does not match downloaded hash
fi ;
</code></pre>
<p>Or a Bash one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>bash -c 'dl=&quot;$(python3 -u -c '\''import hashlib,tempfile,urllib.request;r=urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/source.tar.gz&quot;).read();t=tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False);t.write(r);print(t.name);print(hashlib.sha256(r).hexdigest())'\'')&quot; ; hsh=&quot;$(python3 -u -c '\''from urllib.request import urlopen;print(urlopen(&quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/source.tar.gz.sha256&quot;).read().decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;).split(maxsplit=1)[0])'\'')&quot; ; if [[ &quot;$dl&quot; == *&quot;$hsh&quot;* ]] ; then tmpy=&quot;$(mktemp -d)&quot; ; IFS='\'' '\'' read -r -a words &lt;&lt;&lt; $dl ; tar -zxf &quot;${words[0]}&quot; -C $tmpy ; cargo binstall -y --manifest-path=&quot;$tmpy/$(ls $tmpy)&quot; uv ; else exit 1 ; fi ;'

<p>It does basic SHA-256 verification with the hash given upstream.</p>

<p>@konstin and I are maintainers of pubgrub too, we can look into upstreaming the differences — though, given how tightly integrated pubgrub is in uv, it might be not be plausible for us to upstream all of our specific needs so we might need to publish the fork or vendor it as a <code>uv-pubgrub</code> crate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One other thing we may want to keep in mind is that there's an Ubuntu LTS coming up relatively soon (on the timescales of getting packages into distros) and it will be supported for a long time (on the timescales of wanting to support software). Specifically, judging from the current release and the last LTS, the cutoff for automated imports from Debian <em>unstable</em> to Ubuntu 26.04 is likely to be February 2026, and then that will be the uv version you get out of a supported Ubuntu release for 5+ years. So if we manage to get a package into Debian before February, it would be nice if it's something we're relatively comfortable with people having for a pretty long time. (Of course Ubuntu's schedules have no formal veto over what Debian has in its archive, and it's possible to go to the Ubuntu folks and say &quot;uh that thing you snapshotted from Debian isn't long-term supportable, can I convince you not to ship it / can you ship this version instead,&quot; but it's easier for everyone if you don't have to do that.)</p>
<p>On the Debian side, a release just came out in August and they come out every 2 years, so we have until early 2027 to find a version that we're comfortable with Debian users having for a long while (though the normal support cycle is 3 years, not quite as long as an Ubuntu LTS).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While we generally make upstream PRs for our changes, our remaining Git dependencies are either because we made significant changes to the library (pubgrub, asnyc-zip), or because upstream didn't react to our PRs (reqwest-middleware, tl).</p>
<p>For pubgrub specifically, we upstream most of our changes, but we're using an entirely different internal API we've added over <code>DependencyProvider</code>. CC @eh2406 re upstreaming this interface.</p>

<p>Is there something that makes pubgrub special? We can publish pubgrub to crates.io as astral-pubgrub, but we have other Git dependencies too, usually because upstream is unmaintained, sometimes only for one or two releases because we needed to fix something faster than upstream didn't react. I checked <code>Cargo.toml</code> and our current list of Git dependencies is:</p>
<ul>
<li>async_zip</li>
<li>pubgrub and version-ranges</li>
<li>reqwest-middleware and reqwest-retry</li>
<li>tl</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd ideally want to avoid re-publishing all of those to crates.io, especially because we don't intend those forks to be used by others.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, all the other Git dependencies will be equally problematic.</p>
<p>I have asked more experienced Debian contributors what my options are to deal with those, and we have identified the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>upstreaming the changes of those dependencies to the original crates (I trust you that it's hard or not desired in the cases that you have)</li>
<li>convincing you to upload them to crates.io (which I understand you are reluctant to)</li>
<li>convincing you to vendor them as internal crates in your workspace, as <code>uv-pubgrub</code> and so on, or as modules in some of your existing internal crates</li>
<li>me maintaining forks of your forks, that I upload to crates.io myself. When packaging <code>uv</code> I would then patch it to point to my crates instead of the git dependencies</li>
<li>vendoring the dependencies inside uv as part of the Debian packaging, using the <code>debian/missing-sources</code> mechanism, or &quot;extra packages&quot; (which I am yet to understand). I am not familiar with this approach, which probably comes at a greater risk that the &quot;ftp masters&quot; reject the upload when reviewing it. Given that such reviews take many months at the moment, I'm reluctant to bet on this (a rejection would likely delay the packaging by nearly a year, because of the times needed for a review of the new uploads of the forks and of uv itself).</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's difficult to find any Debian package written in Rust whose upstream has git dependencies, because most Rust tools are uploaded to crates.io, and crates.io enforces that all dependencies of the crate are also fetched from crates.io.</p>
<p>It looks like it could be possible for the Debian packager (say, me) to vendor those dependencies as part of the Debian packaging process (say, using <code>debian/missing-sources</code>), assuming we have good justifications for why they shouldn't be packaged separately. This could apparently be sufficient to convince the ftp masters to approve the package. For that, I would need a statement from your side on the status of each of those crates, explaining why it wouldn't make sense to package them separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, that could perhaps work. That being said (and apologies for being a bit stubborn with that), I see that there are apparently <a href="https://crates.io/crates/uv">interest to make <code>uv</code> installable from <code>crates.io</code></a>. Those git deps will also be a blocker for that, so I still think it would be worth tackling this issue directly. As far as I know, uploading a crate to crates.io doesn't come with a particular commitment to supporting third-party uses compared to just having it as a public GitHub repo. A disclaimer added to the docs of the crate, explaining your intentions, would probably go a long way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand why it's not preferred but if these could be uploaded to crates.io with a disclaimer as suggested by @wetneb this would simplify things a lot for downstream OS packagers. Having a single source for these seems more sensible than various OS packagers dealing with it themselves in various different ways.</p>
<p>As some other projects are starting to use uv as a build backend (e.g. https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/13137) it's getting more important to have native OS packages. That particular example is easily worked-around for now where needed, but that won't always be the case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, I have looked into it and didn't find any blocker yet. I'm focusing on packaging <code>uv_build</code> first, so it can be used as a build backend, without the full <code>uv</code> CLI yet (as this will hopefully help with Debian packaging of Python software, and has almost all of its dependencies packaged for Debian already). Progress for that is tracked <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1115616">here</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to get involved, there are about 20 Rust crates that need packaging to be able to package the full CLI. The process for those crates is documented in the <a href="https://rust-team.pages.debian.net/book/">Rust team book</a>.</p>
