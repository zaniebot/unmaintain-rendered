Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

</ul>
<p>I have a package published to AWS Code Artifact that has a <code>pyproject.toml</code> that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-system]
requires = [
    &quot;setuptools&quot;,
    &quot;wheel&quot;,
]

# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/
[project]
name = &quot;my_package&quot;
dynamic = [&quot;version&quot;]
dependencies = [
    &quot;transformers[torch] @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@1f33023cfa998c237372baff36b166c014f33405#egg=transformers&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>When I try to install it, I get the same error as in the 2 linked issues:</p>
<pre><code>error: Package `transformers` attempted to resolve via URL: git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@1f33023cfa998c237372baff36b166c014f33405#egg=transformers. URL dependencies must be expressed as direct requirements or constraints. Consider adding `transformers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers@1f33023cfa998c237372baff36b166c014f33405#egg=transformers` to your dependencies or constraints file.
</code></pre>
<p><code>pip</code> is able to install it though.</p>
<p>I would try to publish a package like this to PyPI as a MRE, but I think PyPI specifically forbids publishing packages with direct links.</p>
<p>So, similar to the recursive dependency in #4152, is there another case not being considered here? As in when the link is coming from the package you are trying to install.</p>
