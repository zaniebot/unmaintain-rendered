            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>i don't have much space left on my hard drive, and i've noticed that uv's cache seems to be quite large (20-40gb) so i have to manually clear it every so often.</p>
<p>possible solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>when running any uv command that interacts with the cache, detect if the disk is almost full and/or if the cache directory is very large, then either automatically clean it up, or print a warning that suggests the user cleans it themselves by running <code>uv cache clean</code> or <code>uv cache prune</code></li>
<li>limit the amount of cache that's stored relative to the amount of available disk space</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
