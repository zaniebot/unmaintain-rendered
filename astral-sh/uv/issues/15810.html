            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When using VCS-based dependency specifications, <code>uv lock --dry-run -P [package]</code> reports a misleading &quot;No lockfile changes detected&quot; while <code>uv lock -P [package]</code> does change the lockfile to reference the latest commit hash.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I have a project dependency which is a git-based package, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
dependencies = [
    &quot;mypackage @ git+https://github.com/username/mypackage&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>The lock file is currently locked to a old commit, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>[[package]]
name = &quot;mypackage&quot;
version = &quot;0.0.1&quot;
source = { git = &quot;https://github.com/username/mypackage#123456&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>I want to run <code>uv lock --dry-run -P mypackage</code> to verify that it will pull in the latest commit. When I do, I receive the following output:</p>
<pre><code>uv lock --dry-run -P mypackage
    Updated https://github.com/username/mypackage (abcdef...)
Resolved X packages in Ys
No lockfile changes detected
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I run without <code>--dry-run</code>, the lock file does in fact update and reference the new commit.</p>
<p>It should be noted that I haven't done anything to change the version of &quot;mypackage&quot; between these two commits. However, I would expect that VCS-based dependencies are locked based on a commit hash rather than version number.</p>
<p>The message that &quot;No lockfile changes detected&quot; is misleading here. I would interpret that to mean the lock file would not change at all with a regular run.</p>
<h2>Expected Output</h2>
<pre><code>$ uv lock --dry-run -P mypackage
    Updated https://github.com/username/mypackage (abcdef...)
Resolved X packages in Ys
Update mypackage v0.0.1 (123456) -&gt; v0.0.1 (abcdef)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is because the <code>--dry-run</code> changelog only logs based on package version (and the actual package version didn't change). We can add a commit SHA to it, I think.</p>
