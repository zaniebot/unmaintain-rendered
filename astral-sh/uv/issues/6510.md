# `uv init` should prompt for directory

---

_Issue opened by @kdheepak on 2024-08-23 12:59_

I accidentally run `uv init` in my `~/projects` folder assuming it would prompt me for the directory and it created `~/projects/src`, `~/projects/README.md`, `~/projects/pyproject.toml`. I would prefer if it prompted for a directory with the default as `.` so that a user can hit enter to get the same behaviour as current exists OR type in a folder. IMO, this makes it behave similarly to `uv init new-project` and is more intuitive behaviour.

An interactive prompt does sound nice, but I also run this command all the time and like that it just does what I want. Hm.

Maybe `uv` can skip the prompt if it is an empty folder? But if any files exist, `uv init` would prompt to ask if you mean to create files in the current folder?

Alternatively, printing out the full paths to the files that are created would make the user experience nicer and would allow the user to go back and clean up files they accidentally created in a different folder.

I just accidentally ran `uv init` in a non empty directory (my `~/src` directory), and then had to manually figure out which files were created so I could delete them (which was quite a few files/directories: `.git/`, `.gitignore`, `.python-version`, `hello.py`, `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`).

If this command were more easily reversible then I wouldn't mind favouring reducing friction over risk of doing the wrong thing. (A bit like how eg GMail doesn't prompt when deleting an email, but instead shows an "undo" link afterwards to mitigate accidental usage. However, I don't think that pattern can easily be applied here.)

I do like the idea of having `uv init` give a "Do you want to initialize a project in the current directory (y/n)?" prompt when no arguments were passed to `uv init` and when the directory isn't empty - this seems like a reasonable compromise between friction and preventing unintended usage?

(The prompt could always have "yes" as the default option, that way users could `uv init` and immediately hit enter to init for less friction. Or such users could use `uv init .` to skip the prompt entirely.)
