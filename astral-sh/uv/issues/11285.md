# Treat `-p` in `uv pip compile` as `--python` and fallback to `--python-version`

Right now, `-p` in `uv pip compile` is an alias for `--python-version` instead of `--python` which means it does not accept things like `pypy@3.10` — this is different than the entire rest of our CLI and is blocking things like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3889
