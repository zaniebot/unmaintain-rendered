            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I was wondering how to do &quot;correctly&quot; uv and caching.</p>
<p>I was very happy to already find so much documentation already dedicated to that (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#caching-in-continuous-integration, https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/)
Thank you for that 🙏</p>
<p>I am thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With uv, it turns out that it&#x27;s often faster to omit pre-built wheels from the cache (and instead re-download them from the registry on each run). On the other hand, caching wheels that are built from source tends to be worthwhile, since the wheel building process can be expensive, especially for extension modules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any data for that? It is not necessarily a no-faith - but it is always nice to have visible results ✌️</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> # GitLab CI creates a separate mountpoint for the build directory,
 # so we need to copy instead of using hard links.
 UV_LINK_MODE: copy
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn&#x27;t this something that uv can detect itself?</p>
<p>If default is <em><code>auto</code></em> (<code>cow</code> on MacOS, <code>hardling</code> rest), and <em>hardlinking</em> fails - shouldn&#x27;t uv be able to fall back automatically selecting the next-best option that works and continue with that mode for the rest of the run?</p>
<p>If <code>UV_LINK_MODE</code> is hardcoded to something, then ofc it should fail and NOT fall back to anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>...
  cache:
    - key:
        files:
          - uv.lock
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it worth to throw away the whole cache, for just a minuscule dependency change?</p>
<p>I get it that it is saner - but I was wondering if someone &quot;compared it&quot; with e.g. heavy dependabot usage.</p>

<p>We don&#x27;t have anything to share here. We benchmarked it initially, but it&#x27;s not something we&#x27;re continuously benchmarking to publish data for.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We do fallback to copying on hardlink failures, but it emits a warning. Changing the mode silences the warning.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On GitHub, we do</p>
<pre><code>          key: uv-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(&#x27;uv.lock&#x27;) }}
          restore-keys: |
            uv-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(&#x27;uv.lock&#x27;) }}
            uv-${{ runner.os }}
</code></pre>
<p>so we&#x27;ll fallback on inexact matches.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the GitLab equivalent is — that integration guide is user contributed. Happy to change it if there&#x27;s something better!</p>

<p>My question is &quot;is it worth it or not&quot; (in cache metrics: speed, network, etc)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not quite sure what you&#x27;re saying there. My point is that the GitLab documentation seems less than ideal.</p>
<p>It seems like https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/caching/#per-cache-fallback-keys should be added</p>

<p>😅</p>
<p>I guess I&#x27;ll try my hands on fallback-keys 🤝</p>
