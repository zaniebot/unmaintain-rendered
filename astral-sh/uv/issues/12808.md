# How can my company host python distributions?

_Issue opened by @s-banach on 2025-04-10 14:01_

### Question

Our EC2 instances have no internet access. They can only install files hosted the internal Sonatype Nexus. Right now, our Nexus has some files like `python-3.xx.xx-xxxxxxxx_x_cpython.conda`, and we can use miniconda to create environments.

If I wanted to push people in the company to host uv-compatible python versions in Nexus, how would it work? How would we configure uv to look in Nexus for installable python versions?

### Platform

_No response_

### Version
