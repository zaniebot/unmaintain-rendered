            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've been using uv and really enjoy it, but I've noticed a missing feature that other package managers like pdm provide: a command to install all the dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml file.</p>
<p>When I clone a project, the first step is usually installing all dependencies. With pdm, for example, I can simply run <code>pdm install</code>, and it automatically creates a virtual environment and installs all the required dependencies. Additionally, this can be filtered to install only specific types of dependencies (e.g., production, dev).</p>
<p>I was expecting a similar feature in uv, but I couldn't find a way to install all dependencies directly from the pyproject.toml file. Having such a command would make project setup much easier and faster.</p>
<p>I think adding this command would improve the user experience for managing dependencies in projects.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering this!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I believed so when reading the documentation. But after some tries I didn't manage to make it work as I expected, thus I open the issue.</p>
<p>Maybe I am using it wrong, this is what I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clone a one of repositories that was setup with uv and had some dependencies:</p>
  <details><summary>Current pyproject.toml file here</summary>

<pre><code class="language-text">  [project]
  name = &quot;python-template&quot;
  version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
  description = &quot;Python template for projects&quot;
  readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
  requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
  dependencies = []

  [dependency-groups]
  test = [
      &quot;coverage&gt;=7.6.9&quot;,
      &quot;doublex&gt;=1.9.6.1&quot;,
      &quot;doublex-expects&gt;=0.7.1&quot;,
      &quot;expects&gt;=0.9.0&quot;,
      &quot;pytest&gt;=8.3.4&quot;,
      &quot;pytest-watch&gt;=4.2.0&quot;,
      &quot;pytest-xdist&gt;=3.6.1&quot;,
  ]
  lint = [
      &quot;mypy&gt;=1.13.0&quot;,
      &quot;ruff&gt;=0.8.3&quot;,
      &quot;yapf&gt;=0.43.0&quot;,
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Go to the folder in my terminal, no .venv folder is yet created</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run <code>uv sync</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>The virtual environment gets created, but no dependencies are install</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@j178 thanks for the help, that tag fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Turns out that with the version I was using that command didn't exist and had to upgrade uv 👍</p>
