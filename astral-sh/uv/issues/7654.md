# Install uv for all users on Linux

---

_Issue opened by @bolinocroustibat on 2024-09-24 08:14_

- Platform: Linux and/or MacOS
- uv version: 0.4.15

When installing uv with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, it puts the executables in a `~/.cargo/` directory under current user's home directory, which is loaded by the current user's shell.
Therefore, no other users can use uv unless they install it.

Is there a simple way to install user for all users?
Wouldn't that be useful for the install script to ask if it needs to be installed for the current user or for all users?

@bolinocroustibat 

this is my current solution using a justfile  (see https://just.systems/man/en/)
by manipulating env-vars CARGO_HOME and HOME

```
BIN_DIR := env('BIN_DIR', '/opt/bin')

CARGO_HOME := env('CARGO_HOME', '/opt/cargo')

CURL_FLAGS := env("CURL_FLAGS", "--create-dirs --fail --location --no-progress-bar --show-error")

# install uv/uvx directly in /opt/bin
export UV_INSTALL_DIR := parent_directory(BIN_DIR)


# install uv/uvx systemwide in $BIN_DIR
uv-install: 
    curl {{CURL_FLAGS}} --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | HOME={{CARGO_HOME}} bash -s -- --verbose --no-modify-path

alias install-uv := uv-install

# update uv to specific version or latest release
uv-update target_version="":
    HOME={{CARGO_HOME}} uv self update {{target_version}}

alias update-uv := uv-update

```

Does setting `UV_INSTALL_DIR` directly not work? As in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#configuring-installation.

@charliermarsh 

UV_INSTALL_DIR works great for the executables, 
but the receipt is still hardcoded to go to ~/.config/uv  (which was a problem for my usecase) 

rye has RYE_HOME,  
poetry has POETRY_HOME, 
pipx has PIPX_HOME, 
ansible has ANSIBLE_HOME,....

so why not UV_HOME (or UV_CONFIG_HOME)  to be able to override the hardcoded location?

@charliermarsh 

Thanks, sorry I should have better RTFM, indeed `UV_INSTALL_DIR` works fine.

Although I would suggest that the installer would optionally automate the process and use a hardcoded install path for all users (`/usr/local/bin/uv` for example), as many users like myself might not be proficient enough in sysadmin to choose the right location in a Linux system for this.

There's also now `UV_UNMANAGED_INSTALL`

> as many users like myself might not be proficient enough in sysadmin to choose the right location in a Linux system for this.

I don't think it's feasible for us to choose a proper path either, that stuff differs per Linux distribution.

Now documented here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/installer/#changing-the-install-path
