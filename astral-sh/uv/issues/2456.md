<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
## Description
I was installing `onnx` and saw this error:
`cmake not in path` which I got around by installing cmake: `brew install cmake` but was curious why it's required to be built from source? Unsure if this is a `uv` issue or just that `onnx` on pypi hasn't shipped the built version for macos. 

## Reproduce
On an M1/2/3 Mac, run
```
uv pip install onnx
```

## My system

```
uv --version
uv 0.1.16 (9f1452cb7 2024-03-07)
python --version
Python 3.12.2
```

Hi! `pip` builds this from source too — at https://pypi.org/simple/onnx/ you can see they don't publish Python 3.12 wheels.
