            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>--constraint</code> and <code>--override</code> flags should be updated to allow single constraints (in addition to the current behavior of accepting a file path), e.g., <code>--constraint &quot;foo&gt;=0.1&quot;</code>. In the <code>--constraint</code> case, this is mostly unambiguous — if there's a version specifier then we can treat it as a constraint. It is possible to have a file with that name, but it seems very unlikely in practice. In the <code>--override</code> case, we do allow overriding a dependency to have <em>no</em> specifiers, e.g., <code>--override foo</code>. I'm not sure if we should allow this via this interface? It seems nice to avoid the ambiguity. Historically, we've avoided inspecting the file system to determine the behavior of arguments and I think that is a good goal to maintain.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This proposal applies to both the <code>uv pip</code> interface (though it would differ from the upstream) and top-level interface (where <code>--constraint</code> and <code>--override</code> is only implemented for <code>uv tool install</code> at the moment but should be added elsewhere)</p>

<p>You could always check for a file first and then fall back to see if it's a valid version specifier (that includes an operator, e.g. <code>foo&gt;=0.1</code> not just <code>foo</code>).</p>

<p>This is the behavior we have historically avoided. We don't want the CLI behavior to change based on the state of the file system.</p>

<p>Okay but <code>constraints.txt</code> is a valid requirement 😉.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from packaging.requirements import Requirement
&gt;&gt;&gt; Requirement('constraints.txt')
&lt;Requirement('constraints.txt')&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And that is likely to be the name of a file, so I guess document this carefully on what the boundary conditions are between choosing a file or a requirement.</p>

<p>Yeah so that's why I said we'd require a version specifier. A constraint without a version specifier doesn't do anything.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb -- Just noticed one problem here... The values are technically space-delimited, so you can do <code>UV_CONSTRAINTS=&quot;file1 file2&quot;</code> etc. That was initially for pip compatibility. But if they're space-delimited, it becomes much harder to do this... Not impossible, but definitely harder.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alas. I'm not sure what to do about that.</p>
<p>As a minor note, it's <code>UV_CONSTRAINT</code>.</p>
<p>One alternative option: we could align on the name in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>, which would be <code>--dependency-constraint</code> and <code>--dependency-override</code>. I don't love the setting name though (I find it non-obvious).</p>
