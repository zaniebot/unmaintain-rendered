# Warn when project defines a `requires-python` that pins to a `.0` patch version

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-09-16 13:38_

As described in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7352#issuecomment-2352928006

If the user defines a Python requirement of `==3.12` this means `==3.12.0` which I don't think anyone really wants. We should suggest using `==3.12.*` instead?

Similarly, it may be worth warning about `~=X.Y` too (since it's confusingly not the same as `~=X.Y.0`), xref #7682.

Looking to get started on uv, I can take a look at this if no one has had a chance to tackle it yet.

It seems the linked PR hasn't been updated in a while. Is this something that we would like to warn on? If so, happy to take this.
