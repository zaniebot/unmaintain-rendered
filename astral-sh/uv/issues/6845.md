# Bad inline suggestion for requirements.txt

---

_Issue opened by @dimaqq on 2024-08-30 00:37_

So I didn't read `--help` / usage, and tried this:

```command
> uvx --with requirements.txt tox --help
? `requirements.txt` looks like a local requirements file but was passed as a package name. Did you mean `-r requirements.txt`? [y/n] › yes
```

However, neither `uvx -r req...` nor `uvx --with -r req...` do what's intended.

Instead, the correct flag is `uvx --with-requirements req...`
