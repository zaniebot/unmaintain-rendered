Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hi, thanks for this wonderful tool !
I noticed that when building packages from source, either locally or from downloaded tarballs, reports build time is bundled in download time, which is somewhat misleading. I think it'd be more correct (and informative) to show time spent building sources separately, especially because it's usually much longer than resolution/download/install and that uv is not actually doing the heavy lifting there.
To illustrate what I mean, here's what happens if I run <code>uv pip install yt --no-binary yt</code> in a fresh env</p>
<pre><code>Resolved 39 packages in 690ms
   Built yt==4.3.1
Downloaded 1 package in 33.49s
Installed 39 packages in 220ms
...
</code></pre>
<p>almost all the time is spent waiting for compilers and linkers (~33s), but it's still included in &quot;downloaded&quot;.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this is the message you see as the package is being built (downloading itself takes a couple seconds at most)

<p>Furthermore, if I instead clone https://github/yt-project/yt.git and install locally (<code>uv pip install -e .</code>), I <em>still</em> see build time being included in &quot;download&quot; time, which in this context seems plain wrong</p>
<pre><code>Resolved 47 packages in 389ms
   Built yt @ file:///Users/clm/dev/yt-project/yt
Downloaded 10 packages in 25.44s
Installed 47 packages in 153ms
...

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It isn’t really “possible” to fix this because we don’t download-then-build in discrete phases. We download and build in parallel across all packages. So while some packages are being downloaded, others are being built.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can use a more generic term, but conceptually we can’t report separate phases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah the concurrent pipelining was my concern regarding feasibility. We could track the separate total times but I don't know we'd report it in a coherent way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for clarifying that the built/download phase is conccurent, this wasn't obvious to me.
Since I'm having trouble coming up with a more generic term, how about something like this ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm thinking it could also be nice to report how long each package took to build</p>
<pre><code>   Built yt==4.3.1 in xxx s 
</code></pre>
<p>Although that might make it confusing since all other reported times are wall times, but this one would be CPU time (I think ?).</p>
