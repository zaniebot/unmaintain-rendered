# Noob Here, What Does Your Python Setup Look Like With UV?

_Issue opened by @Maple38 on 2025-04-17 10:53_

### Question

Hi all, I'm a Python beginner and I am very confused about how exactly Python should be set up. Before UV, I just had a main Python installation that I was using everywhere, along with a couple of virtual environments when needed. I know that having a venv for each project is a good thing, that's something I think I understand. 

Previously, I would just create a new environment for things I consider an actual project, but if it's something small, or just a quick script, I would use my default installation. I would usually keep this up to date, and install packages to it if I needed them.

But after doing a ton of research about setting up Python with UV, I'm at a bit of a loss. It looks like having a "main Python installation" as I used to, and installing packages to it, is not recommended. So it seems to me like I need to create a new venv for everything I do, or just use a stock Python installation. I also had the idea of creating a main venv and just adding its bin to my path, but I'd rather not do anything convoluted or seen as a "workaround" right now.

So my question is, what do your setups look like? I'd like to learn here, so if you'd like to leave a detailed answer I would greatly appreciate it.

### Platform

MacOS Sequoia 15.3.2, Darwin 24.3.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.6.14 (a4cec56dc 2025-04-09)

I would recommend using `uv init --script <path> ` and `uv add --script <path> <dependency>` for script dependencies and `uv init` / `uv add <dependency` for multifile projects. A global, mutable environment leads to a fair number of problems and if you just specify your dependencies where you need them, you should have an easier time running things when you come back to them in the future.

If you really want a set of shared dependencies, I'd maybe do `uv init ~/shared` then `uv add --project ~/shared httpx pandas` then you can do:

```
❯ uv init foo
❯ cd foo
❯ uv add ~/shared
```

etc.

So if I'm understanding this correctly, essentially, UV handles dependencies differently from regular Python, and rather than adding them to the Python installation, they're downloaded elsewhere and loaded on demand when needed?
