# Support 3.14-dev and 3.14t-dev in `python-version`

_Issue opened by @ngoldbaum on 2025-04-17 16:01_

Right now I get a failure like this if I try to use either:

```
Set UV_PYTHON to 3.14-dev
Activating python venv...
Error: The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/uv/0.6.14/x86_64/uv' failed with exit code 1
```

Thank you for reporting this. I am really grateful that you are always using the latest features and help make this action better for everyone!

I am looking into it, might take me a bit longer over the Easter weekend.

No rush!

This fails with `No interpreter found for executable name `3.14-dev` in managed installations or search path`.

astral-sh/setup-uv#375 will enable printing the error message by default so we get more info in the future.

@zanieb @charliermarsh can you please transfer that issue to `astral-sh/uv` so we can discuss there why (or if) 3.14-dev is not supported?

Yeah, we don't support `3.14-dev`, that's not an official syntax is it? You can use `3.14` directly?

`-dev` is how you'd get pre-releases using https://github.com/actions/setup-python#supported-version-syntax for the longest time. But they have added a [`allow-prereleases`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#allow-pre-releases) flag in https://github.com/actions/setup-python/releases/tag/v4.6.0 in 2023.

So workflows that need both uv, setup-python and a pre-release (like this one: https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit/pull/323/files#diff-52c8399fb1fedace4e7afc3557e43f6cf119f8d73f0853bddec2b79d0ed585ccR90-R103) can still work together with a single matrix number. (it's also nice for mypy that wouldn't understand 3.14-dev)
