# Add `excluded-dependencies` support

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-04-02 01:38_

We support this now by setting an impossible marker, e.g., `override-dependencies = ["package; sys_platform = "never"]` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#override-dependencies). We should add a dedicated option, e.g., `excluded-dependencies = ["package"]`. Unlike `--no-install-package`, this omits the whole dependency tree. We should add a dedicated option, as this is fairly bespoke.

This is literally what I requested in issue #7214, so I'll just mention it so it can be referenced.

This should be fairly easy to add, if someone is interested.
