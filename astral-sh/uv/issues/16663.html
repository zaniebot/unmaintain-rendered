            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using uv 0.9.8.</p>
<p>Suppose I have three packages, which I'll call <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. In their respective pyproject.toml's , there is a dependency chain <code>c -&gt; b -&gt; a</code>.</p>
<p>Assume that I have local versions of each of these packages in some directory. Within <code>c</code> I can do either:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv run --with-editable ../b python ...
$ uv run --with-editable ../a python ...
</code></pre>
<p>and this works as expected.</p>
<p>However, I run into a problem if trying to use local versions of both of them simultaneously:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv run --with-editable ../b --with-editable ../a python ...
  × Failed to resolve dependencies for `b` (v0.1.0)
  ╰─▶ Requirements contain conflicting URLs for package `a`:
      - file:///path/to/a (editable)
      - git+https://github.com/OuOrg/a.git@shashashashasha
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>In the above, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are private packages within our organisation, with dependencies encoded via git SHAs. But I suspect I could construct a reproducible example using pypi packages -- let me know if this would be useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>--with-editable</code> entries get resolved together, and <code>../a</code> does conflict with the declared Git dependency. I'm not certain how we should handle this. I think you'd need to use overrides?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The behaviour - very roughly - I expected, was something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>collect a set of paths given from <code>--with-editable</code> arguments</li>
<li>each path should correspond to a particular package; so we get a set of packages</li>
<li>then when we resolve, every time we come across a package that's in this 'special set' of packages, we ignore the dependency and use the editable one</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Just to justify why the behaviour above would be useful: sometimes we need to make a change in both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> simultaneously, and then test that it has the desired impact in <code>c</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do need some better support for replacing URL dependencies with local checkouts, we lacking a notion of priorities in URL, where e.g. a CLI override URL can replace a transitive URL. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#override-dependencies for the workaround with overrides.</p>
