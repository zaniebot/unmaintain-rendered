# Difference between the Editable Mode of uv sync and uv pip install -e .

_Issue opened by @lmanc on 2025-02-27 19:43_

### Question

I assume I might have a fundamental misconception, but according to the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#editable-mode), `uv sync` always installs in editable mode. However, when using `uv sync`, I don’t see the project installed locally as I do with `uv pip install -e .`.

If I run `uv pip install -e .` in a `.venv` where the project's package is not yet in editable mode:

```
uv pip install -e .
Resolved 37 packages in 309ms
Installed 1 package in 15ms
 + <project_name>==0.1.0 (from <project_path>)
```

Then, if I execute `uv sync` afterward:

```
uv sync
Resolved 45 packages in 1ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 1ms
 - <project_name>==0.1.0 (from <project_path>)
```

Looking at the help documentation for `uv sync`, I see:

```
      --no-editable                              Install any editable dependencies, including the project and any workspace members, as non-editable
```

For `uv pip install`, it states:

```
  -e, --editable <EDITABLE>                    Install the editable package based on the provided local file path
```

So, it seems that they refer to two different concepts.

1, Yet I don’t understand why they share the same name.
2.. Also, is there an equivalent of `uv pip install -e .` within `uv sync`?

### Platform

Can you make sure you have a `build-system` defined in the project? We omit the project itself in `uv sync` if it lacks a `build-system`.

See: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#build-systems

Thank you, I didn't know that, that makes sense.

I was just playing around with `uv` as a way to improve my understanding of some packaging related concepts, and really couldn't wrap my head around this.

In the paragraph you linked there's this note

> While `uv` will not build and install the current project without a build system definition, the presence of a `[build-system]` table is not required in other packages. For legacy reasons, if a build system is not defined, then `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__` is used to build the package. Packages you depend on may not explicitly declare their build system but are still installable. Similarly, if you add a dependency on a local package or install it with `uv pip`, `uv` will always attempt to build and install it.

Here I understand that `uv` needs a `[build-system]` in order to install the project, but it can still build dependency packages using the legacy `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__`, even if dependency packages doesn't declare a `[build-system]`.

But why `uv pip install -e` . doesn't require a `build-system` to be specified?

Yeah, you can build and install a project without a build system by falling back to setuptools. It's just a decision we made _not_ to do that in the "project APIs" (`uv run`, `uv sync`, `uv lock`, etc.), whereas in the `uv pip` APIs, we follow pip's behavior.

(Hopefully that helps; happy to answer questions.)
