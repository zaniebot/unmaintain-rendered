`uv pip install -e .` ?

That installs in editable mode, but sometimes I want a "snapshot" of the current version.

👍 I believe this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/313. We actually do support `uv pip install "foo @ ."` where `foo` is the package name -- internally, we just have various codepaths that rely on having a package name upfront. But we'll remove that restriction in the future.

(Closing to merge into #313.)

This is supported as of `v0.1.24`. You can `uv pip install .` directly, without including a package name.
