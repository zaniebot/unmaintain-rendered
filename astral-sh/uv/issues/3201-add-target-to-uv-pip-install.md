# Add --target to uv pip install

---

_@Pixel-Minions_

Hi, 

Is there any plan to implement the target flag to point to the install location for a pip installation like the regular pip?

The reason is that I am not installing those packages in any virtual environment or python folder. In my company we are using a different package manager and each one of them is isolated.
