            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>UV does a great job when it comes to package management. However the feature missing most when migrating from poetry is adding the latest version of a package and updating the spec inside the pyproject.toml.
At the moment I have to do a &quot;uv pip install <package> --upgrade&quot; to find out the version and add it manually to the pyproject.toml.
After this it can happen, that when you updated the file and do a &quot;uv sync&quot; I have to solve dependency caused by this new package since my version constrains of subpackages is not always meeting the &quot;new&quot; package requirements. It would be great, if a command like described above would suggest, what packages needs to be updated in order to install the &quot;latest&quot; version of package you want to install and prompt if you want to do this.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>uv add mypackage --latest</p>
<p>installing mypackage==2.0.0
required updates:
my-sub-package&gt;=2.0.0
mysecond-sub-package&gt;=3.0.0
do you want to update? y/N: y</p>
