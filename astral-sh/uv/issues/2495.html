            <div class="timeline-body"><pre><code>$ uv --version
uv 0.1.21
</code></pre>
<p>i think <code>uv</code>'s UX would benefit from being able to drop the <code>pip</code> prefix from all commands. examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv pip install ... -&gt; uv install
uv pip uninstall ... -&gt; uv uninstall
</code></pre>
<p>while it's neat that <code>uv</code> is going for &quot;pip compatibility mode&quot;, where all the commands have the same interface, just prefixed by <code>uv</code>, i think it's not really necessary.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv install</code> is a lot easier to type(!)</li>
<li>if there is no <code>pip</code>, users don't need to expect that the API will be exactly the same.</li>
<li>i don't think exact API compatibility is important, what's more important is that all the same <em>functionality</em> works</li>
<li>&quot;pip compatibility mode&quot; can be maintained, so <code>uv pip install ...</code> always works like <code>pip install ...</code>. but after some time, users can graduate to &quot;uv-native&quot; mode</li>
</ol>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2494 is an example where the &quot;<code>uv</code>-native&quot; API could break compatibility in a good way -- <code>uv install</code> could just install from the current directory by default instead of requiring the explicit directory (as in <code>pip install .</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We put all these pip-compatible interfaces into a separate namespace because we're going to design a new workflow that is not designed to be pip-compatible. We'll be addressing all sorts of usability concerns there. So, this is on our roadmap but we will explicitly not be moving the existing <code>uv pip</code> commands to <code>uv</code>.</p>
