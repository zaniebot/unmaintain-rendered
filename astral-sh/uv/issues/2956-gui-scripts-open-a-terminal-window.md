# GUI scripts open a terminal window

---

_Issue opened by @bersbersbers on 2024-04-10 08:05_

GUI scripts, when installed via `uv pip` and launched from VS Code, open a terminal window. They should not do that. `pip` doesn't do it, either.

`pyproject.toml`
```toml
[project]
name = "bug"
version = "0.0.1"
dependencies = ["PySide6-Essentials"]

[project.gui-scripts]
bug = "bug.main:main"
```

`bug/main.py`
```python
from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow

def main() -> None:
    print("Starting")
    app = QApplication()
    window = QMainWindow()
    window.show()
    app.exec()
```

```
pip install --force-reinstall . && bug
```

```
uv pip install --force-reinstall . && bug
```

This is `uv 0.1.31 (7bcca28b1 2024-04-09)`.

The executables generated by `uv` for gui-scripts are not using the `pythonw.exe` (mind the `w`) in their bootstrap code, which exists for exactly that purpose (to prevent console windows popping up). From a distance it looks like an easy fix.

EDIT: tested with `uv 0.2.10 (907727cb1 2024-06-10)` on win10
