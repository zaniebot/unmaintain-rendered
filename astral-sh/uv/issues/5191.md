# Provide footer to navigate between previous and next pages

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-07-18 15:55_

I think it might be useful to add the footer with the "Next" and "Previous" section because it has different pages instead of what Ruff has.

This can be done by adding [`navigation.footer`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-the-footer/) to the feature set:

```yaml
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.footer
```

What does it look like?
