            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There was an authentication issue with Depot and DockerHub for the 0.8.12 release and the extended Docker images, e.g., <code>uv:alpine</code> or <code>uv:python3.12-trixie</code>, were not published to DockerHub for 0.8.12. Pinned images like <code>docker.io/astral/uv:0.8.12-alpine</code> will be missing. Images without a patch pin, like <code>docker.io/astral/uv:0.8-alpine</code>, will point to 0.8.11. The base uv images, e.g., <code>uv:latest</code>, <code>uv:0.8</code>, and <code>uv:0.8.12</code>, are not affected and are available on DockerHub.</p>
<p>If you are affected, we recommend using the GitHub Container Registry images or staying on 0.8.11.</p>
<p>We will resolve this issue in a subsequent release, but we probably won't backfill the images.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The root cause here is that the BuildKit cache has some very weird behavior where it will store <code>docker.io</code> repositories and a subsequent attempt to push to a specific <code>docker.io</code> repository can be poisoned by the that cache and include the additional repositories.</p>
<p>In this case, @samypr100 was testing the Docker release process and published to his own <code>docker.io</code> repository from the same Depot &quot;project&quot; (i.e., shared cache). Then, our release process attempted to publish both to our official repository and Sam's repository — the latter of which we do not have write permissions for. (This is certainly a simplified representation of what happened, we're digging deeper into the details of the BuildKit behavior here).</p>
<p>The solution is to clear the cache and create distinct Depot projects for production and testing. These items have been actioned, so the next release should go out fine.</p>
