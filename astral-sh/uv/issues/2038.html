Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm currently working with the docker image <code>l4t-pytorch</code>, which already includes certain system libraries like <code>torch==2.0.0a0+ec3941ad.nv23.2</code>.</p>
<p>My goal is to add extra dependencies on top of this and manage them with uv, while pinning the preinstalled version of torch.</p>
<p>I'm trying to this via a venv with system-site-packages and declaring a dependency on <code>torch==2.0.0a0</code>, which fails since it can't resolve dependencies.</p>
<p>Is there any trick to do this or something I might have overlooked?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for having a look. I believe I can already work around the first of the two linked issues, and I'm not sure the last one applies.</p>
<p>My core issue seems to be that the version of torch already installed has a pre-release identifier (I don't think the local version identifier is the issue here). I'm trying to use the system version by pinning torch to this version (<code>2.0.0a0</code>), but <code>uv pip compile</code> fails since it can't find it in any package index. I'm not sure of the best way to handle this.</p>
