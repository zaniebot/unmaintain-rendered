            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I found the hard way after migrating from pip to uv on few projects that my lock files are no longer working, just because <code>uv pip</code> command seems to ignore presence of <code>PIP_CONSTRAINT</code> or <code>PIP_CONSTRAINTS</code> file and thus failed to lock the dependencies during install.</p>
<p>I tried defining <code>UV_CONSTRAINT</code> and it worked as expected. This is a divergence from the claimed API compatibility. Sadly the documentation page from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#build-constraints does mention the constraints only on build constraints, not also on install.</p>
<p>I do believe that the desirable fix here is to look for environment variables in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>UV_CONSTRAINT</li>
<li>PIP_CONSTRAINTS</li>
<li>PIP_CONSTRAINT (quile uncommon name but apparently supported by pip)</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Maybe it would worth displaying a warning if PIP_CONSTRAINT(S) is found as defined, mentioning the uv will not use it. This could save a good number of hours to those trying to migrate or use both.</p>
<p>As someone that defined these in his user profile, I do face few surprises...</p>
