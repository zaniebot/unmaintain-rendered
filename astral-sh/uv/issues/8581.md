<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

To repreduce:

```
uv lock
uv sync --locked
```

```
error: The lockfile at `uv.lock` needs to be updated, but `--locked` was provided. To update the lockfile, run `uv lock`.
```

Apologies. Fixed in the next release. You can also workaround it by removing the empty `dev-dependencies` list here (we weren't handling the empty case correctly when validating): https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/3fe0f9e97d67a67f4027a92f458cb4842b3db43f/python/packages/autogen-agentchat/pyproject.toml#L22.
