            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>As of #11426, uv gives an error if an extra dependency is not available in pyproject.toml when running <code>uv sync --extra non-existing</code>. However, I'd like to have the old behavior back.</p>
<p>Is there any way of sort of pre-checking the <code>uv.lock</code> (or <code>pyproject.toml</code>)if an extra is available, and if not, ignore the <code>--extra</code> command, and if it is available, use the <code>--extra</code> command?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux 6.8.0-1027-azure x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.7.2</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you emulate this with have an optional dependency or a dependency group that activates the extra? We allow non-existent extras in dependencies themselves, since we don't know to which version they point yet.</p>
<p>What is the reason the extra is only sometimes available?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>How would that solution work?</p>
<p>In this case, I'm exploring to build wheels sometimes including a set of extra optional dependencies (e.g. based on a customer id, so the customer id would be the name of the extra) but generally without. The extras are added on a need-to-have basis, so if an extra flag is given for a customer id that's not in pyproject.toml, it should just continue without raising an error, whereas if the id is in pyproject.toml, it includes the optional dependency.</p>
<p>The workflow is that the repo is first synced with optional extra dep based on a uv.lock file and then a wheel is build.</p>
<p>Maybe there's a better / easier alternative, and also maybe building the wheel completely ignores optional deps anyways, as it builds with refs to all deps, idk....</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The way extras usually work, they assume a static set of extras; they aren't suited for storing information such as customer in there.</p>
