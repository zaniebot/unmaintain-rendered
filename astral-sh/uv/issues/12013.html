            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When working on multiple dependent repos at once, a developer may want to configure uv to install some dependencies from a file location. This works great for local development, but on a shared branch his paths may be different from another developer's - or further, other developers may not even share the same need to install those packages from source locally. It would be very helpful to enable some setup such as a uv.toml override that can be kept locally and .gitignored to maintain a local set of sources different from the configuration checked into git.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>A developer is working on package A. He is also simultaneously developing package A.1 and A.2 which are dependencies of package A. He would like to configure his package A repo to install from source at the file location of A.1 and A.2 source code, but knows his peer A developers (whom are <em>not</em> developing A.1 and A.2) would be affected by a change to the shared pyproject.toml <code>tool.uv.sources</code> section</p>
