# Avoid showing negations of single ranges in error messages

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-01-18 23:47_

e.g. in https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/blob/6cad0f609caba5354f528cc3dba813f0c26a0e27/crates/puffin-cli/tests/pip_install_scenarios.rs#L688 

we have `!( a>=3.0.0 )` but since it's just a single item in the negation we should just _perform_ the complement.
