            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm working with <a href="github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib">PufferLib</a>, although I was able to distill this down to <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/uv-repro">this repro</a>, which has this error:</p>
<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (&gt;=3.9) does not satisfy Python==3.11.7 and metta-common==0.1.0 depends on
      Python==3.11.7, we can conclude that metta-common==0.1.0 cannot be used.
      And because only metta-common==0.1.0 is available, we can conclude that all versions of metta-common cannot be used.
      And because uv-repro[metta] depends on metta-common and your project requires uv-repro[metta], we can conclude that
      your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (&gt;=3.9) includes Python versions that are not supported by your dependencies (e.g.,
      metta-common==0.1.0 only supports ==3.11.7). Consider using a more restrictive `requires-python` value (like ==3.11.7).
</code></pre>
<p>This error is fine for greenfield projects, where you probably want to make sure that everything works all of the time, but it's problematic when working with existing projects. I have no plans to use <code>metta-common</code>, but I don't want to remove it for my pip-using friends either. Ideally:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <code>metta-common</code> wasn't actually being used, uv would (or could, perhaps through <code>conflicts</code>) pay no mind to this.</li>
<li>if it was being used, uv would keep the current error or maybe just warn and automatically make <code>requires-python</code> more specific.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately they've made the peculiar choice to pin their package to a specific Python version https://github.com/Metta-AI/metta/blob/c576d3d95c2c278236a17c862d7032873ef5e1d4/common/pyproject.toml#L10</p>
<p>This means the package cannot be used with other Python versions.</p>
<p>We generate a lockfile that includes all your extras. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#universal-resolution for more details on the resolution process.</p>
<p>You can do something like</p>
<p><code>metta-common @ git+https://github.com/metta-ai/metta.git@main#subdirectory=common; python_version == '3.11.7'</code> to only include that package on the compatible Python version. Really, they should fix this upstream though.</p>
