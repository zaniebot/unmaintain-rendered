            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m trying to run <code>func start</code> (Azure Functions Emulator) with uv, and in Linux this works fine: <code>uv run func start</code> runs <code>func start</code> with the .venv as expected. However, on Windows it is unable to run <code>func</code> as it can&#x27;t spawn the process.</p>
<p>As a minimal example i did the same with echo:
Linux (fish shell):

<p>Windows (powershell):

<p>So there seems to be some mismatch between the two, but maybe there is better/preferred way of running an arbitrary program while also running/installing the uv venv?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In Ubuntu 20, <code>echo</code> is a program, and I assume it&#x27;s the same in other Linux distributions. It&#x27;s normal for it to work in Linux. As for Windows, I believe echo doesn&#x27;t exist as a standalone program. The echo in PowerShell is an alias, and in cmd, it&#x27;s likely a built-in command.

<p>@FishAlchemist Aha! This make sense, its just weird that the same happens with <code>func start</code> ..! I was unable to reproduce it on another Windows machine though, so i will investigate if there is something wrong with the first one.</p>

<p>Ah yes, but <code>func</code> is a third party tool not installed in the .venv. I just want to run this executable with the venv activated.</p>

<p>I think your Windows environment doesn&#x27;t have an executable file named <code>echo</code> that can be found by UV.
However, it seems like <code>echo</code> isn&#x27;t the program you actually want to run. Is there a possibility that you forgot to install the related program on Windows?</p>
<p>UV is not limited to executing files within virtual environments only.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! Reporting back! <code>func</code> was installed and worked when running without uv, but we reinstalled it on my colleagues machine and then everything worked... Not complaining :smile: Closing this as it seems to be an environment issue! Thanks @FishAlchemist</p>
