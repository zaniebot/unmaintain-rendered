# `uv --help` is missing help text for `generate-shell-completion`

_Issue opened by @drmikehenry on 2024-10-26 13:46_

`uv --help` is missing help text for `generate-shell-completion`, though it's in `uv help`, e.g.:

```
$ diff --ignore-space-change -u <(uv help) <(uv --help)

This is intentional because of the length of the command.

Understood; that's reasonable.  I thought it might have been an oversight.  Thanks for the quick reply.
