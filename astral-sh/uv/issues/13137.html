            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When the action completes sucessfully UV will print what is installed in the environment but if the action fails to complete it is unclear what version it was trying to install when the action failed.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For example here the version of <code>metatensor-torch</code> is causing an issue due to a recent release that has an inconsistent sub-dependency.  Given the action failed we can't see what version was downloaded in CI.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I don't think that's a uv error. It looks like a runtime error, from trying to import the package? We don't have any control over the error message there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry yes I wasn't clear there is no error with UV. The linked error is supposed to support the point that it would be nice if when UV prints downloading XYZ it gave the version in brackets as that would make it easier to diagnose which version caused the error in instances where the dependencies may be unpinned.</p>
