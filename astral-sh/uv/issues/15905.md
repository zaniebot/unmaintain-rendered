# Add "--not-required" option to uv pip list

---

_Issue opened by @NdagiStanley on 2025-09-17 09:56_

### Summary

I think feature parity between `pip list` and `uv pip list` is an ideal goal.

"--not-required" is not an option in `uv pip list`.

"--not-required" included in the `pip list` options.

I use "--not-required --format=freeze > requirements.txt" to generate a clean, top-level requirements file.

While this might seem like a niche use case, I'm proposing this addition more for parity's sake, especially for new uv users familiar with it.

@zanieb I'm willing to take a stab at this.
