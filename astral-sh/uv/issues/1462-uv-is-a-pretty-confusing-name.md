# `uv` is a pretty confusing name

If you wanted to use `pacman` instead, I'm happy to transfer it:
https://pypi.org/project/pacman/

Thanks for the offer and yeah, pacman is a cool name but It's unlikely that we're going to change the name now. There's also the issue that arch's package manager is called pacman (and uv is intended to be more than just a package manager)
