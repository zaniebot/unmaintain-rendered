<pre><code class="language-console">❯ uv tool install git+https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle@latest
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because crcmod was not found in the package registry and greaseweazle==1.22 depends on crcmod, we can conclude that greaseweazle==1.22 cannot be used.
      And because only greaseweazle==1.22 is available and you require greaseweazle, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>However pipx manages this just fine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">❯ pipx install git+https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle@latest
  installed package greaseweazle 1.22, installed using Python 3.12.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - gw
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
</code></pre>
<p>The dependency is on pypi: https://pypi.org/project/crcmod/</p>
<p>I might be doing something wrong, not sure. This is the first time I tried installing a tool from github as opposed to pypi. Looking at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#requesting-different-sources it seems it should be supported? I tried with <code>uvx</code> also (as opposed to <code>uv tool</code>) and got the same result though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, never mind, I figured out the issue. I had a left over UV_INDEX_URL set, the issue is with the mirroring of the public pypi to that mirror I guess.</p>
