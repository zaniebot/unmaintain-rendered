# Order of settings in CLI `help` is not intuitive

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-23 22:19_

For some reason, `quiet` and `verbose` are randomly in the middle (and non-consecutive).

The help menu is also generally way more verbose than I need. I end up seeing options that are very advanced. I wonder if there's anything to be done about that?

@zanieb - Did this also get fixed, by chance?

Nope. I'll take care of it though.
