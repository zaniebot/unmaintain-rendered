            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When trying to reproduce an issue on a Python version that I don't have installed, it would be useful to be able to create a virtual environment for that version <em>without</em> needing to install a system copy of the Python version first. Other tools like hatch and PDM use the <a href="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone">Python standalone builds</a> project for this. Clearly I could download the appropriate interpreter, unpack it, and run <code>uv venv --python /path/to/unpacked/build</code>, but that would mean manually managing the unpacked version.</p>
<p>Being able to do something like <code>uv venv --python pypy@3.10</code>, and have <code>uv</code> download, unpack and cache the interpreter for me would be useful in this situation.</p>
<p>I should note that this isn't a common occurrence for me, so I'm not asking for this feature to be prioritised. The workarounds I currently have are perfectly fine. But this does feel to me like a natural extension to the current <code>uv venv</code> feature set.</p>
