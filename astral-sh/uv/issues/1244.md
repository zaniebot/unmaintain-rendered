# Add `--dry-run` flag for `pip install`

For parity with `pip` but also useful.

Basically this let's you `pip compile` without creating requirements file. The install plan is displayed to the user, e.g.

```
❯ pip install flask --dry-run
Collecting flask
  Using cached flask-3.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (101 kB)
Requirement already satisfied: Werkzeug>=3.0.0 in /Users/mz/.pyenv/versions/3.11.4/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from flask) (3.0.1)
Requirement already satisfied: Jinja2>=3.1.2 in /Users/mz/.pyenv/versions/3.11.4/lib/python3.11/site-packages (from flask) (3.1.2)

Would install Flask-3.0.1

May I try this? @zanieb 
I have a basic thing done:

```
uv on  1431 [📝🤷✓] via 🐋 colima via 🎁 v0.1.1 via  pyenv via ⚙️ v1.75.0
➜ ./target/debug/uv pip install flask --dry-run
Resolved 7 packages in 1.15s
Would have installed:
  jinja2
  itsdangerous
  blinker
  markupsafe
  flask
  werkzeug
  click
```

Although I'm not yet sure how to pull versions to display..
