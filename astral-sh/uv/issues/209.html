            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you try to resolve <code>./scripts/resolve/pypi_top_8k_flat.txt</code>, there's like a 1 second delay at the start of the resolution. The issue is that we kick off requests eagerly for all 8,000 packages, and then we wait for the first package in <code>potential_packages</code> to be available. If that first package (which isn't guaranteed to match the order of the initial requirements) is deep in the list, we end up waiting a long time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another thing we could explore here is doing a better job loading cached metadata upfront. Like, we could do a blocking operation upfront to ensure we pre-load any cached metadata without going through channels or the reqwest client.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For 500 packages, if you just try to fetch all the (cached) metadata in a loop upfront, it takes about 600ms on a release build.</p>
