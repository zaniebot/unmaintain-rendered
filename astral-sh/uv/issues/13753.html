            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When I installed gymnasium[box2d], it required the binary program &quot;swig&quot;. However, I couldn't find a way to bundle &quot;swig&quot; into pyproject.toml. I've tried many methods, but all of them resulted in errors.
I know I could first install &quot;swig&quot; in the environment using <code>uv tool install swig</code> and then install the environment based on pyproject.toml. But I hope to install the environment in one go via uv sync so that I can distribute the code without any extra steps.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's not possible to declare <code>swig</code> as an extra build dependency for <code>gymnasium[box2d]</code>, but we'll probably support that in the future. (When you added <code>swig</code> on line 29, that would include <code>swig</code> when building your own package (<code>rl</code>), but builds are performed in isolation, so it wouldn't have any affect on the <code>gymnasium[box2d]</code> build.)</p>
<p>\cc @Gankra -- I think this is a decent example of a package for which users might want to augment build dependencies? Though haven't tried it myself.</p>
