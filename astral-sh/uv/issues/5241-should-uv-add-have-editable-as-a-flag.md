# Should uv add have editable as a flag

---

_Issue opened by @bluss on 2024-07-20 07:27_

Current cli interface for editable like this:

```uv add --editable true depencency```

I think ```uv add --editable```  and ```uv add --no-editable``` with no true/false value would be more familiar to most people?

Feel free close if it doesn't make sense.
