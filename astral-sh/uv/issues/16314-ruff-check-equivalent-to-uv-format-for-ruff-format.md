# `ruff check` equivalent to `uv format` for `ruff format`

---

_Issue opened by @domoritz on 2025-10-15 13:11_

### Summary

ruff has a `format` and a `check` option but it looks like only the format option is supported as a shorthand through `uv format`. It would be great to support `check` (for general linting)  as well. 

### Example

_No response_
