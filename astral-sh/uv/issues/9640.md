# Inconsistent or incorrect package resolution for PyTorch when using environment markers

---

_Issue opened by @asalaria-cisco on 2024-12-04 14:08_

I am following the [instructions in documentations](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/#configuring-accelerators-with-optional-dependencies), to allow CPU-only builds in some cases, but CUDA-enabled builds in others.

I am using Linux and uv version `0.5.6`. 
My machine has an NIVIDIA GPU but let's say I want to only install a CPU version of PyTorch.
Starting from an empty folder, I run:

```
uv init
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then I edited the `pyproject.toml` to look like this (following the documentation):

```
[project]
name = "test"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [ ]

[project.optional-dependencies]
cpu = [ "torch>=2.5.1" ]
cu124 = [ "torch>=2.5.1" ]

[tool.uv]
conflicts = [ [{ extra = "cpu" }, { extra = "cu124" },] ]

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = [
  { index = "pytorch-cpu", extra = "cpu", marker = "platform_system != 'Darwin'" },
  { index = "pytorch-cu124", extra = "cu124" },
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch-cpu"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"
explicit = true

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch-cu124"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124"
explicit = true
```
Running `uv sync` I get:

```
$ uv sync --extra cpu
Resolved 26 packages in 1.52s
Installed 1 package in 113ms
 + torch==2.5.1+cpu
```

Bug number 1: only `torch` and no other package, has been installed!
Immediately running `uv syc` again adds the missing dependencies:

```
$ uv sync --extra cpu
Resolved 26 packages in 1ms
Installed 9 packages in 25ms
 + filelock==3.16.1
 + fsspec==2024.10.0
 + jinja2==3.1.4
 + markupsafe==3.0.2
 + mpmath==1.3.0
 + networkx==3.4.2
 + setuptools==75.6.0
 + sympy==1.13.1
 + typing-extensions==4.12.2
```

This adds back the missing dependencies.

Now for the second and more complex issue. If I add a dependency to the `pyproject.toml` that itself has `torch` as a dependency, things start to break. Modifying the `pyproject.toml` by adding `ragatouille` as a project dependency (nothing unique to this package, other similar packages produce the same results):

```
[project]
name = "test"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [ "ragatouille" ]

.... the rest the same as above ....
```

Now running `uv syc` we hit the second bug:
```
$ uv sync --extra cpu
warning: Missing version constraint (e.g., a lower bound) for `ragatouille`
Resolved 141 packages in 1.84s
Installed 128 packages in 913ms
...
```

Among the packages installed, we get a second copy of `torch` with CUDA dependency!
```
$ uv pip list | grep -e "torch\|nvidia"
fast-pytorch-kmeans                     0.2.0.1
nvidia-cublas-cu12                      12.4.5.8
nvidia-cuda-cupti-cu12                  12.4.127
nvidia-cuda-nvrtc-cu12                  12.4.127
nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12                12.4.127
nvidia-cudnn-cu12                       9.1.0.70
nvidia-cufft-cu12                       11.2.1.3
nvidia-curand-cu12                      10.3.5.147
nvidia-cusolver-cu12                    11.6.1.9
nvidia-cusparse-cu12                    12.3.1.170
nvidia-ml-py                            12.560.30
nvidia-nccl-cu12                        2.21.5
nvidia-nvjitlink-cu12                   12.4.127
nvidia-nvtx-cu12                        12.4.127
torch                                   2.5.1
torch                                   2.5.1+cpu
```

It seems that the constraint that was put in the `pyporject.toml` to use the specific index to look for torch (i.e. using CPU version), was not used when resolving the dependencies of `ragatouille`. It is worth mentioning that moving `ragatouille` from project dependencies to the optional ones (i.e. adding it along `torch` to the `cpu` and `gpu` optional decadency lists) also results in installing two versions of `torch`, CPU and GPU.

The second issue is a duplicate of #9289. It's being worked on actively.

And the first might be the same underlying issue as #9622

I can confirm that the first bug is resolved by #9370.

On my Linux machine, if I test the second bug with `ragatouille`, I get:

```
error: Distribution `voyager==2.0.9 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
```

But if I use `torchmetrics` instead (which I think is the same idea, since it depends on `torch`), then that bug is also resolved by #9370.
