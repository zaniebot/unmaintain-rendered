# FEAT: Support to set the Project Version using uv command

---

_Issue opened by @datnguye on 2024-09-28 03:49_

Currently I'm using `poetry` and would like move into `uv` world. One of the migration point is to be able to **set the project version** in `pyproject.toml` using  `uv` command.

```
[project]
name = "package"
version = "0.0.0" # will be always like this in pyproject.toml & need updating on release
```

Similarly using `poetry`: `poetry version 1.0.0` -- This feature will help to simplify the Pypi Publishing workflow.

In my case, here is the sample Github Workflow step:
```
    - name: Build and publish
      run: |
        poetry version $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
        poetry build
        poetry publish --username ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
```

My expectation is that something I can do the same for `uv`:
```
    - name: Build and publish
      run: |
        uv version $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
        uv build
        uv publish --username ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
```
OR:
```
    - name: Build and publish
      run: |
        uv build --version $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
        uv publish --username ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
```
