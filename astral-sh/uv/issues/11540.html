            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm sure you have thought of this but I couldn't find an issue about it so I want to get it on the list.</p>
<p>Since one goal is to be able to say <code>uv run the_tool.py</code>, more inexperienced users will be able to use Python programs if they can get <code>uv</code> installed via the app store for Windows and Apple.</p>
<p>Icing on the cake would be if I can create my own app installer that will install <code>uv</code> along with all the necessary things for that OS to produce a clickable app that will execute <code>uv run the_tool.py</code>, so the end user has the same experience as any other app, without knowing that they are actually installing a python app.</p>
<p>Again, I'm sure you've thought of all this.</p>
