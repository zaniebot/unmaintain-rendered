<p>Currently uv will use UV_INDEX_URL if it&#x27;s set, and ignore the one in the requirements file. Reproducer:</p>

<p>This is in contrast to pip, where the index url from environment is lower priority to the cmd:</p>

<p>This makes <code>uv</code> + UV_INDEX_URL somewhat dangerous to use as a drop-in replacement for <code>pip</code> + PIP_INDEX_URL. A failure to install is not the worst scenario, the worst is that you <em>succeed</em> to install potentially totally different packages from a totally different index (note: checksums in the reqs file could protect you from that).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I think it&#x27;s arguably unclear <em>what</em> we should use here. I would find it more dangerous that the environment variable (which is presumedly set by the user) is ignored, and the one in a <code>requirements.txt</code> in a file was picked up (which could be from another project or similar). But I can see an argument either way. I&#x27;d rather document this as an incompatibility than change it though, I think.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><em>Below, I&#x27;m intending to convince you that retaining compatibility with pip is a better choice than documenting as an incompatibility.</em></p>
<p>Consider when there is a custom <em>default</em> index set. This is pretty common in corporate environments, where PyPI packages may need to be cached, whitelisted or shadowed with patched versions, e.g. by using an internal <a href="https://github.com/devpi/devpi/tree/main/server">devpi-server</a>.</p>
<p>The custom index is set as the default index (for all users) by <code>/etc/pip.conf</code> file, owned by root and placed by sysadmin or config mgmt. Now, uv doesn&#x27;t look at <code>/etc/pip.conf</code>, ~nor allow a global default configuration~ (no longer true since uv 0.4.26 <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7851">#7851</a>), only considers the user&#x27;s <code>~/.config/uv/uv.toml</code> - so this is only an option to set a default index for <em>pip</em>.</p>
<p>The next-best option for the sysadmin to put a sensible default index for uv would probably be setting <code>UV_INDEX_URL</code> (perhaps in <code>/etc/environment</code>, or by wrapping the uv executable).</p>
<p>However, if the <code>UV_INDEX_URL</code> takes precedence over the index specified by requirements files, that&#x27;s an unfortunate situation - users would have to <em>unset</em> the env var (which they might not even know about) to allow using the index which the requirements file was attempting to provide.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, the simple failure mode is that packages are not found, but the more confusing and hard-to-debug failure mode is if the installation succeeds but uses the wrong packages (because it was using the wrong index). Switching from <code>pip</code> to <code>uv pip</code> should not be so error-prone.</p>
<p>The failure mode I describe might sound like a weird edge-case, but could actually be quite common especially with devpi-server, where &quot;team-specific&quot; indices could inherit and mirror a default index, to host a mix of their own/patched local versions layered over the default versions.</p>

<p>... and the one in a <code>requirements.txt</code> in a file was picked up (which could be from another project or similar).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean here? Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, it is part of the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#global-options">requirements file format</a> that the file can control the index-url. This is not dangerous, because requirements files and their custom indices can not be used during dependency resolving from some other top-level installation candidate. The requirements file would have been installed directly with <code>-r</code>. At least, it&#x27;s not any more dangerous than a <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#examples">direct url requirement</a>, as specified in PEP 508.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m currently faced with this problem. I would love to specify index rules in the pyproject.toml file and completely ignore --index and --extra-index definitions in <code>requirements.txt</code> as these are provided partially by external projects (in this case external Ansible collections).</p>
<p>We use uv like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip compile -U --generate-hashes --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in collections/ansible_collections/*/*/requirements.txt -n --no-strip-extras --emit-index-url --index-strategy unsafe-best-match --emit-index-annotation
</code></pre>
<p>All external Ansible collections are ina <code>collections/ansible_collections</code> and we add all their <code>requirement.txt</code> to our pinned dependencies. <code>--index-strategy unsafe-best-match</code> is something I would like to avoid.</p>
<p>I have two internal projects that should be looked up ONLY internally (in two different indexes) and the rest on pypi.</p>
