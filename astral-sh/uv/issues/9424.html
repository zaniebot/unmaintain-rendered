Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53899">CVE-2024-53899</a> was published, with the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>virtualenv before 20.26.6 allows command injection through the activation scripts for a virtual environment. Magic template strings are not quoted correctly when replacing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This corresponds to https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/2768 and is supposed to be fixed by https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/pull/2771.</p>
<p>Because <code>uv</code> vendors <code>virtualenv</code> activation scripts in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/tree/0.5.4/crates/uv-virtualenv/src/activator/"><code>crates/uv-virtualenv/src/activator/</code></a>, I wondered if <code>uv</code> was also affected. Imitating the original reproducer in https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/2768, and working with a <code>uv</code> checkout on the <code>0.5.4</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo build
$ envname=&quot;';uname -a;':&quot;
$ mkdir &quot;$envname&quot;
$ cd &quot;$envname&quot;
$ ../target/debug/uv venv .
$ . ./bin/activate
(';uname -a;':) ben@musicbox:~/src/forks/uv/';uname -a;':$
</code></pre>
<p>This is good; the <code>uname -a</code> command was not executed, so this test did <em>not</em> reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>Checking older versions, it looks like this was fixed between <code>uv</code> 0.5.2 and 0.5.3, probably in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8984 (although I did not bother bisecting). To reiterate this very clearly, I <em>was not</em> able to trivially reproduce CVE-2024-53899 in <code>uv</code> 0.5.3 and later, but I <em>was</em> able to reproduce it (output from <code>uname -a</code> appeared in my console) in <code>uv</code> 0.5.2 and earlier.</p>
<p>Could you please comment on whether you believe the underlying issue is entirely mitigated in <code>uv</code>, or whether further work needs to be done? Thank you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Due to #8984, uv is unaffected for:</p>
<ul>
<li>bash</li>
<li>csg</li>
<li>fish</li>
<li>nushell</li>
</ul>
<p>The powershell activator does not contain the path.</p>
<p>The batch activator is fixed by #9466.</p>
<p>While #8947 and the batch behavior are clearly bugs, I would like to remind users that you should never build virtual environments from untrusted input. There are various sources of arbitrary code execution, such as <code>.pth</code> files, wheel data writing to arbitrary paths in the venv and source dist builds running arbitrary code.</p>
