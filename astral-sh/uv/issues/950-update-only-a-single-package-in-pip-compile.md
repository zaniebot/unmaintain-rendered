# Update only a single package in pip compile

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-01-17 17:16_

When running `puffin pip compile` with an existing lockfile the options are currently to not update any of the packages (default) or update all packages (`--upgrade`). There should also be an option to update only a selected package.
