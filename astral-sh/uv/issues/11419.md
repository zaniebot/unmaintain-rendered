# Dependencies with custom indexes lead to lockfile always being outdated

---

_Issue opened by @ew-pallon on 2025-02-11 12:20_

### Summary

In a setup with two packages, both using dependencies from custom indexes, the lockfile always appears outdated.

# Reproduction

`pkg_a/pyproject.toml`:
```
[project]
name = "pkg-a"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "torch==2.1.2"
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "torch-index"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = { index = "torch-index" }
```

`pkg_b/pyproject.toml`:
```
[project]
name = "pkg-b"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "pkg-a",
    "cchttpserver"
]

[tool.uv.sources]
pkg-a = { path = "../pkg_a/", editable = true }
chttpserver = { index = "hpk-index" }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "hpk-index"
url = "https://m.devpi.net/hpk/dev/"
explicit = true
```

Then, run:
```
pkg_b $ uv lock
Resolved 20 packages in 181ms
pkg_b $ uv lock --check
Resolved 20 packages in 526ms
error: The lockfile at `uv.lock` needs to be updated, but `--locked` was provided. To update the lockfile, run `uv lock`.
```
Subsequent executions of `uv lock` or `uv sync` do not make any changes to the lockfile, yet uv claims the lockfile is outdated.

The issue only occurs when depencies with a custom index source exist in both `pkg_a` and `pkg_b`. If either one is removed, there is no problem.

# Workaround

Adding the `[[tool.uv.index]]` section for `torch-index` to `pkg_b/pyproject.toml` works around the issue.

### Platform

Darwin 24.2.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.5.30 (Homebrew 2025-02-10)

### Python version

Python 3.10.6

The problem here is that this snippet from the validation step:

```rust
// If the lockfile references an index that was not provided, we can't validate it.
if let Source::Registry(index) = &package.id.source {
    match index {
        RegistrySource::Url(url) => {
            if remotes
                .as_ref()
                .is_some_and(|remotes| !remotes.contains(url))
            {
                let name = &package.id.name;
                let version = &package
                    .id
                    .version
                    .as_ref()
                    .expect("version for registry source");
                return Ok(SatisfiesResult::MissingRemoteIndex(name, version, url));
            }
        }
        RegistrySource::Path(path) => {
            if locals.as_ref().is_some_and(|locals| !locals.contains(path)) {
                let name = &package.id.name;
                let version = &package
                    .id
                    .version
                    .as_ref()
                    .expect("version for registry source");
                return Ok(SatisfiesResult::MissingLocalIndex(name, version, path));
            }
        }
    };
}
```

Only looks at indexes provided in the root `pyproject.toml`. But when resolving, we respect explicit indexes defined in arbitrary path and Git projects. So there's a mismatch. I don't quite know how to solve this.

Thank you for looking into it! I'm fine with the workaround for now, but resolving this issue (or providing a useful error message) might help others in the future.

👍 Yeah we should definitely fix this.

_Comment by @HenriBlacksmith on 2025-02-17 13:35_

Not sure wether it is related, but when adding or removing an index via `[[tool.uv.index]]` in `pyproject.toml` with `uv==0.6.0` has no effect on `uv.lock`:

```shell
uv lock --check
Resolved 62 packages in 0.59ms
```

Adding or removing an index in `pyproject.toml` should cause the lockfile to be outdated (all the references are targeting the default or the removed index).

The workaround being:

```shell
rm uv.lock
uv lock
```

Do you mind creating a separate issue with a minimal reproduction (i.e., the exact commands you ran, the contents of the `pyproject.toml` before and after, etc.)?

Here is the new issue with an MRE (I found a PyPI mirror for the MRE): https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11596#issue-2860388118

Hello!
Just checking in to see if there’s been any update on this. We’re still running into this issue (that i also described [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12116)) in our projects, and it’s proving to be a blocker. Appreciate any insights—thanks! 🙏

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-05-21 12:08_

I'll try to take another look soon, sorry about that.
