            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a small pet peeve of mine but it took me the longest time to understand the entry point stuff in Python. I will admit that I'm usually far too late to the docs, and that's because I feel that we should instead design the world like a Metroidvania, breadcrumbing the possibilities.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The idea is simple: at the end of pip install, the output would display a list of any new entry point available to the user, with <code>uv pip install foo</code> or <code>uv pip install -e .</code> Even better if it says something like <code>The package X offers Y entry points in its pyproject.toml</code> or wherever it comes from!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll +1 this.  I use <code>uv</code> across a lot of projects, and I define entrypoints in <code>[project.scripts]</code> in many of these projects.  I don't typically remember the names, so when I come back to a project after a while, my first command is typically <code>cat pyproject.toml</code> then scroll through to look for the <code>[project.scripts]</code> to remember what my entry points are.  Something like a <code>uv info</code> would be helpful, to just cat a quick summary of the pyproject.toml with package name, optional dependencies, entrypoints, etc.  If a uv-managed .venv is present, it could output things like python version installed and other venv-relevant info too.</p>
<p>... Then again, maybe that's just trivial feature bloat when you can just cat the <code>pyproject.toml</code> which is already pretty human readable ...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As a note, <code>uv run</code> without arguments will list the available entry points</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv run
Provide a command or script to invoke with `uv run &lt;command&gt;` or `uv run &lt;script&gt;.py`.

The following commands are available in the environment:

- glom
- jsonschema
- markdown-it
- normalizer
- opentelemetry-bootstrap
- opentelemetry-instrument
- pwiz.py
- pygmentize
- pysemgrep
- python
- python3
- python3.14
- semgrep
</code></pre>
<p>(This is a bit different than showing them in <code>pip install</code> though)</p>
