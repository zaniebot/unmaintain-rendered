            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Have you created and activated a virtual environment? My and Micha's conclusion from debugging #1639 was that it's not possible on Windows (yet) to use the &quot;trick&quot; where you pretend a virtual environment has been created and activated by doing the <code>echo &quot;VIRTUAL_ENV=${Python_ROOT_DIR}&quot; &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_ENV</code> in a GitHub Actions workflow. The reason why this doesn't work on Windows is likely due to the fact that <code>python.exe</code> is found in a different directory on Windows when a virtual environment hasn't been activated (it's <em>not</em> in a <code>Scripts/</code> directory when a virtual environment hasn't been activated, and <code>uv</code> assumes <code>python.exe</code> will always be in a <code>Scripts/</code> directory on Windows). So the <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> trick to avoid having to create and activate an environment currently only works on Unix.</p>
<p>(Edit: it looks like you <em>are</em> indeed doing the Unix-only &quot;trick&quot;: https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-uv/blob/a93e37e98a012d07d6ac151e097c444a77d15b0a/.github/workflows/check.yml#L43)</p>

<p>Oh of course. Longer-term we want to have first-class support for GitHub Actions, which I think will probably include something like #1526. We absolutely agree the current situation is far from ideal :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main issue here is that <code>uv</code> assumes that Python is located at <code>$VIRTUAL_ENV/Scripts/python.exe</code> which isn't the case when pointing to a global python installation. see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1803 for some details.</p>
<p>@jenshnielsen https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1803 might help with your issue, depending on the layout of the <code>venv</code> directory</p>

<p>The recommended local workflow is to use a venv instead of installing dependencies globally.</p>
