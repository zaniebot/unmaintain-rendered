# Why do I lose many commands after UV sync?

_Issue opened by @bbhxwl on 2025-06-11 06:27_

### Question

After following the process below, my virtual environment will lose many commands and I will no longer be able to use pip and uv. How to deploy a formal environment?

```
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install uv
uv sync

```

`uv sync` manages the entire environment, it may recreate it with a different python version and install only the package from the lockfile in it. If you want to manually manage the venv, you can use the `uv pip` commands.

Is there a problem with my steps? Because after running UV sync, there is no UV command left and I cannot find the UV command, so I cannot run UV pip

you're installing uv in the environment that is then overwritten by uv, removing the uv installation. The easiest way to solve this is to install uv another way, e.g. with our `curl` install or with `pipx`.

Or, add it as a development dependency for your project.
