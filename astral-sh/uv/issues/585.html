            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We&#x27;d like the installer and resolver to work when run from multiple concurrent processes (with a few exceptions, for example, if the user deletes the cache from one session while running a command from another, that seems okay).</p>
<p>In general the cache is purely additive, with one exception: we remove &quot;stale&quot; built distributions when we notice that they&#x27;re no longer fresh. This could, in theory, lead to failures, if one process picks up a cached wheel, and then in-between picking it up and installing it, another process removes it from the cache.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never actually seen this, it&#x27;s a theoretical concern.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the safest thing would be to avoid removing the stale wheels, and always treat the cache as append-only.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The case i can see, still very constructed:</p>
<p>1 A: See that the source dist cache for foo is stale
2 B: See that the source dist cache for foo is stale
3 A: Deletes the cache
4 A: Builds new wheels
5 A: Puts new wheels into place
6 B: Deletes the cache
7 A: Tries to install from the cache, the cache isn&#x27;t there</p>
<p>If we want to prevent this we could put RW locks around the source dist cache dirs or try something around https://stackoverflow.com/a/10886940/3549270 so that the cache dir always exists</p>
