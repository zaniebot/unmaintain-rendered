<p>I think it should not be silently ignored though, but rather show a message making it clear that nothing was done because the package with that version already exists (like pip does).</p>

<p>I don't think the path where the wheel file is located should matter - pip does not care about it, regardless of location it shows this message:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>mypkg is already installed with the same version as the provided wheel. Use --force-reinstall to force an installation of the wheel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>one case where I think using the full path would be weird is when you have a cronjob or similar that downloads a &quot;latest&quot; wheel from some place (GH actions build or similar) to a temporary location, which might be a <code>/tmp/&lt;randomname&gt;/</code> folder, and then runs <code>uv pip install /tmp/&lt;randomname&gt;/*.whl</code>.</p>
<p>In such a case I think the expected behavior would be to reinstall only if the version changed (or if the user uses a switch to force reinstalling)...</p>
