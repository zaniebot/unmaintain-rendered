# Dependency backoff appears unmantained, and depends on unmaintained instant crate

---

_Issue opened by @musicinmybrain on 2024-12-18 14:48_

The dependency `backoff` appears unmaintained, https://github.com/ihrwein/backoff/issues/66, and its dependency `instant` is also unmaintained, https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0384.html.

I’m not aware of any concrete, specific defects in these dependencies, but it might be a good idea to consider alternatives.

As an intermediate step – since the crate is currently used only to work around file locking by antivirus programs on Windows – I plan to open a PR that would actually conditionalize the dependency so that `uv` can be compiled without `backoff` on non-Windows platforms.

https://github.com/Xuanwo/backon looks like a maintained fork

I wonder if we should just vendor this?

backon looks to be in a healthy state, I've used it in other projects before, so I'll move us to that.

(Not sure what the bar/preference is for vendoring though.)
