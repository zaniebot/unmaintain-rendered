            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The best idea I've been able to come up with is to add some kind of a wheel regex filter at lock time to handle filtering on manylinux specifics, etc. since there aren't available markers / constraints for this afaict</p>
<p>In my scenario we use <code>sam</code> for python lambda deploys, which requires a <code>requirements.txt</code> which we create via <code>uv export</code>, and then <code>sam</code> hard codes <code>manylinux2014</code> (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/7860 and https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/7744) but that causes downstream issues, so we're looking to create a <code>requirements.txt</code> (and ostensibly keep <code>uv.lock</code> in sync) which only contains versions of packages which have wheels build for <code>manylinux_x_y</code>, for instance.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><code>--filter-wheels manylinux_2_28</code> or something like that? I'm not sure.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aha! Yes @konstin that could work, for a manylinux range or upper/lower bound</p>
<p>I have some other situations where I'd like a lower bound</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The upstream fixed my issue (https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/8101) but this still makes sense to me to add to <code>uv</code> at some point.</p>
