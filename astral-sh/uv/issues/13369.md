# System Python used despite global config specifying Python version

---

_Issue opened by @liby on 2025-05-09 21:19_

### Summary

I've encountered unexpected behavior with UV's Python version selection. Despite setting `python-version = "3.13"` in my global config (`~/.config/uv/uv.toml`), UV still uses the system Python 3.9 when initializing projects.

### Reproduction steps

1. Configure `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` with:

    ```toml
    [pip]
    python-version = "3.13"
    ```

2. Run `uv init` in a new directory
3. Check the created `.python-version` file:

    ```
    $ cat .python-version
    3.9
    ```

4. Verify available Python versions:

    ```
    $ uv python list
    cpython-3.14.0a6-macos-aarch64-none                 <download available>
    cpython-3.13.3-macos-aarch64-none                   <download available>
    cpython-3.13.3+freethreaded-macos-aarch64-none      <download available>
    ...
    cpython-3.9.6-macos-aarch64-none                    /usr/bin/python3
    ...
    ```

### Expected behavior

With `python-version = "3.13"` in my global config, I would expect UV to download and use Python 3.13 for new projects, rather than using the system Python 3.9.

### Actual behavior

UV uses system Python 3.9 despite the global configuration specifying 3.13.

I understand that `python-preference: managed` (the default) means system Python installations are preferred over downloading a managed version. However, when there's such a significant version discrepancy (3.9 vs 3.13), I would expect UV to respect the explicitly configured version rather than choosing a system version with a completely different minor version.


### Platform

Darwin 24.4.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.7.2 (Homebrew 2025-04-30)

### Python version

Python 3.9.6

You configured the target Python version under a `[pip]` heading which only applies to `uv pip` not top-level commands like `uv init`.

I think what you want is `uv python pin --global 3.13`
