# Add a command like `pnpm fetch` for CI/CD build.

On CI or CD environments, the BuildKit cache mounts might not be available, because the VM or container is ephemeral and only normal docker cache will work.

So an alternative is to use a typical Dockerfile with layers that are built incrementally, for this scenario, pnpm fetch is the best option, as it only needs the pnpm-lock.yaml file and the layer cache will only be lost when you change the dependencies.

It seems that uv can also add similar features to better comply with the CI/CD build process。

I think `uv sync` is probably fine for this? But the suggestion is that it would need to require _only_ the `uv.lock`, is that right?
