            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm working on a project that requires different versions of the same package for two separate environments. For example, I need <code>numpy==2.1.2</code> for one environment and <code>numpy==2.0.0</code> for another. However, UV does not seem to support this scenario, as it results in dependency resolution conflicts.</p>
<h3>Expected behavior</h3>
<p>Is there a way to specify different versions of the same package in separate optional dependencies without causing conflicts?</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a simplified example of my <code>pyproject.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">dependencies = [
    &quot;some-shared-lib&quot;,
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
project1 = [
    &quot;numpy==2.1.2&quot;,
    &quot;some-other-lib&quot;,
]

project2 = [
    &quot;numpy==2.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;some-other-lib&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>When I run uv sync with this configuration, I get <code>No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (python_full_version == '3.11.*')</code> error.</p>
<p>My current uv version is 0.4.19 installed from brew.</p>
<h3>Why this would be useful</h3>
<p>In cases like our repository, where different subprojects require different versions of the same package, not having this feature forces us to create a separate project for each subproject within the same repository. This approach is less convenient compared to having distinct optional dependencies that are exclusive to each other.</p>
