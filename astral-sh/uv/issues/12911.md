# 'Fat wheel' with all workspace packages?

---

_Issue opened by @Ben-grmbl on 2025-04-15 23:54_

### Question

We have been using [uv workspaces ](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) to split a monolith into multiple packages, to great success.

I was wondering though, when publishing a wheel, is there a way to publish a single wheel containing all the workspace packages? 


### Platform
Linux/Windows

### Version

0.6.14

Hmm, no, I don't think there's an easy way to do this, though it's an interesting idea.

Going to close for now, maybe revisit in the future...
