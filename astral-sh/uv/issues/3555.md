# Merge `pip_sync.rs` and `pip_install.rs`.

These used to be more different but they've since converged a lot. The difference now is just that we resolve with --no-deps and we uninstall extraneous packages.

Would this result in `pip sync` gaining various `pip install` args? e.g. `-r foo.txt`

I don't think so, the idea here is that we should combine our internal implementation to avoid duplicated logic.

It will enable us to add constraints though.
