            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was excited by the work done in this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2220">issue</a>, so I tried checking out main and testing uv to see if it improved performance on 1 package I found slow. Instead I found that using main uv now gives me a 401 error for installing any internal package with index server. Packages that previously worked to install now fail. I&#x27;ve bisected commits to find the first commit that fails is this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2241">commit</a>.</p>
<p>The exact command being run is <code>cargo run -- pip install --index-url=SOME_URL numpy</code>. The url has credentials in it. I do have .netrc file, but they are not intended for this installation especially when --index-url has all credentials needed already and did work prior to that pr. Similarly pip works for similar command <code>pip install --index-url=SOME_URL numpy</code> and I&#x27;d guess is sticking to credentials inside index-url over mixing it with .netrc.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the verbose logs from the first failing commit,</p>

<p>Like before, I&#x27;m happy to test out any specific commands/extra log statements that would be helpful.</p>
<p>edit: Credentials in netrc are not wrong though and maybe could be used somehow. The netrc looks like,</p>
<pre><code>machine registry.snapchat.com login LCAv1 password AUTH
</code></pre>
<p>while --index-url passed is <code>https://LCAv1:password@registry.snapchat.com/python/virtual</code>. Login and password are same either way, but guessing the two aren&#x27;t mixing as expected. I wonder if <code>/python/virtual</code> part is lost.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did one extra test and main works if I include index url without auth.</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install --index-url=https://LCAv1:password@registry.snapchat.com/python/virtual # Fail
uv pip install --index-url=https://registry.snapchat.com/python/virtual # Works
</code></pre>
<p>So it&#x27;s using netrc + index-url well if index-url doesn&#x27;t also have authenication data in it. But if they both have it even if it&#x27;s same password/login, then it fails.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The code for the netrc middleware is actually pretty small, and I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s failing to handle this. It <em>does</em> look like it would override the credentials though. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The credentials are identical. At work we have some script that we need to run daily to refresh our credentials. That script updates both .netrc and pip.conf with same credentials. I then manually copy the index url in pip.conf and pass it to uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can confirm there&#x27;s two headers for me too when it fails. I added the logs from this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2175/files">pr</a> you did before. I also tried <code>RUST_LOG=trace</code> but that doesn&#x27;t log headers.</p>
<p>For my use case it does not really matter which of the two credentials you pick. My personal intuition though is if url has credentials it&#x27;d be used first over a separate file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb - I think this might be impossible to do with middleware, because the reqwest middleware seems to be purely additive. We might need to remove this middleware, and add a <code>safe_copy_url_auth</code>-like method to every HTTP path that gets the relevant netrc credentials, and replaces the authorization header with them.</p>
