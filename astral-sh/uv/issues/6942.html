            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Just wondering, does <code>uv</code> support multiple environments (I see I can specify &quot;application dependencies&quot; and &quot;dev dependencies&quot;, but could I e.g. create an env for &quot;cpu&quot; and another for &quot;gpu&quot;)?</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help, and for this lib!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No we don&#x27;t have multiple environment support right now — the closest is probably to use different groups of <code>optional-dependencies</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for re-opening this, but is this still the case? If I want two environments in the same folder, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv-analysis` does not match the project environment path `.venv` and will be ignored
</code></pre>
<p>which doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @zanieb ,
<code>hatch</code> provides quite a convenient way to actually separate envrionments, not just groups.</p>
<p>This might be useful in scenarios when packages are incompatible and you need to use a couple of envs, or when you want cross-python testing. Would you consider this feature in future?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@asmith26 Is there any way currently to have multiple environments (eg. gpu, cpu) in the same folder? If not, this issue should be re-opened - this is a very common use case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am also interested in this. I need a venv to run preprocessing and another one to run model training. There are package conflicts that prevent me from doing both in the same env, which is generally fine by me as I do not nee to run these entrypoints in the same environment.</p>
