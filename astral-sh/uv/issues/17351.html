<p>Hi,
there is an obvious case which not sure was never considered.</p>
<p>When u have a workspace with several libraries and u call something like <code>uv sync --all-packages --all-groups</code>, you obtain a uv.lock file for the overall build. However, you no longer obtain a uv.lock file for each specific library in the workspace. This causes that, in case you would like to reuse a library in the workspace somewhere else, you don&#x27;t have a lockfile with the versions used and have to rebuild taking the risk of having different versions.</p>
<p>Is this intentional?
I think there would be somewhat a workaround doing <code>uv sync --package the_package</code> and then <code>uv export</code> but it&#x27;s not very nice.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes it&#x27;s intentional that we create a coherent lockfile for the entire workspace. The subsets selected during <code>uv sync</code> have no effect on the lockfile, the lockfile is always for all of the packages. If you need a subset of the lockfile, you can use <code>uv export --package ...</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for your answer. I understand your point, however, my understanding is that reproducibility is only guaranteed with <code>uv run --frozen</code></p>
<p>So I would find interesting to be able to produce the lock file of just that package as of <code>uv export --format uv.lock --package ...</code></p>
<p>And then be able to take that package standalone, the resulting uv lock file and execute <code>uv run --frozen ...</code></p>
<p>With the current exporter, uv only allows to use <code>uv pip install</code>, which feels like a bad practice to me.</p>
<p>Does my understanding make sense?

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use <code>uv run --package foo --frozen ...</code> and we&#x27;ll just use the relevant subset of the lockfile. You don&#x27;t need to create a subsetted lockfile.</p>
