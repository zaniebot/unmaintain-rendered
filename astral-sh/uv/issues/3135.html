            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now, when we see a requirement with a recursive extra, we just add that as a constraint and return the set of resolved constraints. We'll later ask for the requirements for that same package with the recursive extra, return the set of resolved constraints, and continue.</p>
<p>This is somewhat inefficient as we &quot;miss out&quot; on constraints that are applied by the recursive extra that we should be able to collect earlier than we currently are.</p>
<p>This is roughly what happened in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3127: there was an additional constraint that we didn't apply until much later than we should've.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's both bug and performance, since <em>not</em> doing this sometimes leads to use attempting to build packages that we should be able to skip (which can lead to failed resolutions).</p>
