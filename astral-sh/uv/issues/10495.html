            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To my eyes the progress bar makes more sense than a %, since it is a visual representation of %.</p>
<p>The filesize done/remaining for a &quot;big&quot; wheel gives my brain an idea of how long it should take since I know how fast I (usually) download things at.</p>
<p>Adding a % would clutter things to me.</p>
<p>What might be nicer is aligning the graphs and thus the sizes to the longest text in the dependency tree so that it &quot;lines up&quot;.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>personally, I think the size is more meaningful.
I'd say it's essential for large packages on slow connection, something like torch/tensorflow is above 1 GB and take hours to download on broadband.
it's not useful to show &quot;XX%&quot;, it's better to show X/YYY MB, so the user can understand the package is enormous and the internet connection is meh. showing a stale percentage will actually mislead users into thinking packages are not downloading.</p>
