            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>uv is not listed as an option in the setting for either &quot;Default env manager&quot; or &quot;default package manager&quot; in the new &quot;Python Environments&quot; VS Code extension:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7192eb-80e0-4030-b7e1-5ab35663e99d"></p>
<p>This is causing issues with third-party extensions that rely on the Python extension for various operations.</p>
Example
<p>In the GitHub Copilot extension, you may configure agents to use the extensions for basic tool calls:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d81d4a5-e7d8-4ec0-87d0-7be96ce5b0b7"></p>
<p>This defaults to pip, and it&#x27;s unclear if it&#x27;s possible to configure it to use uv, especially considering that the Python Environment extension appears to be specifically looking for other extensions:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My understanding is that uv is transparently used if pip is selected? e.g., see <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/issues/809">microsoft/vscode-python-environments#809</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Separately from that question, a &quot;Python Environments&quot; VS Code extension for uv is also tracked in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11314">astral-sh/uv#11314</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yes that is correct @zanieb it is used in the background! @karthiknadig thinking maybe we open an issue on the python envs repo and gather some feedback on if what makes sense for <code>uv</code> short term. I also got some pushback on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-environments/issues/809">microsoft/vscode-python-environments#809</a> from others like @brettcannon since it feels that doesn&#x27;t achieve what we want out of the experience and would be more confusing then helpful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, thanks @eleanorjboyd .  So does uv use venv under the hood? @zanieb?  I thought it used virtualenv, but maybe that was just for an early release.... maybe that was part of my confusion.  Definitely could be hallucinating that memory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv implements virtual environment creation natively, it doesn&#x27;t use venv or virtualenv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This extension is helpful, and having better <code>uv</code> support would be nice.</p>
<p>As it stands, you can add a package to the environment via the extension GUI, and it will disappear the next time <code>uv sync</code> is run. It&#x27;s obvious when you know it&#x27;s using <code>pip</code> and not updating <code>pyproject.toml</code>. However, it&#x27;s a hard-to-understand beginner trap, because it&#x27;ll work and then at some point it won&#x27;t. In devcontainers, it&#x27;ll happen in every rebuild or <code>uv sync</code>.</p>
<p>I talked about it in context in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12197">astral-sh/uv#12197</a>#issuecomment-3224624792, too.</p>
<p>Having package installs from the GUI work like you&#x27;d expect would be really nice for beginners.   It&#x27;s really nice using <code>uv add</code> and having important packages recorded and versions pinned via the lock file automatically (compared to <code>pip install ...</code>, <code>pip freeze</code>, copy-paste to <code>requirements.txt</code>, and edit down to important packages). Having all that be true via the GUI would be even easier for beginners, who are often initially wary of the terminal.</p>
<p>What I don&#x27;t know is whether this all also applies when VS Code suggests installing a package, but I would think so (e.g., paraphrasing, &quot;Hey, you need <code>ipykernel</code> if you want to use Jupyter notebooks. Do you want me to install it?&quot;).</p>
