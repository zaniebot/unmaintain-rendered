# uv init -p <path> confused me (I'm sorry)

I can't get this one to work:

```shell
UV_NO_CACHE=1 RUST_LOG=trace uv init -p /usr/bin/python uv_with_custom_python9
# DEBUG uv 0.3.4
# DEBUG Checking for Python interpreter at path `/usr/bin/python`
# TRACE Querying interpreter executable at /usr/bin/python
# Initialized project `uv-with-custom-python9` at `/home/user/ryes/uv_with_custom_python9`
```

```shell
cd uv_with_custom_python9/
uv sync
# Using Python 3.12.4
```

System python is not 3.12.4, so it's not using the /usr/bin/python interpreter that was specified. This seems to be the case even if I have default uv configuration (or only-managed).

Workaround: `uv python pin`

```shell
uv python pin /usr/bin/python
# Pinned `.python-version` to `/usr/bin/python`
uv sync
# Using Python 3.10.12 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python
```


uv 0.3.4

Ok, it sets requires-python correctly, but it's still a confusing interaction. `requires-python = ">=3.10"`. That's probably ok, feel free to close.
