# Getting version of all dependencies and transitive dependencies

---

### Question

In my pyproject.toml  I have specified my normal depedencies and dev dependencies.
I would like to list all my normal dependencies, incl. their transitive dependenceis, but not the dev dependencies.
Idealy uv.lock should be queries for this information. 

How would I do that?
