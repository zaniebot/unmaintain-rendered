# Yank warnings should display at the end

We display yank warnings during resolution, but not as a part of the summary at the end. We should probably do it there instead to avoid hiding the message.

~It looks like https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/pull/1253 isn't firing at all.~

We are showing the warnings from #1253 but they could be re-arranged.
