# Make `CachedEnvironment` robust to concurrent modifications

Right now, it's possible that we'd modify an environment that's in-use by another process.

I think I know what to do here but it's slightly tricky. We might be able to reuse it for tool installs though. We want to create the environment in one location, then relocate it to the final location (probably by symlinking so that it's atomic). But we can't do this naively because we need the interpreter in any installed scripts to use the path of the final location.
