            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Hello, I have recently switched over to uv, and I would like some guidance for best practices.</p>
<p>I am managing a private python package using uv. This package depends on a whl file that is not find on PYPI or similar online, I have created it locally.
Here is what i want, but i am not sure how to actually make it work.</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;name&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;description&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;whl file&quot;,
    &quot;package depending on whl file&gt;=0.6.0&quot;
]


[build-system]
requires = [&quot;uv_build&gt;=0.5&quot;, &quot;uv&gt;=0.8&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;uv_build&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>I need someone to be able to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pip install git+ssh://git@repo@tag</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this needs to install the whl file, the package depending on the whl file and my package.</p>
Platform
<p>Windows11</p>
Version
<p>uv 0.8.13 (ede75fe62 2025-08-21)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is unfortunately not properly supported by the wheel file format. The closest you can do is <code>package_name @ https://example.com/path/to/wheel/pkg-1-py3-none-any.whl</code> as requirement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay thank you.
Out of curiosity, why is this not supported? Technical reason or because not many people want it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Most registries have the rules that you can only point to other entries in the registry, for consistency and for security. As most people use registries, design and features are centered around them, and URL support exists mainly for specific use cases, mostly around pulling in source code instead of wheels, such as replacing a dependency with a Git repository in an application.</p>
