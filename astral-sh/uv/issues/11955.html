            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href="https://nx.dev/ci/features/affected"><code>nx affected</code></a> promises to &quot;run only tasks affected by a PR&quot;.</p>
<p>Having <code>uv tree</code> and <code>uv lock --check</code> makes me wonder if uv could replace this command?</p>
<p>If this is out of scope for <code>uv</code> proper, is there a suggested better tool or pattern?</p>
<h3>Context</h3>
<p>Non-workspace monorepos, where each project is pytest testable, but there is a root pyproject to oversee  and enforce code patterns (ruff, etc), python versions, and other shared contraints.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're interested in this, but we're far out from implementing it in a robust way.</p>
<p>The most relevant work here is https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13402 which is used by some people for test selection.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for sharing that link and validating the desire.</p>
<p>Even &quot;non-robust&quot; ways (packages with source lines in the lockfile, assuming they are all in projects with a <code>pyproject.toml</code>) are a great starting point!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Further amplification:  a place where UV can add value (the &quot;most missing piece&quot;) is by exposing more of the dependency graph, either as part of <code>lock</code> or <code>tree</code>.    This is orthogonal to the discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903.</p>
<p>Building a <code>run-many</code> task runner that uses that information might be a simple as calling <code>uv run --project</code> or <code>uv run --directory</code> for each line in that graph (bottom-up).</p>
<p>In particular, listing every pyproject.toml that would be involved in a particular uv lock scenario would be very helpful, and strictly better than <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p><code>uv -v lock --dry-run |&amp; grep static</code> has lines like</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG Found static `pyproject.toml` for: my-lib @ file:///Users/glind/some/monorepo/path`

</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've written a github action that compares to uv.lock files using <code>uv tree --frozen --no-depupe</code> on the current and base revision, plus the changed files (using <a href="https://github.com/Ana06/get-changed-files">Ana06/get-changed-files</a>).</p>
<p>The output of the action is a list of workspace actions that have been effected by the PR. This handles intra workspace dependencies. It runs in about 8 seconds in my monorepo of about ~35 python packages</p>
