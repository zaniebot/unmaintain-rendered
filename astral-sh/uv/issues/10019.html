            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can the project come up with a java-like maven packaging feature that can package a python project and its dependencies into a single file. The packaged file can be run directly using the python interpreter. I've used a few packaging tools: zipapp, shiv, pex. none of them are very good. I'm looking forward to seeing this feature in the project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I mean just packaging the source code and dependencies of a python project into a package, like the standard library zipapp, but zipapp will have problems with dependencies not being found when packaging some three-way dependencies. For example, when using zipapp package to package a fastapi development project, there will be a problem that pydantic's three-way dependency can't be found</p>
