            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What it says on the tin, really. Just like we have <code>src/myproj/__init__.py::hello()</code>, why not also have <code>tests/test_placeholder.py::test_hello()</code> and maybe even <code>tests/conftest.py</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No need to import anything, maybe just generate the <code>tests</code> folder and <code>test_hello.py</code> with a docstring in the file.</p>
<p>This should be the same whether someone was using pytest or unittest.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this might be better suited as an <strong>opt-in</strong> configuration in user level uv.toml (See: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8098) with the default behaviour being no skeleton test suite.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agree with @chrisrodrigue, and that is what I had in mind.</p>
<p>Although <code>uv</code> may well want to ship its own test framework implementation in future, realistically test case <em>discovery</em> is a pretty ossified interface -- I can't imagine a new test framework implementing something that is radically different from <code>pytest</code>. (excluding <code>pytest</code>-isms such as fixtures, parametrize [sic], etc. In any case the aim here is to give people a fundamental setup for simple 'run <code>hello()</code> and <code>assert</code> test cases, and they can grow the complexity however they see fit)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I started playing around with <code>uv</code> today as we are currently evaluating to make the switch from <code>poetry</code> to <code>uv</code> in our project.</p>
<p>I've played around with the different <code>uv init</code> options and was missing the <code>tests</code> folder or basically a equivalent folder structure of what i get from poetry:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">❯ poetry new --src foobar-delete-later
Created package foobar_delete_later in foobar-delete-later
❯ tree foobar-delete-later
foobar-delete-later
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── src
│   └── foobar_delete_later
│       └── __init__.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py 
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice to just add a tests/<strong>init</strong>.py as we probably can agree, that we all implement unit tests regardless of which framework we implement them in</p>
