Does it work if you execute `eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion bash)"` directly instead of in your rc file?

No.  This seems to be a known issue ([ref1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/hc2vo2/script_thas_makes_tab_completion_usable_in_wslwsl2/), [ref2](https://gist.github.com/Gordin/cb44429a25fd7d4d7ba73b970d68b5ab)).  I just wish it were fixed.

So it works it just takes 8+ seconds to appear?

No, it doesn't work at all for me.

That sounds different from the two references you provided then.

i am having the same exact issue on WSL 2

if anyone has any guidance on how to resolve this please post 

for clarity i am using bash as well and put it in my .bashrc file as told in the docs

I have specified the uv path in `.bashrc`, and it works. 🤔

```
...

eval "$($HOME/.local/bin/uv generate-shell-completion bash)"
```
