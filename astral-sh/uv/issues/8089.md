# Can't run uv init due to uv init not being a subcommand

_Issue opened by @askerrit on 2024-10-10 13:26_

Hi, I installed uv with:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

When I run uv init I get:

```
uv init example
error: unrecognized subcommand 'init'

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
```

`uv init` is not a command given by `uv`

```
uv
Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  pip      Resolve and install Python packages
  tool     Run and manage executable Python packages
  venv     Create a virtual environment
  cache    Manage the cache
  self     Manage the `uv` executable
  version  Display uv's version
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

What gives? 🤔

Fixed! I had 2 versions of uv installed.
