            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was trying to execute uv pip install requirements on latest version of uv. If there was a operation timeout error , uv didn't crash and instead just printed the error like below and said all is successful</p>

<p>Shouldn't it have crashed and asked user to re execute the install command here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's surprising. Hm. You might be seeing an error that was retried? Maybe it was a pre-fetch that we didn't need? It seems weird that we could fail a request and not propagate the error into a failure unless the request didn't matter for some reason.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I am not entirely sure, also I see this randomly obviously for some timeout reasons. If possible i will try to get you more verbose logs when it happens</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That'd be really helpful. You can set <code>RUST_LOG=uv=trace</code> (or <code>RUST_LOG=trace</code>) to increase verbosity.</p>
