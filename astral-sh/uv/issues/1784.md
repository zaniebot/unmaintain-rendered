# Any way to create a stdlib style venv instead of virtualenv style?

---

_Issue opened by @wimglenn on 2024-02-20 21:27_

I wonder if it is possible to ask `uv venv` for a [stdlib venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) style env instead of a [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) style one?

The latter registers a new `meta_path` importer which I don't really want in my envs (it makes every import statement a little bit slower).

```
$ uv venv -q .venv1
$ python3 -m venv .venv2
$ .venv1/bin/python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.meta_path)'
[<_virtualenv._Finder object at 0x7ffff6f99c10>, <class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>, <class '_frozen_importlib.FrozenImporter'>, <class '_frozen_importlib_external.PathFinder'>]
$ .venv2/bin/python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.meta_path)'
[<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>, <class '_frozen_importlib.FrozenImporter'>, <class '_frozen_importlib_external.PathFinder'>]
```

Thanks!

While it's true to that it makes the imports a tiny bit slower, I wonder how the stdlib avoids this finder. It exists to solve specific issues with distutils and setuptools.

Maybe they don't? Not sure.
My env is externally managed, and it's Python 3.12+ so the stdlib distutils is gone.
I don't have setuptools/distutils installed in the env so there is no issue for the finder to solve (but still the check happens on every import statement).

I have been trying to get rid of this finder in rye for a while and I have not found a good alternative. You can find some history and related links to it: https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/pull/1688

I really wish this hack was not necessary but I'm not aware of a much better one. It might be interesting to see if that `.pth` can be placed only when `setuptools` or `distutils` are in the venv.

I really don't like giving the user a flag to shoot themselves in the foot.
