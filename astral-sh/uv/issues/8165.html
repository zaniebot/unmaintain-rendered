Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>We very much like the &quot;uv tool&quot; command, because tools can be installed in a separate venv.</p>
<p>However, when working with a CI and multiple developers, everyone needs to know what the current version of the tool is.
It would be nice if the tool versions can be shared, e.g. via the pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>uv version:</p>
<pre><code>uv 0.4.18
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe we have a design for &quot;project-level tools&quot; in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3560. I think that will cover the use-case you're describing -- gonna merge into that issue.</p>
