            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First off, apologies if this has already been reported. I did have a look over the tracker and could not find a similar issue. I am using <code>uv==0.4.18</code>. The problem I have hit is that uv will silently add and install packages that are not compatible with the project's python version without throwing an error.</p>
<p>So for example, if I have a project that uses python 3.12 I can <code>uv add geojson==3.0.0</code> (this package isn't compatible with python 3.12) without error. I can run manually run <code>uv pip check</code> after installing and that will tell me that</p>
<pre><code>The package `geojson` requires Python &gt;=3.7, &lt;=3.11, but `3.12.3` is installed
</code></pre>
<p>(or whatever) but in my opinion, trying to <code>uv add</code>, <code>uv lock</code>, <code>uv sync</code> etc should throw a hard error if I try to add/lock/sync packages that are not compatible with the project python version. The behaviour should be similar to the &quot;No solution found when resolving dependencies&quot; error seen when trying to install 2 incompatible packages.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the problem, I have a made a small repo at https://github.com/chris48s/uv-repro with a minimal UV/python 3.12 in it and a GitHub Actions Workflow that demonstrates the issue https://github.com/chris48s/uv-repro/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml
Here's a link to a build: https://github.com/chris48s/uv-repro/actions/runs/11146126874/job/30977334223</p>
<p>If you can't see the individual outputs of the workflow steps, you can fork or copy the repo, push it up and run it yourself to get a repro you can inspect. That said, it should hopefully be pretty easy to reproduce locally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks more like a <code>uv pip check</code> bug. https://pypi.org/project/geojson/#data explicitly declares 3.12 support via the trove classifier and defines the python requirement as <code>&gt;=3.7</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You're right! I was looking at the latest pypi release and the upper bound got removed there. But 3.0.0 still has it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes. Note I picked explicitly <code>geojson==3.0.0</code> here for this repro because I was looking for something which has an upper bound constraint. In this case <code>&lt;=3.11</code></p>
<p>I get that there are a lot of packages out there with a caret constraint on python-requires (e.g: <code>^3.7</code>) that implies <code>&lt;4</code> (perhaps unintentionally) and it can be pragmatic to consider <code>python &gt;=3.7</code> and <code>python &gt;=3.7, &lt;4</code> to be &quot;the same&quot;, particularly when the project being managed is a package rather than an application.</p>
<p>A few thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you're going to say ignoring <code>&lt;4</code> is pragmatic, a package that explicitly declares <code>&gt;=3.7, &lt;=3.11</code> (for example) should perhaps be considered differently?</li>
<li>Ignoring upper-bound python constraints should be configurable IMO. Ideally you should opt in to ignoring it, but it should at least be possible to opt-out of this behaviour. Is there any option or configuration for this?</li>
<li>In the context where UV is managing an application with one target python version to install/deploy on rather than a package (which targets a range of python versions), not installing (or at least warning about) packages that have explicitly declared they are incompatible with that version seems particularly key.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I'm familiar with <em>the literature</em> :books:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/#pinning-the-python-version-is-special</li>
<li>https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12663</li>
</ul>
<p>etc</p>
