# Add `--constraint` flag to `uv add`

---

_Issue opened by @krishsai7 on 2025-01-11 00:44_

`--constraint` exists for `uv pip install` which has been terrific for adding dependencies to my environment but I would also really like the package I want to add to my project + constrained dependencies to my `uv.lock` file as well for deployment purposes. For example with Airflow, I would like to do something like
```
uv add apache-airflow --constraint https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.10.4/constraints-3.12.txt
```

Is this feasible? Thanks in advance.
