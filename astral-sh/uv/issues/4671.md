# `uv tool` commands should warn if the executable directory isn't on the `PATH`

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-06-30 22:03_

e.g. during `uv tool install` where the executable entry points are placed.

We can also consider some command in the style of `pipx ensurepath` that adds the executable directory the user's shell configuration.
