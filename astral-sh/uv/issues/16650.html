            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>in my project, i want certain dependencies to always allow prereleases, but not others. the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#prerelease"><code>prerelease</code></a> setting only seems to allow configuring this for every dependency.</p>
<p>i know i can just run <code>uv sync --upgrade-package packagename --prerelease allow</code>, but it would be more convenient if i could just configure this in my <code>pyproject.toml</code> since it's always the same packages that i want to allow pre-releases for.</p>
<p>this way, <code>uv sync --upgrade</code> will always resolve prerelease versions for the packages where they are allowed, without me having to manually update each package individually.</p>
<p>(similar issue: #15780)</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DetachHead/pytest-robotframework/">my project</a> is a pytest plugin that relies on the internals of both pytest and robotframework, so i like to always test it against prerelease versions of these two packages whenever they are available to ensure that i always stay on top of any changes that may break my plugin. but i want all my other dependencies to stick with the release versions.</p>
<p>maybe the config could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.prerelease]
robotframework = &quot;allow&quot;
pytest = &quot;allow&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can also just include a pre-release segment in your requirement for those packages, e.g., <code>foo&gt;=1.0a0</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>oh i didn't realize that makes it resolve any prerelease, not just prereleases of that specific version. thanks!</p>
