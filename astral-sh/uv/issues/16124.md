# uv sync can hang with network errors

_Issue opened by @ggilley on 2025-10-04 15:50_

### Summary

We had an issue the other night where a Runpod region was having network errors. In some cases, uv sync would error out. In other cases, uv sync would hang. I can't really give you any more details other than somewhere in the network stack, uv can get stuck. I'm just glad I have alerts when a job runs too long :-)

Maybe there's a way to force/simulate network errors. Here's our dependencies from our pyproject.toml in case that helps shake it out.

```

```

(We use unsafe-first-match because we have a private repo at cloudrepo.io and they don't support forwarding)

What index are you using? PyPI?

Can you share verbose logs?
