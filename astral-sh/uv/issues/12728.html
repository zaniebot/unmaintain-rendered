            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Running the standard install command that fetches the install shell script fails for me with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$&gt; curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
downloading uv 0.6.12 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
curl: (23) client returned ERROR on write of 16375 bytes
failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.6.12/uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
this may be a standard network error, but it may also indicate
that uv's release process is not working. When in doubt
please feel free to open an issue
</code></pre>
<p>I could not discover an issue on my side. Downloading the archive manually works fine. I worked around the issue now by reassigning the <code>$_file</code> variable in the shell script at the appropriate location to my manually downloaded version, so this seems like an issue in the release process as suggested by the error message.</p>
<p>I searched this error in the issues but could not find an existing issue. If this is a duplicate, I'd be happy to close it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! I have experienced similar problems recently as I tried installing uv after upgrading my Ubuntu to 24.04 (also using Python 12). I was able to install using <code>curl</code> after reinstalling the <code>curl</code> tool according to #11849 and this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11849#issuecomment-2691088757">solution</a></p>
<p>Basically just doing:
<code>sudo snap remove curl</code>
<code>sudo apt install curl</code></p>
