<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

Hello, I can successfully use my private index with credentials saved in .netrc when installing a private package as dependency in the `pyproject.toml` of my lib.
However when copying the same logic in a script header it does not resolve my index.

Running `uv run myscript.py` gives :

```
error: Package `myprivatepackage` references an undeclared index: `myindex`
```

Code snippet :
```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "myprivatepackage>=1.2.3",
# ]
# [tool.uv]
# [[tool.uv.index]]
# name = "myindex"
# url = "https://pypi.myindex.com/simple"
# explicit = true
# [tool.uv.sources]
# myprivatepackage = { index = "myindex" }
# ///
mycode
```

Is config more limited in the script header ? 
Thanks

This might just be a bug. I'll take a look today.
