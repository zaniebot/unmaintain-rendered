# Platform support tiers

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-01-27 10:55_

We should create a list of platforms we support and at which level.

Currently, we test on linux (x86) and mac (x86 and aarch64). We work towards adding windows x86 support. We build binaries for a number of manylinux platforms, but don't have CI or test machines for them.
