            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a private package registry, but would like to avoid replicating public dependencies from PyPi to the private registry or proxying requests for unknown packages through the private registry to PyPi. This can be configured easily by just setting the <code>UV_INDEX</code> env var - by default, <code>uv</code> automatically falls back to PyPi when a package is not found in the private registry.</p>
<p>However, when running the same package multiple times in a row with <code>uvx</code>, there is a noticeable pause during every execution for dependency resolution. It is especially noticeable for larger packages with many dependencies.</p>
<p>This seems to be caused by <code>uv</code> never caching negative responses from the private registry. Essentially the control header is ignored, when the private registry responds with HTTP404 for any of the dependencies (that are always expected to be on PyPi).</p>
<p>This is surprising behavior, as I expected <code>uv</code> to cache the 404 response (until max-age has elapsed) and immediately fall back to the default index (and use a cached response from the default index, if any). If negative caching is not supported by design (even behind a cli flag or env var), then I feel like <code>uv</code> should at least print a warning when it ignores the cache control header (instead of dropping it silently). The <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#customizing-cache-control-headers">documentation</a> could also be improved, since it's not clear what should happen in more complex cases.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>For the following example, I have built (<code>uv build --sdist</code>) and published (<code>uv publish</code>) a single package to the private registry: <code>private</code>.</p>
<h3>private/pyproject.toml</h3>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;private&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;example_pypi_package&quot;]  # public package, only on PyPi
</code></pre>
<p>The private registry sets the <code>Cache-Control</code> header to <code>public, max-age=600</code> in every response, if the request is not POST, PUT or PATCH.</p>

<p>The private registry is part of a proprietary program, so I am unable to share the source code.</p>
<h2>Log snippets</h2>
<p>With <code>UV_INDEX=http://__token__:***@localhost:8000/packages/pypi/simple/</code>, I executed <code>uvx -vvv private</code> twice in a row - the log below is from the second execution.</p>
