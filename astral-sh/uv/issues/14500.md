# Implement a concept of "trusted" projects

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-07-07 22:27_

### Summary

Right now, we can't do things like allow `.env` files (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1384#issuecomment-3046545409) or insecure hosts  to be defined in the `pyproject.toml` because we see it as a security issue if a _project_ is making decisions about sensitive fields without opt-in.

We should allow users to opt-in to trusting a project, and allow these fields to be read from the `pyproject.toml`.

### Example

e.g.,

```
$ uv sync
This project includes security sensitive settings:
- native-tls
- env-files

If you trust this project, you can allow these options to be loaded. Choose an option to continue:
- [ ] Exit
- [ ] Ignore these settings
- [ ] Allow these settings until they change
- [ ] Always allow sensitive settings in this project
```
