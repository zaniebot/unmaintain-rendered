            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have the following issue:</p>
<p>I have a setup where those <code>extras_require</code> are defined in <code>setup.py</code> but when running
<code>uv pip install -e '.[test]'</code></p>
<p>it says</p>
<pre><code>warning: The package `mypackage @ file://[...]` does not have an extra named `test`.
</code></pre>
<p>and also doesn't install any dependencies other then the package itself, not even the things in <code>requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p>This is the case since v0.2.5, it works fine in 0.2.4.</p>
<p>Original post: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2828#issuecomment-2185769691</p>
<p>I have not managed to create a full reproduction setup so far, but I got a bit closer:</p>
<p>The reproduction repository https://github.com/karfau/uv-install-issue contains a script <code>test.sh</code> which</p>
<ul>
<li>drops the venv folder if it exists</li>
<li>configures a virtual env, I tested with both python 3.8 (because that is what the original repository uses), but the behavior doesn't change with python 3.12</li>
<li>installs uv in the version passed as the first argument</li>
<li>installs the dependencies using <code>uv --verbose pip install -e '.[test]'</code></li>
<li>lists the content of <code>venv/bin</code> to check if the dependencies have been installed</li>
</ul>
<p>In the reproduction it prints the warning (since 0.2.0 if the pyproject.toml contains a <code>[project]</code> section) <strong>and always installs all dependencies</strong>.</p>
<p>So maybe the warning was leading me into a wrong direction, but in the original repository the warning is not present when running those steps using uv 0.2.4 but the warning is printed when using uv 0.2.5 and it is only installing the editable package but nothing from <code>install_requires</code> or <code>extra_requires</code>.</p>
<p>here is the <code>--verbose</code> output in the affected repository, if you have any idea in what direction to continue testing, let me know</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem with your setup is that you have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> with a <code>[project]</code> section, but you haven't declared any of the metadata as dynamic. Per the spec, if you omit <code>dependencies</code> from the <code>[project]</code> section, that's equivalent to <code>project.dependencies = []</code>.</p>
<p>You should add <code>dynamic = [&quot;dependencies&quot;, &quot;optional-dependencies&quot;]</code> to your <code>pyproject.toml</code>, under the <code>[project]</code> section.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh thx, a lot, that resolves the initial problem in the original repository.</p>
<p>It's still not clear to me if this is intended as a change in behavior and what <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/0.2.4...0.2.5">change between 0.2.4 and 0.2.5</a> causes this.
And why it behaves different in our repository than in the reproduction (were the dependencies are always installed even without this addition).</p>
<p>I'm happy to continue to experiment with the reproduction if I have any trace of what could be the reason, but currently I'm out of ideas (and capacity to find more ideas on my own).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It’s intended behavior because we added an optimization to read the metadata directly when it’s statically declared. And in this case, the metadata is technically statically declared (even though you want it to be dynamic).</p>
