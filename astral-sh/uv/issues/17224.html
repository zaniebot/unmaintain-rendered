            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks useful, but this issue seems to be promoting a third-party extension rather than proposing a change to uv itself. Would it make more sense to move this to Discussions or link it from documentation instead of tracking it as an enhancement?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think promoting your personal project in a GitHub Issue is the right choice. You should use social media to promote it and gather community feedback, rather than doing it here, where the audience is mostly just contributors or people troubleshooting issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you’ve opened four issues for this. Please refrain from spamming. The fact that there isn't an official uv VS Code extension yet suggests it’s either not a necessity or simply a low priority at this time.</p>
