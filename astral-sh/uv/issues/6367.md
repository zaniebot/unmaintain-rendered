# `--no-build-isolation` has no effect in `uv add `

---

_Issue opened by @kabouzeid on 2024-08-21 18:52_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

The following works.
```
uv add torch
uv pip install --no-build-isolation "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
```

While the following does **not** work. It seems like `--no-build-isolation` has no effect for the `add` subcommand.
```
uv add torch
uv add --no-build-isolation "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
```

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'

  Caused by: This error likely indicates that git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git depends on torch, but doesn't declare it as a build dependency. If git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git is a first-party package, consider adding torch to its `build-system.requires`. Otherwise, `uv pip install torch` into the environment and re-run with `--no-build-isolation`.
