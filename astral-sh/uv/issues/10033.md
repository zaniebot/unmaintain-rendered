# `uv run -c` doesn't propagate arguments

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-12-19 17:02_

> Also, is it not supported to read a script from stdin and pass along command line arguments at the same time?
> 
> I can't get this to work:
> ```console
> $ echo '# /// script
>      # requires-python = ">=3.10"
>      # dependencies = [
>      #     "urllib3",
>      # ]
>      # ///
> 
>      import sys; print(sys.argv)' | uv run - 1 2 3
> Reading inline script metadata from `stdin`
> ['-c']
> ```
> Placing a `--` before or after `-` doesn't help either.
