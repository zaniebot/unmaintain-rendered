            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>ok, so, this is too opinionated but I think this will be a cute little configuration option for uv to invent.</p>
<p>=========</p>
<p>Background:
Currently, a typed project, more specifically a 'library' project, should advertise that its typed in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>Typing :: Typed</code> trove classifier to aide in PyPI search</li>
<li>a <code>py.typed</code> 'marker' file in the project to signal type checkers to use the library's type hints in downstream usage
(this is pretty basic and known, just putting it here for completeness sake)</li>
</ul>
<p>=========</p>
<p>Feature Request:
Introduce a configuration option where <em>uv</em> would add the <code>py.typed</code> file when building the project.</p>
<p>Rationale:</p>
<ul>
<li>This configuration would make the 'typed' metadata available in <code>pyproject.toml</code> (where it belongs) along with the <code>Typing :: Typed</code> classifier, to one place. (I guess the marker file was chosen so that type checkers won't have to read the whole <code>pyproject.toml</code> for just one field lol)</li>
<li>This is a marker file, with this configuration enabled, its absence won't cause any confusion or breakage. It's not a source code file, so it shouldn't be PERSISTENTLY in the source code directory!</li>
<li>My personal opinion/taste: having an empty file with a weird extension in the source directory for a very specific use-case which is arguably a project metadata more than anything, just doesn't sit right with me.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The empty <code>py.typed</code> is a recommendation from Python itself, I'm hesitant to make a different choice in the uv build backend: https://typing.python.org/en/latest/guides/libraries.html#marking-a-package-as-providing-type-information</p>
<p>If you want this file to be generated, this should be a Python packaging proposal, so the configuration is shared between tools, similar to e.g. entrypoints.</p>
