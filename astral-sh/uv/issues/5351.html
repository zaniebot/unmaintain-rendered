            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>We unfortunately ran into a nasty issue with uv seemingly incorrectly handling the repository cache for a newly released package (in this case <code>importlib-metadata==8.1.0</code> which was released this morning)</p>
<p>Poetry happily installs the version (assuming they are handling cache differently), however UV fails to compile, complaining <code>8.1.0</code> is not found. The previous version <code>8.0.0</code> is found as expected.</p>
<p>Removing the cache or running without cache succeeds.
Now locally this would be fine, however this is happening in our CI environment, which is using a mix of <code>uv</code> and <code>poetry</code>, dropping the cache which is shared across builds would work as a one-time, however is not sustainable of course.</p>
<p>Struggling to investigate why UV might behave like this, any help is appreciated.
Compiling all the info below with my current investigation.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>If I understand the output correctly, it believes the cache file for importlib-metadata to be up to date.
I am however unsure how to parse the cache headers / any other information that would indicate why UV thinks so.</p>
<p>Below a manual head request for that index
<code>HEAD https://&lt;internal-repo&gt;/repository/pypi-group/simple/importlib-metadata/</code>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8228bb24-7b92-40e1-b6fb-8b4934f1fd28" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The repo does have the <code>8.1.0</code> (we essentially have a pass through mirror using nexus with very minimal caching, should have gotten the new release shortly after it was pushed on PyPi)
<code>GET https://&lt;internal-repo&gt;/repository/pypi-group/simple/importlib-metadata/</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-html">...

<p>Now the plot thickens, when running without cache, uv correctly installs / compiles the package (as expected I assume)</p>

<p>Now dropping all of my cache would probably resolve the issue as well, however more interestingly, dropping just the importlib-metadata cache does <strong>not</strong> resolve the issue.</p>

<p>So far so good, however running the original command again, it clearly still has a cache file relating to importlib-metadata (...\simple-v9\dcb525f06f275a06\importlib-metadata.rkyv, not familiar with how to read rust .rkyv, however opening with text editor clearly shows there's several importlib-metadata version in there, no 8.1.0). Would expect this to be deleted, but then maybe that's me misunderstanding how some internal work.</p>

<p>So two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does UV think the cache is still valid / how do I go ahead with debugging? (fairly important as this is impacting CI builds using fresh versions)</li>
<li>Why does UV still persist this <code>*.rkyv</code> file despite deleting the cache for the package? (not so important)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any help is massively appreciated as always</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, as background, we respect HTTP caching headers for the simple API responses (so, e.g., we cache PyPI responses for 10 minutes, per their headers). Are you seeing this behavior consistently, or was it only for the first 10 minutes after publishing? (I assume the latter.) Either way, running <code>uv cache clean</code> should've resolved the issue -- I think there might a bug there, that we're missing the <code>.rkyv</code> files. I'll fix that now.</p>
<p>Is there any <code>Cache-Control</code> header on your proxy response? Perhaps some header is indicating that we can cache it indefinitely.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding on, after running the compile once with <code>--refresh-package importlib-metadata</code> following all the previous steps, it does compile correctly.
Subsequent calls are now working as intended, assuming the cache was refreshed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the thorough write-up! Some people on the team are more familiar with the cache and can probably weigh in on what's going on, but hopefully I can unblock you quickly.</p>
<p>Unlike pip, uv respects the <code>max-age</code> cache response from the registry which is generally 10 minutes (context on that in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/505). If you attempt to install the package within that range, we will use the cached version instead of a newly released one. Best practice for ensuring the latest version of a package is used is to use <code>--refresh-package &lt;name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Did this happen outside that range?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The nexus repo response doesn't set any cache header from what I can see (sent the response in the screenshot) but maybe i'm not looking at the right thing.
Both me and my dev-ops team are a bit puzzled, we found configuration for the cache control towards PyPi but not for incoming requests (to our repo) itself.</p>
<p>We noticed this first occurrence about 30 minutes after the <code>importlib-metadata==8.1.0</code> was released and were still running into the same issue about 3 hours later at which point we decided to drop the whole cache in our CI environment.
That did &quot;resolve&quot; the issue, however could pop up again.
Are there any tools available to dig into the cache to understand which cache headers etc might UV have seen?
When this happens again (will try to replicate over the coming days), not sure how I could go further with the debugging</p>

Unfortunately the cache got cleaned using the <code>--refresh-package</code>, however the output might still be helpful</p>

Not sure how to read this, however it looks like it keeps the cached response based on a 200? or does that mean its going to cache the response because it was successful.</li>
<li>However next line then mentions it found a fresh response for the same request</li>
<li>Reading through all the logs, not seeing any info relating to cache control headers, merely <code>is storable because its response has a heuristically cacheable status code 200</code></li>
<li>Also saw this warning, does that mean our nexus repo does not support range requests or uv in the configuration we are running with does not support it? <code>WARN uv_distribution::distribution_database Range requests unsupported when fetching metadata for importlib-metadata==8.1.0; downloading wheel directly (range requests are not supported)</code></li>
<li>We are running nexus repo version <code>3.57.1-03</code> from July 2023 (about a year behind) in case that's relevant. Looked through all newer releases and could not find any references to the <code>Accept-Ranges</code> header. In the index responses headers am not seeing that header set.

<p>We are running nexus repo version 3.57.1-03 from July 2023 (about a year behind) in case that's relevant. Looked through all newer releases and could not find any references to the Accept-Ranges header. In the index responses headers am not seeing that header set. Assuming we could get some additional performance boost here if that's enabled to reduce network usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, if your index supports range requests, we can resolve faster. Even better are the <code>.metadata</code> files that PyPI exposes, like: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ef/a6/62565a6e1cf69e10f5727360368e451d4b7f58beeac6173dc9db836a5b46/iniconfig-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>interesting not seen this. Nexus repo definitely does not have support for these unfortunately.
Will open a request with our point of contact to further explore the <code>Accept-Ranges</code> and <code>Cache-Control</code> headers for Python repos in Nexus, from what I can tell it supports neither currently.</p>
<p>Either way, keen to get some further input from you guys whenever available, it seems possible uv is not handling caching for repo's without Cache-Control headers properly / is too relaxed with it's TTL for these cases.
Will feed back if this pops up again with hopefully more decisive trace logs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From a quick glance, I'm not seeing anything interesting with respect to the HTTP cache semantics we have implemented. It seems to detect a &quot;fresh&quot; response without issue, which means, &quot;the data we have cached is fresh after considering HTTP cache headers.&quot; And thus, a &quot;fresh&quot; response is one that can be used.</p>
<p>The only thing that doesn't seemed to be cached is this:</p>
<pre><code>0.013232s   0ms TRACE uv_client::cached_client No cache entry exists for \\?\&lt;path-to-cache&gt;\wheels-v1\index\dcb525f06f275a06\importlib-metadata\importlib_metadata-8.1.0-py3-none-any.msgpack
</code></pre>
<p>But that's not in our HTTP semantics. That's just a result of not being able to find any cached file for that wheel.</p>

<p>Same behavior, new version for several hours (this time &gt;~12), but UV thinking it's cache is up to date.</p>
<p>Got the full trace output this time.
Realized there was a new version <code>0.2.28</code> available, so upgraded and ran again without making any cache change which was now successful.
Included both full verbose + trace outputs below.</p>
<p>Going through the release notes, seeing multiple bug fixes that could be cache related however not sure.
Something in the release seemed to have fixed this particular issue.</p>
<p>Even more interesting, downgrading to <code>0.2.27</code> fails again, following the successful compile on <code>0.2.28</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since there isn't an <code>Expires</code> header or any cache control headers, I <em>believe</em> <code>uv</code> is going through its &quot;heuristic&quot; for how long a response should be fresh for before calling it stale, and this is based on the last-modified header: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/cb505d24f80725ccdfb8625acc0ce418d99bf63c/crates/uv-client/src/httpcache/mod.rs#L946-L950</p>
<p>We could probably use better logging here, particularly around choices made based on heuristics. And perhaps the heuristic ought to be tweaked. (Assuming I've diagnosed the problem correctly.)</p>
<p>Of course, the HTTP server should probably have better cache headers, but <code>uv</code> should probably also have better heuristics if possible. (And at least log something that indicates the problem.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This has popped up again just now in our CI, however was not able to reproduce locally i'm afraid.
Looked through the heuristic logic in detail and think uv is caching too aggressively.</p>
<p>See the below, think this is roughly what happened with <code>importlib-metadata 8.1.0</code> initially (however no way to be sure).
https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/#history
<code>8.1.0</code> was published on Jul 23rd
The previous version <code>8.0.0</code> was published about a month earlier on Jun 25th</p>
<p>If UV retrieves the simple index for <code>importlib-metadata</code> on i.e. Jul 22nd (before 8.1.0 was published), the heuristic duration would be set to the below</p>
<pre><code>last_modified_header = &quot;Tue, 25 Jun 2024 07:01:23 GMT&quot;
date_header = &quot;Mon, 22 Jul 2024 07:01:23 GMT&quot;
interval = date_header - last_modified_header
percent= 10
duration = (interval * percent) / 100
</code></pre>
<p>Duration in this case would be set to <code>2 days, 16hours</code>!!
So the new <code>importlib-metadata</code> release 8.1.0 which came out the next day (23 Jul) is not found, as uv is still considering the simple cache as fresh.</p>
<p>Believe this to be way to aggressive, as quite common for packages to be updated a lot less frequently, which could cause the cache to last for weeks.</p>
<p>Think there could be two possible changes here</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users setting a ceiling for the heuristic, i.e. 600 seconds, which would match the cache control header on PyPi.</li>
<li>Or outright allow overwriting the heuristic with a static duration to have a consistent cache of i.e. 600 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>We are still awaiting nexus to come back to us regarding implementing proper cache control headers, however have not got strong hopes here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We own the HTTP caching semantics here, so we could also just use a hard-coded duration instead of trying to get too smart with the heuristic. @charliermarsh What do you think about just hard-coding 600 seconds as the time we treat things as &quot;fresh&quot; in this specific case?</p>
