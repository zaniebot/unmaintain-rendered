            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>How to migrate a uv project from an external network Ubuntu server to an offline internal network Ubuntu environment? The project paths are exactly the same, both in /app/api_server_test/. In the external network, a virtual environment was created using uv with Python 3.11.12, and all dependent packages were installed after activation. The entire project was compressed into a 7zip file and copied to the internal network server for decompression. In the external network, executing &quot;uv run main.py&quot; runs normally, but in the internal network, the following error occurs:</p>
<p>error: Querying Python at <code>/app/api_server_test/.venv/bin/python3</code> failed with exit status exit status: 127</p>
<h2>[stderr]
/app/api_server_test/.venv/bin/python3: error while loading shared libraries: /app/api_server_test/.venv/bin/../lib/libpython3.11.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</h2>
<p>external network Platform: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
offline internal network platform: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.16</p>

<p>Hello, i also meet the same situation.
Does copying venvs is fine, or copy other files (pyproject.toml, .python-version) are also required ?</p>
<p>( In my case, the server is completely <strong>offline</strong>, it's impossible to reinstall the python package ; so i want to make sure <strong>copy</strong> what kind of files can help me reproduce the enviroment.</p>
<p>Any suggestion are appreciated !!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can copy the virtual environment by itself, it depends how you want to run commands in the environment — i.e., if you want to use <code>uv run</code> you might want the project, etc.</p>
<p>In general, you can also follow a strategy like we do in our multistage Docker file example https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example/blob/fa761744819c05f4ce207bde1f0a396f6be3915f/standalone.Dockerfile#L35-L39 and just copy across a managed Python version along with the environment. It just needs to be at the same absolute path.</p>

<p>i see, TKS for your quick reply!!
As your suggestion, Dockerfile COPY venv seems a promise solution ~</p>
