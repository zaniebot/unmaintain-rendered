<p>Currently, the <code>eccodes</code> library&#x27;s latest release, v. 2.39.0, is released without source or manylinux builds. It&#x27;s an error on their side for sure, and I&#x27;ve created an issue in their repo. However, in spite of this, <code>uv</code> still resolves this latest problematic version when locking, and it means that <code>eccodes</code> can&#x27;t be added without version specifier:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv add eccodes
Resolved 7 packages in 821ms
error: Distribution `eccodes==2.39.0 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can&#x27;t be installed because it doesn&#x27;t have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
</code></pre>
<p>Specifying the old version (which has the right files on PyPI) works fine. However, in my projects I don&#x27;t depend directly on eccodes, it&#x27;s somewhere down the dependency tree, so I&#x27;d prefer not having to explicitly pin it in my pyproject file.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure if it should be considered a bug in uv, but it&#x27;s certainly annoying that a dependency somewhere in the tree can create this kind of disturbance.</p>
<p>Likely related (don&#x27;t know if considered dupe):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, this is expected, though it&#x27;s understandably not a great experience. It&#x27;s another case of the problem I outlined here: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5182">astral-sh/uv#5182</a>#issuecomment-2237858277. I&#x27;d prefer to track in that issue. I think right now, you may want to set a constraint on your end (with <code>constraint-dependencies</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Returning to this because I just had the issue again with another ecmwf library, <code>eckitlib</code>, which in the latest version only has macos wheels. Since #5182 was closed, I believe the new tracking issue is #9711.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv now supports <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#required-environments">required environments</a> for which wheels must exist for a version to be selected, this should match the original problem well.</p>
