# Homebrew-installed uv gets permission errors trying to write to /.local/share/uv

---

_Issue opened by @jasonmclaren on 2024-12-14 01:08_

I installed `uv` using Homebrew v4.4.11 on MacOS 14.7.1.

`uv --version` returns `uv 0.5.8 (Homebrew 2024-12-11)`.

I enabled bash completions by sourcing the completions file provided by the homebrew recipe.

When I run `uv python install 3.13`, I get this error:

    error: failed to create directory /.local/share/uv/python: Read-only file system (os error 30)

I also tried `UV_PYTHON_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/share/uv/python uv python install 3.13`, and got the same error.

Is there some other configuration setting I need to set?

Sorry, this was user error.

I had the following set in my .bashrc (note the typo):

    export XDG_DATA_HOME=$HOOME/.local/share

Once I corrected this (using `$HOME`), `uv` installed python in `$HOME/.local/share/uv/python`.
