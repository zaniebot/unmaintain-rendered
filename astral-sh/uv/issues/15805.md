# A way to remove old Python versions

---

_Issue opened by @adamchainz on 2025-09-12 09:21_

### Summary

After using uv to install all active Python versions and keep them updated for a while, I found my `~/.local/share/uv/python` directory consuming 3GB. This includes many versions I won't use again, like the alpha and beta versions of 3.14.

I couldn't find an easy way to remove all but the latest version of each Python (including freethreading variants), so I found it easier to blast them *all* away with `uv python uninstall --all` and then re-running my automated install process ([using Ansible](https://github.com/adamchainz/mac-ansible/blob/main/roles/adam_mac/tasks/installs.yml#L63-L79)).


This clearout saved me ~2.3GB of disk space.

This is a bit unintuitive and wastes time and bandwidth. It would be nicer if there were a way to prune down the installed Python versions to just the latest of each release, or something like that.

### Example

```
$ uv python uninstall --outdated
Searching for Python installations
Uninstalled 7 outdated Python versions in 14.45s:
 - cpython-3.9.20-macos-aarch64-none
 - cpython-3.9.21-macos-aarch64-none
 - cpython-3.9.22-macos-aarch64-none
...
```

That makes sense, thanks!

The only problem is that it's plausible these are in use by virtual environments — we cant't track all usage.

I could see this become part of the upgrade command, such as `uv python upgrade --uninstall` removing all older version (with the caveat that venvs may still use the interpreter).
