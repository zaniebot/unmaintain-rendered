            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After fully switching to workspaces in Airflow, we are using <code>uv sync --resolution lowest-direct</code> to check if our 90+ providers have properly set lower-bounds. This works really nicely now after refactoring some of the code and ti will work even better after https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48223 where we complete the refactoring and switch to <code>uv</code> completely.</p>
<p>While runnign the tests I have found however that in a few cases we accidentally missed to put lower bounds in some of our dependencies - in both &quot;production&quot; and &quot;development dependencies and we got the warnings:</p>
<pre><code>warning: The direct dependency `microsoft-kiota-abstractions` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution lowest` to avoid using outdated versions.
warning: The direct dependency `pgvector` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution lowest` to avoid using outdated versions.
warning: The direct dependency `rich` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution lowest` to avoid using outdated versions.
warning: The direct dependency `ruff` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution lowest` to avoid using outdated versions.
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to force failure in such case and treat lack for lower-binding as a failure.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to add a flag to switch the warning into e failure?</p>
