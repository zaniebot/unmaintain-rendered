# [compatibility] install tgz extension

_Issue opened by @mobidyc on 2024-09-05 13:18_

Hi,

Installing a .tgz extension fails in error using uv

uv 0.4.4
python 3.10

```shell
# uv pip install acmeapi.tgz
error: Failed to parse: `acmeapi.tgz`
  Caused by: Expected path (`acmeapi.tgz`) to end in a supported file extension: `.whl`, `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.xz`, or `.tar.zst`
acmeapi.tgz
^^^^^^^^^^
```

no issue using `pip`

We should add all of these: https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/111eed14b6e9fba7c78a5ec2b7594812d17b5d2b/src/pip/_internal/utils/filetypes.py#L9 (we already support them, I mean the extensions).

@mikeleppane -- Just let us know if you're not able or don't plan to get to it (or need some pointers :)), so we can prioritize accordingly.
