# managing project tools with a new `uv tool sync` subcommand

---

_Issue opened by @itcarroll on 2025-05-02 15:32_

### Summary

I would like `uv` to help manage my frequently used tools by 1) knowing about the tools (with their version constraints and extras) used in development for a project and 2) ensuring that matching tools are available.

### Example

For instance, suppose I have a  `pyproject.toml` that includes a "tools" dependency group.

```toml
[dependency-groups]
tools = [
    "dvc[s3]>=3",
]
```

The name "tools" wouldn't be special, as there would be a new setting like:
```toml
[tool.uv]
install-tools = ["tools"]
```

When I am working in this project, I would execute the new subcommand.
```shell
$ uv tool sync
```

As a result, I would get
```shell
$ dvc --version
3.59.1
```

Which would be great, because trying to use a 2.x version of `dvc` or one without `s3` extra would not work at all.

I'm sure there are better people than me to improve on the useage, but I hope that example demonstrates the goal. Being able to easily share the tools I want my collaborators to have available this way would help me move away from installing tools in project virtual environments, which seems common but annoying nowadays.

Thank you for a great tool!

This overlaps with

- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12533
- "Project level tools" from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3560

Thanks, @zanieb. It looks like `uv tool sync` (along with `uv tool add` and `uv tool remove`) were considered but not included in the original implementation of `uv tool`. Perhaps with the `depency-groups` table, there is now much less potential for confusion. I'm glad there is support for something similar expressed in #12533. I'll leave this open though, as I don't think my description duplicates that one. But no worries if you prefer to close this one!

Yeah we sort of wanted to wait for the `dependency-groups` table to move forward on a design there. I think there's still some design work to be done before we can ship something, but definitely agree it will be nice to have!
