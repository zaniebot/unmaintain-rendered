# Add a dedicated help menu for `uvx`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-02 23:03_

Instead of displaying exact menu from `uv tool run`, we should refer to `uvx` and note that it's an alias of `uv tool run`.

I'm not entirely sure how we'll go about this yet, but perhaps a hidden `uv tool x` or `uv x` command that we invoke from `uvx` instead of `uv tool run`?
