uv vesrion: uv 0.4.29 (85f9a0d0e 2024-10-30)
os: windows 10

pyproject.toml example
```
[project]
dependencies = [
    "cachetools==5.5.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
linters = [
    "ruff==0.7.2",
]
```

how install only ruff using `uv sync`? without [pip interface](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/#the-pip-interface)

If you want to install _only_ one group, you need to use `dependency-groups` rather than `project.optional-dependencies`:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "cachetools==5.5.0",
]

[dependency-groups]
linters = [
    "ruff==0.7.2",
]
```

Then you'd run `uv sync --only-group linters`.
