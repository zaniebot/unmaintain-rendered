            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m trying a setup, when the workspace has a <code>requires-python</code> value while a non-workspace has a different (more loose) constraints, but requires a package from the workspace. It seems like when I installing that latter, non-workspace package, the workspace <code>requires-python</code> is not being observed.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve set up a project pretty much exactly as it&#x27;s described in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/">workspace documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>albatros</code> is root</li>
<li><code>bird-feeder</code> is a workspace package`,</li>
<li><code>seeds</code> is an excluded package, but it depends on <code>bird-feeder</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This latter is set up like this</p>
<pre><code># ... snip
dependencies = [&quot;bird-feeder&quot;]

[tool.uv.sources]
bird-feeder = { workspace = true }
</code></pre>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>albartros</code> sets <code>requires-python = &#x27;&gt;=3.13&#x27;</code>; this applies to <code>bird-feeder</code> as well</li>
<li><code>seeds</code> sets <code>requires-python = &#x27;&gt;=3.10&#x27;</code> and is not part of the workspace</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#x27;s the test setup as a repo: https://github.com/imrehg/uv-workspace-debug</p>
Expected behaviour
<p><code>seeds</code> wouldn&#x27;t install with Python 3.10/11/12, only with 3.13, due to the <code>bird-feeder</code> requirement, that should force the workspace&#x27;s 3.13 Python requirements</p>
Observed behaviour
<p><code>seeds</code> happily installs with 3.10, including</p>
<pre><code>❯ cd packages/seeds
❯ uv sync --python 3.10

</code></pre>
<p>While going into <code>bird-feeder</code> folder to install just that:</p>
<pre><code>❯ cd ../bird-feeder
❯ uv sync --python 3.10
Using CPython 3.10.15
error: The requested interpreter resolved to Python 3.10.15, which is incompatible with the project&#x27;s Python requirement: `&gt;=3.13`

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So after cloning that repo, in <code>packages/seeds</code>, I do see the failure:</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv sync --python 3.10

Creating virtual environment at: .venv
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because the current Python version (3.10.15) does not satisfy Python&gt;=3.13 and bird-feeder==0.1.dev4+ge5c6435 depends on Python&gt;=3.13, we can conclude that bird-feeder==0.1.dev4+ge5c6435 cannot be used.
      And because only bird-feeder==0.1.dev4+ge5c6435 is available and your project depends on bird-feeder, we can conclude that your project&#x27;s requirements are unsatisfiable.

<p>That seems right. You&#x27;re seeing different behavior?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised that this works:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;seeds&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
authors = [
    { name = &quot;Gergely Imreh&quot;, email = &quot;gergely.imreh@faculty.ai&quot; }
]
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;bird-feeder&quot;]

[tool.uv.sources]
bird-feeder = { workspace = true }

[project.scripts]
seeds = &quot;seeds:main&quot;

[build-system]
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I think you should get an error there because you&#x27;re asking for <code>bird-feeder = { workspace = true }</code>, but that&#x27;s intended for dependences in the <em>same workspace</em>.</p>

<p>Yeah, that workspace I needed to add, to my surprise too, as otherwise <code>seeds</code> was just failing some other wasys (not finding some of the other packages). I think the workspaces example doc is not fully flashed out (in this area of &quot;package excluded from the workspace but still need to use packages from the workspace&quot; config).</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback, gonna try out the changes!
I&#x27;m the first one making use of <code>uv</code> workspaces in our org, so trailblazing it is... :D</p>
