# "Why is it fast" documentation

---

_Issue opened by @valentincalomme on 2024-09-02 12:16_

I've been trying to track down some info related to "why is uv" faster than `pip` and I was somehow successful. I found that this is often the first question I get when I mention `uv` to people. I say "it's faster than `pip`" and people say "yeah, but how, you're still downloading the same stuff?".

I would find it extremely helpful to have some section explaining the performance gains.

Obviously, no need to delve into `rust`-specific optimization or even internal secrets, but I think it would be great to have some sort of blog-like section explaining why `uv` works as fast as it does

I think this probably makes more sense as a blog post than documentation that we maintain, but yeah it'd be cool to write! cc @konstin who did some work on this previously.

I'm also giving two talks on this over the next two months, which will be public and recorded.
