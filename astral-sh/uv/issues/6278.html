            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Those are both out of scope for this issue — though <code>uv build</code> should be trivial once <code>uv publish</code> is set up. See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1510 for the relevant tracking issue there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi all! I'm neither a maintainer of PyPI nor <code>twine</code>, but I'm an active contributor to both who has touched a lot of the components related to uploading/API tokens/etc. It's very exciting to see <code>uv</code> consider adding publishing support!</p>
<p>A couple of things that might be worth considering as part of an implementation here:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyPI and TestPyPI both support <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/">trusted publishing</a>, i.e. credentialless package publishing via OIDC. This is handled transparently at the API token issuance layer to avoid any changes to PyPI's authentication parameters, but a future <code>uv publish</code> command could avoid the need for a separate token exchange step by performing the token exchange internally.</li>
<li>PyPI and TestPyPI are nearing the completion of initial support for <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/">PEP 740</a>, i.e. index support for digital attestations over packages. <code>twine</code> has support for detecting and uploading attestations; a future <code>uv publish</code> command could consider adding support as well 🙂</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm happy to provide more details on the above or anything else related to publishing, to those interested. Just let me know!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding this comment to the correct issue. 🤦</p>
<p>Would be good to mimic the <code>rye publish</code> command where it prompts you to encrypt your PyPI token with a password.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv publish</code> is now implemented. It supports token authentication (for PyPI), username/password authentication, keyring integration and trusted publishing support for GitHub Actions + PyPI (publishing without manually configuration a secret in GitHub Actions). In the next release, it will ship in preview mode (pass <code>--preview</code> to use it), as we might still need to make minor adjustments to the CLI outside of our usual stability policy.</p>
<p>If you are running into any problems, please open an issue! Especially for authentication with private registries feedback would be invaluable.</p>
