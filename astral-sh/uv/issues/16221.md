# Feature Request: `UV_PYTHON_EXTRA_INSTALL_DIRS`  lets uv search additional managed Python directories

---

_Issue opened by @j178 on 2025-10-10 08:01_

### Summary

Add a `UV_PYTHON_EXTRA_INSTALL_DIRS` environment variable that lets uv search additional managed Python directories without installing into them.

### Motivation

Tooling built atop uv often need a private managed store (via  `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`) to avoid polluting the user’s default managed store, yet they still want to reuse interpreters the user already installed. Currently uv can only search the active install dir, so tools either duplicate installs or overwrite user choices.

### Proposal

Introduce `UV_PYTHON_EXTRA_INSTALL_DIRS`, a path-list (colon-separated on Unix, semicolon on Windows).
During interpreter discovery, uv inspects these directories just like the primary managed store.
Managed downloads never target these extra paths; installs remain confined to `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`.
If unset, behavior is unchanged.

### Example

```
UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/mytool/py
UV_PYTHON_EXTRA_INSTALL_DIRS=~/.uv/python
```

uv installs new Python into `/opt/mytool/py` but will also discover interpreters in the user’s `~/.uv/python`.

### PoC

A proof-of-concept implementation is available in #16222.
