            <div class="timeline-body"><p>there seems to be some confusion regarding the different methods of installing an editable package. from what i can tell, uv's build backend uses <code>.pth</code> files by default instead of import hooks. however the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/import-resolution?id=uv">pyright documentation</a> was recently updated to state that passing <code>{ editable_mode = &quot;compat&quot; }</code> to uv's build backend is necessary to enable this behavior. as far as i can tell, this is only necessary when using setuptools as the build backend.</p>
<p>i think it would be a good idea to document editable installs <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/build-backend/">somewhere here</a>. i saw <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#editable-dependencies">this section</a> but i think that's only talking about the frontend</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem described in pyright's documentation to my best knowledge is only a problem with setuptools, other build backends default to <code>.pth</code> files. The advice they share is for the case of using uv a build frontend (e.g. <code>uv sync</code>, <code>uv pip install -e .</code>) with setuptools as backend (<code>build-backend = &quot;setuptools.build_meta&quot;</code>), if you're using the uv_build backend (with any frontend), or uv with a different build backend, you are not affected. See also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1708#issuecomment-2174463476 and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3898. I proposed some changes to the pyright docs to clarify this: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/pull/10888</p>
