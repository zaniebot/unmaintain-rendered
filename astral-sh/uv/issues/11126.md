# How to do `uvx --with 'ops[testing]' python python -c 'import ops.testing'` ?

---

_Issue opened by @dimaqq on 2025-01-31 03:55_

### Question

I tried:

`uvx --with 'ops[testing]' python python -c 'import ops.testing'`

and

`uvx --with 'ops[testing]' ops python -c 'import ops.testing'

The intention was to get an ephemeral virtualenv with some packages (and `--resolution xx`) and run some **python** script.

The thing is, an arbitrary package doesn't provide any executables. `ops` doesn't provide any executables.

### Platform

I believe this just shipped in the latest version? `uvx python` is special-cased. So you can do, e.g., `uvx --with "anyio" python -c 'import anyio'`.

Indeed, works with the latest release, thank you!

```command
> uvx --with 'ops[testing]' python  -c 'import ops.testing; print(42)'
42
```
