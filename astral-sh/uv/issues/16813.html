            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>--exclude-newer</code> is a very useful feature for implementing dependency cooldown policies but it requires package registries to support the JSON view with the PEP 700 <code>upload-time</code> attribute. This currently prevents usage on projects which use <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10394">Azure</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/581770">GitLab</a> to host any dependencies.</p>
<p>It would be useful if there was a way to disable the exclude-newer mechanism for a single registry or package so it could be used for PyPI packages, which are usually the highest concern for the kind of attacks which a minimum age policy is designed to mitigate, while still allowing private registries to be used.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Using the documentation example for a custom index, one option would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
exclude-newer = &quot;…&quot;
skip-exclude-newer-for-indexes = [&quot;pytorch&quot;]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>… or perhaps to avoid that somewhat ugly name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
exclude-newer = &quot;…&quot;

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
skip-exclude-newer-check = true
</code></pre>
<p>… or perhaps this would be best as a per-package override requiring you to manually opt-in for each package:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
exclude-newer = &quot;…&quot;
exclude-newer-package = { pytorch = &quot;ALLOW_ANY&quot; } # This magic value can't conflict with an existing date
# or, to make it more explicit that you only want to trust one source:
exclude-newer-package = { pytorch = { allow-latest-from-registry = &quot;pytorch&quot; } }
</code></pre>

<p>That’s my inclination as well - I liked the middle proposed syntax the most when I was thinking about this but wanted to at least think about alternatives since every packaging discussion I have ever been in seems to involve someone bringing up a use-case wildly outside of what I do 😁</p>

<p>For completeness, I opened this ticket for GitLab for that exact reason and will be escalating with our sales rep: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/581770</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>we observed the same problem with AWS CodeArtifact, which does not support JSON API  - it would be great to have this <code>uv</code> setting  to skip validation for some additional private indexes</p>
<p>UPDATE: I opened a ticket with AWS support and they will consider implementing JSON API but unfortunately there is not ETA yet</p>
