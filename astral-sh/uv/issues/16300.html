            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>In a workspace if I build multiple packages like:</p>
<pre><code>uv build --package lib_a
uv build --package lib_b
</code></pre>
<p>and then publish those packages (in my case to AWS Codeartifact):</p>
<pre><code>uv publish --index myindex --username __token__
</code></pre>
<p>the logged output on initial publish looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Publishing 4 files https://domain-123456789012.d.codeartifact.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pypi/myindex/
Uploading lib_a-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl (2.4KiB)
Uploading lib_a-1.0.0.tar.gz (3.9KiB)
Uploading lib_b-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl (33.9KiB)
Uploading lib_b-1.0.0.tar.gz (41.8KiB)
</code></pre>
<p>If I then run the same publish command without rebuilding, the logged output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Publishing 4 files https://domain-123456789012.d.codeartifact.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pypi/myindex/
Uploading lib_a-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl (2.4KiB)
File lib_a-1.0.0.tar.gz already exists, skipping
File lib_b-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl already exists, skipping
File lib_b-1.0.0.tar.gz already exists, skipping
</code></pre>
<p>Every time I run the publish command, the first log says it is uploading the <code>lib_a-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl</code> asset, however, in CodeArtifact the index doesn&#x27;t show the package being updated which is the expected behavior. To verify this seems like a bug in uv,  I removed the <code>lib_a</code> assets from dist and reran the publish command with this output:</p>
<pre><code>Publishing 2 files https://domain-123456789012.d.codeartifact.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pypi/myindex/
Uploading lib_b-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl (33.9KiB)
File lib_b-1.0.0.tar.gz already exists, skipping
</code></pre>
<p>The logs say the <code>lib_b-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl</code> asset is being uploaded even though in previous logs it was correctly skipped.</p>
