# `uv version`: Add --all-packages option

---

_Issue opened by @StephenRobin on 2025-06-11 16:26_

### Summary

When using `uv version` with a workspace, it would be very useful to have a `--all-packages` option like the sync / lock  / build / run commands have. This would update the version in all relevant pyproject.toml's.

Follow up from  #13548 

### Example

This is definitely doable, although you will also need to:

* implement human printing
* implement machine printing (this requires a new schema for printing multiple values, boo)
