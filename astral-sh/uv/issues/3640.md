# Where is `install.sh` in the repo?

---

_Issue opened by @s-banach on 2024-05-17 15:47_

The documentation says to download `astral.sh/uv/install.sh`.
Where is `install.sh` in the repo?
I would feel safer linking to fixed versions of this script in a specific commit, rather than a dynamic version on your personal webpage.

The link in the readme is a redirect to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/uv-installer.sh. You can find a fixed `uv-installer.sh` asset on each release in the releases page.

Coincidentally I was wondering exactly the same at roughly the same time :wink: 

I still don't really understand where it is coming from though, i.e., how does the release pull it out of thin air / where is it actually coming from originally?

EDIT: I have a guess: It looks like it is actually coming from `cargo-dist` resulting from [this template](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/blob/e95f7b3d18b89633c5e6942782b7e278595442e0/cargo-dist/templates/installer/installer.sh.j2).

Yeah that's right -- we use `cargo-dist` to create our installers. They're generated as part of the release pipeline.
