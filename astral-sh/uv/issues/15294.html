            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Following a discussion about the topic of venv activation scripts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think someone just needs to validate and pull in those upstream changes [from virtualenv package] into our virtual environment activation scripts. Ideally, we&#x27;d have some test coverage that makes it apparent we&#x27;re resolving the problem.</p>
<p>-- originally from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14917">astral-sh/uv#14917</a>#issuecomment-3186780343</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/15272">astral-sh/uv#15272</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the requirements of the requested test(s)? I added a nushell activation test. Do you want more tests for all other supported shell(s)? I&#x27;m of the impression that nushell needed a test to detect breakages because nushell is still in v0.x. I have only ever used bash and pwsh (with much reluctance).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;d be ideal to have test coverage for them all, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to do here! Especially if you&#x27;re reluctant :) We can open an issue to track it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let this be the issue to track adding integration/unit tests for activating venv in variously supported shells.</p>
Proposed idea
<p>An aggregated discussion between zanieb and myself across the aforementioned threads:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I see now that integration tests are written directly in the CI.yml workflow (an overwhelmingly long file). While unconventional per rust standards, this makes writing integration tests easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>we could</em> do another testing strategy within our test suite, e.g., we&#x27;d add a new <code>test-nushell</code> feature then assume nushell is available and add a snapshot test for the activation script that&#x27;s gated by the feature. Then, we&#x27;d install nushell in the Linux cargo test run.</p>
