            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I searched through issues but didn't find anything similar - apologies if there's already an issue that I missed.</p>
<hr />
<p>The <code>--include-deps</code> flag on <code>pipx install</code> will allow any CLI applications from the dependencies of a package also be added to the $PATH.</p>
<p>My use case may be pretty niche :-) but I use this as a pattern for an org-internal CLI, which can add dependencies on binary packages released on pip, and then have everything installed all at once with a single install command.  Installing everything into separate packages is not a huge inconvenience (copy paste a list of N commands instead of just one), but there are some niceties in being able to ensure that versions move together with a single package upgrade command.</p>
<p>Happy to explain the use case in more detail if it's helpful!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ah! perhaps https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6403</p>
<p>I'll leave it to your judgment if you want to close this issue and consolidate on #6403</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think these issues are separate concerns, I'm thinking about the ansible official install instructions use pipx require the <code>--install-deps</code> flag.</p>
<p>https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#pipx-install</p>
<p>Also tools like <code>ansible-lint</code> need to be injected (with apps) into the ansible venv.</p>
<p>So supporting this would provide better support for ansible's install structure. (This the last thing I have installed in pipx)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's also #6314 in regard to <code>--include-deps</code>.</p>
<p>That issue references the flag <code>--install-deps</code> but the intention is <code>--include-deps</code>.</p>
