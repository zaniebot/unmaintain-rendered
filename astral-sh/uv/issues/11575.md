# uv export into Poetry lockfile

---

_Issue opened by @Lenormju on 2025-02-17 11:25_

### Summary

Currently, uv can only export to format `requirements-txt` (cf #6668).
For (dumb) compatibility reasons, I would like to be able to export a "Poetry lockfile" from uv. These are different, bu close, TOML documents.
Would this be interesting to add to uv ? I can understand why not.
Would you like me to draft a PR for this ?
Also, there does not seem to be a documented schema for Poetry lock files (cf https://github.com/orgs/python-poetry/discussions/6763) so there may be some instability there.

### Example

Sorry, but I don't think we'll support the Poetry format — it seems hard to maintain. It sounds like a better fit for an external project.

Yeah, I think this would be a stretch. Sorry that we couldn't accommodate your request here.
