# Question/Bug: Can't specify exactly 3.14.0 as the Python version

---

_Issue opened by @Ahajha on 2025-10-08 05:58_

### Summary

3.14.0 just released, I wanted to make a venv with the new release. Running (on Linux):
```sh
uv venv --python 3.14.0
```
gives
```
Using CPython 3.14.0rc3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```
Which is an RC. I also tried
```sh
uv venv --python ">3.14.0rc3"
```
but it still picks the same version.

Is there something I'm missing here, or is this a bug in the version resolution?

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04

### Version

0.9.0

### Python version

3.14.0

Not urgent, but definitely bothers me. This may have also lead to this bug: https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop/issues/690 but it might have just been a caching issue.

Does it work after:

```
uv python install 3.14.0
```

Yes, that works! I had tried `uv cache clean` at one point, but I suppose the Python version download cache is different?

On macOS, here are verbose logs:

Thanks! I'll look into this

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-10-09 15:35_

It's intentional that if you have previously installed an rc we won't upgrade you to a new Python version without an explicit install. We could make requesting `3.14.0` explicitly (rather than `3.14`) fail to match pre-releases, though I worry that's breaking.

I've fixed the `>=...` bugs though.

Wonderful! I'm mostly happy so long as there's a way to get it, though maybe we could attach a `.final` or something as a special hint to not install prereleases? That's a little messy, I'm okay without it
