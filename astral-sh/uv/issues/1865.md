<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

If you have a git+https dependency from two sources, even if it is the identical tag or commit, you still get this message.

```
# requirements.in
pydantic @ git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@f8c01bb4245220f21cc840981b41f905b1bb2c3e
```

```
$ uv pip compile requirements.in requirements.in 
error: Requirements contain conflicting URLs for package `pydantic`:
- git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@f8c01bb4245220f21cc840981b41f905b1bb2c3e
- git+https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic@f8c01bb4245220f21cc840981b41f905b1bb2c3e
```

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.1.7
```
