# The uv pip install for current directory only works with editable mode

_Issue opened by @dbritto-dev on 2024-02-23 03:37_

* The command I invoked: `uv pip install .`
* The current Ruff settings:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["pdm-backend"]
build-backend = "pdm.backend"

[project]
name = "demo"
version = "2024.02.22"
dependencies = [
  "pydantic[email]",
  "email-validator",
]
requires-python = ">=3.10"
description = "Demo"
readme = "README.md"
classifiers = [
  "Programming Language :: Python"
]
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["ruff", "nox", "pytest"]
```
* The current Ruff version: 0.2.2

> **Note:** the same command with editable mode, works without any problem. Ref command: `uv pip install -e .`

Hey sorry -- we currently support `uv pip install "demo @ ."` or `uv pip install -e .` but we'll lift this restriction in the future. (It's a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/313.)

This is supported as of `v0.1.24`. You can `uv pip install .` directly, without including a package name.
