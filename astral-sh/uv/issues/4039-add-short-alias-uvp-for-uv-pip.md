# Add short alias `uvp` for `uv pip`

---

_Issue opened by @itsmeadarsh2008 on 2024-06-05 04:48_

I think adding an alias `uvp` for the name `uv pip` is a great idea. It would make the name easier to remember and type, especially for those who frequently use the tool. Plus, it can help to streamline commands and make the overall user experience more efficient. Overall, adding an alias like `uvp` for `uv pip` seems like a simple yet effective way to improve usability.

Hi! I think we're leaning away from this kind of alias. Is there a reason a shell alias e.g. `alias uvp="uv pip"` won't work for you? 

There's a bunch more discussion over in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1657
