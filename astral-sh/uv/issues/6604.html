            <div class="timeline-body"><p><strong>Title:</strong> Compatibility with Briefcase Projects: Support for New Configuration File</p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong></p>
<p>I am working on a project using Briefcase and encountered compatibility issues when trying to integrate <code>uv</code>. The main problem arises from the different configurations expected by <code>uv</code> and Briefcase, specifically in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p>
<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Project Structure:</strong> Briefcase projects have a specific structure where the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file is located in the root directory. Here's a simplified version of the structure:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── pyproject.toml
├── src
│   └── project_name
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── app.py
│       └── ...
└── tests
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Briefcase</strong> uses a <code>[tool.briefcase]</code> section in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</li>
<li><strong>uv</strong> expects a <code>[project]</code> section and a <code>[tool.uv]</code> section for dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a Briefcase project with the structure mentioned above.</li>
<li>Navigate to the project directory and try to run a <code>uv</code> command, e.g., <code>uv add ruff</code>.</li>
<li>Observe the error indicating that the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file does not have the expected <code>[project]</code> table.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Error Messages</h3>
<p>When running <code>uv add ruff</code> in the project root:</p>
<pre><code>error: No `pyproject.toml` found in current directory or any parent directory
</code></pre>
<p>When running <code>uv add ruff</code> in the <code>project_name</code> subdirectory:</p>
<pre><code>error: No `project` table found in: `/path/to/project/pyproject.toml`
</code></pre>
<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
<p>To resolve this compatibility issue, I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduce a New Configuration File:</strong> Allow <code>uv</code> to recognize a new configuration file in the base folder that can be used to specify the <code>[project]</code> and <code>[tool.uv]</code> sections. This file could be named <code>uv.toml</code> or similar.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration Flexibility:</strong> Provide an option to configure the location and name of this file, so it can coexist with the Briefcase <code>pyproject.toml</code> without conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Command Used:</strong> <code>uv add ruff</code></li>
<li><strong>uv Platform:</strong> macOS</li>
<li><strong>uv Version:</strong> 0.3.3 (deea6025a 2024-08-23)</li>
<li><strong>macOS Version:</strong> [Please specify your macOS version, e.g., macOS Sonoma 14.6.1]</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for considering this feature request. This enhancement would greatly improve the integration of <code>uv</code> with projects managed by Briefcase, allowing for more seamless development workflows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>BeeWare/Briefcase maintainer here. Definitely keen to work with Astral/uv maintainers on anything related to Briefcase integration; the exact form of that integration is the open question.</p>
<p>I wouldn't <em>necessarily</em> recommend adding support for Briefcase's configuration conventions to uv. I'd argue it's likely better for <em>Briefcase</em> to support <em>uv's</em> conventions, and use uv internally. beeware/briefcase#1367 is an existing ticket asking for Poetry support in Briefcase; I imagine the uv-based approach would be similar.</p>
<p>The constraint on this is usually whether the installation tool can support four key features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Platform-specific dependencies (i.e., only install library X if we're installing for platform Y)</li>
<li>Support for iOS, Android, and web as recognised platforms.</li>
<li>&quot;Host-mode&quot; installation - installing dependencies into a specific target location that <em>isn't</em> the site-packages of the currently running Python interpreter</li>
<li>Cross-platform targeting - installing dependencies for a platform that <em>isn't</em> the currently running platform (e.g., installing iOS dependencies when on macOS.</li>
</ol>
<p>To date, I haven't done any exploration of uv to know the current state of these features. If they already exist, then it might be possible to add uv support to Briefcase.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At least for now, if you need to use Briefcase, the recommendation is &quot;don't use uv&quot;. Briefcase doesn't currently have <em>any</em> uv integration, for the reasons listed above.</p>
<p>This is something we'd <em>like</em> to address - but no solution exists at present.</p>
<p>In terms of project structure, though - both uv and briefcase use pyproject.toml for configuration, so there's no special considerations involved.</p>
