            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is more an observation rather than an issue.</p>
<p>I'm using a ci tool that parses commit history, generates the &quot;next&quot; version and updates the version in pyproject.toml (the tool is <code>python-semantic-release</code>).</p>
<p>What I just noticed was, since <code>python-semantic-release</code> updates <code>pyproject.toml</code> when it performs a build, once the build has finished <code>uv.lock</code> contains the &quot;wrong&quot; version for the project, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>[[package]]
name = &quot;my-package&quot;
version = &quot;0.2.1.dev0&quot;
source = { virtual = &quot;.&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Since  <code>python-semantic-release</code>  bumped the version to &quot;0.2.1&quot;. To fix I added <code>uv sync &amp;&amp; build.sh &amp;&amp; git add uv.lock</code> - this updates the lock file and stages it (with the other files <code>python-semantic-release</code>  modifies.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this causes more problems than it fixes, but I thought I'd mention it - I think in general it's probably a better practice to generate tags based on the pyproject.toml-&gt;project.version rather than the other way around?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was also experiencing the <code>uv.lock</code> going out of sync when <code>python-semantic-release</code> would bump the version in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I fixed this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a step after the semantic release that updates the version of my project in the <code>uv.lock</code> file by running: <code>uv lock --upgrade-package &lt;project_name&gt;</code> followed by committing and pushing the change.<ul>
<li>Link to my GitHub workflow file: https://github.com/aqib-oss/sonar-qube-gh-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/main-workflow.yaml#L74</li>
<li>Thankfully, this does not trigger another run of the <code>main</code> branch workflow, however, if it did, it can easily be handled by adding a pre-check job that determines if the last commit was for syncing the project version in the <code>uv.lock</code> file, and the main job will run only if the output from the pre-check job is <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
