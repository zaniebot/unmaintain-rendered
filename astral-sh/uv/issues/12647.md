I don't think it's necessary, but @Gankra would know.

It's not included because it's managed by another tool (cargo-dist) and we don't control where it's put. We could recommend deleting it though. In the future, we will have more control over this file.

We can definitely teach uv how to uninstall in the future, with our current plans.

Can you say more? I'm not sure what you mean.

_Comment by @candrapersada on 2025-04-04 19:35_

I want to create a new path environment variable with the help of the `install.sh` script like `$HOME/bin2` and `$HOME/bin3 `easily
