# Issues when using multiple venvs

---

_Issue opened by @xd009642 on 2025-03-26 13:42_

### Summary

My application is a code sandboxing service (closed source) that's used to execute LLM code in a more secure environment. As such I've:

1. Got a working dir with a venv in which API submitted code runs in
2. The venv for the python API receiving and executing this code

I'm attempting to use uv to handle both of these but then it's becoming a bit fiddly to get uv to use the right venv and me have the right cwd etc. 

So my directory structure in my dockerfile is something like:

```
/app
    /.venv
    /src/
/sandbox
    /.venv
``` 

I was just trying to within `/sandbox` do `uv run /app/src/app.py` but then it picks up the `/sandbox` and complains about missing deps. I was hoping a `--venv-path` or `--root` arg existed for `uv run` for when running it outside of the source tree.

I can probably get around this by just tweaking things around I just figured I'd raise this as a DX type issue since the team clearly cares a lot about ease of use

You can use `--python <path>` to target a specific environment, e.g., `uv run --python /sandbox/.venv`.

You can also use `--directory` or `--project` to change our root directory at startup.
