# Stucturing project with workspaces

---

_Issue opened by @haarisr on 2025-02-21 03:04_

### Question

Hi

I would like to a structure a project with uv. Lets say I have top level project `foo` defined in the pyproject toml.

I would like to have subpackages and/or libraries  such as `cloud` and `app` each in its own workspace that defines its own set of requirements

But from `app` I would like to import `foo.cloud` instead of just `cloud`. Is this possible to do?

The altenative is to name the package `foo_app` and `foo_cloud`. I wiould like to know if the former is possible.

Thanks!

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04

### Version

Latest UV

The answer is PEP 420 namespace packages.

Closing this in favor of #11787

I usually recommend using `foo_cloud` over namespace packages with `foo.cloud` to avoid issues with the shared `foo/__init__.py` and `foo` package name, even though it is indeed the less pretty version.

The package layout and namespace package supports needs to be in the build backend, such as hatchling, uv only installs what the build backend decides.
