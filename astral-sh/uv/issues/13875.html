            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a Python application that runs uv syncs downstream and writes all of the output to a log file. I noticed recently that a number of seemingly innocuous log messages were being flagged as an error log level. For example:</p>
<pre><code>2025-06-05 16:11:51,605 com.my.app.name ERROR Resolved 23 packages in 1.74s
2025-06-05 16:11:51,681 com.my.app.name ERROR Installed 22 packages in 42ms
</code></pre>
<p>Looking into the codebase, I found the above messages and they are, in fact, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/7dd564d3d09668488c179b02bfe446754e58a5ea/crates/uv/src/commands/pip/loggers.rs#L103">being printed with printer.stderr</a></p>
<p>Based on the source code, it seems like this is intentional, but as a developer this feels very unintuitive. Conventionally, I have viewed ERROR-level logs as an indication that something has failed to a degree that the expected behavior of your program is impaired. But in this case, they are regular messages that are expected and show up with every <code>uv sync</code>.</p>
<p>I was wondering if any maintainers could provide insight into why this decision was made?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We've talked about this briefly before, e.g., in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2656</p>
<p>This isn't a uv-thing, this is typical behavior for command-line tooling.</p>
