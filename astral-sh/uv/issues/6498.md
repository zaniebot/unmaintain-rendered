# Add documentation on how to specify pytorch as a dependency

_Issue opened by @valentincalomme on 2024-08-23 08:05_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

Installing Pytorch has always been the bane of my existence, especially when I require the CUDA version of the package, whose wheel is not available on PyPi. Rye has such a section: https://rye.astral.sh/guide/faq/#how-do-i-install-pytorch

Could `uv` add, as part of the documentation, a guide on how to define `torch` as a dependency, knowing that:
- On MacOs, there are no CUDA version, so theoretically speaking, `pip` is sufficient
- On Linux and Windows, CUDA versions are available but need to be downloaded from a URL (i.e. https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124/torch-2.4.0%2Bcu124-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl#sha256=22bc926ac3c2f2e4f483f2a201a0ab8a701cc1104ddd74469763f652f3856ec2)

How can we gracefully deal with the different platform and hardware requirements using `uv`?

+1, also if somebody knows how to include pytorch and related packages to uv compile

I think it's a duplicate of #5945.

You mean a bit like this from this index? or another? `uv pip install --extra-index-url="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu" -- torch`

Yes this a duplicate of #5945 — I'd love help documenting this as I'm not a pytorch user.
