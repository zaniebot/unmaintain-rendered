            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Consider package 'foo' depending on package 'bar'. Both reside on a private index. the following pyproject.toml does not resolve the package to the correct index:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;my_project&quot;
...
dependencies = [&quot;foo&quot;]
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;artifactory&quot;
url = &quot;https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/.../pypi/simple/&quot;
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
foo = { index = &quot;artifactory&quot; }
bar = { index = &quot;artifactory&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>running this by <code>uv lock</code> results in Error (the index was successfully inspected though):</p>
<pre><code> [Information] [CredentialProvider]VstsCredentialProvider - Acquired bearer token using 'MSAL Silent'
[Information] [CredentialProvider]VstsCredentialProvider - Attempting to exchange the bearer token for an Azure DevOps session token.
  x No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (python_full_version &gt;= '3.12'):
  `-&gt; Because bar was not found in the package registry and foo==1.0.0 depends on bar, we can conclude that foo==1.0.0
      cannot be used.
      And because only foo&lt;=1.0.0 is available and your project depends on foo&gt;=1.0.0, we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>However, adding 'bar' as an additional explicit dependency to the project will resolve the packages successfully.</p>
