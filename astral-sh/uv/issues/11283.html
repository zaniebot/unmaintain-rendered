            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I ran into trouble with a PyQt6 gui-script that was neither opening, nor throwing any error, when running with <code>uv run</code>, but working fine when calling the gui-script without <code>uv</code>.
I could narrow down the issue and produced a MRE here (description with commands in README.md): https://github.com/EDohmen/MRE_uv_run_pyqt5vs6.git</p>
<p>However, I am still not sure what happens or what I am missing and would appreciate any feedback and ideas here in case it's not reproducible for others and a uv bug, but something I'm overlooking on my side. The behaviour got stranger the more I tried to narrow it down.
Here's what I found out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bug only occurs with <code>pyqt6</code>, not with <code>pyqt5</code> (I would like to use PyQt6 for the original project though)</li>
<li>only <code>uv run</code> is affected and calling the executable (defined gui-script from <code>pyproject.toml</code>) without <code>uv</code> results in expected behaviour, i.e. a window opens</li>
<li>The program seems to simply end when entering the <code>super().__init__()</code> function of a <code>pyqt6.QMainWindow</code>, however</li>
<li>this behaviour is only triggered if there is also a <code>__new__()</code> function defined, if there is none additionally defined (which I need in my original project) all works fine again also with <code>uv run</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks for your amazing work and uv!</p>
