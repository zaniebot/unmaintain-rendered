Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hello, I have been facing a issue while trying to install mediapipe.</p>
<pre><code>× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only the following versions of mediapipe are available:
          mediapipe==0.9.1.0
          mediapipe==0.9.2.1
          mediapipe==0.9.3.0
          mediapipe==0.10.0
          mediapipe==0.10.1
          mediapipe==0.10.2
          mediapipe==0.10.3
          mediapipe==0.10.5
          mediapipe==0.10.7
          mediapipe==0.10.8
          mediapipe==0.10.9
          mediapipe==0.10.10
          mediapipe==0.10.11
          mediapipe==0.10.13
          mediapipe==0.10.14
          mediapipe==0.10.15
      and all versions of mediapipe have no wheels with a matching Python version tag, we can
      conclude that mediapipe&lt;0.9.2.1 cannot be used.
      And because your project depends on mediapipe, we can conclude that your project's
      requirements are unsatisfiable.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the
        `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.

<p>I am on MacOS Sequoia 15.0.1, with a M1 Mac. On the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/#files">PyPi Page</a> there exists a wheel for ARM64, and it should be used
