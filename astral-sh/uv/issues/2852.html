            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awaiting that #171 gets resolved, it would be very useful if <code>uv pip compile</code> could generate annotations with the “source” index.</p>
<p>Currently <code>uv pip compile --extra-index-url &lt;MYINDEX&gt; --no-header &lt;(echo MYPACKAGE)</code> outputs something like</p>
<pre><code>DEPENDENCY==1.18.5
    # via MYPACKAGE
MYPACKAGE==0.0.5
</code></pre>
<p>and I found no easy way (apart from analyzing the <code>--verbose</code> trace or cross-referencing the hashes from <code>--generate-hashes</code>) to understand which package comes from which index.</p>
<p>I would like explicit annotations, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>DEPENDENCY==1.18.5
    # via MYPACKAGE
    # from https://pypi.org/simple
MYPACKAGE==0.0.5
    # from &lt;MYINDEX&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Sorry for my unclear wording: indeed I'm suggesting to implent this enhancement as a mitigation for possible dependency confusion attacks <em>before</em> #171 is finalized.</p>
<p>Knowing the origin of a package without the need to trace the index-strategy could also be helpful for users that are not fully aware of the differences with <code>pip</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah cool makes sense. As long as there's not an expectation that we will guarantee the given index is used on install.</p>
