            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have problems running a customtkinter app with uv. The window pops up and closes immediately. I receive this error:</p>
<pre><code>[xcb] Extra reply data still left in queue
[xcb] This is most likely caused by a broken X extension library
[xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
python3: xcb_io.c:673: _XReply: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_extra_reply_data_left' failed.
</code></pre>
<p>When I change the venv to the system python the same error happens. When I execute the code with the system python the program runs without issues. I have also pyenv installed and when I use this python interpreter in the venv the programs runs also. So it seems that I have only issues using interpreters installed from uv and with the system python version, tough the system python version works when called without uv.</p>
<p>This is my main.py:</p>
<pre><code>import customtkinter


class Window(customtkinter.CTk):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        pdf_frame = customtkinter.CTkFrame(self)
        pdf_frame.grid(column=0, row=0)


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    window = Window()
    window.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>The commands that I used:</p>
<pre><code>uv init --python x.y.z
uv add customtkinter
uv run main.py
</code></pre>
<p>Tried with 3.13.2 (system), 3.11.11 (uv) and 3.11.5 (pyenv; works).</p>
<p>Maybe someone has an idea what I can try.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi - I believe this should be resolved in uv 0.8.7, released just now. Please make sure you've updated both uv and your local Python versions:</p>
<pre><code>uv self update
uv python install --reinstall --no-bin 3.13.6
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using another Python version, use <code>3.9.23</code>, <code>3.10.18</code>, <code>3.11.13</code>, <code>3.12.11</code>, and/or <code>3.14.0rc1</code> in that command. (This ensures that you're on the latest patch release <em>and</em> you pick up the new build in case you were on an older build of that same patch release.)</p>
<p>Please try it out and let me know if there are remaining issues.</p>
<p>(By the way, if anyone sees <em>new</em> bugs from this, please first open a new issue and at-mention me, and then use <code>uvx uv@0.8.6 python install --reinstall --no-bin 3.13.6</code> etc. to roll back to yesterday's builds of Python. I don't expect this to break anything, but it is a pretty significant change in what's in the Python distributions and how things are linked, so it might have some unexpected side effects.)</p>
