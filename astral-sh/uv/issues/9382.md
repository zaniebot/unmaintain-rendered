<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I wondering what if uv include its own PEP 518-compatible build system? (e.g. no need for external build systems like setuptools), similar to poetry?

We're already working on our own build backend. It's tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3957.
