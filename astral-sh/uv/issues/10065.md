Hi!

I am confused as to why `uv pip install gradio-webrtc==0.0.25` fails saying that version does not exist but `uv pip install --upgrade gradio-webrtc` finds version 0.0.25.

0.0.25 is a very recent version (~5 minutes old when I ran these two commands). I wouldn't be surprised if both commands failed to find 0.0.25 but I find it odd that only the first one fails.

We cache PyPI metadata for 10 minutes, so running with `--upgrade` or `--refresh` is the best way to force a refresh.
