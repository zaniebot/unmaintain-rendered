# Add required-version settings

---

_Issue opened by @TomerBin on 2024-11-05 07:14_

Ruff supports setting a version specifier that is enforced at runtime. It might be beneficial to have this feature in UV as well. [Ruff required-version](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#required-version)

An additional improvement could be to automatically install the required version of UV, if possible.
