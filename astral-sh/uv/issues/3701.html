            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Or at least have an option for this? Maybe it already exists and I missed it?</p>
<p>My scenario is I am building a set of requirements with <code>uv pip compile</code> via a script and have an output file selected. uv gives some potentially useful warnings, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>warning: The requested Python version 3.10.6 is not available; 3.11.4 will be used to build dependencies instead.
Resolved 360 packages in 124ms
warning: The package `google-api-core==2.8.2` does not have an extra named `grpcgcp`.
</code></pre>
<p>However it's easy to miss these warnings because the screen is quickly then filled with the 360 packages of the output requirements, however I don't need these output requirements on the screen because they are written to a file.</p>

<p>I believe we omitted this output by default initially but added it to match <code>pip compile</code>'s behavior.</p>

<p>With <code>-q</code> I see no messages from uv, including warnings.</p>

<p>Fair enough, I'm not that familiar with pip compile's specific behaviors.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI I tested with <code>-q</code> using <code>pip-compile</code> and it displays some, but not all, warnings.</p>
<p>Though it's docs state &quot;-q, --quiet Give less output&quot;, where as uv's state &quot;-q, --quiet Do not print any output&quot;.</p>
<p>uv's use of <code>-q</code> makes more sense to me, I'm sure some users will not want any output.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh I think the workaround people have used in the past is to pipe stdout to a <code>/dev/null</code> since warnings are on stderr and this output is on stdout?</p>
<p>Maybe we should just have a <code>--no-stdout</code> flag? hm.</p>

<p>Ah thanks, this is sufficient for me!</p>
<p>Feel free to close this issue if you would rather keep compatibility / not add any more flags.</p>
