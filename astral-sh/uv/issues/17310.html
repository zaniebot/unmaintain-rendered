            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Coming from poetry, one thing I use a lot is <code>poetry show &lt;pkg&gt;</code>. The output shows the constraints on packages in the dependencies and required-by sections, which is helpful to understand why a particular version is installed. For example (from the <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#show">poetry docs</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ poetry show pendulum

name        : pendulum
version     : 1.4.2
description : Python datetimes made easy

dependencies
 - python-dateutil &gt;=2.6.1
 - tzlocal &gt;=1.4
 - pytzdata &gt;=2017.2.2

required by
 - calendar requires &gt;=1.4.0
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to request a similar feature for uv 🙏. I know of <code>uv pip show &lt;pkg&gt;</code> and <code>uv pip tree --package &lt;pkg&gt;</code>, but those don't show constraints.</p>
<p>One extension which might be useful is showing which constraints are binding. Quite often an upper bound causes a surprising version to be chosen. It can be tough to understand why, especially if the binding constraint is on a transitive dependency. An example to mind is <code>numba==0.63.1</code> which requires <code>numpy &gt;=1.22,&lt;2.4</code>.</p>

<p>I don't think so? AFAICT that shows installed versions, but does not display constraints at all</p>
