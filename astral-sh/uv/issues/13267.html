            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>I recently switched to uv and trying to incorporate the following things in my project:</p>
<p>a) I need to patch some dependencies after installation - mainly spicy where I need to comment out three lines to make it compatible with pyinstaller. I do not want to install scipy as editable/local project as there are only minor changes required. Ideally I'm looking for something like patch-package in the npm world. Maybe it's possible to hook into the builders for all or specific packages?</p>
<p>b) Currently I use a script that runs uv sync followed by applying the patches, however on each uv run the patches are reverted unless I specify --no-sync or set UV_NO_SYNC. Is there maybe a pyproject config setting to set uv to only sync if uv sync is explicitly called?</p>
<p>c) I need to install some dependencies with custom cmake args (both custom pip command line and environment vars). Is there a right way to do this? Alternatively hooking into the builders could also be a solution here.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and help!</p>

<p>Hmm, nothing beyond what you've already discovered -- I'd say <code>UV_NO_SYNC</code> is your friend here.</p>

<p>Is this covered by https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#config-settings?</p>

<p>I believe those config-settings are only for the projects own build backend and cannot be used to affect a dependency :/</p>
<p>As an example, what I'm currently calling is:</p>
<pre><code>FORCE_CMAKE=1 CMAKE_ARGS=&quot;-DGGML_CCACHE=OFF -DGGML_NATIVE=off -DGGML_AVX=on -DGGML_AVX2=off -DGGML_AVX512=off -DGGML_FMA=off -DGGML_F16C=off -DGGML_LASX=off -DGGML_LSX=off -DGGML_CUDA=off&quot; \
  uv run pip install --verbose --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-deps llama-cpp-python==${LLAMA_CPP_PYTHON_VERSION
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Ah okay I see - but the build system is not used for dependencies that are available via wheels, there seems to be no way to force building from source for a specific dependency and to specify the build command for just a single dependency, or am I missing something?</p>
