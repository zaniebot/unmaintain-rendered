# Skip over versions with invalid metadata

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-02-21 09:34_

There are a number of (mostly older) releases on pypi with files with invalid metadata (e.g. #1363, #1686, #1798) we can't parse even with our fixups. We already skip over simple metadata entries we can't parse with fixups. We should do the same with versions that contain a wheel with invalid METADATA file. The failed packages should have a custom incompatibility in pubgrub so they get explained in resolution failures.
