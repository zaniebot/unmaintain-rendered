            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I like about Discussions is &quot;show and tell&quot;, where people present their work related to the project. I think <a href="https://github.com/jgm/djot/discussions/categories/show-and-tell">djot</a> is a great example of how &quot;show and tell&quot; can create value. It has let the followers of the project discover things they are interested in, like integrations and implementations.</p>
<p>For uv, there is something I'd share in &quot;show and tell&quot;. I have <a href="https://dbohdan.com/scripts-with-dependencies#python-comparison">benchmarked uv</a> against other script runners that download dependencies. It is the fastest that implements PEP 723.</p>
<p>If Discussions fit poorly with your workflow, maybe you could create a single issue for &quot;show and tell&quot;?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for sharing your use case! We'll chat about this internally and see if we feel like it makes sense for us right now. A pinned &quot;Show and tell&quot; issue seems like a reasonable alternative too.</p>
