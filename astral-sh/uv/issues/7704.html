<p><strong>Description:</strong>
Proposing to add a feature comparison table to the UV project's documentation. This table would compare UV with other popular Python environment management tools such as <code>pip</code>, <code>pipx</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>pyenv</code>, and <code>virtualenv</code>. The goal is to help users quickly understand the unique benefits of using UV and make informed decisions on which tool best suits their needs.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Improved Clarity:</strong> A clear, side-by-side comparison will help users see the distinctions and advantages of UV over other tools.</li>
<li><strong>Informed Decisions:</strong> Users can make better decisions when selecting a tool for their specific use case.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Adoption:</strong> Highlighting UV's strengths relative to other tools could lead to increased adoption and usage.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Proposed Table Structure:</strong></p>
<p>| Feature       | UV | pip | pipx | poetry | pyenv | virtualenv | some other tools
|---------------|----|-----|------|--------|-------|------------|------------|
| Package Management   | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | x |
| Environment Management | Yes | No | Partial | Partial | Yes | Yes | x |
| Dependency Resolution | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | No | x |
| Script Execution | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | No | x |
| some other features | x | x | x | x | x | x | x |</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related:</strong>  Documentation feedback #5605</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for considering this feature request. Providing a comprehensive comparison will greatly enhance the usability and appeal of UV.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi thanks for the suggestion! I'm not a big fan of comparison tables, they're hard to keep up to date as we are not the authority on other tools.</p>
<p>As a minor note, why do you give us a partial on resolution? :)</p>
