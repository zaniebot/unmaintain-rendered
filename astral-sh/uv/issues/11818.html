            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I want to use a heavy weight package, playwright, and, while I can install it and use it as a <code>tool</code>, when I want to run it as part of a project, the dependency is not available.</p>
<ul>
<li>It cannot be simply included as a dependency, because it requires a follow-up <code>playwright install-deps [...]</code> step, which downloads a browser.</li>
<li>I don&#x27;t know if I can, nor how to, nest virtualenvs, for use of a heavier dependency shared between projects that doesn&#x27;t need to be updated as often, and would be better not to install multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#x27;s the best, uv-idiomatic way to achieve this task?</p>
Platform
<p>Linux 5.15.0-131-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
Version
<p>uv 0.5.31</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On my machine (ubuntu 24.04) <code>playwright install-deps</code> wants to install system dependencies, that would be installed once per machine, but doesn&#x27;t change the venv, and browser seem to be installed per-user. Are there any modifications that need to made to the venv? Otherwise uv hardlinks dependency files from a cache on installation, so installing a package multiple times is generally cheap.</p>
