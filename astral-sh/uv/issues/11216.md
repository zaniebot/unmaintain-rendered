### Summary

I have a project where in need to install this package from .whl from the web site https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl

I can run this command `pip install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`
But i cannot run `uv pip install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl` i have this error 

```
uv pip install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
  × Failed to download `python-ldap @
  │ https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`

```

even with this command ```uv pip install python-ldap@https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl```

I downloaded the file in local from the same link and when i installed it with the local root and it works well.
Do you know why the installation from a http link it is not working ? 

Regards,

Sorry, I don't know what's going on here. I do find it strange that this server returns a 404 if you omit a user agent, though. It also seems to return responses of different sizes depending on what you include in the user agent.

The file fails to download with `wget pip install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/python_ldap-3.4.0-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`, their server is most likely misconfigured. This is something that needs to be fixed on the side of lfd.uci.edu.
