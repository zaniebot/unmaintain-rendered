            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am using Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS and Apache 2.4.58 and a uv viertual environment with Python 3.13.3 and uv 0.7.7.
I have installed the apache2-dev package but forgot to install python3-dev. Nonetheless,
uv add --group production mod_wsgi
seems to compile mod_wsgi-py313.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so into .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/ and install the mod-wsgi 5.0.2 package) but this won't work with Apache, which segfaults with errors I assume are related to a Python version mismatch (Python 3.12 is the system Python).</p>
<p>pip install mod_wsgi in a separate virtualenv under the system Python 3.12 behaves as expected (fails to compile until I install python3-dev and then compiles a compatible module after I do; then Apache is happy).</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.7.7</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.13.3</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv does not manage anything related to apache and will install packages on the version you request, i.e., if you install a package on the non-system Python 3.13 it may not work with software expecting the system Python 3.12. Given that uv installs mod_wsgi itself correctly, this does not look like a bug in uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the problem might really be that uv is apparently compiling a broken Apache module without warning about the missing python3-dev library. As long as apxs is installed, the Python version shouldn't matter.
If uv is to be a drop-in replacement for pip, it should surely do the same thing and fail to install mod_wsgi if the OS dependencies aren't present?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv is not involved in the <code>mod_wsgi</code> build process, that is done by the <code>mod_wsgi</code> build backend, which decides whether the build fails or not. Apache is a system package, so Python packaging is not aware of Apache and does not handle the interaction.</p>
