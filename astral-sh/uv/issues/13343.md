# Option to specify individual overrides in CLI

---

_Issue opened by @roaldarbol on 2025-05-08 09:21_

### Summary

When install a tool with `uv tool install` (or likely also running `uvx`), it would be great to have the option to specify an override without the need to create a `requirements.txt?` file given the global nature of the commands. I imagine something like the current `--with`, but as an override (maybe `--with-override`).

### Example

An example of a tool that fails to install is libretranslate (see https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate/issues/739). Here it would be super helpful if it was possible to run:

```sh
uv tool install libretranslate --with-override apscheduler==3.9.1.post1
```
