            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On Windows, when running multiple uv instances in parallel (as we do in our CI, using uv as a test runner), there's a risk of concurrent writes to the cache directory, potentially resulting in &quot;Access denied&quot; errors.</p>
<p>For instance, when executing <code>uv python list</code>, uv writes interpreter information to the cache. With multiple uv processes running simultaneously, these write operations may conflict. This issue isn't limited to this specific command; there might be other scenarios where cache writing occurs without file locking.</p>
<h2>Steps to reproduce</h2>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rm -Recurse -Force C:\Users\nigel\AppData\Local\uv\cache\interpreter-v2\
$ Start-Process 'uv' 'python list' -NoNewWindow; Start-Process 'uv' 'python list' -NoNewWindow; Start-Process 'uv' 'python list' -NoNewWindow; Start-Process 'uv' 'python list' -NoNewWindow;
Failed to inspect Python interpreter from managed installations at `AppData\Roaming\uv\data\python\cpython-3.8.20-windows-x86_64-none\python.exe`
  Caused by: Failed to query Python interpreter
  Caused by: Failed to persist temporary file to AppData\Local\uv\cache\interpreter-v2\ae3c819d96baa6b8.msgpack: Access is denied. (os error 5)
