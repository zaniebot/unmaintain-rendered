<p>The log does not reveal if any retry was attempted. Such transient errors should certainly be retried for a small-ish number of times, up to a reasonable deadline.</p>
<p>As I have thought and talked a lot about the relevance of retries around transient errors in distributed systems and CI: once we improve the retrying logic it would be great to have explicit logs indicating those error and retries, leading up to success.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we did retry, we show &quot;Request failed after 3 retries&quot; in the error chain, so this error failed our retrying and was not retried as it should have been.</p>
<p>Currently, we only show individual retries with eventual success with <code>-v</code>, but we can certainly bump that to a warning (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/ad638d7fa394303f09d8bd0e8bde474702dff606/crates/uv-client/src/base_client.rs#L402-L413">https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/ad638d7fa394303f09d8bd0e8bde474702dff606/crates/uv-client/src/base_client.rs#L402-L413</a>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see this error occasionally, and need to rerun uv, if it is retrying it would be a better user experience to include how many times it tried in the final user error message, this would allow the user to be more empathetic to uv when it happens (&quot;hey, at least it tried!&quot;).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that there should be messaging about retries, but iirc the problem here specifically is that that code path isn't in our retry logic at all (streaming or range requests, at least that what it's look likes from the logs, this needs a proper investigation of course), so what's missing is hooking this into our retry logic, which will then also print proper feedback about retries.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry to harp on about this, but currently I've migrated my works dev environment tooling to uv, I took a look at migrating our build tooling to uv yesterday and faced this error several times.</p>
<p>Our build tooling has a lower tolerance for errors because it's more difficult to recover from, so I've put migrating on hold for now.</p>
<p>I'm not in a rush, I can revisit this in the future, but I imagine it will cause other users not to migrate to uv, and they won't make a GitHub issue about it.</p>
<p>Let me know if there's anything useful I can run to help. I can't reproduce it consistently, but I'm happy to try a few times a week.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see that PR landed so I ran my build setup with <code>ENV RUST_LOG=uv=trace</code> and set uv to 0.4.25, and I got the error immediately.</p>
<p>FYI, I <em>suspect</em> the network issue on our end is the firewall decides it needs to do a security scan of the package, it kills the network connection, after the security scan is complete the same requests work for, at least a few more days, but at some point it falls out of the firewall cache (most our builds are cached so we don't normally make this network request). Compared to uv, it appears pip's timeout/retry mechanism will wait long enough for the security scan to complete.</p>

<p>This was <code>uv sync --locked</code> with <code>0.4.28</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>Connection reset by peer (os error 104)</code> here we instead see <code>stream closed because of a broken pipe</code>. This is just another variant of a transport error. Transient. A little bit of retrying would have auto-healed this in all likelihood.</p>

<p>What do we think about prioritizing this relative to other things?</p>
<p>We keep seeing this in CI every now and then. Of course, an outer retrying watchdog thingy can always do the trick, but now that <code>uv</code> is still so young it would be cool to show to the world that we take &quot;best-best-best-effort retrying&quot; serious :-) :heart:</p>
