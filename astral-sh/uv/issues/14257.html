            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I need to install a uv lockfile which contains <code>python-ldap</code> which I have to install manually via a wheel file on windows. I checked the docs but couldn't find a way of telling this to uv.</p>
<p>When I run <code>uv sync --frozen</code>, the setup fails and that's it.</p>
<p>Anything that I can do differently?</p>
<p>Thx in advance ❤</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Windows 11</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.7.6</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you share the <code>pyproject.toml</code>? Typically, you'd add something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.sources]
python-ldap = { path = &quot;./path/to/wheel&quot; }
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @charliermarsh</p>
<p>thx for the fast reply! ❤</p>
<p>That's a good idea, I'll try this out. My - and probably others, too - use case is that I have a unix based Docker image but I want to install the packages locally, too for performance and simplicity reasons. In other package managers this package will just be ignored and I can install it manually.</p>
<p>Here, the process fails and I can't continue. Can you think of a way of making my edge case work?</p>
<p>Thx!</p>

<p>Works like a charm! Would be awesome to have some kind of condition so I can commit it but still: It works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you have a directory for vendored source distributions and wheels, you can use a flat index (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#flat-indexes).</p>
<p>A feature that may more directly solve your problem is that you can limit sources to a specific platform (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#platform-specific-sources)</p>
