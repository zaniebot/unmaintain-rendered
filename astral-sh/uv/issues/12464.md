# Running package tests from root of workspace?

---

_Issue opened by @Time0o on 2025-03-25 13:44_

### Question

I am attempting to create a uv workspace. In particular I have a package under `packages/my_package` that contains a `src/my_module` and `test` directory. Inside the package directory I can run the tests with `uv run pytest` because I am using the hatchling build backend which lets the tests `import my_module` no problem.

However, running `uv run pytest` from the root of the workspace does not work because the tests can then not find `my_module`.

What is the correct way to run tests across packages? I would like to the tox configuration in my top-level `pyproject.toml` for all of them but I don't see how.
