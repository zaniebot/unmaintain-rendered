            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @konstin for following up on this. Such a test could also make a specific test when you use <code>--publish-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/</code> and there's no credentials but there is something like <code>https://test.pypi.org/legacy/?PACKAGE</code> available - it could say &quot;hey, you might want to use a package-specific publish URL that has the following form where ?PACKAGE is your package`.</p>
<p>Should uv go even further to guess the right publish URL in keyring based on the current package name? Can uv publish even introspect on that metadata?</p>
