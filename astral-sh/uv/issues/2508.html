Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hi, <code>uv</code> works very well in venv creation and package installation but I have some questions about the venv reproduction.</p>
<p>I see there is no <code>.lock</code> or <code>.toml</code> file when we run <code>uv venv</code> or <code>uv pip install xxx</code>.  I don't want to use the package list created by <code>pip freeze</code>, which lists packages in <code>package==version</code> format, compared to the <code>xxx = &quot;^0.1.7&quot;</code> format in <code>poetry</code>.</p>
<p>So how can we reproduce current venv other than <code>uv pip freeze</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Related to #1968</p>
<p>use <code>uv pip freeze | uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt</code> to create lock file for your current environment. then install lock file into new environment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we don't support Poetry-style dependencies, which are custom to Poetry and aren't standardized in any way. So if you're trying to convert from PEP 508-style requirements to Poetry-style requirements, I don't think uv can help you. There may be other tools that can facilitate that conversion.</p>
