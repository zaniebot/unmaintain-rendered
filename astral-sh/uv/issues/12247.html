            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sorry if this is duplicate.
Currently, if you have a uv-created venv activated, <code>pip</code> is not available and so it points to your system pip. You can add pip to your uv venv when you create it with the --seed flag, but I think it should be this way by default and I'm curious why it isn't</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would expect a venv to have pip in it. If I ssh into a shared linux server and find and activate a virtual environment, I would expect to be able to use pip. People who don't know what uv is would be very confused in this situation</li>
<li>I manage a python package for ~100 engineers internally at a company. We are migrating our main project from pip to uv, and it would help to have commands that work regardless of how they set up their venv, i.e. <code>pip install x</code> <code>pip show x</code>, rather than &quot;if you set this up with uv, do this x, otherwise y&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the above two reasons, I basically will only use and instruct others to use uv venv with the --seed flag, which makes me feel like it should be the default.</p>
<p>I understand seed is configurable with environment variable, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use both Windows and Linux, setting environment variables on Windows is a mess (both the UI and the PS command) and very tedious and multiplying that by 100 engineers each who each have multiple computers is a big loss.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>uv venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install pandas
uv pip show pandas
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know there's many packages out there that run pip on your behalf using sys.execuble such as <a href="https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/blob/b3c46c315eb16ce644bddd106d31c3dd349f6bb2/spacy/cli/download.py#L175">spacy</a> e.g. via <code>python -m spacy download xyz</code>.</p>
<p>I believe something like this could help those scenarios, although this could easily be a breaking change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a deliberate design decision to add a barrier to using pip inside uv venvs and I think that's the right choice.</p>
<p>What is the barrier to using native uv commands?</p>

<p>I haven't tried it for the <code>seed</code> option per se, but have you considered centrally managing users' <code>uv.toml</code> configuration files? This is what we do for our corporate environment (Windows + Linux, with a tiny Mac segment), and it works great -- much better than env vars indeed.</p>
