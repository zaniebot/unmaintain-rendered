            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm trying to achieve the following through CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># pyproject.toml
[dependency-groups]
ruff = [
    &quot;beslogic-ruff-config&quot;,
    &quot;ruff&quot;,
]
dev = [
  { include-group = &quot;ruff&quot; },
]
[tool.uv.sources]
beslogic-ruff-config = { git = &quot;https://github.com/Beslogic/Beslogic-Ruff-Config&quot;, rev = &quot;&lt;rev&gt;&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>What I got so far:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv add git+https://github.com/Beslogic/Beslogic-Ruff-Config --group ruff --rev &lt;rev&gt;
uv add ruff --group ruff
# Something like that
uv add &quot;{ include-group = 'ruff' }&quot; --dev # also tried with --raw
</code></pre>
<p>Which results in:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">error: Failed to parse: `{ include-group = 'ruff' }`
  Caused by: Expected package name starting with an alphanumeric character, found `{`
{ include-group = 'ruff' }
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to add an <code>include-group</code> entry using the CLI.</p>
<p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#nesting-groups makes no mention of this being possible, hence I'm opening as a feature request.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Tools that only need to run within a specific context and don't need to pull in the entire dev dependencies can offer a simpler optimized installation method through a few CLI commands (create a dependency group, then add said group to dev)</p>
<p>(my full real-world example is included in summary)</p>
<p>I can see this pattern becoming popular once Ruff officially supports extending non-local configurations</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><pre><code>uv add --include-group foo --group bar
</code></pre>
<p>is the first thing I can think of?</p>
<p>Or I guess we could use our invented syntax we use for display, i.e.:</p>
<pre><code>uv add project:foo --group bar
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO <code>--include-group</code> has better discoverability. As a CLI arg it'll naturally come up in --help and it'll be easier to search for in docs.</p>
<p><code>uv add foo2 --include-group foo --group bar</code> would still work and add both the dependency and include to the group</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm a little wary of adding more flags though. We do already support group selection e.g., <code>uv pip install --group pyproject.toml:group</code>. And this is how you'd add an extra to a group, e.g., <code>uv add project[foo] --group bar</code>.</p>
