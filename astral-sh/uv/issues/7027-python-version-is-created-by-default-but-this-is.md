# `.python-version` is created by default but this is not documented

I think I'm right in saying that https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6869 has made the creation of a `.python-version` file happen by default if you run `uv init`.

But this still needs to be updated in the project docs? see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/
