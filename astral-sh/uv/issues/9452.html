            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👋 Thanks for engaging with uv! As maintainers, we must split our time between solving existing issues (e.g., by adding features and fixing bugs) and responding to new issues. We care a lot about responding to issues promptly. <strong>Help us out by opening high quality issues, identifying related issues, and ensuring that your issue is not a duplicate.</strong></p>
<h2>When to open a new issue</h2>
<p>Before opening a new issue, please <strong><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20%20sort%3Arelevance-desc%20">search for a similar issue</a></strong>. GitHub's search is frequently unreliable, we struggle to find issues we know exist, so we understand if you have a hard time finding an existing issue. The preceding link includes closed issues and sorts by the &quot;best match&quot;. We've also included some common issues below. It's also important to <strong>search the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">documentation</a></strong>; we often see issues that are answered there.</p>
<p>If you find a similar issue, please <strong>confirm that your issue is the same</strong>. If you are not certain if your issue is the same, it is best to create a new issue instead. Including a link to possible existing issues can save us a lot of time. Some error messages can look similar, e.g., during build failure, but we often need more information to help diagnose your issue and it's best to avoid side-tracking an existing discussion.</p>
<p>If your request or problem is the same as an existing issue, please <strong>upvote the original post with a 👍</strong> instead of adding a comment like &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;I'm encountering this too&quot;. If you do comment, please make sure you're adding new context to the conversation. Similarly, please do not request status updates on issues — if progress has been made, the issue is usually updated.</p>
<p>If you encountered the same problem or have the same question as someone else, consider creating a new issue with a <strong>suggestion to improve the experience</strong>. For example, uv could show a different error message that would help explain its behavior. In this way, we can collaborate to prevent confusion in the first place and make uv easier to use.</p>
<h2>What information to include</h2>
<p>When reporting a problem or asking a question, <strong>be sure to include the following</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version of uv</li>
<li>The operating system</li>
<li>The command that you ran</li>
<li>The output of the command with the <code>--verbose</code> flag</li>
</ul>
<p>Including this information can save a lot of back and forth and we'll be able to solve your problem faster.</p>
<p>The <strong>best issues include a <em>minimal reproduction</em> of the problem</strong>. A minimal reproduction is a <em>small</em> example that demonstrates the problem. This can take a few forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>A repository on GitHub and a command to run</li>
<li>A Docker image and command</li>
<li>A list of commands to run, e.g., <code>uv init example &amp;&amp; cd example &amp;&amp; uv add ...</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If your project is open source, it can be helpful to link to your <em>actual</em> GitHub repository you are encountering the problem in. However, this is not a <em>minimal</em> example — isolating the issue in a simple case without extraneous details is better. Including both can help us narrow down the problem. <strong>See our <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/troubleshooting/reproducible-examples/">reproducible examples guide</a> for examples</strong> and more details.</p>
<p>A few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're not on the latest version of uv, <strong>make sure that your issue is still present on the latest version</strong>.</li>
<li>If the behavior worked on a previous version of uv and <em>regressed</em> in a new version, please share all the versions you have tested. This can help track down the cause of the bug. Regressions are generally given higher priority.</li>
<li>Please <strong>avoid screenshots</strong>, and use markdown formatted text. Instead, copy the output text from your terminal. This improves discoverability via search and makes it easier for maintainers to interact with the output.</li>
<li>You can get more logs by repeating the <code>-v</code> flag, e.g., <code>-vvv</code>. These logs can be very verbose, we recommend putting them in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/b146fe5da72ca1f706b2ef72a20ac39d"><code>&lt;details&gt;</code> block</a> or a <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist</a>.</li>
<li>If you're reporting a difference from pip, please be sure to share both the <code>uv pip</code> and <code>pip</code> commands used and their output. Read the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/">pip compatibility guide</a> to ensure the difference is not intentional.</li>
</ul>
