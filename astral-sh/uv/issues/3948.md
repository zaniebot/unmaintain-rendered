# uv venv

_Issue opened by @DRKolev-code on 2024-05-31 20:24_

Hi. I am thinking of switching to uv from poetry. I never used virtualenv. What is the benefit of providing `uv venv` compared to `python -m venv .venv`?

The main benefit is that it's much faster than `python -m venv .venv`, and you can just use uv for creating the environment as well as installing into it without having to learn multiple tools:

```sh
uv venv
uv pip install flask
...
```

But if you use `python -m venv .venv`, `uv` will still cooperate with it just fine -- it can install into `python -m venv` environments without an issue.

Another benefit is that `uv venv` seems to produce a virtual environment that is compatible with `virtualenv`. 

I use a piece of software that only works with virtual environments created by `virtualenv`, and the one produced by `uv venv` seems to work with it as well. This tool is not compatible with virtual environments produced with `python -m venv`. I think in general, many more tools support `virtualenv` over `venv`.

Thanks for the answers!

The reason I am asking is because we are debating switching to uv from poetry in our production but my reservation is in the scope of uv. Currently, we have `venv|conda` + `pyenv` + `poetry` with preference for `venv`.

I want to have this situation: `venv` + `pyenv` + `uv`. Would such a scenario continue to be supported?

This is what I want to avoid.

Yeah, you can certainly use `uv` with virtual environments created by `python -m venv` or `virtualenv`. In each case, the environment itself follows the same standardized structure, so there's no issue with it.

Thanks! Looking forward to testing and hopefully replacing poetry. :)
