# `uv pip compile` should support an option for not sending the compiled requirements to stdout, but not hiding other output with --quiet

### Summary

The output of `uv pip compile` can be quite large given an extensive list of dependencies. The `--quiet` option hides this output but it would still be useful for the dependency resolution info and progress info to be output to stdout, excluding the compiled requirements.

### Example

Currently:
```
# standard
$ uv pip compile <requirements-in> -o <requirements-txt>
<progress-output>
Resolved 303 packages in 25.00s
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile <requirements-in> -o <requirements-txt>
absl-py==2.3.1
    # via
    #   -r <requirements-in>
addict==2.4.0
    # via
    #   -r <requirements-in>
...
# with --quiet
$ uv pip compile <requirements-in> -o <requirements-txt>
<nada>
```

Change:
```
# with a badly named new option --file-only
$ uv pip compile <requirements-in> -o <requirements-txt> --file-only
<progress-output>
Resolved 303 packages in 25.00s
```
