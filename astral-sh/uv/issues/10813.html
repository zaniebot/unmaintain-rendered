How am I supposed to install project dependencies from an existing pyproject.toml?
Where is that notorious <code>uv install</code> command that would install all the project packages?</p>

If you run it directly as a project, then using uv sync should also work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but who designed the CLI interface? What does pip have to do with it at all?
If you don’t mind a bit of criticism: the current UX of <code>uv</code> is astonishing in the worst possible way - everything is so counter-intuitive and confusing. My goodness, why?</p>

I&#x27;m not sure about the UX, but it&#x27;s definitely one of pip&#x27;s features.</p>

<li><code>uv sync</code> will sync the project dependencies into the <code>.venv</code> in the project directory.</li>
<li><code>uv run {command}</code> will run a command in the project&#x27;s environment, automatically locking and syncing if anything is out-of-date.</li>
<li><code>uv pip install</code> (and other <code>uv pip</code> commands) exist for compatibility with users that want a pip-style workflow. Commands like <code>uv sync</code> and <code>uv run</code> are project-centric, but much of the existing Python ecosystem is not. <code>uv pip</code> is an alternative interface to <code>uv sync</code>, <code>uv run</code>, etc. You would typically not use them together.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To be constructive, I believe that the meaning of sync/build should be clarified to non native speaking users. Installs first time? Installs if not installed? Doesn&#x27;t uprade? What&#x27;s the difference?</p>
<pre><code>### Syncing the environment

While the environment is synced automatically, it may also be explicitly synced using uv sync:

uv sync 

Syncing the environment manually is especially useful for ensuring your editor has the correct versions of dependencies.

            <div class="timeline-body"><pre><code>The tool is functionally capable. The problem is not what it does, but how that functionality is exposed to users.</code></pre>
<p>From a user’s perspective, the interface and documentation expose internal implementation concepts rather than user-level tasks. As a result, performing a basic operation - such as installing project dependencies - requires understanding the system’s internal model instead of invoking a clear, intention-driven command.
A user comes with a simple intent:<br>
<code>install project packages</code>
Instead, they are presented with commands like:<br>
<code>uv sync</code>, <code>uv add</code>, <code>uv run</code>
These are internal operations, not task-oriented actions. The interface mirrors how the system works rather than what the user wants to do, forcing the user to infer which internal command matches their goal.
This also breaks established CLI expectations shaped by tools like <code>pip install</code>, <code>npm install</code>, or <code>cargo install</code>, which provide a clear entry point for common workflows. Requiring users to adapt to internal abstractions instead of meeting those expectations increases cognitive load and friction.
This is not a documentation problem. Documentation cannot compensate for a missing abstraction in the interface. If users must read architectural explanations, issues, or source code to perform a basic task, the interface is incomplete.
Well-known tools demonstrate that this is avoidable. <strong>Git</strong> explicitly separates user-facing <em>porcelain</em> commands from internal <em>plumbing</em> operations. <strong>Mercurial (hg)</strong> goes even further by aggressively hiding internal concepts behind an intention-driven interface. Both show that implementation complexity does not have to leak into UX.</p>
<p><strong>In short:</strong><br>
The interface exposes internal mechanics instead of user workflows, forcing users to think like system implementers rather than consumers of functionality.</p>
