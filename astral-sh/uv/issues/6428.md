# Configuration request: UV_NO_BINARY env var

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

Pip has the environment variable `PIP_NO_BINARY` to not install binary packages and instead compile them. This env var has the same behavior as `--no-binary` flag for `pip install`.

`uv pip install` has the `--no-binary` flag, but not the env var (not in the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/)).

I'd like to request the env var `UV_NO_BINARY`, with the same syntax/functionality as `PIP_NO_BINARY` and the `--no-binary` flag.
