<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
## uv version
0.1.6

## Platform
Darwin

## Description

This works:

```bash
pip install ".[dev]"
```

and this works:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

but this doesn't:

```bash
uv pip install ".[dev]"
```

I get

```bash
 uv::requirements::from_source source=.[dev]
error: Failed to parse `.[dev]`
  Caused by: Expected package name starting with an alphanumeric character, found '.'
.[dev]
^
```

when running with `--verbose`.

I'm installing my package from a pyproject.toml and the dependency groups are defined under `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

Thanks, this is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/313. You can use `uv pip install "package-name @ .[dev]"` for now, but we'll lift this restriction in the future.

This is supported as of `v0.1.24`. You can `uv pip install .[dev]` directly, without including a package name.
