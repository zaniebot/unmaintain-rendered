            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In CPython 3.14's <code>venv</code> module there is a new alias for the <code>python</code> interpretter alongside <code>python3</code> or <code>python3.14</code> called <code>𝜋thon</code>. This is an easter egg for this minor version of CPython, and it would be neat if <code>uv</code> also added this alias.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the original easter egg, would probably be best to leave it out of the release notes and just quietly add it.</p>
<p>Original Easter Egg: https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/125035</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>With <code>venv</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">python3.14 -m venv .venv
</code></pre>
<p>Or with <code>uv</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv venv -p 3.14 .venv
</code></pre>
<p>Would produce this list of executables in the <code>.venv/bin/</code> directory</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ls .venv/bin/
activate                activate.fish           pip                     python
activate_this.py        activate.nu             pip3                    python3
activate.bat            activate.ps1            pip3.14                 python3.14
activate.csh            deactivate.bat          pydoc.bat               𝜋thon
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There was a PR for this already but received (a light) pushback.</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13341</p>
<p>Personally I'm enjoying that Python still retains it's Monty Pyzhon quirkiness so would be nice if uv did this, but it's up to the maintainers. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One downside to uv supporting this, is that uv would have to keep support for this for many more years than the upstream CPython project does, due to uv supporting historic versions of Python. (ie: uv will likely need to support Python 3.14 for many years after 3.14 reaches upstream EOL)</p>
<p>In contrast, the upstream CPython project was already able to remove support from <code>main</code> (where Python 3.15 is now being developed), so won't be carrying the feature in any newer branch:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could someone explain to me, a layman when it comes to Python packaging and tooling, what extra support burden this imposes on the dev team? It seems like the PR's code is all that is needed, and shouldn't need much more support than that. Some things I can envision:</p>
<ul>
<li>It may be troublesome to remember to replicate the code if some future feature <em>should</em> support this.</li>
<li>It may cause new issues popping up with &quot;<code>𝜋thon</code> not working anymore&quot;, which increases triaging times.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn't even advertise the feature or claim it's a &quot;supported feature&quot;. I understand the desire to ship polished software that always runs, which <code>uv</code> is (it's a joy to use; I love it!), and this increases the bug surface in a sense. But it also seems like a bit of harmless fun.</p>
<p>However, I may be missing something, so I welcome the opportunity to learn about this 🤓.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just adding on to this thread.</p>
<p>I'm also having trouble when trying to install torch via <code>uv</code>, but I'd get this error:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install --index-url https://rocm.nightlies.amd.com/v2/gfx1151/ --pre torch torchaudio torchvision
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because all versions of torch have no wheels with a matching Python ABI
      tag (e.g., `cp314`) and you require torch, we can conclude that your
      requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: You require CPython 3.14 (`cp314`), but we only found wheels for
      `torch` (v2.10.0a0+rocm7.10.0a20251024) with the following Python ABI
      tags: `cp311`, `cp312`, `cp313`
</code></pre>
<p>At first, I thought it was an <code>uv</code> problem, but now that I see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/156856, it seems like a chain of external dependencies and package managers that makes Python more fun to use.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hoonsubin that's unrelated, uv supports 3.14 — this issue is about supporting an easter egg added in 3.14. That issue you linked is the correct issue to follow for pytorch 3.14 support.</p>
