# `uv pip compile` does not show which dependencies are defined directly by the project

_Issue opened by @silv-io on 2024-03-04 16:15_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

# Expected Behavior

`pip-compile` signifies which dependencies come directly from the current project itself, by putting `<project-name> (pyproject.toml)` in the `via` comment. This is very helpful in differentiating between transitive and direct dependencies.

# Bug

`uv` completely skips this output, making transitive and direct dependencies look the same.

# Platform

* Linux AMD64
* `uv` version: `0.1.13`
