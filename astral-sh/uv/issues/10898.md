# `uv --python` and `uv python pin` fail if Python3.6 is found on the system

---

_Issue opened by @jramcast on 2025-01-23 14:45_

### Summary

I have Python 3.10 installed at `/usr/local/bin/python`
Python3.6 is also available at /usr/bin/python3

**Expected behavior**: uv ignores the 3.6 installation.

**Actuall behavior**. When I try to run a command by using a specific python version, the command fails

```

Thanks for the report! This is surprising.

Do you have a Python 3.9 interpreter available?

Does this reproduce on `uv 0.5.21`? I am suspicious of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10716

No, Python 3.9 is not initially available in the system.

Downgrading to `0.5.21` solves the issue:

```console
$ uv run --python 3.9 python --version
Python 3.9.21
```

More verbose output:

```console
$ uv -v run --python 3.9 python --version

Similar issue with the uv 0.6.1:
