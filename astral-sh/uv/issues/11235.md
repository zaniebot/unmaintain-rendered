# uv sync ignores user config file

---

_Issue opened by @mneumei on 2025-02-05 06:53_

### Summary

I have a uv.toml at "%APPDATA%\uv\uv.toml" with the content:

[[index]]
url = "https:/<my_index>/simple"
default = true

python-downloads = "never"

When i run uv sync, it will still try to download python.

How can i verify where it will actually read the config from, and which values were taken? Is there any similar function like pip config list?

### Platform

win11 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.5.25 (9c07c3fc5 2025-01-28)

### Python version

Python 3.11.4

This is an issue with the TOML you're using. You need to do something like:

```toml
python-downloads = "never"

[[index]]
url = "https://google.com"
default = true
```

As-is, `python-downloads` is being considered a key under `[[index]]`.

You can add `--show-settings` to any command to show the applicable settings.

Thanks, that solved it. Is there a "General" section to make sure it will not end up in previous sections?

Also, what would be super helpful is to have the source of the configuration item (like this setting is from env, this form this config file).

Thanks a lot for the quick response!

Unfortunately not in `uv.toml`, it's just top-level vs. nested :(

In `pyproject.toml` it's a bit clearer, since you have:

```toml
[tool.uv]
python-downloads = "never"

[[tool.uv.index]]
url = "https://google.com"
default = true
```

But that isn't applicable to user- or system-level settings like that.
