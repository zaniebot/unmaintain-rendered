            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a package (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/json5/">json5</a>) that has no runtime dependencies and runs on 3.8 or later, so my package has a <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;= 3.8.0&quot;</code> in its pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>I also have a <code>dev</code> environment configured for the package that contains all the tools I need to work on the package (uv, ruff, mypy, etc.).</p>
<p>As tools are gradually dropping support for 3.8, I can no longer run the latest version of everything and still run the dev environment on 3.8.</p>
<p>It would be great if there was some way to specify that the dev environment required 3.9 or later, but the actual package only required 3.8 (i.e., I could have a 3.13 environment that would be able to build a package for 3.8). AFAICT, there isn't currently a way to do this except perhaps to use multiple pyproject.tomls, which kind of defeats the point. I don't know if it would be possible to implement this in uv or if it'd actually need changes upstream to the pyproject spec et al?</p>

<p>Ideally it'd be added to the specification, but we can try it first.</p>
