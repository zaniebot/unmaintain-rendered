<p>fyi, within the <code>README</code> install instructions for downloading the install script (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/c306e46e1d3342a923ab587a1e9d3313dddb3000/README.md#L53-L54">here</a>), this fails as  he curl command is downloading HTTP headers as well as the actual script content due to the redirects</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/c306e46e1d3342a923ab587a1e9d3313dddb3000/README.md#L51-L55</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

<p>the URL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh redirects (HTTP 301) to a new location:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/uv-installer.sh. which is then redirected (HTTP 302) to a specific versioned installer download URL:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.5.21/uv-installer.sh and the final URL points to an Azure Blob storage location</p>

<p>What shell are you using...? Something with your cURL version? Something in your network proxy? I have no idea.</p>
