Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<h1>command</h1>
<p>Run <code>uv sync --all-extras</code> installs the following dependency tree:</p>
<pre><code>pylint v2.3.0
├── astroid v3.3.2
├── isort v5.13.2
└── mccabe v0.7.0
</code></pre>
<p>There is no reason to use pylint 2.3.0 as far as I can see. The current pylint version is 3.2.7.</p>

<p>The issue is that the resolver is prioritizing solving for <code>astroid</code>, so you get a newer version of <code>astroid</code> (<code>3.3.2</code>) than is supported by newer versions of <code>pylint</code>. This isn't any less valid than a resolution that gives you <code>pylint==v3.2.7</code> and <code>astroid==v3.2.4</code>, though that resolution makes more sense from a user perspective.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This also works, perhaps more intuitive:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, the problem is that <code>astroid</code> is an explicit dependency. If it wouldn't be, uv would solve for the newest pylint version and get whatever <code>astroid</code> version it requires. Makes sense.</p>
<p>I can't come up with a better idea on how to solve this (that's also simple), so I guess this issue can be closed.</p>
<p>FTR: In those cases, you could calculate a score from the version numbers. And then use the combination of packages with the highest score. <strong>But</strong> who knows what side effects this would produce and how long it would take.</p>
