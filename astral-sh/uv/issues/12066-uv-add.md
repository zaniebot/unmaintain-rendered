Hi! This issue does not meet our standards for a bug report. Please see #9452 and add the requested information.

Notably, it's not clear what's wrong here? Looks like you requested a package with an extra that does not exist.

That isn't one of the extras, from what I can see?

Similarly this does not exist

https://inspector.pypi.io/project/beanie/1.29.0/packages/04/28/f6038727827ed06659a57b3c70e6f4a339f57f92ce910f868ac928843a30/beanie-1.29.0-py3-none-any.whl/beanie-1.29.0.dist-info/METADATA#line.52

I'm sorry, but I don't really see what this has to do with uv?
