# Combine `project` and `pip` routine internals

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-22 16:46_

I think I can merge the utilities in `crates/uv/src/commands/project/mod.rs` with those in `crates/uv/src/commands/pip/operations.rs`, so that we can have shared routines for installing and resolving between the two APIs and across the various commands. Would lead to a lot of deduplication and ideally better abstractions.
