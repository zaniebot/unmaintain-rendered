# Using uv run in launch.json for Debugging Python Apps

---

_Issue opened by @user1500177 on 2025-12-09 12:32_

### Question

Hi team,

I’m currently able to debug my Python applications in VS Code using the standard Python configuration in [launch.json](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/kevin.paulson/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html):

    {
      "name": "Debug API (Python)",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/api/main.py",
      "console": "integratedTerminal"
    }

However, I’d like to use [uv run](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/kevin.paulson/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) instead of the default Python interpreter, so I can leverage its speed and environment management. I can run my app with uv run src/api/main.py from the terminal, but I haven’t found a way to use uv run directly in [launch.json](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/kevin.paulson/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) for debugging.

Is it possible to configure [launch.json](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/kevin.paulson/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) to use uv run for debugging (with breakpoints, etc.)? If so, what would the configuration look like?

Isn't `uv run` a wrapper on the corresponding python cli itself?

You can just activate the venv created uv and continue working normally.
