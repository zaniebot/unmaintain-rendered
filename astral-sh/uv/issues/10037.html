            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>In my typical workflow, I create virtual environments using <code>poetry</code> or <code>venv</code> and activate them with <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code>. While I primarily rely on <code>poetry</code> for package management and tracking dependencies in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, I occasionally use <code>pip</code> for tasks like checking installed package versions or installing packages without tracking them in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>Currently, this workflow isn’t possible with <code>uv</code> because virtual environments created by <code>uv</code> do not include <code>pip</code> by default. To address this, would it be possible to create an alias for <code>pip</code> that maps to <code>uv pip</code> within UV-managed virtual environments? This would ensure a seamless experience when using <code>pip</code> commands alongside <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering this feature request!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a rather old question (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1657). Perhaps you could take a look at the discussion to see why uv didn't plan to do this in the past.</p>
