# Combine `uv` configuration from workspace root

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-11 19:41_

Rather than the nearest `pyproject.toml`. We lock the whole workspace at once, so I don't think we can allow per-project configuration within a workspace... Perhaps for sync / install, though?
