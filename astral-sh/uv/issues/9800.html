            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I want to include extra non-code files into my package (ie. JSON configuration files), and access them in code as <code>import resources; config_path = resources.files(&quot;config&quot;)</code>. In hatch I can do stuff this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.hatch.build]
include = [&quot;config/**/*.json&quot;, &quot;src/mypackage/**/*.py&quot;]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = [&quot;src/package&quot;]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]
&quot;config/&quot; = &quot;/config&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Is there an equivalent for uv?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I'm not mistaken, <code>[tool.hatch.build]</code> refers to the backend settings of <strong>hatchling.build</strong>, right? uv doesn't have its own officially released backend yet, so you might consider continuing to use <strong>hatchling.build</strong>, as it can still be used.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-system]
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>uv build supports other build backends, not just uv's build backend.</p>
<p>Here are the supported backends during <code>uv init</code>.</p>
<pre><code>--build-backend build-backend
Initialize a build-backend of choice for the project.

Implicitly sets --package.

Possible values:

hatch: Use hatchling as the project build backend
flit: Use flit-core as the project build backend
pdm: Use pdm-backend as the project build backend
setuptools: Use setuptools as the project build backend
maturin: Use maturin as the project build backend
scikit: Use scikit-build-core as the project build backend
</code></pre>
<p>Are you using UV as your build  backend right now?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah ok that makes total sense, I can just continue to use Hatch.</p>
<p>How would I be able to use uv to build though? It would be nice if I can eliminate one more extra tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use <code>uv build</code> with the hatchling build backend. Like, you should be able to run <code>uv build</code> in your project even with those settings (unless they're specific to <em>hatch</em> rather than hatchling).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@rdong8 If you want to remove the dependency on hatchling, you can keep an eye on the state of the UV build backend.
