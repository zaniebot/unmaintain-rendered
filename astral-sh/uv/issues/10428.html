            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods, the given install command is currently for Windows</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I was not able to run this because of a security software.</p>
<p>However, I was able to follow the installation instructions &quot;Install via <a href="https://scoop.sh/">Scoop</a>:&quot; in https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/ for which one needs to execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, I guess installation instructions for UV (or the script I don't know) could be improved to avoid such security blockage.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was finally able to install UV with the .ps1 installer with</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 -OutFile install-uv.ps1
iex .\install-uv.ps1
</code></pre>
<p>So it might just be that what does not like the security software is only the <code>| iex</code> ? However, <code>| Invoke-Expression</code> worked with Scoop, so I don't know.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It might be useful to improve the documentation. About this and also not using short Powershell aliases. I guess very few people know &quot;irm&quot; and &quot;iex&quot; so it is really &quot;copy paste this command that you don't understand&quot;. The longer version with few steps and with a local (and checkable) <code>install-uv.ps1</code> script might be better.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a user try to install this and our AV blocked it as well.  The specific error was &quot;The application powershell.exe attempted to execute fileless content that contains known malware. This content performs highly suspicious process injection behavior.&quot; I'm trying to figure out what specifically in there it flagged as known malware, but I don't have anything specific at this point.</p>

<p>It seems to indicate that it can be an issue with <code>| iex</code> (executing without file on disk).</p>
