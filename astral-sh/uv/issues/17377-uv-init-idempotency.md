_@ginolegigot_

### Summary

hello!
would it be possible to achieve some idempotency on uv init ? (if i missed the option, apologize)
if i uv init on a project already created, would it be possible to say "Nothing happened because the project is already created" instead of getting an error "Project is already initialized in ..." ?

### Example
