            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Update: while I initially suspected this to be specific to macos-arm64, it seems to no to be true as I seen the exact same error on linux with intel architectures at https://github.com/ansible/tox-ansible/actions/runs/11705926832/job/32601848111?pr=389#step:9:91</p>
<p>So, it can happen on both arm64 and amd64, linux and macos and multiple versions of python.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Thanks for the very fast reply. Apparently that failure is caused by something else. For sure is not a specific local setup issue because I was able to reproduce it on my macos and but also on the github runners.</p>
<p>I suspect it might be related to how python was compiled?</p>
<p>Using uv provided pythons seems to be working, by I am currently using asdf ones on mac and on github runners, I am not sure where github is taking the pythons from.</p>
<p>Any ideas about what else to invetigate?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was able to find that uv installs wrong binary for regex. While using py312, I found that the installed package had <code>_regex.cpython-310-darwin.so</code>... so that is why python failed to import it... and found it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.pip]
annotation-style = &quot;line&quot;
custom-compile-command = &quot;tox run deps&quot;
python-version = &quot;3.10&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The last line makes uv install the wrong wheel, even if documentation states that it should do something different:</p>
<pre><code> --python-version &lt;PYTHON_VERSION&gt;      The minimum Python version that should be supported by the requirements (e.g., `3.7` or `3.7.9`)
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to use this config option in order to produce predictable lock file using <code>uv pip compile</code> but the side effect is that once you configure it, uv will start installing wrong binary wheel all the time.</p>
<p>This makes be believe that this is related to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3883</p>
