<p>Hey, thanks for the fast answer.
Yes I guess it's a cringe Windows effect (yet another one, using Windows for work is only suffering)
My UV version is:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv --version
uv 0.3.3 (deea6025a 2024-08-23)
</code></pre>
<p>I guess it worked on 0.3.0. But someday without updating it stopped working also on 0.3.0, so I updated thinking it was a simple bug (to 0.3.3) and nope it doesn't work</p>

<p>How I could give you more informations on my environnement ? Some command/variable ?</p>
<p>It fails in MINGW (Git for Windows), Powershell and CMD. =&gt; They don't activate the <code>.venv</code> by default
BUT, new info: it works in JetBrains IDE because the integrated terminal activate the <code>(.venv)</code> by default.</p>
