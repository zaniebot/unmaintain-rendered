            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>don't know if this is the right place, but my company recently installed Crowdstrike (yeah, that one)
and it is now messing with me after switching to awesome UV.</p>
<p>For only <strong>some</strong> of our internal Python packages, Crowdstrike is quarantining the EXE that is created by UV (because of defined gui application entrypoints of the library),
when i try installing it via <code>uv tool install</code> or creating a venv and installing the library using <code>uv pip install</code>.</p>
<p>Why i'm creating this issue here? Well, if i'm using <code>pip</code> and <code>pipx</code> to install,
everything works fine.
Maybe Crowdstrike has a problem with the <code>uv-trampoline</code> bootstrap code? This seems to be the only difference between executables from UV and PIPX, or am i wrong?</p>
<p>It seems to be only an issue for entrypoints defined in <code>[project.gui-scripts]</code>, entrypoints from <code>[project.scripts]</code> are not quarantined.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8187aaba-1c75-4e81-80bf-82b15b1b5148" alt="image" /></p>
<p>UV version: uv 0.4.9 (77d278f68 2024-09-10)
Windows 10</p>
<p>I could make a small reproducible Python project example that triggers the quarantine and attached it:
<a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16976061/cs_false_positive.zip">cs_false_positive.zip</a>
Just unpack and execute <code>trigger_crowdstrike.ps1</code>. This will create a venv and install the project. Crowdstrike will then delete <code>.venv\Scripts\hello-app.exe</code> but ignore <code>.venv\Scripts\hello-cli.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Did you also report this as a false-positive to Crowdstrike? I'd love to hear what they say too. We're not doing anything malicious :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes our CyberSec team is reporting it to them, but i probably don't get any information i could share with you. Since they are doing a lot of scanning based on ML models, this can take some time until they updated to model to not flag the executables anymore, if they do this at all...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Suffering from the same problem. Our cybersec team has also submitted a report on the false-positive to Crowdstrike.</p>
<p>My workaround in the meantime is to use .cmd &quot;shebangs&quot; instead of the trampoline feature.</p>

<p>Works for my use case, YMMV!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just wanted to report that this is still a blocking issue (in enterprise environments anyway) since crowdstrike has not adapted their scanners yet.
With <code>uv</code> being used under the hood of more and more tools, the impact is growing as well 😐</p>
