# `uv pip install -e .` -> import package is not working

### Question

Hi all,

i created a sample project for using uv ( [eed_uv_sample_project](https://github.com/EED85/eed_uv_sample_project)).
Just created it using `uv init`.
I installed it in editable mode using `uv pip install e .`. Now i expect that i am able to import this package via `import eed_uv_sample_project`.
But i get the error, that this package is not found.

Can anybody give an advice, what am i doing wrong here?

```bash
$ uv venv .venv
Using CPython 3.13.2
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/Scripts/activate

$ uv pip install -e .

okay it has something to do with the python path.
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('C:/dev/github/EED85/eed_uv_sample_project')
```
does the trick, but code at the top of main.py looks pretty ugly then.

i am trying to update the pythonpath in the bash, but that is currently not working.

```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:C:/dev/github/EED85/eed_uv_sample_project
(.venv) 
ericb@DESKTOP-142JRU9 MINGW64 C:/Users/ericb/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code (main)
$ C:/dev/github/EED85/eed_uv_sample_project/.venv/Scripts/python.exe c:/dev/github/EED85/eed_uv_sample_project/eed_uv_sample_project/main.py
Traceback (most recent call last):

    import eed_uv_sample_project
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'eed_uv_sample_project'
```

You'll want to configure a build backend and restructure your project for imports to work like that.

See
