            <div class="timeline-body"><p>per the last few comments at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/76557: pytorch indexes mostly do have hashes these days.</p>
<p>While automating the process has apparently had its hiccups - they seem willing to engage with requests to fix cases where the hashes are missing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh nice! (We do still need this in general since not all registries will have hashes, but that's really helpful.)</p>
