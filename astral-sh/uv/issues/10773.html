            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>uv 0.5.21 via <code>ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim</code> (<code>ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv@sha256:9cc15585b36e8d7e3a9e2e43ba52b270de73722679f440fd3a5946d431a6e0e7</code>)</li>
<li>run on Apple Silicon, Rosetta AMD64 container emulation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repro steps</h2>
<h3>Dockerfile</h3>
<pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim AS build
WORKDIR /foo
RUN uv init
RUN uv build --wheel

FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim
WORKDIR /app
RUN --mount=from=build,source=/foo/dist,target=/wheels uv --no-cache-dir pip install --system /wheels/*.whl
</code></pre>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<pre><code>$ docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t xxx .
$ docker run -it xxx ls -la /tmp
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    0 Jan 20 08:44 uv-1b696e695b7c17a7.lock
</code></pre>
<h2>Workaround</h2>
<pre><code>RUN --mount=from=build,source=/foo/dist,target=/wheels --mount=type=tmpfs,target=/tmp ...
</code></pre>
<p>so an ephemeral <code>/tmp</code> can't end up in the captured layer.</p>
<h2>Desired result</h2>
<p>No extra files left behind in Docker image (each extra file has a measurable cost when extracting Docker images onto host systems; #7696 was related).</p>

<p>I'm unsure of the behavior either. But if you delete the lock file while the lock isn't held, then that certainly seems like it could lead to a synchronization bug. So that leaves deleting it while the lock is held, which I'm not sure is possible, and I think would require relying on anything that is <em>waiting</em> on the locks to stop with an error. I'm not sure if that's the behavior or not.</p>
<p>Given that I don't know the platform behavior here, I can't immediately think of a way to safely delete these files. I think a user can if they can assert that there aren't any <code>uv</code> processes running.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I agree with @zanieb here. Mount <code>/tmp</code> as a <code>tmpfs</code>. <code>/tmp</code> is often treated as an ephemeral directory whose contents will eventually be removed, and thus precise clean-up isn't nearly as important.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a solution, sure. That just doesn't happen by default in Docker builds, so this stray file (that doesn't appear with vanilla <code>pip</code> – but then again I suppose it doesn't play nice in concurrent situations either) caught me by surprise.</p>
<p>Might be at least worth documenting on the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/">uv Docker page</a>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I can't think of a way to safely delete the file either — we've considered it before.</p>
<p>I'm happy to review a pull request adding it to the page.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My 2 cents: It seems odd that (even outside of containers) <code>uv</code> is virtually the only thing I see leaving stray files in /tmp when not running.</p>
<p>I run CI <em>outside</em> of containers for one project (virtual envs are more than sufficient in this case) and  gathering dozens of /tmp lock files there over time stands out as unusual. It's a minor annoyance, to be sure.</p>
