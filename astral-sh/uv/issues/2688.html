Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>uv version: 0.1.24, running on MacOS.</p>
<p>In my use case, I want to install dependencies, some of them living as .whl files in a local directory. When running `uv pip sync ... -find-links LOCAL_PATH the whls were not found. I made a small example that reproduces the case for me, with disabled network lookup to simplify the case</p>
<p>Case 1: uv pip install seems to work correctly
<code> uv -v pip install MY_PACKAGE --find-links /Users/OTHER_STUFF/libraries/.wheels --no-index</code>
result: based on the logs, it clearly finds the package (and only starts failing later, as this package has external dependencies which it is now blocked to fetch due to no-index flag). Snippet from the log:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG Found 4 packages in `--find-links` entry: /Users/OTHER_STUFF/libraries/.wheels
DEBUG Solving with target Python version 3.11.4
DEBUG Adding direct dependency: MY_PACKAGE*
DEBUG Searching for a compatible version of MY_PACKAGE (*)
DEBUG Selecting: MY_PACKAGE==0.0.1 (MY_PACKAGE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl)
DEBUG Adding transitive dependency: pytest*
...
</code></pre>
<p>Case 2: uv pip sync seems to fail
<code>uv -v pip sync requirements-dev2.txt --find-links /Users/OTHER_STUFF/libraries/.wheels --no-index</code></p>
<p>content of the requirements file:
<code>MY_PACKAGE==0.0.1</code></p>
<p>Snippet from the log:</p>
<pre><code>INFO Found a virtualenv through VIRTUAL_ENV at: /Users/SOME_PATH
DEBUG Cached interpreter info for Python 3.11.4, skipping probing: .venv/bin/python
DEBUG Using Python 3.11.4 environment at .venv/bin/python
DEBUG Using registry request timeout of 300s
DEBUG Found 4 packages in `--find-links` entry: /Users/OTHER_STUFF/libraries/.wheels
DEBUG Identified uncached requirement: MY_PACKAGE ==0.0.1
DEBUG Unnecessary package: ruff==0.1.13
error: MY_PACKAGE isn't available locally, but making network requests to registries was banned.
</code></pre>
<p>Note: there actually is a whitespace in <code>DEBUG Identified uncached requirement: MY_PACKAGE ==0.0.1</code>. Could this be a pointer to what is wrong?</p>
<p>I also tried <code>pip-sync</code> for case 2 instead of <code>uv pip sync</code>, which also seems to work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, running on <code>main</code>, I do see <code>error: lib1 isn't available locally, but making network requests to registries was banned</code>, but I no longer see the space in <code>lib1==0.0.1</code>, so just gonna ignore that for now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By the way, removing <code>--no-index</code> does succeed (but it should still succeed without it).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks a lot! Just a quick check: does it work without —no-index because it finds the local library, or is there a lib1 on PyPI mirroring the local library and is the problem therefore masked?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It finds both (like pip), but it correctly selects the local library since you pinned the version (in my testing).</p>
