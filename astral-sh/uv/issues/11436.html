            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Follow-up from #11435</p>
<p>I don't see a way to <em>add</em> a tool to an already existing env. That would be very handy, particularly in the case of adding libraries over time to an ipython-based env. Otherwise a potentially long, growing chain of <code>--with </code> parameters would be needed.</p>
<p>I personally reach for ipython and a few other things frequently, outside of projects, for many things. I'd love to grow that particular tool env to have many of the libs installed I regularly reach for, but not have it be a defined project.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is intentional. The tool environments are intended to be immutable. I'm very hesitant to add this.</p>
