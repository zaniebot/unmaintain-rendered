Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>I was reading through the documentation of <code>uv pip install</code>  and found the <code>--no-system</code> flag <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/#using-uv-pip">here</a>. However, the latest <code>uv</code> CLI help (from <code>uv pip install</code> does not appear to list it or describe it. Only <code>--system</code> appears on the help.  I think it would nice to include it to the CLI help. Any thoughts?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We generally have negation flags with <code>--no-</code> for each boolean, but adding them to the CLI help would be too verbose.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Totally agree it would be to verbose to add the description for each boolean. I was wondering the rationale, since this flag does exist on CLI help of <code>uv pip tree</code>. Anywho, thanks for the amazing tool!</p>
