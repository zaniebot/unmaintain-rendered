# Support for `UV_PROJECT` environment variable that acts like the CLI `--project` argument

---

_Issue opened by @ggueret on 2025-03-04 11:24_

### Summary

Hi!

Coming from PDM, I used to export the `PDM_PROJECT` environment variable from [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise). I noticed that uv CLI supports a `--project` argument, but there doesn't seem to be an equivalent environment variable like `UV_PROJECT`.

Is this on purpose? The current workflow feature and `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` don't meet the needs, and it's not very user-friendly to have to pass the `--project` argument every time.

### Example

`UV_PROJECT=$(pwd)/backend uv sync` acts like `uv sync --project=$(pwd)/backend`

I was unwell and couldn't sit on this, will take some other open issues once I'm fully recovered.
