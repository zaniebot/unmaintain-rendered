            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a bit of a peculiar workflow. I like to use wheels for all my dependencies and never let them be built from sdists unless explicitly stated in the <code>no-binary-package</code> setting. An example of my <code>[tool.uv]</code> settings could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-system]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]

[project]
name = &quot;my-cool-project&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;dependency-a&quot;, &quot;dependency-b&quot;]

[tool.uv]
no-binary-package = [&quot;my-cool-project&quot;, &quot;dependency-a&quot;]
no-build = true
package = true
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>dependency-a</code> publishes only sdists, and <code>dependency-b</code> publishes sdists and wheels.</p>
<p>To build my project I would then do: <code>uv build --no-sources --build</code>, However this hangs during the build process and never completes. (This also makes other commands which rely on building the project like <code>uv lock</code> &amp; <code>uv sync</code> to also hang.</p>
<p>I believe this is a regression as I recall this functionality working correctly with uv version 0.5.11.</p>
<p>Is there any way to achieve my desired functionality or am I abusing some bug by using the <code>--build</code> flag when running <code>uv build</code>? Should I just remove the <code>[tool.uv.no-binary-package]</code> &amp; <code>[tool.uv.no-build]</code> keys and rely on uv's building of sdist dependencies when necessary? I much prefer being explicit over which dependencies I allow to be built from sdists.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately I'm unable to reproduce this. <code>uv build --no-sources --build</code> works fine for me with this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build-system]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]

[project]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;iniconfig&quot;, &quot;typing-extensions&quot;]

[tool.uv]
no-binary-package = [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;iniconfig&quot;]
no-build = true
package = true
</code></pre>
<p>I'll need a Git repository that I can clone and run to help.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I see. I think it may be some sort of circular dependencies issue. (Admittedly I didn't test the above minimal reproduction myself, so I apologise for that.) It is a completely different problem than the one described here so I will close this issue.</p>
<p>I'll spend more time investigating myself for now as I don't want to waste anyones time. But for those that are curious, I have project A which has a direct dependency on project B. But project B depends on project A as a <code>[build-system.requires]</code> dependency. I didn't think this would cause an issue, as the build dependencies are not locked anywhere. Perhaps I need to force refresh A when building B (building A works successfully)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Or is there any way to use the PyPI wheel of A that B depends upon, when attempting to build A, rather than the local project itself? I thought build isolation was meant to solve this issue? Surely the local project is not installed into the build environment; an external older released version is used?</p>
<p>For context. The two dependent projects are A = https://github.com/CarrotManMatt/typed_classproperties &amp; B = https://github.com/CarrotManMatt/Pydowndoc</p>
