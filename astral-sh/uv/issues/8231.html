uv 0.4.21 (Homebrew 2024-10-14)
(abnormal) ➜  source git:(main) venv-sync
Using Python 3.11.10 environment at /Users/gsirois/venvs/python3.11-2
error: Failed to read metadata from: `/Users/gsirois/venvs/python3.11-2/lib/python3.11/site-packages/protobuf-4.25.3.post1_abnormal.87071f8fe87.dist-info`
  Caused by: after parsing `4.25.3.post1`, found `_abnormal.87071f8fe87`, which is not part of a valid version
</code></pre>
<p>Per https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#local-version-identifiers it is expected that Python packaging implementations support <code>+</code> symbols in the version number as a &quot;local&quot; part. It appears that during installation at least some versions of <code>pip</code> normalize local version suffixes using <code>_</code> which breaks UV.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't see anything in the spec suggesting that the <code>+</code> should be replaced there -- that seems like a bug somewhere else?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I agree with you on the spec -- trying to find where this is coming from ~in pip~. Edit: Doesn't seem to be pip behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is pretty clearly something that came out of an old <code>python3 -m build</code>... the wheel artifact contains the <code>_</code> part in its <code>.dist-info</code> tree. Question is how.</p>
