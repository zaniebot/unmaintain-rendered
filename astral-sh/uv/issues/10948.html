<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m working with <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html">ROS 2 Humble</a>, largely in Python. I&#x27;m managing an environment for a few users, and I&#x27;ve chosen <code>uv</code> as our scheme for managing virtual environments.</p>
<p>ROS 2 <em>can</em> respect Python virtual environments, but it relies on whatever is set in PYTHONPATH for those. At the moment, I am having to manually set it as such:
<code>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.10/site-packages</code></p>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9168">this issue</a> I understand that this isn&#x27;t really functionallity in <code>uv</code>&#x27;s wheelhouse, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a reasonable way  in <code>uv</code> to create some sort of hook that, after sourcing <code>.venv/bin/activate</code>, will add anything added by that venv to the PYTHONPATH? (Bonus points if this would also work for something installed via <code>uv pip install -e ...</code> because that doesn&#x27;t place the editable package in the site-packages directory (for obvious reasons)).</p>
<p>I see that for something like <code>uv run ...</code> the <code>--env-file</code> argument could work, but, because of the constraints of my project, I&#x27;m using <code>uv</code> only for the virtual environment management, not for actually running anything.</p>
<p>Or, possibly, if there is any other wisdom or best-practices to dynamically set my PYTHONPATH with <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So, according to the ROS 2 documentation <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Using-Python-Packages.html">here</a>, the venv should work out of the box. However, based on all of my testing, as well as <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/98214/how-to-use-python-virtual-environments-with-ros2">this stackexchange post</a> which first pointed me to <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, it is clear this isn&#x27;t the case.</p>
<p>In my use-case, our system is fully containerized (due to the constraints of our institution, we are using <a href="https://apptainer.org/">apptainer</a> in lieu of Docker/on top of a docker image (for back-readers, I would be happy to discuss using ROS 2 in apptainer, but that&#x27;s not specifically relevant to this issue).</p>
<p>Because it is containerized, we have decided that system-wide package installation is our best option, because that works out of the box. This should be fine containerized. I&#x27;m still using <code>uv</code> to manage the installation, but this way, I never have to source a venv or modify the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</p>
<p>So, in summary, because we were using a containerized environment anyway, I just ensured that Python packages were installed, with <code>uv pip</code>, systemwide. (In my specific case, this is an issue because our apptainer containers are read-only, so we have to rebuild the whole image to add more Python dependencies, but that is an issue we&#x27;re taking up with our institution&#x27;s security policy, and the system install would work fine in a Docker container.</p>
