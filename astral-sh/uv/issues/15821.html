            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Since uv's cache growth is unbounded, it would be helpful to have a built-in subcommand <code>uv cache size</code> or similar that can be parsed by scripts to decide whether or not to blow away the cache. Since <code>uv cache prune</code> already reports the cache size, maybe that logic would be easy to extract and offer up as a new subcommand?</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(if the cache size is itself stored in the cache, that would allow for near-instant size reporting, which would make the operation fast enough for us to run transparently in our script that launches uv for us)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Checking as quickly as possible if the cache has grown larger than a threshold is a building block to externally disallowing unbounded cache growth. If &quot;prune the cache if it's larger than x GB&quot; can't be done on every uv invocation, then there's no reason to have this because users could just manually prune their caches every now and then.</p>
<p>Additionally, getting the recursive size of a directory is generally extremely slow on Windows.</p>
