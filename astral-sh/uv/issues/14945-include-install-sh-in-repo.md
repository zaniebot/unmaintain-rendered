# Include install.sh in repo

---

_@rieje_

### Summary

Shouldn't the install.sh script be included in the repo? Seems safer and more transparent to curl from git repo. (Of course you can still view the contents of the script before executing it.)

### Example

_No response_

Never mind, I see in the release notes of the latest version the path to the installer, this wasn't obvious from the README.
