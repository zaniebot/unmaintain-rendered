            <div class="timeline-body"><p><strong>Summary</strong>
I propose the introduction of a new command, <code>uv shell</code>. This command would provide users with a quick and straightforward way to enter the associated Python virtual environment (venv) for their projects.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>
The inspiration for <code>uv shell</code> comes from the convenience and simplicity offered by the <code>poetry shell</code> command in Poetry. Having worked with poetry on multiple OSs over the last year, I miss this intuitive approach to environment management. I propose introducing a similar capability into uv.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong>
The <code>uv shell</code> command would activate the project&#x27;s Python virtual environment (basically a shorthand for <code>.venv/bin/activate</code>), allowing users to immediately start working within the context of that environment <strong>OR</strong> return an error message if the venv is missing. This feature would abstract away the need to manually source the venv activation script, thus providing a more seamless development workflow across operating systems.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is somewhat similar to the <code>workon &lt;venv&gt;</code> command of <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/">virtualenvwrapper</a> (a tool I have been using for many years), except that here each virtualenv is referrer by a name and not its path (its not stored inside the project directory but in as a subidir of a command path defined by $WORKON_HOME . like <code>~/.venvs</code>)</p>
<p>Also, a functionality that I find useful of virtualenvwrapper are the hooks (pre/post hooks on venv activation and venv creation)</p>
<p>If you can include some of these features in <code>uv</code> many of us would be grateful! .</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I frequently use <code>pipenv shell</code>, and the killer feature of this is that it starts <em>a new</em> shell.  Whereas activating a virtual environment modifies the currently running shell.  This means that one can exit the shell without exiting the terminal window one is running the shell in.  It would be great if <code>uv shell</code> could replicate this behaviour.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would like to have an even shorter alias at the same time such as <code>uv sh</code> (just like <code>uv v</code> for <code>uv venv</code>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Fwiw, this is what I have for my Bash shell on both Windows (git-bash) and Linux right now.</p>
Bash Script
<p>You can add this into your <code>.bashrc</code> / <code>.bash_aliases</code> or whatever auto sourced bash file.</p>
<pre><code>uvsh() {
    local venv_name=${1:-&#x27;.venv&#x27;}
    venv_name=${venv_name//\//} # remove trailing slashes (Linux)
    venv_name=${venv_name//\\/} # remove trailing slashes (Windows)

    local venv_bin=
    if [[ -d ${WINDIR} ]]; then
        venv_bin=&#x27;Scripts/activate&#x27;
    else
        venv_bin=&#x27;bin/activate&#x27;
    fi

    local activator=&quot;${venv_name}/${venv_bin}&quot;
    echo &quot;[INFO] Activate Python venv: ${venv_name} (via ${activator})&quot;

    if [[ ! -f ${activator} ]]; then
        echo &quot;[ERROR] Python venv not found: ${venv_name}&quot;
        return
    fi

    # shellcheck disable=SC1090
    . &quot;${activator}&quot;
}
</code></pre>
Usage
<ul>
<li><code>$ uvsh</code>: this will activate <code>.venv</code> by default</li>
<li><code>$ uvsh .my_venv</code>: this will activate <code>.my_venv</code></li>
<li><code>$ deactivate</code>: exit the current venv</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had this in rye and backed it out because there is just no non hacky way to make this work. I think the desire is real, but the experience just will always have holes. You basically need to allocate a pty, hook it up with the parent pty and then send key presses into it to manipulate the shell environment. It&#x27;s pretty hacky and breaks stuff in subtle ways :(</p>

<p>Is it not just a case of exec&#x27;ing <code>$SHELL</code>, after modifying the environment as required?  (Or exec&#x27;ing <code>$SHELL</code> with an argument to make it source the venv&#x27;s <code>activate</code> script on start-up?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What about if, instead of hooking up pty&#x27;s, we just do the bare minimum? We detect the shell (whether zsh, bash, nushell or powershell), the OS, and just call the source file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there are two separate feature requests that are being combined in this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to spawn a <em>new shell</em> as a new process with the venv activated within it.  This is what <code>pipenv shell</code>, and <code>poetry shell</code> do.</li>
<li>The ability to activate the venv within the <em>current shell</em>.  As running <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> would do.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the talk of injecting keypresses into a shell via a pty is about the second item, whereas the original request in this issue was about the first.  My preference is for the first, as it is straightforward to &#x27;exit&#x27; the spawned shell without exiting the terminal emulator/window, whereas if the current shell is modified then it is not easy to &#x27;unmodify&#x27; it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW I&#x27;ve always considered <code>poetry shell</code> a misfeature from a UX perspective. It&#x27;s too easy to drop into a shell, then change directory, and lose track of which venv you&#x27;re actually working in.</p>
<p>So for my team I prefer to recommend always using <code>poetry run</code> (often plus some shell aliases to minimise typing). I think that would make better sense as a first-class citizen for <code>uv</code>. And then if someone still really <em>really</em> wants a shell then this is still accomplishable via <code>uv run [bash|fish|etc.]</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t know if this is relevant here, but sometimes I have difficulties understanding which venv I&#x27;m actually using and what&#x27;s happening under the hood (and why). I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s already a way to figure out these things and I&#x27;m just missing it.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: I have a project in VSCode without a venv. I open the terminal and run <code>uv pip list</code>, which outputs:</p>
<pre><code>Package    Version
---------- -------
pip        23.0.1
setuptools 65.5.0
</code></pre>
<p>This output reflects my clean, system environment.</p>
<p>Next, I run <code>uv venv</code>. According to the documentation:</p>
<pre><code>By default, `uv` lists packages in the currently activated virtual environment, or a virtual environment (`.venv`) located in the current working directory or any parent directory, falling back to the system Python if no virtual environment is found.
</code></pre>
<p>So, I&#x27;m expecting <code>uv</code> to pick the local <code>.venv</code> without activation, and it does, even if the venv is not activated.</p>
<p>Now, if I close VSCode and reopen it, VSCode continues with its &quot;implicit&quot; activation of <code>.venv</code> in every terminal I open from now on.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, I now delete <code>.venv</code> and run <code>uv pip list</code>, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip list
error: failed to canonicalize path `&lt;path&gt;`
  Caused by: The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>While I expected the same output (the system environment) as before.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s VSCode&#x27;s fault because I guess it somehow implicitly runs something like <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> if I open it with a venv already created. However, since the venv is now activated, I think this &quot;overrides&quot; uv&#x27;s standard venv detection flow when none is activated.</p>
<p>So my point is: it would be nice to have some mechanism inside of <code>uv</code> to check which venv it is currently selecting and why (e.g., &quot;explicit activation of <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>&quot;, &quot;implicit use since no other venvs are activated and there&#x27;s a <code>.venv</code> in the current directory&quot;, &quot;implicit system environment use because no venv is activated and no <code>.venv</code> in the current directory,&quot; etc.).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it&#x27;s worth looking at this from the lense of what the world might look like in two years.  A lot of the reasons people want to &quot;activate&quot; virtualenvs is that this is how we used to do things, not necessarily how we would do things in a slightly changed world.</p>
<p>Even with rye today the need to actually activate a virtualenv is largely gone as the python executable always does the right thing, and <code>rye run</code> does too.  So it primarily are things created in a world that assumed that virtualenvs are for activating that need this.</p>
<p>npm got away without any equivalent of &quot;activation&quot; and I think a future Python ecosystem will also no longer find much use in virtualenv activation.</p>

<p>I just threw this in my <code>~/.bashrc</code> (MSYS2 on win)</p>
<pre><code>uv () {

<p>this mimics the same <code>venv</code> function I have had for years for creating/listing/activating venvs.</p>
<p>Albeit feeling the need for a quicker way to activate the env while using uv I agree with the sentiment that it&#x27;s not the called process role to alter the parent&#x27;s environment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I originally saw the lack of a &#x27;shell&#x27; command as a deal-breaker since I am so used to Poetry. When I stepped back for a sec I realise I can get by with a couple of shell aliases (Linux or Mac):</p>
<pre><code># uv aliases
alias va=&#x27;source .venv/bin/activate&#x27;
alias vd=&#x27;deactivate&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>This is from my <code>zsh</code> config but all shells offer similar. Windows users can use a <code>Doskey</code> or powershell alias.</p>
<p>Now, I just enter my project folder and type <code>va</code> and ready to go, actually faster that the Poetry equivalent.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got my GitHub actions working again, and changed to <code>Renovate</code> from <code>Dependabot</code> so I think I&#x27;m ready to go full on <code>uv</code> :grin:</p>
<p>EDIT: <code>direnv</code> now has a working <code>uv</code> script I&#x27;ve just tried and it works perfectly: <a href="https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Python#uv">https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Python#uv</a></p>

<p>I like <code>uv shell</code> concept because of consistency. No need to run anything else other than <code>uv</code> tooling. Newcomers won&#x27;t even have to worry about what is a <code>venv</code>.</p>
<p>Although I like very much using <code>uv run</code>, <code>uv pip</code>, ... I think that <code>uv shell</code> could make it easier for them to migrate to <code>uv</code> .</p>

It generates a platform independent activation command, allows for a custom <code>uv shell</code> command if one prefers, and a <code>uv venv activate</code> would fit nicely in the uv pip/venv interface.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s the thing: this issue is about mimicking <code>poetry shell</code>, which does in fact spawn a new process. What you&#x27;re referring to (modifying the shell process the user is already in), is basically activating the venv.</p>

<p>I am personally not a fan of spawning a new shell just in order to have the environment automatically activated, at that point I can setup a quick, unobtrusive way to activate the shell and use that in plave of <code>uv shell</code>, say an function called <code>uva</code> (uv activate).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think easy virtual environment activation is great to have. IMO uv has not made it obsolete, uv has based all its functionality on virtual environments, so they continue to be relevant.</p>
<p>Virtual environment activation needs shell integration. I understand if <code>uv</code> doesn&#x27;t want to build this, but users need a place to go where they can install good existing solutions for this kind of shell integration. Most(?) experienced python developers already have some solution for this, and they vary: simple shell aliases, shell functions, direnv, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need visibility of existing or future solutions - users need a place to go to get these shell integrations, so that not every developer writes their own shell functions</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>venvs made by uv have the activation scripts, so <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> (maybe an alias if you find that too verbose). Poetry did the <code>poetry shell</code> and had to get rid of it. PDM decided from the get-to that <code>pdm shell</code> would be too problematic for how little of benefit it brings. Rye decided against it too. At one point I thought <code>poetry shell</code> (or an equivalent) is important but after a while of using just <code>poetry run</code> and <code>uv run</code>, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy them. <code>uv run</code> also has the benefit of guaranteeing a proper up-to-date environment on every run.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After realising that <code>$tool shell</code> is obviously problematic, I did think about proposing the alternative of a command that simply prints that activate command, after all the commands are different on Windows  (<code>.venv/scripts/activate</code>) and Linux (<code>.venv/bin/activate</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ uv shell
source .venv/bin/activate
$ eval $(uv shell)
</code></pre>
<p>This sounds nice on paper (cross platform command!) but it&#x27;s not actually cross platform. On Windows you would need to <code>iex (uv shell)</code> while on Linux you would need to <code>eval $(uv shell)</code>. So in the end, the benefits are negligible. You save a few characters while still needing to remember some minor differences. I haven&#x27;t really needed a reason to activate the venv either, after all, <code>uv run/add/pip/etc</code> do the right thing and are cross platform while also avoiding the foot gun of &quot;oops I forgot to activate the venv and installed something in my global environment&quot;. VS Code and Pycharm also pick the in project venv without any activation. On the rare occasion where I do need to activate the venv <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> works fine.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with @mitsuhiko.</p>
<p>virtualenv activation adds even more state to an already stateful shell, in the name of saving a few keystrokes. An activated virtual environment makes things available on the PATH that otherwise shouldn’t be there. The fact that a different activation script is needed for each platform is yet another code smell.</p>
<p>Maybe <code>uvr</code> could be the final answer to the virtual environment activation problem?</p>

<p>That was my thought too.  When I went back and read through what @mitsuhiko <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1910#issuecomment-2256407301">said</a>, I <em>think</em> the general aim here is to remove the need to &quot;active&quot; a virtualenv.  If all the tooling just does the &quot;right thing&quot; based on the working directory (and, perhaps some other environment variables, for some rare cases, I assume), then there is no longer any need to &#x27;activate&#x27;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @krystofbe and others, don&#x27;t wait too long to switch to <code>uv</code> 🙌  The migration has been great for me: dev groups, container building with dependencies, pulling packages from our private registry all works as expected, and the project build is so much faster. The workaround to activate the <code>venv</code> that I use is:</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import run

def activate():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Activate uv virtual environment 🐍.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    cmd = f&quot;source .venv/bin/activate&quot;
    run(args=[&quot;/bin/bash&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, f&quot;{cmd}; exec $SHELL&quot;], check=True)
</code></pre>
<p>This can be wrapped in a <code>typer</code> / <code>click</code> CLI command and incorporated with other <code>uv</code> commands like <code>sync</code> or <code>uv python pin</code> to have one single command that installs and activates a Python project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I scrolled through the comments and didn&#x27;t see this suggested yet (but maybe I missed it, or maybe it&#x27;s just a terrible idea):</p>
<p>uv super environment</p>
<ul>
<li><code>source</code> it once in your <code>.zshrc</code> / <code>.bash_profile</code> / etc</li>
<li>Replace <code>python</code> with a a shell script that sets <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> and runs the real <code>python</code><ul>
<li>Or it could be a symlink to <code>uv</code> itself, which would check argv[0], set the env var and exec python (if it&#x27;s faster to implement in Rust than in shell)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add a &quot;super environment&quot;/bin directory to PATH, with files for all entrypoints in all uv managed environments<ul>
<li>they would be shims or symlinks that check the dynamic virtual environment and forward to the right command</li>
<li>commands that don&#x27;t exist in that environment would fail</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your virtualenv would be dynamic based on the CWD.</p>
<p>One down side, unless there&#x27;s a clever way around this, is that you would get tab completion for commands not installed in the active virtualenv. You&#x27;d also want to try to detect if a virtual environment was manually activated and disable &quot;super environment&quot; mode, which might get tricky.</p>
<p>I could also see it being frowned upon to add a layer in front of python like this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another scenario:</p>
<p>Us coming from pyenv with the <code>uv install python &lt;pythonver&gt; --default --preview</code> would really like to have this feature. From pyenv we have a standard <code>~/.bash_profile</code> that works like this: (scenario is a pod running a not root service that need a dedicated python environment):</p>
<pre><code>uv venv 
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# And I append this file:
cat ~/.bash_profile
export UV_ROOT=~/.local/bin
export PATH=&quot;$UV_ROOT:$PATH&quot;
if [ -f ~/.venv/bin/activate ]; then
        source ~/.venv/bin/activate
fi
</code></pre>
<p>I use this in all my containers. UV has removed more than 200MB from the container compared to pyenv which needs to build from source. We never use <code>sudo apt-get install python3</code> because we like to control everything ourselves and patch independently of ubuntu. and once pyenv had a new python ready (usually max 5-10hours after python.org release) Our CICD system had build and tested.</p>
<p>Add this source file based on what shell you use to give you a default python on login.</p>
<p><code>uv shell ~/.venv --shell=bash</code></p>

<p>FYI: UV stores the venv wherever you tell it to do so, https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#using-arbitrary-python-environments and will search for it, even will try automatically one folder up https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#discovery-of-python-environments.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t see how any of this is relevant to the activation, and the existence of a command to do so, so maybe you are in the wrong issue?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just adding my late $.02, but the &quot;venv-less&quot; world being advocated for by @mitsuhiko and others upthread is not really plausible for test-driven development or test-heavy workflows where you may be running &quot;uv run pytest&quot; dozens or hundreds of times per session.  Rye avoided this by providing a <code>rye test</code> command, but one can imagine other frequently-invoked commands as well.  It&#x27;s a bit separate from the question of whether or not uv should provide a built-in &quot;shell&quot; or &quot;activate&quot; command, but i agree with the commenter who said that as long as uv&#x27;s implementation is tied to virtual environments, it will be necessary to activate them.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not sure, but I <em>think</em> the vague idea of the direction I&#x27;ve picked up from this thread is that ultimately you wouldn&#x27;t need to have the <code>uv run</code> bit, and the python executable would just sort it all out.  Maybe I&#x27;ve misunderstood though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>for what it&#x27;s worth i&#x27;ve been using <code>pixi shell</code> for quite a while now and it seems to be pretty seamless.  The only quirk is that running <code>pixi add</code> in a separate shell outside of an active one still requires you to run <code>pixi install</code> inside that shell, or open a new shell, for the update to take effect.  But that&#x27;s really a minor enough problem that I don&#x27;t really understand what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>I also use nushell as my daily driver, which usually means i can expect a bunch of quirks, but this has been absolutely fine.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> to include the <a href="https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/pixi_shell/">pixi shell</a> documentation which outlines their approach and anticipated quirks</p>

<p>As has been argued quite a bit in this issue, it&#x27;s <strong>not a simple feature</strong>. There are subtleties that make this feature more complex than it seems. There are good reasons why Poetry actually dropped this feature.</p>
<p>You have to realize that adding a new feature also means adding extra code that needs to be maintained. The many people asking for this feature, will also be the ones who are going to complain when there are bugs in this new feature.</p>
<p>People <strong>do have a choice</strong>. Many examples are given in the comments on how to recreate this feature for specific shells etc. People can use that.</p>
<p>I really wish for the maintainers to make a choice here though. Either cave to the people asking for this, which means building and maintaining an allegedly complex feature, or lock this issue and be done with it.</p>

<p>Maybe we should recommend this in the docs, e.g. in the projects guide (I have an open PR in which I could include it #13542) and maybe also in the <code>uv venv</code> <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/23ed31b94da8ca2ba23866cbfd13f0998e3b04f3/docs/index.md?plain=1#L182">output</a>? <code>uv activate</code> could still be an alias for that, however, as there is a uv-solution, maybe this could end this discussion and make everybody happy☀️.</p>

<p>I ment in the context of this issue, which is not about scripts but getting a developer shell (see Proposed Solution). And anyway, you could use <code>uv run</code> before the script, e.g. <code>uv run cmd myscript.bat</code>. That also would keep your script uv agnostic. Also, it&#x27;s not about not using <code>activate</code> at all if someone prefer it.</p>

<p>If the shell executed by <code>uv run</code>, it keeps its context and therefore venv alive. You can try it out:</p>

<li>Spawn a new shell that’s inside the env and exits cleanly with exit/Ctrl‑D (pipenv/poetry/pixi/hatch style).</li>
<li>Activate the env in the current shell (true activation), which requires user cooperation (eval/source/iex) or shell integration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Current friction points<ul>
<li>Activation is OS- and shell-specific; it’s the “last mile” that confuses newcomers.</li>
<li>Nested activations and directory changes can be foot‑guns.</li>
<li>Users want clear introspection (“which env is active/selected and why?”).</li>
<li>Some want hooks or centralized env locations (virtualenvwrapper‑like) and upward discovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Philosophical split<ul>
<li>“Don’t activate; just use uv run and let uv select the right env.”</li>
<li>“Give me a developer shell; typing uv run repeatedly is clunky for interactive workflows.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior art and constraints</p>
<ul>
<li>Practical constraint: a child process can’t safely mutate the parent shell’s environment. That rules out “activating your current shell” from uv without user cooperation or shell integration.</li>
<li>What other tools do<ul>
<li>pipenv: pipenv shell spawns a subshell.</li>
<li>pixi: pixi shell spawns a subshell and is widely reported as workable.</li>
<li>poetry: poetry shell existed; Poetry 2.0 removed it; there’s a plugin; modern approach leans toward printing activation commands.</li>
<li>pdm: avoids a shell command; prints activation commands.</li>
<li>hatch: shells via pexpect/PTY control (works but brittle and high maintenance).</li>
<li>conda/mamba: rely on shell integration (activate/deactivate functions).</li>
<li>direnv, oh‑my‑zsh plugins, mise: shell‑side solutions many users already use with uv.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>uv today<ul>
<li>uv run/add/pip select the appropriate env based on CWD and discovery rules (and editors like VS Code/PyCharm often pick .venv automatically).</li>
<li>Users can already approximate a developer shell with uv run $SHELL.</li>
<li>There’s interest in better introspection/logging of how an env was selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Desired behaviors I’m hearing</p>
<ul>
<li>A first‑class way to:<ul>
<li>Spawn a subshell “inside” the project env (clean exit returns you to your original shell unchanged).</li>
<li>Activate in the current shell safely via printed commands (eval/source/iex) rather than trying to mutate the parent process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Respect uv’s environment discovery (CWD, parent dirs, configured/global env locations).</li>
<li>Clear handling when no env exists (helpful error by default; optional create).</li>
<li>Sensible defaults for nested activations (warn/refuse by default), minimal/opt‑in prompt changes, and Windows/fish support.</li>
<li>Good docs and quick paths for newcomers, plus recipes for direnv/oh‑my‑zsh/mise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tentative direction to validate (not a final proposal)</p>
<ul>
<li>Two complementary commands plus introspection, avoiding PTY/expect hacks:<ul>
<li>uv shell: spawn an interactive subshell with the env prepared; exit to leave.<ul>
<li>If the env is missing: error by default; allow --create.</li>
<li>Respect discovery, support fish/pwsh/cmd, warn on nested activations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>uv activate: print shell‑appropriate activation snippets to stdout.<ul>
<li>Users opt‑in via eval/iex/source.</li>
<li>If missing: error by default; allow --create.</li>
<li>Optional --with-prompt, and a --json mode for tooling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>uv env explain: show which env uv selected and why (and provide --json for editors/IDEs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation<ul>
<li>Make the tradeoffs explicit; show uv run $SHELL, uv shell, and uv activate variants for bash/zsh/fish/pwsh/cmd.</li>
<li>Link to curated recipes (direnv, oh‑my‑zsh plugin, fish examples), so users don’t reinvent shell functions.</li>
<li>Update messaging after uv venv to include “developer shell” and “activate‑in‑place” options alongside source .venv/bin/activate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions for maintainers and contributors</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope and defaults<ul>
<li>Missing env: should uv shell and uv activate error by default and offer --create, or auto‑create by default with a config to opt‑out?</li>
<li>Prompt: minimal by default, or only on explicit request? Any strong preferences?</li>
<li>Nested activation: warn and refuse by default for uv shell? Allow with a flag?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UX and naming<ul>
<li>Would uv activate (top‑level) be acceptable, with uv venv activate as an alias for discoverability?</li>
<li>Is uv shell as a “spawned subshell” aligned with uv’s philosophy, or should we only recommend uv run $SHELL in docs?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Platform specifics<ul>
<li>Any gotchas you want to avoid for fish/pwsh/cmd specifically?</li>
<li>Preference order on Windows (pwsh vs Windows PowerShell vs cmd)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introspection<ul>
<li>Is a uv env explain (text and JSON) desirable to address “which env and why?” Or should this live behind a --verbose mode of existing commands?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Out of scope for v1<ul>
<li>Hooks on activation/creation, centralized env management UX, and shell integration installers — okay to defer and focus on the core primitives?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this framing sounds right, I’m happy to draft a concise UX/CLI spec (flags, behaviors, examples) and a technical plan that reuses uv’s existing env discovery/creation paths, with explicit notes on testing and platform nuances. I’d really appreciate reactions or corrections on the assumptions above, plus guidance on the defaults and naming so the first draft aligns with project direction.</p>

Main motivation
<p>My main motivation was to have simple, unified instruction for python project README.md for activation of python virtual env.</p>
<p><code>uv run $SHELL</code> seem to be missing good MS Windows equivalent.</p>
explicit or implicit <code>--create</code>?
<p>I would lean more towards auto-creation. This is in line with current uv philosophy with <code>uv run &lt;command&gt;</code> which simply syncs the environment whenever run.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@gsornsen Unfortunately <strong><code>uv run $SHELL</code> does not work</strong> (even if we ignore Windows for now), otherwise there would be no impediment to adding a <code>uv shell</code> implementation that does just that internally (and this thread would probably already be closed).</p>
<p>But with <code>uv run $SHELL</code> the user’s shell configuration is executed <em>after</em> the venv configuration, and that often negates its effect wholly or partly (most trivially if the user configuration overwrites <code>PATH</code>, and causes another Python to be given precedence over the venv’s). We could say “well that’s on the users, they need to fix their shell configuration” but that would be very unhelpful, and would lead to this repo being swamped with [arguably] spurious bug reports.</p>
<p>And there’s no portable way to solve this. — In particular, of spawning a new shell, automatically executing a command inside it, and then handing control back to the user (this is what pexpect is trying to solve, but that solution has the aforementioned caveats). A hacky workaround is to create a shell script that first sources the default user configuration and afterwards the <code>.venv</code>’s (i.e. something like Bash’s <code>bash --rcfile &lt;(printf &#x27;. ~/.bashrc; . .venv/bin/activate\n&#x27;)</code>). But this is not portable across shells.</p>
<p>(I assume that many people involved in this discussion thread — in particular those who have previously used pexpect — know all this, but I couldn’t find it spelled out anywhere above, and I am convinced that this led to some of the misunderstandings and back and forth.)</p>

<p>You&#x27;re quite right -- I hadn&#x27;t spotted that it falls back to pexpect.</p>
<p>However, I think the argument that this shouldn&#x27;t be a feature because it can&#x27;t possibly support <em>all</em> shells, is not reasonable.  Just because something will not work in literally every imaginable situation is not a reason to not have the feature.  The reason to have the feature in this case is that it will make the lives of a significant number of users easier.  There will be situations it doesn&#x27;t work in, but that&#x27;s OK, and it also seems like they are solvable anyway.</p>
<p>If the &quot;it must work in all situations or never become a feature&quot; argument were to be applied to other uv subcommands, then many of those would not exist.  For example I could easily feed a script to <code>uv run</code> that botches up the python execution environment, but it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to say that this meant that <code>uv run</code> shouldn&#x27;t exist.</p>
<p>Seems to me that just avoiding the pexpect implementation would suffice, and grow support for the most common shells.</p>
<p>Also, a side-note: it should be pretty easy for uv to examine whether the shell configuration has been botched-up by the user by just running a few commands within in it.</p>

<p>Thank you, I think this is a helpful addition to the thread even though I&#x27;m still sorting out the implications.  Can you comment on how this assessment fits with how the <code>pixi shell</code> command operates?  Ive found it suitable for most of my needs.</p>
<p>EDIT: it seems like what you are saying tracks with the <a href="https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/pixi_shell/">documentation for <code>pixi shell</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Unix systems the shell command works by creating a &quot;fake&quot; PTY session that will start the shell, and then send a string like source /tmp/activation-env-12345.sh to the stdin in order to activate the environment. If you would peek under the hood of the the shell command, then you would see that this is the first thing executed in the new shell session.</p>
Issues With Pixi Shell
<p>As explained, pixi shell only works well if we execute the activation script after launching shell. Certain commands that are run in the ~/.bashrc might swallow the activation command, and the environment won&#x27;t be activated.</p>
<p>For example, if your ~/.bashrc contains code like the following, pixi shell has little chance to succeed:</p>
<pre><code># on WSL - the `wsl.exe` somehow takes over `stdin` and prevents `pixi shell` from succeeding
wsl.exe -d wsl-vpnkit --cd /app service wsl-vpnkit start

# on macOS or Linux, some users start fish or nushell from their `bashrc`
# If you wish to start an alternative shell from bash, it&#x27;s better to do so
# from `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`
if [[ $- = *i* ]]; then
  exec ~/.pixi/bin/fish
fi
</code></pre>
<p>In order to fix this, we would advise you to follow the steps below to use pixi shell-hook instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it sounds like they roll with the solution being discussed here and additionally say &quot;if you want to customize your shell init, we also have a command for the config code&quot;</p>
<p>That seems like a reasonable compromise to me.</p>
<p>You also claim this wouldn&#x27;t be portable across shells, but it seems like pixi does something under the hood to run the right command.  I use Nushell as my daily driver and the <code>pixi shell-hook</code> command sets some environment variables (using correct nushell syntax) and finishes with:</p>
<pre><code>let old_prompt = $env.PROMPT_COMMAND
$env.PROMPT_COMMAND = {|| echo $&quot;\(sample-dir\) (do $old_prompt)&quot;}
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see the a lot of energy put into this thread which goes in repeated cycles from eager engagement of skilled programmer willing to resolve it which later turns into a lesson, other already learnt before that each solution is tricky and could possibly harm <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>For my key requirement: having simple method to instruct user in README.md on how to activate a python environment, I would consider one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>find or create dedicated page with proper instructions and link to it. The page would have to be really dedicated just to brief instruction on activation of the environment (deactivation would be fine too there) but without too much text which is not directly focused on env activation / deactivation</li>
<li>create a gist with given instructions and read it into my README.md (I do not like including obvious things in my README.md as it may become obsolete and spoils brevity of the text)</li>
<li>create a gist and link to it from my README.md (as in the first point).</li>
</ul>
<p>I read through uv docs and all pages, which deal with activation, are not good enough as they often cover too much and would be confusing.</p>
<p>Any idea, where such a page already exists? Or shall uv docs add dedicated page https://docs.astral.sh/uv/howto/activate/ ?</p>

<p>Anyway, my idea was very focused page, which would only describe how to activate python environment. The concept is to keep it as short as possible to prevent distraction and overwhelming with details, which are not essential during reading project README.md.</p>
