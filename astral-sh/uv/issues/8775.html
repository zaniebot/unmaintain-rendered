            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to know if my script was called with <code>uv run</code>, but there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to tell.</p>
<p>I suggest you set an extra environment variable (e.g. <code>UV=1</code>) which the process can use to check if it was called that way.</p>
<p>(My use case if it matters is that I'm printing instructions on how to run other scripts, and I'd like to show &quot;Run with <code>uv run -m ...</code>&quot; or &quot;Run with <code>python -m ...</code>&quot;)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems fine to me, though I'm a little wary of people keying behavior off of executing in a uv context in general.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This could also be helpful for the infinitely-recursive shebang @zanieb...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>True I basically suggested this as a solution. Though the problem there is we can't tell if the recursion is intentional or not without capturing more information.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Your could increment the count in the env car, so <code>UV=1</code>, <code>UV=2</code> etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fwiw, (maybe supports @zanieb's point) I no longer need this right now. Although I think adding the env var is still a good idea.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds like something that would fit nicely into the <code>sys</code> module, similar <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.orig_argv">sys.orig_argv</a></p>
