# Add PEP751 lock files format support

---

_Issue opened by @JonZeolla on 2024-07-26 12:14_

Add support for lockfiles [PEP751](https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/) format (currently draft).

See the PEP discussions / review at https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3870 and on the [Python forums](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-751-lock-files-again/59173)

Just to clarify, we shouldn't work on this unless the PEP is ultimately accepted.

This PEP has [full acceptance](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-751-one-last-time/77293/150) now 🥳 

While I appreciate that this is hot off-the-press news, has there been any prior discussion on what/how UV will adopt this standard?
