            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently, uv can only export to format <code>requirements-txt</code> (cf #6668).
For (dumb) compatibility reasons, I would like to be able to export a &quot;Poetry lockfile&quot; from uv. These are different, bu close, TOML documents.
Would this be interesting to add to uv ? I can understand why not.
Would you like me to draft a PR for this ?
Also, there does not seem to be a documented schema for Poetry lock files (cf https://github.com/orgs/python-poetry/discussions/6763) so there may be some instability there.</p>
