            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👋</p>
<p>We merged an external contribution for RISCV-64 in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12688 (revert being discussed in #14006) which broke our 0.7.13 release process because the <code>manylinux_2_31_riscv64</code> platform tag was rejected by PyPI.</p>
<p>PyPI does not yet support waiting until all files for a release are uploaded before going &quot;live&quot; so only a subset of the wheels were published for 0.7.13. This provides a bad experience for users, where they either cannot use the new version or fallback to building from source.</p>
<p>Consequently, we've yanked the release. We will either complete the upload of files for 0.7.13, and un-yank it, or release a new version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alright, I've downloaded the artifacts from CI and manually published the relevant ones. The release is un-yanked now.</p>
