# uv.exe uses different line ending than pip

_Issue opened by @FrederikLauber on 2024-07-31 12:06_

When freezing the installed packages with uv pip freeze and pip freeze, the resulting
file either uses CRLF (uv) or LF (pip).

This results in issues with git on uv's part as versioning tools may ignore the CRLF.

As pip already only uses LF, I would ask for uv to do the same

I just realised it is exactly the other way around, sorry for the noise.
