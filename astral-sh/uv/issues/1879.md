# Requirements.txt empty after compile error

_Issue opened by @luchiago on 2024-02-22 17:44_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I've tried to compile my project requirements from `pyproject.toml` and even with the hint ```specify dependencies in the `project.dependencies` section; `tool.poetry.dependencies` is not currently supported```, my previous `requirements.txt` filled with dependencies was erased. I don't think that's a correct behavior

`uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt --verbose`

```bash
 uv::requirements::from_source source=pyproject.toml
warning: `pyproject.toml` does not contain any dependencies (hint: specify dependencies in the `project.dependencies` section; `tool.poetry.dependencies` is not currently supported)
 uv::requirements::from_source source=requirements.txt

```

My `requirements.txt` after the command:
```txt
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt --verbose

```

uv version: `0.1.7`

If this an actual error and unexpected behavior, I would like to start working on it.

I think is expected, you've asked us to compile requirements for a file with no requirements. We allow this, but we warn you to help figure out if you've made a mistake.

Ok then. Thanks for the reply! I thought it was a strange behavior because even though it was a mistake on my `pyprojetc.toml` wouldn't clear my actual `requirements.txt` with the dependencies.
