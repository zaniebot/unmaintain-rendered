# Support for comma-separated lists passed to `--group` and `--extra` flags

---

_Issue opened by @paduszyk on 2025-08-17 20:01_

### Summary

Given the following `pyproject.toml` for a Django project:

```toml
[project]
name = "app"
version = "1"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
  "django>=5.2.5",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
mysql = [
  "mysqlclient>=2.2.7",
]
postgresql = [
  "psycopg[binary]>=3.2.9",
]
```

I would like to install packages supporting both (unnecessarily _all_; here I have only two backends). So, I go with:

```shell
uv sync --extra=postgresql --extra=sqlite --frozen
```

When using pip, I could do the same with comma-separated list:

```shell
pip install -e ".[postgresql,mysql]"
```

I am just wondering on whether this kind of input could be implemented in uv.

The example refers to `--extra`, but could also applied to the `--group` flag.

### Example

Here is a `Dockerfile` from one of my recent projects. I believe that enabling comma-separated lists would be an interesting idea for application of the proposed feature.

```Dockerfile

# === Build ===

FROM python:3.13-alpine AS builder

# ===  Here, comma-separated list could be passed. ===
ARG DJANGO_DATABASE_ENGINES 
# ====================================================

WORKDIR /app/

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.8.11 /uv /bin/
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock uv.toml ./

RUN uv sync --no-dev --extra=${DJANGO_DATABASE_ENGINES} --frozen


# === Runtime ===

FROM python:3.13-alpine

# ...

```
