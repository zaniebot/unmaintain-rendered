# cache-control override not working as expected

---

_Issue opened by @davidszotten on 2025-07-18 12:50_

### Summary

i'm trying out the new cache-control index setting but it's not working as i expect (i may be misunderstanding or doing something wrong)

the index is running devpi-server 6.5.1

```
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "private"
url = "https://private.example.com/org/dev/+simple"
cache-control = { api = "max-age=600", files = "max-age=365000000, immutable" }
default = true
```

(index renamed to remove private dns names etc, hopefully correctly applied the same change in the logs snippet)

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.7.22 (78d6d1134 2025-07-17)
```


bumping the minor version of a `pytest` dependency up and down i see this in the logs from `uv run -vvv pytest --version`

```

Sorry, I think I wired this up in the wrong place (the request, not the response).
