Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.


* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>I am trying to install the accelarated pandas version from rapids but I am getting the following error:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I try to use: <code> uv add cudf-cu12</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I am getting the following error:</p>

*******************************************************************************

The installation of cudf-cu12 for version 24.8.2 failed.

This is a special placeholder package which downloads a real wheel package
from https://pypi.nvidia.com. If https://pypi.nvidia.com is not reachable, we
cannot download the real wheel file to install.

You might try installing this package via

$ pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com cudf-cu12


Here is some debug information about your platform to include in any bug
report:

Python Version: CPython 3.12.5
Operating System: Linux 4.18.0-477.27.1.el8_8.x86_64
CPU Architecture: x86_64
nvidia-smi command not found. Ensure NVIDIA drivers are installed.

<li>I tried to use pip too as suggested in the error: <code>uv pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com cudf-cu12</code></li>

<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only the following versions of cudf-cu12 are available:
          cudf-cu12==23.6.0
          cudf-cu12==23.6.1
          cudf-cu12==23.8.0

          cudf-cu12==24.8.1
          cudf-cu12==24.8.2
      and all versions of cudf-cu12 have no wheels with a matching Python ABI tag, we can conclude that cudf-cu12&lt;23.6.1 cannot be used.
      And because you require cudf-cu12, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
