# Let User Know Self Update is Disabled

---

_Issue opened by @mahyarmirrashed on 2024-10-18 04:40_

I had installed `uv` from `brew` and was trying to run `uv self update`. However, that won't work (and it shouldn't, so kudos)!
The only thing was that the error message could be improved a bit.

```
mahyar@lioness vivaldi % uv self update
error: unrecognized subcommand 'self'

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
mahyar@lioness vivaldi % uv --version
uv 0.4.18 (Homebrew 2024-10-01)
```

I would like to see something along the lines of "Hey, it looks like you're trying to self-update. However, `uv` was installed from <source> and cannot be updated in this way. Please use your package manager to update." or something along those lines.

Thanks for a great and fast tool.
