# When killing the top process of a `uvx` command, the process keeps running in the background

_Issue opened by @schnow265 on 2025-04-06 12:30_

### Summary

When running an `uvx` command and then killing the top process via Process Explorer, a `uv` process keeps on running.

Here is a screenshot from Process Explorer showcasing a simple `uvx mcp-server-git`:

However, when killing the uvx process using Process Explorer, the uv process which started the mcp-server-git executable remains. This is bad, since the terminal is now non-interactable.

This is not just an issue with this package. Here is an example with openwebui:

This is an issue, sine VSCode now supports MCP servers, and when stopping a server started with `uvx`, and then stopping it via VSCode, it causes the process to still run in the background.

Is this a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11817 ?

(I think VS Code should probably stop the process group?)
