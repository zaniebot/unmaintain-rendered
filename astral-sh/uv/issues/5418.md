# `uv0.2.28` uninstalls versions with local specifiers even though it satisfies the requirements

_Issue opened by @blueraft on 2024-07-24 17:28_

I am not entirely sure I diagnosed the problem here correctly but here's an MRE.

`v0.2.28`:
- `uv pip install "flask @ git+https://github.com/pallets/flask"`
```
❯ uv pip install flask-login==0.6
Resolved 8 packages in 99ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 2ms
Installed 2 packages in 4ms
 - flask==3.1.0.dev0 (from git+https://github.com/pallets/flask@a8956feba1e40105e7bc78fa62ce36c58d1c91e1)
 + flask==3.0.3
 + flask-login==0.6.0
```

`v0.2.27`:
- `uv pip install "flask @ git+https://github.com/pallets/flask"`
```
❯ uv pip install flask-login==0.6
Resolved 8 packages in 127ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + flask-login==0.6.0
```

No problem, sorry for the regression. I'll probably release today.
