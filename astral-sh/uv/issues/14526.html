            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>uv build currently does not build wheels for local path dependencies such as ../B. This limits its usefulness in monorepo or sibling-package development workflows.</p>
<pre><code>/my-project/
├── A/
│   ├── pyproject.toml  # depends on ../B
└── B/
    ├── pyproject.toml
</code></pre>
<p>A pyproject would look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;A&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.13&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;B&quot;,
]

[tool.uv.sources]
B = { path = &quot;../B&quot;, editable = true }
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to automatically create a build for local dependencies. I know using workspaces works perfectly using <code>uv build --all-packages</code>. But I cannot always use workspaces due to conflicting requirements.</p>
<p>My current workflow is to export dependencies using <code>uv pip freeze --exclude-editable</code> and then read the pyproject.toml to know which packages must be built.</p>

<p>Can you say more about this? We can add the ability to let workspace members have conflicting packages, as we have for groups and extras.</p>

<p>I was having issues with tensorflow and pytorch. Tensorflow2 is supported with python versions 3.6-3.9 but latest pytorch versions requires  &gt;=3.9. I think the tensorflow model i was trying to use required a python version of 3.8</p>
