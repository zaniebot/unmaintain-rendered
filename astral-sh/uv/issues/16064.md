# Provide name and version of dependency that adds a new package

---

_Issue opened by @hofrob on 2025-09-29 12:06_

### Summary

Show name and version of package(s) that **add(s)** a new package to an app's list of dependencies.

### Example

# details

Sometimes when doing upgrades (via `uv lock --upgrade`) there's a new package needed because a newer version of one of the existing packages changed its requirements/dependencies. This looks like this in the output:

```
Add foo v0.1.2
```

Potentially, there could be 1-n current dependencies which added the package. I think it would help maintainers to get the list of packages which caused this.

# suggestion

```
Add foo v0.1.2 (via bar v1.2.3, baz v2.3.4)
```
