            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I need to determine where venvs are located in the file system.
I don't want python venvs to get installed in any users home directory, because I need to package them in a rpm file including my application, which has to be globally accessible for multiple users.
I can't find a proper way to do this in the documentation and if this is possible at all.</p>
<p>please help</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>AlmaLinux 9.x, CentOS 7.9</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.5.24</p>

<p>I'm not sure if that solves my problem.</p>
<p>But however I managed to create an environment in my  application path (so far not using the concept of a 'project' in the sense of uv concepts.)
But the python executable are always symbolic links to a python binary in a uv related path in the users home dir.(sorry don't remember exactly since beeing not in y office)
Maybe --relocatable is my solution, but I'm not sure.
Is there a step by step intro to create an isolated venv starting from scratch which, when ready does not need any internet access ?</p>

<p>No, what i want is exactly the opposite. I want everything included in my project folder. Not even symlinks to any directory outside that folder. This is what I always got using uv so far.</p>

<p>This is how Python virtual environments work. They link to the Python installation on the system. You shouldn't need the internet. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Sounds like you want #7865</p>
