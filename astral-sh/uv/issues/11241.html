            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>The project is great. I want this as substitution for <code>python</code> as shell default, by following method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Normally this is on .bashrc or .zshrc
alias python=&quot;uv run&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is the user level: between project and root-ish.</p>
<h1>The question is: Is that method approved?</h1>
<p>I can't think any better. Perhaps the developers or ones that has more experiences has way better solutions?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>MINGW64_NT-10.0-19045 3.5.4-395fda67.x86_64 x86_64 Msys</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.5.28 (ee2bdc21f 2025-02-04)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#installing-python-executables but that's different, we don't have a <code>uv run</code> equivalent for <code>python</code>. We may someday, but it's controversial :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Tested and it works on Windows too! All I have to do is add <code>~/.local/bin</code> or <code>%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin</code> into <code>%PATH</code>.</p>
