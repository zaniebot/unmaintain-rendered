Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>With pip you can create custom config per venv (custom index-url etc) with pip.conf files. I think it's impossible with uv as it doesn't look for the <code>uv.toml</code> file within the active venv.</p>
<p>This could be helpful with managing these configs if one needs to work with / test different scenarios without modifying repo code or constantly changing <code>uv.toml</code> that is being detected (IIRC it works with closest to cwd working upwards)</p>
