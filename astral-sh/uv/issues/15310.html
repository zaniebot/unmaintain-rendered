<p>When I do &quot;uv add PySide6&quot;, I get this:</p>
<pre><code>Resolved 9 packages in 12ms
error: Distribution `pyside6==6.9.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on Linux (`manylinux_2_36_aarch64`), but `pyside6` (v6.9.1) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux_2_28_x86_64`, `manylinux_2_39_aarch64`, `macosx_12_0_universal2`, `win_amd64`, `win_arm64`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels
</code></pre>
<p>I then add the following to pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
    &quot;sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64'&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>When I do &quot;uv add PySide6&quot; again, I get this:</p>
<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers: platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux'):
  ╰─▶ Because all versions of pyside6 have no `platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux'`-compatible wheels and your project depends on pyside6, we can

      hint: Pre-releases are available for `pyside6` in the requested range (e.g., 6.0.0a1.dev1606913934), but pre-releases weren't enabled (try: `--prerelease=allow`)

      hint: The resolution failed for an environment that is not the current one, consider limiting the environments with `tool.uv.environments`.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! https://inspector.pypi.io/project/pyside6/6.8.0.2/ does indeed provide <code>PySide6-6.8.0.2-cp39-abi3-manylinux_2_31_aarch64.whl</code>. You set your required environment to <code>2_36</code> though, which doesn't consider <em>older</em> wheels. Want to try <code>2_31</code> instead?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think <code>platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64'</code> will work. The output on that machine will just be something like:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the error is &quot;correct&quot;, in that you're on ARM, but their ARM wheel requires glibc 2.39 or later, and you're on 2.36.</p>

<p>@charliermarsh Yes correct. I am on 2.36, and PySide6 6.8.0.2 requires glibc 2.36, while the newest version requires 2.39 as you pointed out, but uv does not seem to install it.
I also tried 'aarch64' for the platform_machine flag, so basically:
[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
&quot;sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'aarch64'&quot;
]</p>
<p>but then I get this:
error: Distribution <code>pyside6==6.9.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple</code> can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform</p>
<p>hint: You're on Linux (<code>manylinux_2_36_aarch64</code>), but <code>pyside6</code> (v6.9.1) only has wheels for the following platforms: <code>manylinux_2_28_x86_64</code>, <code>manylinux_2_39_aarch64</code>, <code>macosx_12_0_universal2</code>, <code>win_amd64</code>, <code>win_arm64</code>; consider adding your platform to <code>tool.uv.required-environments</code> to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right, I think this is basically unsupported, because you can only narrow resolution with environment markers, and there are no markers for glibc versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see. Thank you. Would be great to support those markers or some other solution (like pip?), due to Qt (with its python bindings PySide6) being such a huge framework worlwide.</p>
