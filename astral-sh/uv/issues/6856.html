            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is only a minor annoyance but I keep running into it.</p>
<p>I typically use the terminal in VS Code, docked at the bottom, with code on top.</p>
<p>When I run <code>uv &lt;command&gt; --help</code> I expect to at a minimum see the command specific options first, since I assume this is supposed to be the quick reference.
This is not an issue when using <code>uv help &lt;command&gt;</code> since it scrolls to the top, however this is the rich help and the purpose is different I think.</p>
<p>Example, I want remind myself quickly what options <code>uv run</code> has:
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67aec19d-ce6e-49e5-8ce5-44021abbdb12" alt="image"></p>
<p>The things I want to see are way up at the top.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure what to do here. All of the details about the specific command are on top. It seems pretty weird to move the command-specific options to the bottom? I agree it&#x27;s not great though. Unfortunately we have a lot of options!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I understand there&#x27;s a lot of options. Possibly there&#x27;s nothing to be done here that&#x27;s worth doing.</p>
<p>I was confused as to why all the options from <code>sync</code> were included. I thought maybe they just got appended in any case.
Reading the rich help in more detail, I found this to be surprising, at least in the specific case of <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When used in a project, the project environment will be created and updated before invoking the command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it&#x27;s essentially doing a <code>uv sync</code> before and thus all of its options are required. Seems like <code>--no-project</code> is the only <code>uv run</code> specific command so it possibly wasn&#x27;t the best example since all options are relevant.</p>
<p>How about <code>uv tree</code> instead? Are the index, installer, build and cache options etc. relevant for commands like this? <em>Edit: All the commands seem to have well trimmed options so they probably are.</em></p>
<p>Maybe just something to keep in mind since I imagine only more options will come in the future.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately all of the resolver options are relevant for most project operations because we make sure everything is up to date. I wonder if we should hide more option sections by default and require <code>uv help</code> to see the full listing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI, with the VS Code integrated terminal you can hit <code>Ctrl+Up</code> to scroll up to the previous command.</p>
