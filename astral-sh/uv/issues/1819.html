            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, I saw https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1474 should have resulted in uv being able to work via SSL_CERT_FILE, but when running.</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install --extra-index-url https://packages.dns.ad.xyz.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-libs-local/simple upv-model
</code></pre>
<p>I am still encountering</p>
<pre><code>error: error sending request for url (https://packages.dns.ad.xyz.com/artifactory/api/pypi/pypi-libs-local/simple/upv-model/): error trying to connect: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer
  Caused by: error trying to connect: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer
  Caused by: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer
</code></pre>
<p>I have validated that my trust store and environment variables are correctly mapped, should the merge for 1474 not have fixed this?</p>
<p>Using uv has a lot of scope to speed up so many internal package deployments so would be very keen to get to test this further.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the great work so far on it!</p>
<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Personal learning on this, and I think there are some gaps in my knowledge, and YMMV. But... this seems to have explanatory power and a safe/usable solution:</p>
<p>First, I'm not deep in pythonia, but it seems like files.pythonhosted.org is the official Content Delivery Network (CDN) for the Python Package Index (PyPI), which hosts all package artifacts (wheels .whl and source tarballs .tar.gz) for almost everything on PyPI, from uv to pyright and beyond. So, when we go run an install, the actual file download comes from files.pythonhosted.org.</p>
<p>When I encountered this error, I began looking at connectivity to files.pythonhosted.org. The HTTPS requests resulted in similar certificate/security errors as the above, as did a basic: <code>curl -vI https://files.pythonhosted.org/</code>, which produced the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">* Host files.pythonhosted.org:443 was resolved.

More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.

</code></pre>
<p>My ai agent cleverly noticed my query was attempting to connect on IPv6, and suggested I try the curl over IPv4. Whammo: suddenly, no errors, everything resolves fine, the certs are good. The IPv4 query tells me a valid, secure IP address for files.pythonhosted.org, so I record this combo to my /etc/hosts, then I try running the install again, and... life is good, but without me institutionalizing the use of unsafe-hosts or whatever.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know WHY the IPv6 path was broken. I don't know if I was behind a proxy at the cafe that had bad cache, or if there's a misconfiguration on the cert or DNS for files.pythonhosted.org, or what the root-root-cause was. That would take more time and effort than I have for this, although I'll note one complication: when I began troubleshooting this, I was on one network. When I found the path forward and started trying IPv4, I was on another. So, I'm not even sure if my solution would have worked in the first context, or if it was the move to a new network that solved it. All I know is that, even after I moved from the cafe network to my more reliable home network, the bad IPv6 dns/cert data was still blocking me.</p>
<p>But, I'm hoping this at least points toward a path for further problem-solving by the community. Maybe an option for uv to fall-back to IPv4 if IPv6 is throwing peer-cert errors? Maybe something the folks at pythonhosted.org can work on with their infra team? Or, maybe just a note on these issues explaining the settled science of it all. ;-)</p>

<p>No idea where it goes from here, but I just want to thank the maintainers here on uv, the amazing folks who run pythonhosted, and the rest of the community who make this kind of work possible. We can't do what we do without you.</p>
