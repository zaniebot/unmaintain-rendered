# feature: uv activate

---

_Issue opened by @hoegge on 2024-12-15 18:25_

It would be really cool, if uv had an activate feature, that would make activating an environement easier:

`uv activate`

to activate the default ´venv´ environment or 

`uv activate venv2`

to activate a venv with another name instead of having to write the long

`source .venv/bin/activate`

Sorry. Searched for it before posting but was apparently not good at searching.

Thanks
