            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is not clear from the documentation and <code>uv lock -h</code> docs how to upgrade an optional dependency with the <code>lock</code> subcommand.</p>
<p>For example, I have pyright unpinned in my <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, in the optional-dependencies / dev section. I want to upgrade it. Is there a feasible way to do that with the <code>uv lock</code> command?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure what I was doing wrong earlier (could have sworn I tried that exact command), but it seems that it does now! Wish I mentioned what version of <code>uv</code> I was on back then.</p>
<p>In the docs, I still think it'd be good to explicitly explain that optional dependencies are locked/upgraded the same as non-optional ones. Thanks for the clarification here!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries! I re-read the docs, and personally I think the line on upgrades is okay as-is. If we get another issue like this, I'll definitely reconsider.</p>
