            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With supply chain attacks becoming more common and serious (<a href="https://helixguard.ai/blog/malicious-sha1hulud-2025-11-24">recent example from NPM</a>), it's important to put some protections in place where possible.</p>
<p>Since these kinds of compromises are usually detected pretty quickly, one simple protection is to not resolve packages that are very new, before package maintainers had a chance to clean up compromised packages. Some JavaScript package managers therefore include a setting that lets you specify a timespan during which new packages should not be considered for resolves, i.e. a minimum release age:
https://pnpm.io/settings#minimumreleaseage
https://bun.com/docs/pm/cli/install#minimum-release-age</p>
<p>Since these kinds of compromises are possible with PyPI as well it would be really useful if uv could implement a similar kind of protection.</p>
<p>Note that this is different from the existing <code>exclude-newer</code> setting since that is about configuring a cut-off at a specific point in time, rather than a minimum release age.</p>
