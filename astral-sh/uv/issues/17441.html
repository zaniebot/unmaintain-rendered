            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When writing libraries, we often want to test using both <code>uv lock --resolution lowest-direct</code> and <code>uv lock --resolution highest -U</code>, to ensure declared minimums are accurate and that we don't break on the newest stuff. One problem is that in a monorepo environment, <code>--resolution highest -U</code> won't actually pick up the true latest version, which would actually require a file-path source. The other problem is we don't want to <code>override-dependencies</code> the package to the file path, because then <code>--resolution lowest-direct</code> won't actually use the published version we set as minimum.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is some way of having <code>lowest-direct</code> pull the specified minimum version from a packaging index still, but for <code>highest</code> to use the local relative path. Either that, or something I can add to the <code>uv lock --resolution highest</code> invocation that will have the lockfile point to the local path instead of the latest published version.</p>
<p>Note: I suppose one alternative is making use of prerelease versions, but that still leaves a gap if two libraries get modified in the same PR; can make that prohibited, but it is an annoyance.</p>
