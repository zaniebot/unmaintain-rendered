            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm sorry. Our development and release flow is the following: Users create PRs, and each PR is merged into the main branch. The main branch is automatically built and published to PyPI. As long nobody bumps the version number in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, we don't want to publish (release) a new version. We used <code>poetry</code> in the past, and the <code>--skip-existing</code> option did the job.</p>

<p>No it doesn't. UV will try to upload all pre-existing ones.</p>

<p>Are these 1.0.0 files the same that are on the index, and when uploading, do you get a &quot;already exists but ok&quot; message or do you get an error?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>for the ci workflow @chassing mentioned (which is similar to what we use) the files aren't necessarily identical. they point is to use &quot;this file already exists in the index&quot; as a shorthand for &quot;version hasn't changed, no need to upload&quot; (by treating that specific error as being ok). i ported the twine approach to poetry, it's based on some heuristics https://github.com/pypa/twine/blob/ae71822a3cb0478d0f6a0cccb65d6f8e6275ece5/twine/commands/upload.py#L58-L72 so a bit hacky, but it works very well in practice</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems problematic to try to upload different content and expect it to be treated the same way as uploading an identical file? It also seems reasonable to opt-in to ignoring failures in that case? Unless we want to add a command to check if a matching version exists or something? But that exposes you to TOCTOU bugs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With pypi today, a new release is created once you upload the first file for that release. Uploading additional files with the same package name and version number but a different filename adds them to the existing release. That is suboptimal: A release is published once a single file exists even if the wheels the users want are still missing, and it means that if something in your release process fails, you have a release with half the files. The pypi admins are also aware that this is undesirable, and there is work going on to fix this (https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-694-upload-2-0-api-for-python-package-repositories/16879).</p>
<hr />
<p>Separately, unfortunately it seems that different implementations differ in how they react to reuploading files</p>
<ul>
<li>PyPI: When uploading the same file again, you get a 200 OK with an empty body. When uploading a different file, you get an error. We can’t tell apart whether an upload was successful or skipped.</li>
<li>GitLab: When uploading a file with the same name, you get a “400 Bad request - Validation failed: File name has already been taken”, no matter whether the file was identical or not.</li>
<li>Codeberg/forgejo: Error 409 “package file already exists”, no matter whether the file was identical or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current skip existing behavior was based on PyPI’s behavior, while copying twine response behavior for compatibility with alternative indexes (the ones @davidszotten mentioned) as default without parameters (misunderstanding how those behave for non-pypi), resulting in a strange mix of behaviours.</p>
<hr />
<p>Skip existing packages in its basic form is necessary: If a CI publish task fails mid-way uploading files, the user should be able to restart the whole workflow, with only new files being reuploaded.</p>
<p>Preferably, we’d error when we try to upload files that have the same name when uploading, but different content, otherwise the following scenario could: You build foo 1.2.3 into foo-1.2.3.tar.gz and foo-1.2.3-cp39-abi3-manylinux2014.whl, but upload only the source distribution foo-1.2.3.tar.gz (let’s say, because they wheel build failed or because the CI machine crashed after the source dist upload). Now you make some code changes, rebuild foo 1.2.3 and try uploading foo-1.2.3.tar.gz  and foo-1.2.3-cp39-abi3-manylinux2014.whl. foo-1.2.3.tar.gz already exists, so only foo-1.2.3-cp39-abi3-manylinux2014.whl gets uploaded. Due to the code changes, the published source distribution and wheel mismatch: A mac or windows user building from the source distribution will get different code than the linux user, breaking the contract (and core assumption in packaging tools) that all files in a release match.</p>
<p>One option is adding index url as mandatory parameter to skip-existing: By using the hashes in the index URL, we check before uploading whether a file with the same filename does not yet exist (new upload), a file with the same name and same content/hash exists (we can skip it, such as a 1.0 that is still present in your <code>dist/</code> when you're now publishing 1.1) or a file with the same name but different content exists (we error). The disadvantage is that this is more complex both on the user side and the uv side than twine's <code>--skip-existing</code>.</p>

<p>We could take a similar approach as <code>poetry publish</code> here and require the project's pyproject.toml to be present (either in the current directory or as part of the workspace), then only upload the version defined there. This would change CI workflows in some cases because it requires a checkout step for the publish step (e.g. if you build multiple wheels for different platforms, then collect and upload in a separate job, that job needs a checkout too).</p>

(i'm open to ideas of other ways of achieving this though)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For skip existing we can use the following design:</p>
<p>The user can pass <code>--keep-existing &lt;index url&gt;</code>. For each file given to upload, uv checks whether the file is already on the index. If the filename does not exist, uv will upload the file. If the filename does exist and the file on the index is the exact same as the local file (hash match), we skip the upload as there's nothing to do. If the file exists and mismatches with different content, we error: There is an inconsistency, and uv does not upload in this case.</p>
<p>The upload itself may then error or succeed. If it errors, we check the index URL again: Maybe there was a parallel upload of the same file, and the other upload was quicker (avoid TOCTOU errors). We then apply the same logic: If the filename does exist and the file on the index is the same (hash match), it's ok, there was an upload race. If the file exists and mismatches, we error: There is an inconsistency, and uv does not upload in this case. I'm not sure yet if we should do the second check only if the error is one of the twine-recognized file-already-existed conditions; i tend to think we can just do the second check on any error.</p>
<p>This enables re-trying publish, but it still requires the author of a package to ensure that they only try to publish each version from a specific commit. We impose this requirement to avoid situations where different files in a version were built from different sources, which breaks a fundamental assumption in uv.</p>

We run a monorepo and all packages are built when a tag is pushed, but the tag doesn't change the version of all packages because of prefixing.

What would you suggest as an alternative to only build packages if they should be built (e.g. version has changed)? Or is there another way you envision this workflow?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd recommend explicitly selecting the package(s) that changed and you want to publish. I know it's more effort than having the index figure it out, but it avoids publishing inconsistent sets of distributions for a version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another option might be to use different exit codes for <code>uv publish</code> to be able to make &quot;local and remote hash don't match&quot; and &quot;some other error occurred&quot; programmatically distinct errors. Then, for this use case, the exit code could be checked and ignored only if it's the &quot;local and remote hash don't match&quot; case. <code>uv publish || true</code> would work as-is but it risks ignoring the &quot;some other error occurred&quot; cases which is not great.</p>
<p>Edit: I've ended up just checking for the string &quot;Local file and index file do not match&quot; in stderr when <code>uv publish</code> exits non-zero and then ignoring the failure in that case for now, but I would really prefer a solution that doesn't evoke Hyrum's Law.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that the default functionality of <code>uv publish</code> should return an error when the hash of the remote and local wheel has changed. However, we're trying to follow the recommended <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/">publishing CI/CD</a> using <code>uv publish</code>, where a standard procedure is to publish to the testpypi index on every pull request. This seems to not currently be possible with <code>uv</code> due to <em>Local file and index file do not match</em>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We also need this option so our CI can publish the same package version with different content (over different CI executions). We use semver to version our packages and do not allow replacing an existing production packages (1.2.3) however our build/publish tools must allow for this for development versions (1.2.3a0 or 1.2.3.dev0 for instance) which we don't mind to change over time</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ugh, I ran into this problem because the folder name of my git repository was different than the Python package name on PyPi.
After I fixed the package name in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, the error continued to happen, because there was a <code>.whl</code> in the <code>dist</code> directory.
I had to manually clear that out, to get <code>uv</code> to publish the package properly.</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to publish `dist\trevor_py-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  Caused by: Upload failed with status code 403 Forbidden. Server says: 403 Invalid API Token: project-scoped token is not valid for project: 'trevor-py', project-scoped token is not valid for project: 'trevor-py'
</code></pre>
<p>My Python package is called <code>trevor</code>, not <code>trevor-py</code>, but my git repository is named <code>trevor-py</code>. I don't want them to match.</p>
<p>To be clear: I would <strong>not</strong> have expected <code>uv</code> to continue attempting to publish the package under the old name, after I fixed the package name in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm a bit confused - i can see PRs adding <code>--check-url</code> but i am unable to get it working as expected (according to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8531)</p>
<p>I've got the following config in my repo (with a subpackage using uv workspaces):</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;myindex&quot;
default = true
url = &quot;https://myindex/path/to/pypi/PYPI/simple&quot;
publish-url = &quot;https://myindex/path/to/pypi/somerepo&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But i'm still getting hash mismatch in my CI when doing <code>uv build --all-packages</code> and <code>uv publish --index myindex</code> when i have changes in e.g. the subpackage that i have not bumped (that i don't want to release yet)</p>
<p>My CI pipeline is very simple (does not need to be more complex) - i simply want to build everything and publish any version that does not already exist.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#check-url">The docs for --check-url</a> and the description of the linked PR differ a bit. Reading the docs, it looks to be the expected (but IMO less useful) behavior - e.g. it will always check hash and fail if the same version exists on the remote index.</p>
<p>If this is by design, does anyone have an example of a release workflow that manually publishes only new versions?</p>

<p>Can you inspect the build package, what is the difference with the previous build of the package that it changed hash?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Sorry, what is by design? What the docs state or what the PR states? Because to me, they state two different behaviors. I've manually modified &quot;subpackage&quot; but i have not updated the tag in it's pyproject.toml so i don't want to publish a new version, because the version already exists on my remote index. Then, i have a release workflow that always builds all packages and is supposed to publish only packages with versions that do not exist on the remote.</p>
<p>E.g. i guess i want something similar to the <code>--skip-existing</code> behavior of poetry which i though this issue was created to address, but i might've misunderstood or missed something? ☹️</p>
<p>If a built package, e.g. <code>subpackage==1.0.0</code>, already exist on the remote i just want to skip uploading it (no need to check the hash or anything in this case). This is because in my repo there might've been changes to <code>subpackage==1.0.0</code>, but it's version is not bumped yet (not to be released yet)</p>
<p>E.g. <code>subpackage</code> might have been updated with a chore: or refactor: commit, and we're expecting another commit or two to land before we want it to be released, so we do not bump the version in it's pyproject.toml yet. Simultaneously we have changes in <code>otherpackage</code>, bump it's version and run the release workflow. But now the release will fail, because it does not ignore <code>subpackage==1.0.0</code> and instead sees that the hash differs.</p>
<p>In my specific case, <code>subpackage</code> is actually just a standalone tool that i ship with my releases, so there is no real dependency between <code>subpackage</code> and <code>otherpackage</code> but i'd still like to just <code>uv build --all-packages</code> and <code>uv publish --index ...</code> and be done with it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The docs are the reference for the expected behavior, the PR descriptions are mainly for internal review. The uv behavior is different from that of poetry: <code>--check-url</code> will only skip uploads if the file is exactly the same, to prevent the problems described in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7917#issuecomment-2402208639. It currently does not support workflows such as the one you describe, where build and publish are called on any commit but should only actually upload when the version number changes. While this protects from a class of bugs around re-uploads and inconsistent index behaviors, it does unfortunately make CI pipelines more complex for the simple cases.</p>

<p>OP specifically stated that he wished for something like poetry or twine <code>--skip-existing</code> flag which completely skips uploading of packages targeting the same version (AFAICT, i've used it before and it's been working great)</p>
<p>It looks to me like a &quot;have problem A but solve a problem B&quot; scenario 😅</p>
<p>In a release workflow environment i (and everyone else using uv workspaces essentially) would have to manually implement logic that checks the versions on the remote index to determine whether or not a package should be published. I don't even see that as a reasonable option, at that point i'd rather bring in poetry/twine and more wisely spend the time developing actual features for my product.</p>
<p>FWIW while not ideal, twine seems to solve it by having some special handling for the various indexes.</p>
<p>Can this be considered, and if so should i create a new issue?</p>

<p>Unfortunately not, this will only be solved Upload API 2.0 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0694/). The current Upload API 1.0 is effectively undocumented, with every index implementing a slight variation of it. It also uploads one file at time and creates a release if the first file of a version is present, with different behaviors when re-uploading a file.</p>

<p>Twine has made bad experiences with this feature, too, and has recently removed support for <code>--skip-exiting</code> for non-PyPI indices (https://github.com/pypa/twine/pull/1253). As poetry has copied twine's implementation (https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/2812), it's possible that poetry will follow suit and also remove support for this. There's a lot of complexity involved that makes it hard to support this cross-index without accidentally causing broken releases.</p>
