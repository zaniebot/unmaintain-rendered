            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Hi I use an NFS setup and optimizing storage allocation vs speed is a priority.</p>
<p>UV uses quite a few directories that can grow large over time. <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code>, <code>UV_PYTHON_CACHE_DIR</code>, etc and how they interact with <code>UV_LINK_MODE</code>.</p>
<p>A suggestion is to dedicate a page in the docs to describe the storage strategy and all locations and all the environment variables we need to set. Right now the docs explain things piecemeal.</p>
<p>With the current docs, I can do this by browsing https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/ but I believe a dedicated doc page is helpful for users to understand UV&#x27;s caching strategy and having the peace of mind that they aren&#x27;t missing anything.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv overall prioritizes speed over disk usage. It writes uses the cache a lot, but it&#x27;s also fine if you remove the cache (e.g., <code>uv cache prune</code>).</p>
<p>uv uses the XDG specification as basis for deciding where files go: Cache for everything transient, <code>~/.local/share</code> for permanent data such as Python interpreters and scripts, config home for the user-level <code>uv.toml</code>, the bin home for launchers. The one special trick uv pulls is that installations into a venv are hardlinked (that&#x27;s the link mode) from the cache. This allows fast installation, while the cache can still be removed without breaking venvs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thanks @konstin for the help. I really like UV. Just saying that the docs can use a page to focus on storage.</p>
