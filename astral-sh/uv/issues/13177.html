            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When reading the docs, I see two examples of integrating <code>ruff</code> into the project, and it is a little bit confusing to me.</p>
<p>First one is by defining dependency groups:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#development-dependencies</p>
<pre><code>pyproject.toml

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
  &quot;pytest&quot;
]
lint = [
  &quot;ruff&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>Second one, as a Python tool:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#commands-with-different-package-names</p>
<pre><code>uvx --from 'ruff==0.3.0' ruff check
</code></pre>
<p>--First question--
Since both use cases are mentioned by you in the docs, I assume that there have to be 2 completely different use cases, different workflows for using <code>ruff</code> (one requiring the dependency group, second one a tool). Can you please provide more details when would you recommend to use which approach?</p>
<p>--Second question--
Why <code>uvx</code> way of using <code>ruff</code> couldn't take by default the version from the dependency-group? Or maybe - to be more precise - version from a specific dependency-group. Maybe something like that:</p>
<p><code>uvx --from-dependency-group=lint ruff check</code></p>
<p>Of course the issue is not only about <code>ruff</code> itself, but - in general - about managing the tools in projects.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
