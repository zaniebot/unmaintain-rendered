            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>I am super excited about uv and all the work done already.</p>
<p>A few project management features beyond dependency management ones have been discussed in other issues, I was curious about the existence of a public roadmap mentioning the expected features at least (not necessarily dates but if some exist, why not 😀!)</p>
<p>Features like build-backend or version management look super promising and I would be interested to see those in the list.</p>
<p>I am aware of feature-specific tracking (which is already super nice) but I was looking at one level above:</p>
<ul>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The uv product is awesome, but the stable version is not released yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv does not yet have a stable API; once uv's API is stable (v1.0.0), the versioning scheme will adhere to Semantic Versioning.
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/policies/versioning/">https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/policies/versioning/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a view of the roadmap would be great.</p>
<p>In the 0.6.0 pre-stable minor release, there a section indicating that a feature in stabilized and no longer in preview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stabilizations</p>
<ul>
<li>uv publish is no longer in preview
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.6.0">https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.6.0</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll like to deploy uv in production, but I’d like to avoid using feature that are not stable.</p>
<p>Do you have page referencing the list of stable/very-unlikely-to-change features ?</p>
<p>I'm especially interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>uv pip install</li>
<li>uv pip compile</li>
<li>uv pip tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The information could require less effort than publishing the roadmap and still convince teams to put uv in production even if the stable version is not out yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All of uv is fairly stable — especially the <code>uv pip</code> commands.</p>
<p>So far, we've made small breaking changes every ~30 releases or so and they're very clearly marked. You can see examples in the CHANGELOG.</p>
<p>I'm kind of surprised I wrote that in the versioning policy. I don't think it conveys the correct message about uv's readiness for production.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, could it be shared in a synthetic form here?</p>
<p>I am super interested in progress on package and project management features (like build-backend stabilization and version bump capabilities).</p>
<p>I feel like other tools like <code>hatch</code> are not releasing much changes since <code>uv</code> arrived and having feature parity (and even more) in uv would allow to get rid of those tools.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Both of those things are high priority items on the roadmap, we're actively moving the build-backend towards stabilization (#11446) and I'm working on a version bump interface this month.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb, thanks for all the work done on uv over the past months!</p>
<p>I am still interested in roadmap related information, I suppose the GitHub issues are part of the answer but might not fully reflect Astral's priorities and plans.</p>
<p>As mentioned in other issues, I am still interested in bump interface evolutions (for instance git tag/commit additions, but also things like GitLab release creation could be nice). Things related to upgrading dependencies are another set of features that I am interested in.</p>
<p>Do you still have plans to share some form of roadmap?
Could also be a categorization of issues by feature or blog posts describing Astral's plans.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the answers!</p>
