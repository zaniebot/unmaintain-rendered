# Issue tracker vs GH discussions vs Discord

---

_Issue opened by @rsyring on 2025-02-21 04:21_

### Summary

You guys are obviously getting a TON of issues reported here.  By the looks of it, many of them really should be discussions.

I've been doing some work in the mise repo recently and Jeff took a somewhat novel approach in [locking down the issue tracker and requiring discussions instead](https://github.com/jdx/mise/issues/3859).  I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, and it is harder for a non-maintainer (me) to get an issue noticed, but all-in-all, I think it's a positive development.  Bonus that it's so easy to convert a discussion to an issue when it's deemed to be one.

I know from the issue tracker suggestions that you want to use Discord for community discussions.  But, for whatever it's worth, I just don't like the UX of Discord for async communications where I might only care about a handful of issues/discussions.  GH is great for being able to subscribe to what I want and ignore everything else.

HTH.

Just thought of something else: if you head this direction, you could note that people should use the thumbs-up reaction in Discussions to call attention to discussions that should be converted issues.  It would help crowd source items that probably deserve maintainer attention and make it easier to find signal in the midst of the issue/discussion noise.  I'm sure automation/reporting could be setup for maintainers to help them focus on the discussions that are getting more "votes."

Issues, by virtue of being issues, then would also become a signal to the community that a maintainer has acknowledged the issue has some weight and is likely to be seen/addressed.  Perhaps encouraging more input/contribution on those already prioritized items.
