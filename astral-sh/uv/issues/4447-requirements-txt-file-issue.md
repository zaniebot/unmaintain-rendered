Are you installing on a different machine / platform than you generated the requirements file on?

Yes, does it change the requirements file result ?

Yeah `pip compile` / `requirements.txt` does not encode a multi-platform resolution, the resolution is for the platform that it was created on. Hence, at runtime, you get this error that there is not a wheel with a matching platform.

We do support running resolution for alternative platforms, you can see the [documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#multi-platform-resolution) for more details. The discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2679 may also be helpful.

We're working on universal resolution with a `uv lock` command: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3347
