            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm relatively new to uv.</p>
<p>I cloned a git repo of mine to begin with, and then <code>uv init</code>'ed within the folder. This initialized the usual files (pyproject.toml, main.py, uv.lock, etc.).</p>
<p>However, at this point, the Python version picked up in .python-version was the default one in my <code>usr/bin/python</code> which was Python 3.9.</p>
<p>I wanted instead for it to install and use Python 3.10 for this project.</p>
<p>Thus, I ran the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv python install 3.10</code></li>
<li><code>uv python pin 3.10</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, as expected this change is reflected in the .python-version file (which displays 3.10). However, the pyproject.toml and uv.loc files still show the old info.</p>
<p><strong>pyproject.toml</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>uv.lock</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>version = 1
revision = 2
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I manually need to change the values for requires-python in the above 2 files after doing <code>uv python pin 3.xx</code>? Is that even required? If so, why is that not taken care of by the pin command?</li>
<li>As I understand it, <code>uv python install 3.10</code> will install that Python version globally? Is there any way to install python only for this project / associated environment? I do not wish to pollute the global space with multiple Python versions.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I am new, I may have some incorrect assumptions. So please correct me where needed.</p>
<p>uv has been a fantastic tool so far, so kudos to the community!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<li>Yeah. The pin command is intended to change your default version. Since it's compatible with your <code>requires-python</code> range, there's nothing that <em>needs</em> to change in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>. The <code>uv.lock</code> includes all possible Python versions already and doesn't need to change.</li>
<li>What is the concern about polluting the global namespace? i.e., where do you not want that Python to be available?</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay that makes sense!</p>
<p>As to the latter question, I would imagine that multiple Python installations across the global namespace could lead to package / dependency conflicts, and this is the reason behind the typical advice to contain Python libraries (incl. the Python version itself) inside neat environments.</p>
<p>Am I mistaken in this understanding?</p>
<p>PS: my apologies for the late response - Github did not notify me for some reason. Thank you!</p>
