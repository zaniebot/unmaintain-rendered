# Installing no-executable packages can leave lingering executables around

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-26 19:43_

On main, if you run:

- `uv tool install black`
- `uv tool install ./scripts/packages/black_editable`
- `uv tool install black`

Then that third invocation will fail with `error: Executable already exists: black (use `--force` to overwrite)`.

The problem is that `./scripts/packages/black_editable` doesn't provide any executables, so when we install it, we don't remove the `black` and `blackd` executables installed in the first invocation. So, when we do that third invocation, we have a `black` and `blackd` that already exists but isn't mentioned in any receipts.

I guess we should remove all the executables when replacing, even if they don't all exist in the new version?
