# Improve documentation on how to run uv script in a cron

---

_Issue opened by @CedricRaison on 2025-03-05 22:02_

### Summary

I wanted to use uv in a cron to run a task. It's really the "classic" usage.

I have my project in `/root/my_project`.
There is inside a .venv folder containing all dependencies.
There is a file `/root/my_project/task.py` in my project that import a few libraries (ex: requests) and do things.

I wanted to run the command `uv run /root/my_project/task.py` in a cronjob to run my task but it didn’t activate the virtual environment so I had a import error.

The solution I found to run my command in my cron was to use `/root/my_project/.venv/bin/python3 /root/my_project/tasks.py`.

It's really the everyday usage and I'm pretty sure it's possible to use with the command `uv run`.

So if it's the case that would be great to improve the documentation on this specific case.

You might be looking for `uv run --project /root/my_project /root/my_project/task.py`?

Yes exactly ! This is what I was looking for. 
It would be great to an example with `--project` in the documentation here https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#running-a-script-with-dependencies

That was really helpful. Thanks! For future reference, I combined @charliermarsh's answer and @CedricRaison's question to the complete solution that worked for me:
`/home/username/.local/bin/uv run --project /home/username/project/ /home/username/project/task.py`

I want to emphasize tobi-or-not's comment. 
**The only syntax that reliably works for me is to supply the full path to uv, to the project's folder, and to the project's entry point.** For example, to run my uv project named `chron_scrape` with entry point `main.py` at 3:30 pm every day, I add the following line to `crontab`

`30 15 * * * /Users/name/.local/bin/uv run --project /Users/name/Python_Projects/chron_scrape /Users/name/Python_Projects/chron_scrape/main.py`

`30 15 * * *` *the time to run the project*
`/Users/name/.local/bin/uv run --project` *the path to uv to run the project*
`/Users/name/Python_Projects/chron_scrape` *the path to the project folder*
`/Users/name/Python_Projects/chron_scrape/main.py` *the path to the entry point to launch the project*
