# `uvx` and `uv tool run` should exec into new process

---

_Issue opened by @iwinux on 2025-06-18 02:40_

## Current Behavior

1. start `ipython` via `uvx ipython`
2. `pgrep -fal ipython` shows 2 processes:
    ```
    1315 /usr/local/bin/uv tool uvx ipython
    1316 /Users/limbo/.cache/uv/archive-v0/wcpt9UP5KQFF4PXopI6ut/bin/python /Users/limbo/.cache/uv/archive-v0/wcpt9UP5KQFF4PXopI6ut/bin/ipython
    ```
3. `pstree -p 1315` shows that PID 1315 is the parent process:
    ```
    -+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd
    \-+= 29881 limbo -fish
        \-+= 01315 limbo /usr/local/bin/uv tool uvx ipython
        \--- 01316 limbo /Users/limbo/.cache/uv/archive-v0/wcpt9UP5KQFF4PXopI6ut/bin/python /Users/limbo/.cache/uv/archive-v0/wcpt9UP5KQFF4PXopI6ut/bin/ipython  
    ```

## Expected

In dev shells it's no big difference, but when starting service daemons (systemd / launchd / etc.), we would expect the actual program to become the "root" process, without `uv` staying in the middle. Usually this is done by doing `exec` instead of starting a subprocess.

Are you having any concrete problems with the process tree setup?

_Comment by @iwinux on 2025-06-18 03:07_

Currently not yet. But indirect process handling raises concerns due to past bad experiences (from other tools). I would consider avoiding `uvx` in systemd unit / `Dockerfile` if this is difficult to fix at the uv side.

Feel free to close this in favor of #3095 :)

We forward signals to the child which has covered most problems we know about. Feel free to let us know if you encounter weird behavior.
