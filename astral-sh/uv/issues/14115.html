            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>To my ear, this message seems a bit stuffy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because flash-attn was not found in the package registry and you require flash-attn, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the phrase &quot;we can conclude that&quot; can be dropped from message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because flash-attn was not found in the package registry and you require flash-attn, your requirements are unsatisfiable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This specific error message is one we commonly see. In this specific form, with a direct requirement missing, it's not actually a resolution error, but an index configuration error. We can special case it, something like:</p>
<pre><code>error: flash-attn was not found in the package registry. Registries searched:
* https://pypi.org/simple
* https://python.example.org/simple
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From a quick search of the repo, it looks like the phrase comes from four formatting strings in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/tree/main/crates/uv-resolver/src/pubgrub/report.rs">src/pubgrub/report.rs</a> and wouldn't be hard to change, though the format strings themselves would be harder to understand in isolation.</p>
