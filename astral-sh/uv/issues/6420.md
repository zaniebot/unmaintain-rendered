# uv tool upgrade forgets username for git packages

---

_Issue opened by @mil-ad on 2024-08-22 10:58_

I installed a package directly from a git repo using `uv tool install git+ssh://git@github.com/foo/bar.git`. This works fine but when I try to upgrade the package with `uv tool upgrade bar` it tries to use $USER instead of `git` username and fails to upgrade the package. Is this a known bug?

I thought I had fixed this in v0.3.1, but let me take another look right now...

Do you mind doing `uv tool uninstall bar`, reinstalling, and trying to upgrade again? I think this _was_ fixed in v0.3.1 but you might have an "invalid" install receipt leftover from 0.3.0. Sorry!

You're right. Works if uninstall and do install/upgrade in 0.3.1
