# --short option for list

_@w3soul_

### Summary

Awesome tool!! Thank you.

It would be nice to have may be (--short) when listing installed python tools.

Example: I have 5-7 tools installed, with impacket in that list with `uv tool list` gets so long as it list the tool along with dependencies.

So, i was wondering if there is `--short` switch, like `uv tool list --short` and it shows only the installed tools without dependencies.

The idea is very similar to pipx.

```bash
pipx list
# list tools with dependencies
```

```bash
pipx list --short
# list tools without dependencies (shorter list)
```
