            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given that <code>uv export</code> and <code>uv pip compile</code> are somewhat able to generate the same output it would be same if their comments and features would match where sensible.</p>
<p>Eg take the following pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;test&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;django&gt;=5.1.1&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>uv export --no-hashes</code> generates:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated via `uv export`.
asgiref==3.8.1
django==5.1.1
sqlparse==0.5.1
tzdata==2024.1 ; sys_platform == 'win32'
</code></pre>
<p>and running <code>uv pip compile pyproject.toml</code> generates:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile pyproject.toml
asgiref==3.8.1
    # via django
django==5.1.1
    # via test (pyproject.toml)
sqlparse==0.5.1
    # via django
</code></pre>
<p>For consistency it would be great if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The comments both started with <code>This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:</code></li>
<li>... and included the full command (like the pip compile example has)</li>
<li>Include the &quot;# via&quot; comments in the uv export example. This makes it easier for human to follow why something changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next thing ties into the legacy tooling stuff, but it would be great if it were possible if <code>uv export</code> could generate a non-universal export (like pip compile does by default I assume) so the exported file stays small and comparable.</p>
<p>Happy to answer any questions or elaborate on why I think some things would be useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we're unlikely to add all the same adornments to the <code>uv export</code> output (like the <code># via</code> annotations). It's intentionally <em>not</em> intended to be a format of record, since all of that information lies in the lockfile. We could probably add the command to the header though.</p>
