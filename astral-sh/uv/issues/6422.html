Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Greetings <code>uv</code> team and congratulations on the release of <code>0.3</code>!</p>
<p>I would like to present a rather vexing issue when it comes to project management.</p>
<p>As you may know, Anaconda has a significant presence in the realm of data science and scientific python usage. Currently, <code>conda</code> lags behind current PEP standards and does not support reading dependencies from <code>pyproject.toml</code>. It is typically used by orgs that deploy to airgapped environments since it comes bundled with Anaconda alongside a number of other popular packages such as <code>pytorch</code>.</p>
<p>These orgs vastly prefer to use modern packaging tools like <code>uv</code> in non-airgapped development environments, but this requires carefully maintaining project dependencies for compatibility with Anaconda/<code>conda</code> and avoidance of adding new runtime dependencies to the airgapped deployment environments.</p>
<p>One such solution to avoid duplication of dependencies between conda <code>environment.yml</code> files and those defined <code>pyproject.toml</code> is by utilizing <code>requirements.txt</code> in conjunction with dynamic <code>project.dependencies</code> (as seen in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76722680/what-is-the-best-way-to-combine-conda-with-standard-python-packaging-tools-e-g">Drphoton’s answer here</a>).</p>
<p>This allows users to have a project layout like so:</p>
<pre><code>Project/
|-- src/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- main.py
|
|-- pyproject.toml
|-- requirements.txt
|-- requirements-dev.txt
</code></pre>
<p>and a <code>pyproject.toml</code> with dynamic dependency fields:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;myproject&quot;
# ...
dynamic = [&quot;dependencies&quot;, &quot;optional-dependencies&quot;]

[tool.setuptools.dynamic]
dependencies = { file = [&quot;requirements.txt&quot;] }

[tool.setuptools.dynamic.optional-dependencies]
dev = { file = [&quot;requirements-dev.txt&quot;] }
</code></pre>
<p>This setup allows users to run <code>conda</code> in airgapped environments like so:</p>
<pre><code>conda create -n ENVNAME &quot;python&gt;=3.12&quot; --file requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>while also letting them use <code>uv pip</code> in non-airgapped environments:</p>
<p><code>uv pip install -e .</code></p>
<p>This approach places a dependency on <code>setuptools</code> to read the dynamic dependencies, and is admittedly just a stop-gap solution to make up for conda’s lack of <code>pyproject.toml</code> support.</p>
<p>It would be nice if <code>uv</code> supported reading dynamic dependencies such that commands like <code>uv sync</code> would work if dependencies were defined in other files (such as split being across numerous <code>requirements.txt</code>).</p>
<p>(Eagerly waiting to see if Astral ever offers a product similar to Anaconda that provides a number of high quality MIT-licensed python packages/python interpreter/uv/ruff/etc).</p>
