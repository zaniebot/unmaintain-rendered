# Enhancement: Allow specifying `--groups` via environment variable UV_DEFAULT_GROUPS

---

_Issue opened by @turbotimon on 2025-11-14 09:29_

### Summary

I suggest an environment variable UV_DEFAULT_GROUPS (or similar) that overwrites the [default groups](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#default-groups)

### Motivation

In a project with many groups, where different team members need different sets of group for development (e.g. a monorepo), it should be possible to configure the default groups individually. Therefore, it is not necessary to specify `--group x --group y ...` ... for every `uv sync` or `uv run` command. In this scenario, it is not possible to alter the pyproject.toml as this would change the behavior for all team members.

The `UV_DEFAULT_GROUPS="x, y, z"` environment variable could then be e.g. set in an [.env]

### Current workaround

Best workaround I came up with, so fare, is make an alias `alias uv-sync="uv sync --group x --group y --group z`". Or is there already another solution?

### Related

Somewhat related to #15009

### Example

```sh
export UV_DEFAULT_GROUPS="x, z"
uv sync 
uv run ...
``

you can always use a local `uv.toml` for project-specific config.

@fanyx Not really in this case

`default-groups` is **not** allowed in `uv.toml` (*error: Failed to parse: `uv.toml`. The `default-groups` field is not allowed in a `uv.toml` file. `default-groups` is only applicable in the context of a project, and should be placed in a `pyproject.toml` file instead.*)

Therefore I still suggest an environment variable (there are already other to deal with groups like [`UV_NO_DEFAULT_GROUPS`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_no_default_groups) so i don't see any reason for one that overwrites the ones from pyproject.
