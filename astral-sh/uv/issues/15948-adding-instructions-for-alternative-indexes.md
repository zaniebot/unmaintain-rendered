# Adding instructions for alternative indexes (Cloudsmith)

---

_Issue opened by @pabloopez on 2025-09-19 13:45_

Hi team, 

some customers asked us about uv support from Cloudsmith. We recently added instructions in [our docs](https://docs.cloudsmith.com/formats/python-repository#uv-support) and we would like to add something similar in our docs in case someone else tries to find them. 

One member of the team will open a PR with suggested changes soon.
