            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I was comparing <code>uv.lock</code> to <code>pylock.toml</code>, and a question came to my mind, why doesn't <code>uv export --format pylock.toml</code> export the <code>uv.lock</code>file into a multi-use <code>pylock.toml</code>?</p>
<p>Currently, if we have any extras or dependency groups etc. and we want to export them, we have to use the appropriate options, something like <code>uv export --format pylock.toml --group dep-group-nape &gt;  pylock.dep-group-name.toml</code>. Which would give us a single use PEP-751 compatible lock file.</p>
<p>Is it because if you allow for exports to multi-use lock file, users would expect to be able to do <code>uv pip sync</code> + give dependency groups or extras and that's not compatible with the <code>uv</code>'s <code>pip</code> interface?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could eventually support extras and groups there in some cases. It’s not implemented.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh ok, it's just not implemented and it's not because there is a fundamental reason or limitation in PEP 751 that doesn't allow for an export of <code>uv.lock</code> to a multi-use <code>pylock.toml</code> for the generic simple use cases. (Like it's understandable to not be able to export workspaces).</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. I'll close the issue in that case :)</p>
