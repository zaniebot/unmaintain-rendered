# Add `uv` / `uv_build` to the Python Packaging User Guide

---

_@johnthagen_

`uv` and `uv_build` are not mentioned in the Python Packaging User Guide. For example at:

- https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#declaring-the-build-backend
- https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#license-and-license-files

It would be helpful if Astral contributed to that guide so that `uv`-related tools were highlighted.

I think that's roughly the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14672, and the PR at https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/pull/1880.
