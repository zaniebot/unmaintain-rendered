# Make UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR configurable in uv.toml

---

_Issue opened by @Vynce on 2024-10-14 19:41_

Please consider making `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR` and `UV_PYPY_INSTALL_MIRROR` configurable in the user-scoped `uv.toml` config file. I think this is a separate use case from the similar `pyproject.toml` request in #8166.

I have no problem with supporting this!

I mentioned this [somewhere else](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6970#issuecomment-2393096766), but this would be a good one for enterprises who may want to adopt `uv python install` (and derivative functionality that may happen in future e.g. #6970) in a way that complies with internal security policy/tooling.

With my issue #8166 I did not mean to specify it in exactly pyproject.toml, I am also fine if it can be specified somewhere else with the code :) 
So I also would support this !
