# Add metadata-only paths for editables

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-03-27 16:40_

We have a fast-path for getting _just_ the metadata of a source distribution (check `PKG-INFO`, check `pyproject.toml`, try `prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`, and then build the wheel if necessary). But for editables, we _always_ build them. Editables should run through the same process.
