# Move command examples out of concepts into command reference

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-01 20:13_

We should give a bunch of examples of how to use the command in the reference instead. I'm not sure how we'll deal with it needing to render nicely in the terminal _and_ the documentation website.
