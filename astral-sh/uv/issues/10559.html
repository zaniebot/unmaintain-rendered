            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is perhaps a naive question but I'm wondering why <code>uv.lock</code> would need to record the project's own version ?
This behavior is generating friction in projects that have a dynamic version number. I got bitten by it myself: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-pre-commit/issues/35
Any chance this could be relaxed somehow ?</p>
