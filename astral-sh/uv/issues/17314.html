            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It seems that trying to install torchvision as cpu only version from the index <code>https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu</code> is currently broken.</p>
<p>This is caused by the <a href="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torchvision/">PyTorch PyPi registry for torchvision</a>, that includes some patch versions of the wheels. There's an <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/9253">issue</a> for that already.</p>
<p>Here's a minimal <code>pyproject.toml</code> that replicates this for Linux:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;uv-torchvision&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;torchvision&gt;=0.2&quot;,
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name     = &quot;pytorch-cpu&quot;
url      = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu&quot;
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
torchvision = [{ index = &quot;pytorch-cpu&quot; }]
</code></pre>
<p>The error on <code>uv sync</code> is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~/dev/tmp/uv-torchvision main*​  ❯ uv sync
Using CPython 3.12.3 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python3.12
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 31 packages in 1.83s
error: Distribution <code>torchvision==0.24.1 @ registry+https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu</code> can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
hint: You're on Linux (<code>manylinux_2_39_x86_64</code>), but <code>torchvision</code> (v0.24.1) only has wheels for the following platforms: <code>manylinux_2_28_aarch64</code>, <code>macosx_11_0_arm64</code>; consider adding &quot;sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'x86_64'&quot; to <code>tool.uv.required-environments</code> to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A solution for me was to pin the version: <code>&quot;torchvision==0.24.1+cpu&quot;</code></p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux Mint 22 amd64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.9.21</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.12.3</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my case I was trying to install all CUDA versions, however the torchvision kept being installed using the CPU-version that did work well with <code>transformers</code>. What I ended up doing is <code>UV_TORCH_BACKEND=cu130 uv add torch torchvision</code>.</p>
