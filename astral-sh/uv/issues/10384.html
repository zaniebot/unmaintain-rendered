            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, the uv resolver thread spends a considerable amount of time in <code>on_progress</code> -&gt; <code>indicatif::style::ProgressStyle::format_state</code>. We should limit rendering progress bar updates to at most 1/60s, ideally directly in indicatif.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To understand the issue: Currently, there is a call to <code>set_message</code> for each resolved package. If there are a lot of packages, we could end up calling <code>set_message</code> more than 60 times a second, slowing down the process. There is no benefit to display each resolved package, since the user can't process that information that quickly.</p>
<p>From what I understand, <code>indicatif</code> already is limited to <a href="https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif/blob/6417492caa546a91ca6f69881d33141ddaf192c2/src/draw_target.rs#L41-L43">20 updates a second by default</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    /// Draw to a buffered stderr terminal at a max of 20 times a second.
    ///
    /// This is the default draw target for progress bars.  For more
    /// information see [`ProgressDrawTarget::term`].
    pub fn stderr() -&gt; Self {
        Self::term(Term::buffered_stderr(), 20)
    }
</code></pre>
<p>However, it appears that the rate limiter only applies to progress bar ticks and not changing the text message. A call to <code>.set_message()</code> will always end in a call to <code>.draw()</code>.</p>
<p>This would mean that <code>ResolverReporter</code> would need to implement a rate limiter itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, I think I was wrong.</p>
<p>There is a call to <code>rate_limiter.allow(now)</code> here: https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif/blob/main/src/draw_target.rs#L171</p>
<p>However, attempting to change the rate here did not show different profiles:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/68adadf806ffca48d1542a89766d642ef38aee9f/crates/uv/src/printer.rs#L20</p>
<p>I've changed this to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">Self::Default =&gt; ProgressDrawTarget::stderr_with_hz(1),
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">Self::Default =&gt; ProgressDrawTarget::stderr_with_hz(1000),
</code></pre>
<p>@konstin Can you help me how to debug the issue? The profiles running your above command have quite some variance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven't looked into it in depth so i can't really help with the code.</p>
<p>Usually, i try to optimize by e.g. counting how often the function was called myself or by inserting <code>dbg!</code>s. For making the profiles more stable, you can try setting a different cpu govenor, on linux <code>taskset</code> to pin the process to performance cores and adjusting the samply sampling rate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've added a simple counter to invocations of <code>set_message</code>. There are 7384 invocations (packages that are reported), of which 24 are allowed to be sent to stderr. With a default of 20Hz that sounds about right.</p>
<p>If I set the frequency to the highest value (255), I get ~70 allowed events, however lower values also end up around 24 events.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a burst mechanism in indicatif, which I haven't looked at yet.</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say that there is not a lot of potential here by optimising the <code>stderr_with_hz</code> setting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like most of the time is spent in rendering the message, it may be possible to skip or delay the rendering until we actually (this is only a guess from the profile though)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've run some benchmarks using hyperfine on the file above:</p>
<p>|               | 0.5.15   | 0.5.16   | local    | local (noop) |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|--------------|
| --show-output | 318.6 ms | 159.3 ms | 161.7 ms | 148.6 ms     |
| /dev/null     | 310.3 ms | 149.6 ms | 153.8 ms | 147.7 ms     |</p>
<p>What's most noticable is that there is a big jump from 0.5.15 to 0.5.16, and the latest release is just twice as fast.</p>
<p>The local-noop version does nothing on <code>on_progress</code> for the progress bar, so that should give us some indication what the overhead is. From this, it appears that there is about a 6ms overhead of using indicatif, even though the output is disabled. There is roughly similar penalty to actually render the output. (At least on my machine)</p>
<p>I've tried setting different values <code>stderr_with_hz</code>, and there is just no difference in the runtime. Higher refresh rates feel much snappier though.</p>
<p>I've also implemented a simple custom rate-limiter, that returns early in <code>on_progress</code>. It takes just shy of 150 ms using 50Hz, and ~151 using 100Hz. I guess we could shave off most of the overhead of indicatif.</p>
