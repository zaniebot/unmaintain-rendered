            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you&#x27;ll permit me to, I would like to jump in here with a suggestion.</p>
<p>I would <strong>like</strong> to think of <code>poetry run</code> as meaning &quot;please act exactly like the shell I am used to, but in addition with the Python venv activated.&quot;</p>
<p>First of all, I think this is by far the most intuitive CLI experience. Second, it would also be consistent with the user experience of<code>source .venv/bin/activate</code></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately</em>, poetry doesn&#x27;t do this: it doesn&#x27;t use my current shell (either the login <code>$SHELL</code> or the one that I am currently using), and it necessarily also doesn&#x27;t offer any of the aliases I have set up! (Super inconvenient.)</p>
<p>For this reason I actually have my own CLI tool to fix this. Extracting the relevant code, it basically looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def run(commands: list[str]):  # e.g. running `mytool run foo bar` on the CLI will produce `commands = [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;]`
    shell_path = os.environ.get(&quot;SHELL&quot;, &quot;/bin/sh&quot;)
    shell_name = pathlib.Path(shell_path).stem
    command, *args = commands
    if shell_name in {&quot;sh&quot;, &quot;bash&quot;, &quot;zsh&quot;}:
        # This `&amp;&amp; echo` is quite a subtle point.
        #
        # bash and zsh have some optimizations (and different optimizations to each other!) in which if they detect that
        # you&#x27;re running something sufficiently simple, then they will skip creating a subshell and directly execute the
        # provided command. (Here&#x27;s a reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56620122)
        #
        # In practice the speed difference is going to be small, and this optimization sometimes makes our `bash`
        # instance below (created in `subprocess.run`) visible to the end user. That is, their preferred shell might
        # *not* be the PPID of the command they run, if that shell optimizes itself out!
        #
        # We would prefer that this not happen: things occuring inside `mytool run` should feel the same as if you were
        # on your existing command line.
        command = command + &#x27; &quot;$@&quot; &amp;&amp; echo&#x27;
    elif shell_name == &quot;fish&quot;:
        command = command + &quot; $argv&quot;
    else:
        raise Exception(f&quot;Unsupported shell {shell_name} at {shell_path}&quot;)
    process = subprocess.run(
        [
            &quot;bash&quot;,
            &quot;-c&quot;,
            &#x27;source &quot;$1&quot; &amp;&amp; shift &amp;&amp; &quot;$@&quot;&#x27;,
            &quot;--&quot;,
            f&quot;{_get_venv_path()}/bin/activate&quot;,
            shell_path,
            &quot;-c&quot;,
            command,
            &quot;--&quot;,
            *args,
        ],
        cwd=pathlib.Path.cwd(),
        check=False,
    )
    sys.exit(process.returncode)
</code></pre>
<p>I expect that probably still takes a bit of work to get portable across Windows, non-{zsh,bash,fish} shells, etc, but you see the essence of it.</p>
<p>This is now much more useful. For example, this means that I can now easily start my <code>$EDITOR</code> inside the correct venv, which is what is needed for the LSP to operate correctly.</p>
<p>Do you think it would make sense for <code>uv run</code> to operate under this model instead?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@patrick-kidger That aligns with your statement here <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1910">astral-sh/uv#1910</a>#issuecomment-2060719717. What I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it simplies implementation to do this on <code>uv run</code> or <code>uv shell</code> either way. One can argue <code>uv shell</code> is an alias to <code>uv run $SHELL</code> from this perspective and you&#x27;d end up spawning a new shell, and having to do the same level of plumbing <code>uv shell</code> would need.</p>

<p>Which bit would be tricky -- the handling of shells that aren&#x27;t on the blessed list?</p>
<p>IIUC this is already a limitation of <code>uv</code> when <code>activate</code>ing -- c.f. the need for a separate <code>activate.fish</code> -- so I don&#x27;t think this would impose any new restriction on compatibility.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am expecting <code>uv run</code> to work more like <code>conda run</code>, just as what @patrick-kidger describes:</p>

<p>The ability to use aliases does not matter much to me.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>uv run</code> forcibly requires <code>pyproject.toml</code> to exist:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv run ls
warning: `uv run` is experimental and may change without warning.
error: No `pyproject.toml` found in current directory or any parent directory
</code></pre>
<p>Where I have a <code>.venv</code> folder in the same directory, and <code>uv pip install</code> just works. It is very counter-intuitive that a <code>pyproject.toml</code> is required to run <code>uv run</code>: I want to run command as in the specified venv, why do I need a project for it?</p>
<p>E.g. A virtual env may be created for a collection of user-wide terminal cli binaries, and I want to use <code>uv run</code> in the folder containing <code>.venv</code> to manage in the venv. Here the concept of <code>project</code> is naturally absent.</p>

<p>Not speaking to what we&#x27;ll eventually ship here, but just to be clear, <code>uv run</code> isn&#x27;t intended to be used with <code>uv pip install</code>. It&#x27;s part of a totally distinct set of APIs that are actively being worked on, and those APIs are <em>all</em> oriented around the concept of a project and workspace. In that context, it is a lot more intuitive that a project is required -- <em>none</em> of the APIs make sense outside of a project.</p>
<p>The initial thinking behind this issue was that we might want to provide something that&#x27;s separate from that project API, to let users run a command in an existing virtual environment without activating it. Conceptually, that could be thought of as <code>uv venv run</code> or something, though I&#x27;m not actually proposing that as the API.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To be clear, I <em>do</em> actually think we should have some form of <code>uv run</code> that works with the <code>uv pip</code> APIs (I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a flag, or a separate command, or just ignoring the project if there&#x27;s no <code>pyproject.toml</code>), but <code>uv run</code> itself in its current form is not intended to be used alongside the <code>uv pip</code> APIs, which is where that confusion is coming from.</p>

<p>So, now we have following venv managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>conda: <code>conda run</code></li>
<li>pyenv: <code>pyenv exec</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">nvm</a> (nodejs): <code>nvm run</code> / <code>nvm exec</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/go-nv/goenv">goenv</a> (golang): <code>goenv exec</code></li>
</ul>
<p>They&#x27;re all capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install specified version of python/nodejs/go</li>
<li>Have first-class <code>run</code>/<code>exec</code> that runs a command in specified environment without requirement for a project</li>
</ul>
<p>And here we have <code>poetry</code> and <code>uv</code> where they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can only work with a pre-existing installation of python</li>
<li>Requires a project to use <code>run</code> command</li>
</ul>
<p>For people who thought <code>uv</code> to be a venv manager analog to <code>conda</code>, <code>pyenv</code>, <code>nvm</code> and <code>goenv</code>, now they should actually regard <code>uv</code> as alternative for <code>poetry</code> as project manager and shall not expect a first-class <code>run</code> command that works like all above venv managers?</p>

<p>No, this isn&#x27;t quite the right framing. We plan to support <em>both</em> workflows -- that&#x27;s why we shipped <code>uv venv</code> and <code>uv pip</code>. <code>uv</code> will be capable of installing specified versions of Python, and we&#x27;ll probably also add a first-class <code>run</code> or <code>exec</code> command that works with an existing environment without <em>managing</em> it. You&#x27;ll have all the tools you need to install Python, manage Python versions, create virtual environments, manipulate them, etc., just as you would with <code>virtualenv</code>, <code>pip</code>, <code>pyenv</code>, etc. You can and will be able to use <code>uv</code> as an alternative to those other tools you mentioned.</p>
<p>Separately, though, we want to ship higher-level APIs (at a similar level of abstraction to Poetry) with a more opinionated interface, for users and projects that don&#x27;t want to operate at that low-level of environment management. The existing <code>uv run</code> was implemented as part of that API. So if we want a first-class <code>run</code> or <code>exec</code> command to execute in an environment without a project (i.e., as an alternative to <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code>), that&#x27;s totally fine, I&#x27;m just explaining that the existing <code>uv run</code> (which is genuinely work-in-progress) was not intended for that use-case.</p>

<p>That is what I initially thought <code>uv</code> would be and why opt-in it. By comparing the behavior of <code>run</code> in <code>conda</code> and <code>poetry</code>, I was trying to model the user&#x27;s expectation towards a manager, because <code>uv run</code> is a top-level command. Unlike <code>uv venv run</code>, the behavior of <code>uv run</code> may impose a stronger implication of what this tool focuses.</p>
<p>Personally I think <code>uv run</code> can work in both scope (project or venv).</p>
<ul>
<li>It can accept a venv folder to run in a specified environment.</li>
<li>When executing without venv, it may keep the current behavior to search for a python project and works the project way (<code>--strict</code> or <code>isolated</code> can apply).</li>
<li>Or furthermore, if no <code>pyproject.toml</code> found but <code>.venv</code> folder exists in current directory, use it as specified venv, just like <code>uv pip</code> does.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I appreciate the conversation, but could you describe the behavior you&#x27;re looking for in a separate issue please? This issue is supposed to be focused quite narrowly on a <code>uv run</code> mode in which commands that are not in the environment are not allowed.</p>
<p>For what it&#x27;s worth: I think you&#x27;re suggesting things that we&#x27;re already planning on doing (and have done previously), but, as Charlie mentioned, <code>uv run</code> is in the middle of being built and is changing all the time as we explore the best way to implement things.</p>
