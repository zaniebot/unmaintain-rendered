<p><em>Originally posted by @samypr100 in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16473#discussion_r2515864179</em></p>
<p>Goal is to use the same filter as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/63ab24776566bb76d68751e2ee5180b6cec34090/crates/uv/src/settings.rs#L107, but for <code>SSL_CERT_FILE</code>.</p>

<p>Hey! Just as an FYI, there's an open PR that's already linked to this issue. It just needs one additional approval, and then it will likely be merged shortly after.</p>
<p>I would recommend looking for another issue without an open PR linked to it.</p>
