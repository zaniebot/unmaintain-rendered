# Refine `puffin sync` output format

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-08 20:51_

I like Bun's output, as an example:

<img width="1788" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-08 at 4 51 07 PM" src="https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/assets/1309177/aec62674-3b30-423c-aeb1-5f50650a85b7">

They show a loading spinner while installing, then show a summary of the resolved versions for the first-party packages at the end.

Personally i'm a fan of minimal output by default, e.g. only a progress bar (which shows the names of the processed packages like cargo) and a summary the end ("Installed 90 packages in the 6s"), or a line for each package we install and a summary at the end for none-tty. One `-v` should still give pretty output, `-vv` activate tracing backend like logging.

I think I'm gonna try a progress bar for the various stages, and then outputting a summary at the end.
