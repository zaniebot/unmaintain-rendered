# `uv self update` may leave uv unusable if interrupted

---

_Issue opened by @qin-tain on 2025-02-02 04:35_

### Description:

The current update process renames `uv.exe`  during the update. If the update is interrupted (for example, due to network failures or manual termination), it may leave the system in a broken state.

### Suggested Improvement:

Ensure atomic replacement where uv.exe is only modified after the new version is fully validated. The original executable must persist until the update is confirmed successful.
