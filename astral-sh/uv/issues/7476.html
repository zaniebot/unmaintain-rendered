            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Have <code>uv export</code> support exporting only the requirements listed in an extra, without package dependencies or dev dependencies.</p>
Use Case
<p>For CI, it&#x27;s common to have a separate job which only does some lint checks or something similar, where the package itself and dependencies are not required. With poetry, I&#x27;d do something like</p>
<pre><code>[tool.poetry.group.lint.dependencies]
pycln = &quot;^2.1.3&quot;
ruff = &quot;^0.4.8&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and then</p>
<pre><code>poetry export --only lint --output lint-requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>and then in CI just pip install from this <code>lint-requirements.txt</code> file. This significantly speeds up setting up the CI environment for these checks.</p>
Feature suggestion
<p>add an option to <code>uv export</code> called <code>--only-extra &lt;extra&gt;</code> or something similar, which only resolves the dependencies listed under the passed extra.</p>
<p><code>uv export --no-emit-project</code> prevents the current project from being emitted as a dep, but the current project&#x27;s dependencies still are. <code>--only-dev</code> added in #7367 is very close to this, but unless there is a way to group dev dependencies that I&#x27;m unaware of it still doesn&#x27;t fully support what I&#x27;m requesting here (ie <code>pytest</code> is in the dev dependencies but not required for just running <code>ruff</code>)</p>
<p>This is a pretty niche use case, and doesn&#x27;t actually restrict functionality (only slightly less CI time wasted).</p>
potential workarounds
<p>I haven&#x27;t yet tried the <code>--only-dev</code> option from #7367 since the latest release at time of writing is <code>0.4.10</code>, but it may be possible to have dev dependencies be empty, and just have those deps be in extras called <code>dev-test</code> and <code>dev-lint</code> or something, and use <code>--only-dev</code> in combination with <code>--extra dev-lint</code></p>
