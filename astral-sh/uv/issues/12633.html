            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When i run the following commands in zsh i would expect to be able to import my lib package while running the python interpreter in my project .venv., however i get an importError.   Perhaps i am doing something wrong.  Because of this, i am unable to use UV to support python monorepos.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir projects
mkdir shared
cd projects
uv init project
cd ../shared
uv init lib
cd ../projects
cd project
 uv add --editable ../../shared/lib
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
python
import lib 
</code></pre>
<h3>Platform</h3>

<h3>Version</h3>

<h3>Python version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It appears that using the --lib flag forces me to have src/project under projects/project, and I can't modify this as the dependencies are (secretly, not declaratively in the pyproject.toml) linked this way.</p>
<p>I feel like this is going to make managing a monorepo really cumbersome.  Shouldn't i be able to simply declare a folder to be used as a package?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't fully understand the layout of your project, but yes, what you're describing should be possible. You just need to configure the build backend for each of those packages (e.g., <code>hatchling</code>) to point to that directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>alright, sounds like i just need to get more educated then.  I'll do some research.  Thanks for your help Charlie!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm almost finished with my setup, but it doesn't appear that the --lib option is configurable in the pyproject.toml.  This makes it impossible for me to use an existing pyproject.toml to create a usable environment with 'uv sync'.  Is this something I also need to configure via hatch?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--lib</code> just creates a project layout. It's not a persistent setting. You should be able to have a usable environment with an existing <code>pyproject.toml</code>. Perhaps you can use the output of <code>uv init --lib</code> as an example? If your goal is still to have a flat structure (i.e., no <code>src/</code> directory), then yeah — you need to configure your build backend (hatchling, I presume).</p>
