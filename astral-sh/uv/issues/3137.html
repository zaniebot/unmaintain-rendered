            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When specifying <code>unsafe-any-match</code>. I'd expect to find the latest version of a package from all indices. However, when using the pytorch index, which has an ancient version of certifi for some reason, uv finds that instead of the recent version from pypi.</p>
<p>This causes SSL certificates to be two years out of date whenever the torch index is used.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there could be an <code>unsafer-any-match</code>, that allows newer pypi packages to override packages from an index.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've enforced a lower bound on certifi, but certifi isn't the only package this is happening to. The following packages are affected in one of my dependency sets:</p>
<p>| pkg | unsafe-any-match | unsafe-highest |
| ---- | ---- | ----|
| certifi | 2022.12.7 | 2024.2.2 |
| charset-normalizer | 2.1.1 | 3.3.2 |
| filelock | 3.9.0 | 3.13.4 |
| idna | 3.4 | 3.7 |
| jinja2 | 3.1.2 | 3.1.3 |
| markupsafe | 2.1.3 | 2.1.5 |
| networkx | 3.2.1 | 3.3 |
| numpy | 1.26.3 | 1.26.4 |
| packaging | 22.0 | 24.0 |
| pillow | 10.2.0 | 10.3.0 |
| tqdm | 4.64.1 | 4.66.2 |
| typing-extensions | 4.8.0 | 4.11.0 |</p>
<p>I don't think torch should be publishing these, but it would be good if we had a way to mirror pip's behaviour here.</p>
