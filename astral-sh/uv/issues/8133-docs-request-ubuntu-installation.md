# Docs request: Ubuntu installation

---

_@jamesbraza_

With `uv==0.4.20` on https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/, there is no Ubuntu OS set up guide.

It would be nice to add one for Ubuntu (and doubly nice if there is an `apt` package for `uv`)

Have you tried this, as given in the docs for Linux/MacOS?
`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

Wow I think visually I saw MacOS and then blurred out the "Linux" part lol

It would be good to give Linux its own tab to be more clear
