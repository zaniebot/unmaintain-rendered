# Support workspaces in `uv version`

---

_Issue opened by @AsafMah on 2025-05-20 04:58_

### Summary

Currently (as of version 0.7.6) the `uv version` command does not support workspaces.

Meaning, that unlike most commands, it doesn't include the `package` and `all_packages` flags.
I think that it should, for consistency.

Furthermore, it would be nice to not have to re-specify the version on every project on the monorepo, and have them all automatically be synced to the root version.

This is mostly fixed by the current version of #13317, although `--all-packages` isn't included (`uv add` and `uv remove` don't have that flag, although it's more plausible for `uv version`).
