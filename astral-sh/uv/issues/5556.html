Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>The fork of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async_zip"><code>async_zip</code> crate</a> that <code>uv</code> uses contains a file, <code>SPECIFICATION.md</code>, with a proprietary license that does not allow redistribution. This is potentially an issue on its own, and it is also a challenge for downstream packaging because an archive of a snapshot of the git repository cannot be included in a source package until the file is filtered out.</p>
<p>This was reported upstream as https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip/issues/146 and fixed in https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip/commit/2d841d600c6d509cb4ecc611001ec339876ca6c9. (There hasn’t been a release since then, so the file is still present in the published <code>async_zip</code> crates, version 0.0.17 and earlier.)</p>
<p>Please consider fixing this by pulling https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip/commit/2d841d600c6d509cb4ecc611001ec339876ca6c9 into the fork https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip and then updating the git hash in <code>uv</code>’s <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
