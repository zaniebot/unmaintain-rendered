# Warn when using `uv` with an incompatible Python version.

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-03-21 12:57_

`uv` only supports Python 3.8 or newer. However, that's not very obvious from our documentation (you need to scroll all the way down to platform support) and some or even most functionality works fine, even when using `uv` with a Python version older than 3.8, e.g. the Python discovery works fine and uv only fails to run scripts (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2445).

`uv` should print a warning message when creating a virtual env or installing into a global Python environment when Python is older than 3.8 to make users aware that their platform isn't officially supported.

In our defense, it's also at the very top of the repo:

FYI, everything except Windows scripts seems to work fine with 3.7. I'm guessing I should be skipping 3.7 too then in https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/pull/1590. Edit: Oh, if it's only a warning, probably okay.
