# New test failure in 0.9.17: uv-resolver exclude_newer::tests::test_exclude_newer_timestamp_absolute

_Issue opened by @musicinmybrain on 2025-12-10 13:27_

### Summary

Working on Fedora 43:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git
$ cd uv
$ cargo nextest run -p uv-resolver --lib
[…]
        FAIL [   0.006s] uv-resolver exclude_newer::tests::test_exclude_newer_timestamp_absolute
  stdout ───

    running 1 test
    test exclude_newer::tests::test_exclude_newer_timestamp_absolute ... FAILED

    failures:

    failures:
        exclude_newer::tests::test_exclude_newer_timestamp_absolute

    test result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 32 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
    
  stderr ───

    thread 'exclude_newer::tests::test_exclude_newer_timestamp_absolute' (4084122) panicked at crates/uv-resolver/src/exclude_newer.rs:657:9:
    assertion failed: timestamp.to_string().contains("2023-06-16")
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

  Cancelling due to test failure: 15 tests still running
[…]
```

In case it matters, my system timezone is GMT.

I added some debugging output to the test and determined that the value of `timestamp` is `"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"` for the RFC 3339 test and `"2023-06-15T23:00:00Z"` for the local time test.
