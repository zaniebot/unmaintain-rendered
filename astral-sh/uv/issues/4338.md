# Support enabling the `--system` flag via an env var?

---

_Issue opened by @hoechenberger on 2024-06-15 06:45_

Hello, I'm using `uv` in a dev container with a global Python installation (no venv) to keep complexity low. Now, I naturally need to pass the `--system` flag to `uv pip install`. I was wondering if you'd consider adding support for switching this flag on / off via an environment variable (which I could then bake into the container). This would make things a little easier for the users of the container.

Hi! This is already supported via `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` ([docs](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables)).
