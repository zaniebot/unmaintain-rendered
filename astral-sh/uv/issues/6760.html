<p>Here the package metadata may be at fault (<a href="https://github.com/quantile-development/dagster-ext/issues/12">quantile-development/dagster-ext#12</a>), but both pypa/build and Poetry are able to build the project without any issues (even if with missing metadata).</p>

<p>Technically, I think it&#x27;s a violation of the specification to exclude the <code>name</code> field when a <code>[project]</code> table exists.</p>
<p>From the relevant <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#declaring-project-metadata-the-project-table">document</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lack of a [project] table implicitly means the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Build-Backend">build backend</a> will dynamically provide all keys.</p>
<p>The only keys required to be statically defined are: ... <code>name</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe the problem is that we see a <code>[project]</code> table so we attempt to extract <em>static</em> metadata from the project without calling into a build backend. I guess the argument here is that <code>[project.urls]</code> doesn&#x27;t explicitly define a <code>[project]</code> table? That seems weird though.</p>
<p>I see a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>We fallback to dynamic metadata retrieval with the build-backend if the static metadata retrieval fails</li>
<li>We special-case implicit <code>[project]</code> table declarations</li>
<li>We continue to be strict here and pursue a clarification in the specification</li>
</ol>

<p>If there&#x27;s a <code>project</code> table, the <code>project.name</code> field must be present, but the <code>project</code> table is not required to be present.
If a <code>project</code> table is not present, it means the project is not using PEP 621 metadata, which is perfectly valid.</p>
<p>In this case, it seems the project was mixing the <code>project</code> (PEP 621) and <code>tool.poetry</code> tables when specifying the metadata, which shouldn&#x27;t really be allowed. I consider this a bug in the build backend.</p>
<p>With this in mind, UV&#x27;s behavior is correct, however, to achieve better compatibility, I would suggest issuing a warning instead of erroring out in such scenarios.</p>
<p>PS: Feel free to ping me if you have any more issues, or questions, regarding the project metadata, and other issues regarding packaging.</p>

<p>I agree, though I wonder if it&#x27;s worth reporting to the Poetry folks, specially since <a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/708">python-poetry/poetry-core#708</a> is just waiting to be released, and the frontend is WIP (<a href="https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/9135">python-poetry/poetry#9135</a>).</p>
