# uv makes python fun again!

Please just close this when you read it... I'm not sure where else to put it.

uv is making python fun again where it has been frustrating. I'm not a package maintainer, I'm "just" an app developer. I don't need comprehensive (.. or many) tests, I don't need to test across many versions.

I've taken a very simple approach that is delightful:
- shell script in the root of the project
- it initializes a .venv python environment if needed, installing uv and the initial requirements_all.txt
- it pip compiles requirements_all.txt from pyproject.toml if needed using uv
- it pip syncs from requirements_all.txt into .venv if needed
- it then runs whatever command you want in the .venv (like poetry run, pipenv run, etc)

The fact that uv is *so*fast* just makes this delightful -
- You can rapidly add/remove packages to experiment with ease. I delete .venv and re-create it for fun.
- I can easily manage the .venv virtual environments and space consumption.
