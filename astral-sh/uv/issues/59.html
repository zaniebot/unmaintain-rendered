            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now, these steps are all parallelized to some degree, but the phases themselves are sequential. So, e.g., we don’t start unzipping (the slowest step) until we’ve downloaded everything.</p>
<p>We could instead use channels to ensure that we can schedule all work efficiently across the phases.</p>
<p>This would be a little more complex and makes debugging and logging harder (or more confusing). And it also may not have a significant impact, since the largest wheels are gonna be the bottleneck in each step anyway. (Actually, I think the bottleneck is largest file in any given wheel, like Ruff, which just has one huge executable.) But it’s worth a try.</p>
