            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you run the uv with the <code>--verbose</code> flag? I can successfully build the package on macOS although the build process is very slow (~7minutes) since everything gets compiled from source</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👋 SpaCy does not provide builds for 3.14 yet from what I can see in https://pypi.org/project/spacy/#files -- notice only cp13 and below are only available. In such cases, uv will attempt to build it for you from source but you will need an adequate environment  to build SpaCy from source successfully which in some cases may work or fail depending on the system configuration SpaCy expects. I would ask in SpaCy's issue tracker to see if there's reported issues, or consult on how to build in 3.14.</p>
<p>At a quick glance, I did notice there are some reported issues with building from source for 3.14 in this issue https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/13885</p>
