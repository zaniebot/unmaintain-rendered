# How to run `uv venv` if latest `virtualenv` is unavailable?

---

_Issue opened by @yury-fedotov on 2025-07-22 04:01_

### Question

## Context

- I now work in a corporate setup where not PyPI directly but its "pre-approved" private mirror acts a package index. We have configured it for `uv`, the lockfile is pointing to that index, so all good.
- Yesterday, [`virtualenv` released version 20.32.0](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/releases/tag/20.32.0), which is not yet approved in this private mirror.
- This now prevents us from running `uv venv`,until that new version of `virtualenv` is approved, because it seems like `uv venv` tries to fetch the latest version of `virtualenv` under the hood? Our CI errors out on 403 forbidden error indicating that it requested a Python package that's not available in this index, `virtualenv` in this case.

## Question

1. Does `uv` leverage `virtualenv` under the hood and tries to pull its latest version to do `uv venv`?
2. Do you have a workaround for the issue in mind? I checked available CLI flags for `uv venv`, but none seemed suitable for that issue.

### Platform

`ubuntu-latest` GitHub Actions VM

### Version

Perhaps the latest - the one that `setup-uv@v5` provides without explicit arguments

No, we don't use `virtualenv`. We have a native implementation of virtual environment creation.

Can you share the command and some verbose logs or something?

Closing as I resolved this. It was not an issue on the `uv` side, and not at `uv venv` step. I just incorrectly inferred it from the logs.

The issue was in the next step, where we `uv pip install`ed some packages, one of which did not define upper boundary for `virtualenv`. And latest version of `virtualenv` was quarantined at this private package artifactory.

So everything correct on the `uv` side. Thanks for your reply!
