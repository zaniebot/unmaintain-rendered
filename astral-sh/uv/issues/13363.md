# uv sync with multiple --package flags

_Issue opened by @heiner on 2025-05-09 08:52_

### Summary

At the moment (uv 0.7.3), adding `--package` to `uv sync` multiple times results in

```
error: the argument '--package <PACKAGE>' cannot be used multiple times
```

In the context of my work environment we have a fairly large workspace and for some interactive usecases feel the need to sync more than one package. We can do that with multiple `--inexact` calls to `uv sync`, but given that `--all-packages` exists, I wonder if adding support for syncing multiple, but not all, packages would make sense. There's precedence in e.g. `--reinstall-package`, although how `--group` and `--extra` gets interpreted in this case might need clarification. 

### Example

```
uv sync --package pkg1 --extra p1e1 --extra p1e2 --package pkg2 --extra p2e1 --group p2g1
```

Would be roughly equivalent to

```
uv sync --package pkg1 --extra p1e1 --extra p1e2
uv sync --inexact --package pkg2 --extra p2e1 --group p2g1
```

👍 I think this can be combined with https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12130.
