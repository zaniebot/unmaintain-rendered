# python broken in venv when uv project is on fusefs mount point

---

_Issue opened by @mbeijen on 2025-08-26 12:31_

### Summary

I wanted to mount my project directory in a VM over fuse.sshfs. When I ran 'uv sync' inside the VM, `uv` tried to download python and symlink it into the venv on the fuse mount, which failed and resulted in a broken `python`. Even if I use `--link-mode copy` this does not result in a working system.

## how to reproduce
use `uv` on my host laptop to create a new project:

    uv init --app --python=3.13 multi-issue

create VM using multipass, mount the project directory in it, install uv and use it to sync

    multipass launch 24.04 --name multivm
    multipass mount $PWD/multi-issue multivm:/home/ubuntu/multi-issue
    multipass shell multivm
    # inside VM
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    cd multi-issue/
    ~/.local/bin/uv sync 

at this point, there is a `.venv` in my project, but `.venv/bin/python` is owned by nobody and is not a file and I can't execute it:

```
ubuntu@multivm:~/multi-issue$ ls -altrh .venv/bin/

```

If I copy the `pyproject.toml` to a different location in my vm, (i.e. not on the fuse mount) and run `uv sync` everything works just fine.

### Expected behaviour
I would have expected `uv` to be able to create a working setup, or at least that using `--link-mode copy` would copy the interpreter, and result in a working system.

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Linux 6.14.0-28-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux)

### Version

uv 0.8.13

### Python version

Python 3.13.5

To clarify: the link mode is used for package installs, the Python interpreter is not copied into virtual environments on Unix.  What you'd need is for the entire Python installation to be copied into the virtual environment at which point it's no longer really a virtual environment.

You should skip mounting the virtual environment, e.g., as described in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#developing-in-a-container

I understand a local `.venv` on the host would potentially be invalid inside the guest. However in this case I did not create a `.venv` on the host environment. It did not exist before. I created it inside the guest, indeed it's on a fusefs filesystem. 

I would have expected that `uv` would be able to copy python into its created `.venv` in this case, and not to create these files owned by `nobody`.

(also, it's not possible to mount the project file while *excluding* `.venv` in multipass... of course that is not `uv`s fault.)

I see. I think you need to set the `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` to be inside your fusefs too. 

It's interesting it lets us construct the symlinks but not read them later.

> I see. I think you need to set the `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` to be inside your fusefs too.

Even if I set `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`, which definitely causes my python to be stored on the fusefs, uv still fails:

```
ubuntu@multivm:~$ export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/home/ubuntu/multi-issue/.python
ubuntu@multivm:~$ cd multi-issue/
ubuntu@multivm2:~/multi-issue$ uv sync
Using CPython 3.13.7
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 1 package in 4ms
Audited in 0.00ms
``` 

the python interpreter is inside my fuse mount and ~~looks just fine~~ the symlinks there already have a problem:

```
ubuntu@multivm:~/multi-issue$ ls -altrh .python/cpython-3.13.7-linux-x86_64-gnu/bin/
total 29M
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nobody nogroup   17 Aug 26 16:25 python3-config -> python3.13-config

drwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu    14 Aug 26 16:25 .
drwxrwxr-x 1 ubuntu ubuntu     6 Aug 26 16:25 ..
```

And apparently this is a feature of sshfs. I was able to resolve my issues by switching to a different mount type:

    multipass mount --type=native $PWD/multi-issue multivm:/home/ubuntu/multi-issue


> It's interesting it lets us construct the symlinks but not read them later.

Yeah, that's right 🙃 

Also, I'm not sure at this point if I'd expect anything from uv -- I guess it's not really possible to do anything about this, on linux file systems its notoriously difficult to understand if they properly support symlinks afaik
