# Different `uv pip compile --python-platform` behavior between Homebrew-installed and python-installed versions

---

_Issue opened by @kukushechkin on 2024-12-02 12:44_

It looks like python-installed `uv` does not respect the `--python-platform`.

The package `pyqir==0.10.6` has [3 wheels](https://pypi.org/project/pyqir/#files):
- pyqir-0.10.6-cp38-abi3-win_amd64.whl 
- pyqir-0.10.6-cp38-abi3-manylinux_2_31_x86_64.whl
- pyqir-0.10.6-cp38-abi3-macosx_10_12_x86_64.macosx_11_0_arm64.macosx_10_12_universal2.whl

Now trying to run `pip compile` for the specific `linux` on arm64 macOS with differently installed `uv`:
```
➜ echo "pyqir==0.10.6" > some_req.in

➜ brew install uv
➜ uv --version
uv 0.5.5 (Homebrew 2024-11-27)
➜ uv pip compile --python-platform=x86_64-manylinux_2_31 some_req.in
Resolved 1 package in 663ms
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile some_req.in
pyqir==0.10.6
    # via -r some_req.in

➜ uv pip install uv==0.5.5
➜ python -m uv --version
uv 0.5.5 (95cd8b8b3 2024-11-27)
➜ python -m uv pip compile --python-platform=x86_64-manylinux_2_31 some_req.in
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because pyqir==0.10.6 has no wheels with a matching platform tag and you require pyqir==0.10.6, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

I believe this is a duplicate of #9521 and is fixed on main.
