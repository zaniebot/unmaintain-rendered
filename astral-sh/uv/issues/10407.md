# Documentation seams to be out of date: "Using uv with Jupyter"

---

_Issue opened by @OlafEichstaedt on 2025-01-08 19:28_

For non-Project environments, the documentation 

[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#using-jupyter-as-a-standalone-tool]

suggests to run the following:

> uv venv --seed
> uv pip install jupyterlab
> .venv/bin/jupyter lab

This did not work for me as no "bin" folder was created.

To create an evironment "default" for my notebooks, I ran

> uv venv default --seed
> default\Scripts\activate
> uv pip install jupyterlab
> uv run jupyter lab

instead. 

The envrionment contains the following folders: ".ipynb_checkpoints", "etc", "Lib", "Scripts", "share".

I am using 

- uv  0.5.15 (eb6ad9a4f 2025-01-06)
- WIndows 11 Pro 10.0.22631 Build 22631

This is correct — you’re just on Windows, and you created an environment named “default”. We can update the docs to show separate instructions for Windows.
