# Incorrect error message when installing Python on armv7l

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-12-21 21:46_

> Looks like the [latest release in `astral-sh/python-build-standalone`](https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20250828) includes "dynamically linked aarch64 musl builds"! 🥳
> 
> Does this (and the fact that this issue is closed) mean that the following shouldn't happen?
> 
> ```
> bash-5.2$ uv self version
> uv 0.9.18
> bash-5.2$ uv python install 3.12
> error: uv does not yet provide musl Python distributions on aarch64.
> bash-5.2$ uname -a
> Linux OpenWrt 6.6.73 #0 SMP Mon Feb  3 23:09:37 2025 armv7l GNU/Linux
> bash-5.2$
> ```
> 
> Or is there another blocker to what I'm trying to do? (Install python via uv on openwrt running on a linksys wrt3200acm)

Opened a PR, please take a look. From what I can tell, we can now just remove the custom error handling block, as uv now **does** support musl distributions on aarch64. Let me know if I'm missing something :)
