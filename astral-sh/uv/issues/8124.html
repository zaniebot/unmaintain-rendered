            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My project includes multiple native C modules with a rather complicated build setup. Editable installs of my package don't work as expected:</p>
<p>When I run <code>uv build</code>, it ends up creating <code>./.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/my_package/</code> which contains lots of <code>.so</code> files, and it also creates a <code>./.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/_my_package.pth</code>. When I run my tests, the <code>.so</code> modules are not found because the <code>_my_package.pth</code> takes precedence and points to my source dir.</p>
<p>Using the <code>--no-editable</code> flag works around this, but I need to specify it every time I run a uv command, or else uv will re-sync and create an editable install.</p>
<p>It would be preferable to specify this in my <code>pyproject.toml</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
no-editable = true
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We probably want this to be an inherited setting, such that if it's set on the workspace, it's inherited by its members (but overridden by the CLI flag).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just came across this issue while deploying on Render. I used <code>uv export --no-editable &gt; requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Given I am deploying a Django app, I think I'd set this in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file as suggested in this fix. Would love to see this feature added.</p>
