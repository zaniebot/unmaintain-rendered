# Support for Lower Python version

---

_Issue opened by @learnwithsomya on 2025-02-11 09:37_

### Question

As per the docs, it has been tested against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. So, does it means that it cannot be used with the environment with Python version lower than that. Like Python 3.6?
Refer : https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/policies/platforms/

### Platform

Ubuntu 20.04

### Version

Latest

It means that we don't guarantee support for those versions and they may not work at all. I believe 3.7 mostly works. 3.6 might work too. We just don't guarantee it, or test against it, or commit to fixing issues affecting those versions.

Is there no way I can create an environment with python 3.7 with uv? I need to reproduce results from some old repo, which uses that version. `uv python list` starts from python>=3.8. @charliermarsh
