# Unexpected: uv lock --no-binary

---

_Issue opened by @dimaqq on 2025-04-24 04:19_

### Summary

`--no-binary` is documented as "don't install pre-build wheels".
However it's a build option.

`uv lock` accepts `--no-binary` flag, so I figured that it would not include arch-specific wheels into the lock file.

Nope, the resulting lock file is the same, whether `--no-binary` is used or not.

It's a bit of a foot gun.

Could the lock command perhaps reject the flags that don't have any effect?


### Platform

macos arm64, linux amd64

### Version

0.6.16, 0.6.14

### Python version

3.8, any

I think we should leave this as-is. We have a common set of arguments here that apply to all the project-level commands, and I don't think it's worth special-casing it for `uv lock`.
