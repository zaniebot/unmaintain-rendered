            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I love that we can now run scripts that define their dependencies in a top-level comment. A feature that would be even more &quot;fun&quot; is adding the ability to run a script from the clipboard.</p>
<p>I often see code snippets online etc. and they typically have a &quot;copy&quot; button added to it. I would love it if I could just run it without having to first create a file etc.</p>
<p>On Mac, I currently do <code>pbpaste | uv run python</code> and it does do the trick, but it would be even better if <code>uv</code> had some sort of flag so that I could just run <code>uv run --from-clipboard</code> or even an alias <code>uvc run</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the pipe is more appropriate here, I don't really want to own reading from the clipboard.</p>
<p>Do you know of other tools that support this?</p>
