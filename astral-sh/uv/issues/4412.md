# Do not reinstall if wheel name+versions match even if the filesystem path differs

See #4398 for the rest checking the current behavior and [these](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4396#issuecomment-2176741999) two [comments](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4396#issuecomment-2176749301).

I think it should not be silently ignored though, but rather show a message making it clear that nothing was done because the package with that version already exists (like pip does).

> > I don't think the path where the wheel file is located should matter - pip does not care about it, regardless of location it shows this message:
>
> *mypkg is already installed with the same version as the provided wheel. Use --force-reinstall to force an installation of the wheel.*

> one case where I think using the full path would be weird is when you have a cronjob or similar that downloads a "latest" wheel from some place (GH actions build or similar) to a temporary location, which might be a `/tmp/<randomname>/` folder, and then runs `uv pip install /tmp/<randomname>/*.whl`.
>
> In such a case I think the expected behavior would be to reinstall only if the version changed (or if the user uses a switch to force reinstalling)...
