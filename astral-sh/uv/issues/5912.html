<p>It's really noisy to see <code>example</code> (my own project) being reported as added and removed on every operation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I worry that's going to cause more confusion. Alternatively we could <em>not</em> reinstall the project in these cases and use a more specific cache key (e.g., the <code>pyproject.toml</code> content rather than the timestamp).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When do we include the project(s) in the output, then? I also want to improve this but I think it's fairly nuanced... If the answer is &quot;we never show it&quot;, what happens in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>First time you sync a project, and it has no dependencies (so we'd show nothing, even though we installed the project).</li>
<li>You do a strict sync with <code>--package</code>, and <em>want</em> to know which workspace members were added or removed.</li>
<li>You run with <code>--reinstall-package my-package</code>, and want visual confirmation that the package was reintalled.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also worry about showing it conditionally, since then users will be unsure when / if the project was reinstalled.</p>
<p>Would a better solution be to... rebuild and reinstall the project less often?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><ol>
<li>We should show installing the project if it was <em>not</em> installed</li>
<li>We should show adding and removing workspace members, but not reinstalling editable workspace members</li>
<li>Hm...</li>
</ol>
<p>I think as a starting point, we could improve the reinstall output so it only shows a single line then see how obtrusive it is?</p>
<p>Reducing the rebuilds and reinstalls seems complicated, I don't see how we can avoid a rebuild when the pyproject.toml changes, e.g., adding a dependency.</p>
