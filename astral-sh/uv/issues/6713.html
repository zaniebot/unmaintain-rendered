Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>I saw a twitter post mentioned by @charliermarsh where someone suggested using <code>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run</code> to run a script. Apparently, <code>env -S</code> is not portable, so I was looking around for other more portable options. This is what I have come to (suggested by Copilot):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/bin/sh
# fmt: off
'''exec' uv run -q &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
' '''
# fmt: on
</code></pre>
<p>The logic seems sound, and I added the <code>fmt: off</code> guard around it prevents <code>ruff</code> from auto-formatting it. It works on my macOS machine, but I haven't tested it yet on Linux. Assuming it does work, it seems like maybe it could be a workflow/tip that could be mentioned in the docs?</p>
<p>One part of the UX that could be improved is the use of <code>-q</code> to prevent <code>uv</code> from saying &quot;Reading inline script metadata from:&quot; I want to hide that so that it feels like I am just calling the script directly, but I would actually like it to have output the first time if it needs to download something (e.g. it has a dep on a large package that is not cached).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would also be interesting to see this combined with a tool that is able to take a python project and merge all of it into a single file (I'm pretty sure there was a <code>xonsh</code> related project that does something like that).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That should work on linux, this technique is already used in one odd corner, see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6489#issuecomment-2308550586</p>
