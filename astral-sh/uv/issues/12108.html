            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a CLI command that programatically launches &quot;uv tool run&quot; in a subprocess and then tries to terminate it when the process is terminated. When running in the terminal, CTRL-C works fine. When testing the command in CI/CD, there's no CTRL-C equivalent, so the command hangs forever.</p>
<p>I've run into the problem described into that comment myself and agree that it's very annoying that you can't tell the terminal not to send CTRL-C to subprocesses.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I run <code>marimo</code>, e.g. <code>marimo tutorial intro</code>, then I can stop it easily by typing ctrl+c twice quickly, once to initiate termination and another to not bother answering the subsequent <code>Are you sure you want to quit?

<p>However, if I run <code>uvx marimo tutorial intro</code> then the second cntl+c just hangs and I have to kill the <code>uv tool</code> process manually which I am guessing is related to this issue?</p>

<p>This seems like it might be a problem with <code>marimo</code>? Even if I do <code>kill -2 3116</code> it doesn't exit. I have to <code>kill -9</code> the marimo process. I don't see anything obvious in their code though https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/984af117b0ec03f8f314eb571b77182f0c17fe8a/marimo/_server/api/interrupt.py#L44-L75</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know. My best guess is that it's something like...</p>
<p>When you use marimo directly and press Ctrl-C, the shell sends a SIGINT to the process group. Marimo captures this, and when sent again, it exits.</p>
<p>When you use uv, the shell sends a SIGINT to the process group — uv ignores it since the shell has sent it to Marimo as part of the process group. When you press Ctrl-C again, the same thing happens — but uv sees this repeated attempt and forwards the SIGINT as well. Now, Marimo receives a <em>third</em> SIGINT which breaks its interrupt handler?</p>
<p>You can actually test this theory by bumping our SIGINT forwarding count...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's hard to say what we could do to improve this here, since there is an expectation that we <em>will</em> forward the signal eventually — otherwise it will never be received if the parent is not a shell.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I'm also running into issues with the current behavior. I'm building an interactive CLI that I'd like to run using uv run during development, but the way SIGINT is handled is causing problems.</p>
<p>Specifically, my CLI catches the first Ctrl+C and prompts the user to confirm they want to quit. Pressing Ctrl+C a second time is meant to force exit the app. However, when using uv run, the second SIGINT is duplicated, which causes the app to exit immediately without respecting the confirmation prompt.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any guidance or workaround, and would love to see more consistent signal forwarding in uv run for use cases like this. I considered having my application change it's process group on startup, but I'd ideally like to avoid hacking runner-specific logic into my application.</p>
<p>For my use case, I honestly prefer that uv didn't forward any signals that my application is already getting from the shell.</p>

<p>If they opt &quot;no&quot;, the next ctrl c won't prompt, it will just immediately exit. Additionally, several other normal interactions use ctrl+c. For example, I integrate readline reverse search (ctrl+r) in my cli, and to cancel reverse search ctrl+c is used.</p>

<p>What about checking the $SHELL env var? This might yield false negatives depending on the environment, but I feel like that is preferable over a false positive, and an improvement over the current behavior.</p>

<p>Thanks, that makes sense.</p>
<p>If we do not forward SIGINT when there is not a shell, the behavior is that you <em>cannot</em> kill the process with SIGINT, which is worse than sending it more than once imo.</p>

<p>Yeah I do agree with this. Which is why I said a false negative ($SHELL is not set even though you are actually in a shell) is preferable to the inverse. It's probably fairly safe to assume that $SHELL won't be set if you are not in a shell. Are there any known cases where this is not safe?</p>
<p>An alternate approach I considered mentioning was checking the parent process against known shells.</p>
<p>pstree of a uv run</p>

 | |   \-+= 14465 djcopley uv run -p 3.13 python -c import time; time.sleep(10)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please accept the commentary of this new <code>uv</code> user who thinks he has some insight.</p>
<p>I think the relevant factor is not &quot;there is a shell&quot;, but only has to do with process groups and the controlling terminal. There's also mention that the shell forwards SIGINT, when in fact it's the terminal driver that sends SIGINT to the foreground process group if ^C is pressed. &quot;foreground process group&quot; because there can be more than one process group attached to the terminal due to forking and job control, but only one process group gets terminal input at a time. (This is all kind of magic *ix kernel stuff that's been progressively refined since being introduced in Seventh Edition Unix in 1979 by Bell Labs, and refined in 4.2BSD in 1983).</p>
<p>I think this is where it starts to go somewhat awry:</p>
<pre><code> // ...If a signal is sent directly to the uv parent process 
 // (e.g., `kill -2 &lt;pid&gt;`), the process group is not involved and a signal is not sent to the 
 // child by default. In this context, uv must forward the signal to the child. We work around 
 // this by forwarding SIGINT if it is received more than once.
</code></pre>
<p>I don't think it's the job of <code>uv</code> to forward SIGINT. If something wanted to kill the entire process group, it should use the <code>killpg</code> syscall.</p>
<p>SIGINT (^C) is special because it's one of the keyboard interrupts sent to the foreground process group that's attached to a terminal, the others are SIGTSTP (^Z) and SIGQUIT (^). Sending a <em>programmatic</em> kill with SIGINT is unusual, and if some program wants to <em>simulate</em> the user pressing ^C, it should send to the whole process group like the terminal driver does, and then this workaround is not necessary.</p>
<p>Usually if some actor wants to <em>programatically</em> terminate a process, SIGTERM is the default.</p>
<p>It looks like <code>uv</code> heads up its own process group, which means that interactive programs it runs will get ^C/SIGINT automatically. I don't know if <code>uv</code> makes the new process group or if it's a feature of the shell, but that new process group is what makes ^C just SIGINT <code>uv</code> and the tools it's running, and not <em>everything</em> in the login session. The user presses ^C, <code>uv</code> and the processes in its process group get SIGINT, the shell notices that <code>uv</code> exited, and gives another prompt.</p>

<p>I think the relevant factor is not &quot;there is a shell&quot;, but only has to do with process groups and the controlling terminal. There's also mention that the shell forwards SIGINT, when in fact it's the terminal driver that sends SIGINT to the foreground process group if ^C is pressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a good clarification — I can update the documentation accordingly. I don't think there's really an implication here, just improper terminology, yes?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I may agree with you philosophically here, but this change was motivated by a real world use-case in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10952 and I think it is actually quite important that uv exits there.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree programmatic kills should send a SIGINT to the whole group. However, this workaround <em>is</em> necessary for the case above still.</p>
<p>We actually aren't getting complaints about the process group behavior, are you having real problems with that?</p>
