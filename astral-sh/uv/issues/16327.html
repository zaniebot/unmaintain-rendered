            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>One of the dependencies in the source, sub dependency of httpcore, h11 0.14.0 has a critical vulnerability.</p>
<p>Link to the CVE <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj</a></p>
<p>Issue has been patched in 0.16.0 so it might be worth considering bumping that if possible.</p>
<p>We have uncovered that during our regular security scan when building uv from source.</p>
<p>It seems the earliest version of httpcore that calls for h11&gt;=0.16.0 is 1.0.9 <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/1.0.9/pyproject.toml">https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/1.0.9/pyproject.toml</a></p>
<p>and in turn the oldest httpx version that starts calling for httpcore==1.* is 0.25.1 onwards <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/0.25.1/pyproject.toml">https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/0.25.1/pyproject.toml</a></p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04.3</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.9.3</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Not relevant</p>

<p>Can you link to where this scanner claims that uv would be using the Python package h11, could it be that the scanner didn't differentiate between test fixtures and actual dependencies?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I cannot share a link as this is one of our internal systems. However, I have had a look through the sources and I can see you are correct, that library is used in tests. I guess this issue can be closed on this basis.</p>
