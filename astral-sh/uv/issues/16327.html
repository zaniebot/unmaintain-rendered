            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>One of the dependencies in the source, sub dependency of httpcore, h11 0.14.0 has a critical vulnerability.</p>
<p>Link to the CVE <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj">https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj</a></p>
<p>Issue has been patched in 0.16.0 so it might be worth considering bumping that if possible.</p>
<p>We have uncovered that during our regular security scan when building uv from source.</p>
<p>It seems the earliest version of httpcore that calls for h11&gt;=0.16.0 is 1.0.9 <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/1.0.9/pyproject.toml">https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/1.0.9/pyproject.toml</a></p>
<p>and in turn the oldest httpx version that starts calling for httpcore==1.* is 0.25.1 onwards <a href="https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/0.25.1/pyproject.toml">https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/0.25.1/pyproject.toml</a></p>
Platform
<p>Ubuntu 24.04.3</p>
Version
<p>uv 0.9.3</p>
Python version
<p>Not relevant</p>

<p>Can you link to where this scanner claims that uv would be using the Python package h11, could it be that the scanner didn&#x27;t differentiate between test fixtures and actual dependencies?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I cannot share a link as this is one of our internal systems. However, I have had a look through the sources and I can see you are correct, that library is used in tests. I guess this issue can be closed on this basis.</p>
