# I encountered a bug when using "uv add tensorrt" to install TensorRT

---

_Issue opened by @txh19971013 on 2025-02-20 01:37_

### Summary

I encountered a bug when using "uv add tensorrt" to install TensorRT. It only installed the tensorrt and tensorrt-cu12 packages, which caused my TensorRT to malfunction. In comparison, when using "pip install tensorrt" to install TensorRT, it installs four packages: tensorrt, tensorrt-cu12, tensorrt-cu12-bindings, and tensorrt-cu12-libs. The TensorRT installed via pip works correctly.

### Platform

ubuntu22.04 amd64

### Version

uv 0.6.1

### Python version

Python 3.8.10
