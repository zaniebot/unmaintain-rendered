            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>A slightly unexpected behaviour occurs when one of the dependencies in <code>requirements.in</code> uses a <code>python_full_version</code> constraint.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-py/blob/master/pyproject.toml">redis-py</a> has the following dependency:</p>
<p><code>async-timeout&gt;=4.0.3; python_full_version&lt;&quot;3.11.3&quot;</code></p>
<p>After running <code>uv pip compile requirements.in</code> with Python 3.11.3+ on the following file:</p>
<pre><code>redis
</code></pre>
<p>we only get:</p>
<pre><code>redis==6.2.0
    # via -r ../requirements.in
</code></pre>
<p>Since I'm preparing a requirements file for all Python 3.11+ environments, I'd expect <code>async-timeout</code> to also be included here.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the compiled file is correct for the current Python version, but the same happens even with <code>--universal</code>.</p>
<p>One solution I've found is to add <code>--python-version=3.11</code>, after which the missing dependency is included:</p>
<pre><code>async-timeout==5.0.1
    # via redis
redis==6.2.0
    # via -r ../requirements.in
</code></pre>
<p>Shouldn't <code>uv pip compile</code> assume a <code>.0</code> patch version for current minor Python version by default?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.7.17 (41c218a89 2025-06-29)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I'm not sure... I mean, we assume that we're compiling for the given Python interpreter, which does <em>not</em> have a patch version of <code>.0</code>. I could perhaps see an argument that if <code>--universal</code> is provided, we should resolve for a patch version of <code>.0</code> as you suggest, but it'd be good to hear another opinion on this (maybe from @konstin or @zanieb).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When compiling with <code>--universal</code>, we still have to determine a value to consider the minimum version. As <code>requirements.in</code>, unlike <code>pyproject.toml</code>, don't have a <code>requires-python</code> field, we default to the current Python version.</p>
<p>Fwiw, I would expect and highly recommend users to be on the latest patch version of a Python minor. Newer patch versions are highly compatible (they contain only critical fixes) and avoid issues such as the one that caused this bound (https://github.com/redis/redis-py/issues/2633#issuecomment-1481672064)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And just to add to this, I would find that if <code>uv pip compile</code> <em>without</em> universal didn't take the current patch version of Python that it would be a breaking change, as <code>uv pip compile</code> is modeled after <code>pip-compile</code> which uses the current Python installation to resolve.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that's intentionally <em>not</em> implemented. Without universal, we resolve for the current interpreter (which includes its patch).</p>
