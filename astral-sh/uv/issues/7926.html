            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, how do I register uv to the command line when doing a pip install of uv, the reason I want that is because uv is not findable by the venv's I am using because it is only installed on my base python</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe you want <code>pip install --system uv</code> or <code>pipx install uv</code>? I'm not sure how Windows handles the base Python's bin directory. I'd really recommend just not installing from pip.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh why are you using <code>python-m uv</code> instead of just <code>uv</code>? You could provide the path to your system interpreter... i.e., before activating your environment <code>which python</code> then <code>\path\to\python -m uv</code>. I imagine you can create an alias for that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I trid to add the uv path to system variables, but that didn't work, but honestly I don't know enough windows to create an alias that when I would run uv it would point to that</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you'll need to just look up how to add a path to your system — there's not much we can do for you here. This is why we have a separate installer that handles these things.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I can solve this be using temp names and aliases and doskey, thanks for the ideas!</p>
