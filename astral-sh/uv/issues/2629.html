            <div class="timeline-body"><p>According to the spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A build back-end MUST honour statically-specified metadata (which means the metadata did not list the key in dynamic).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a field is defined in the <code>[project]</code> section, and not declared as dynamic, the spec suggests it must be used... verbatim? I think? So in theory we could read the metadata directly without executing any PEP 517 hooks.</p>
<p>This would not work for Hatch projects that rely on context formatting: https://github.com/pypa/hatch/issues/1331</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry if this is too tangential, but in my reading environment variables are not part of dependency specs (only requirements files) - thus <code>${PROJECT_ROOT}</code> usage could also be a problem here, which is another case?</p>
<p>Example https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/dependency/#local-dependencies</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My impression is that those usages are not spec compliant. But they do exist in the wild, so we'll have to detect them and skip the optimization in that case.</p>
