            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Support a flag that would allow <code>uv add</code> to read requirements from a file, e.g. <code>uv add -r requirements.txt</code>. This would enable seamless migration from a <code>requirements.txt</code> to a <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>There's some issues here. We would probably have to use <code>--raw</code> to be useful, at least as fallback for git dependencies. We would also need to make sure not to overwrite dependencies with different markers, e.g. <code>foo&gt;2; python_version &gt; '3.7'</code> and <code>foo&lt;2; python_version &lt; '3.7'</code> should be added as expected. This is at least different from the current behavior of <code>uv add</code>, but arguably that should also be changed.</p>
