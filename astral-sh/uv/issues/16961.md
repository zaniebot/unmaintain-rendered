# Refactor `uv_build` warning handling

---

_Issue opened by @EliteTK on 2025-12-03 11:20_

### Summary

#16928 and #15750 add warnings related to `uv_build`, at some point the situations when these warnings are enabled may want to be changed (see #16962). In preparation for that, it would be good to consolidate where the decision to enable warnings is made.

Currently this is being checked in three places: `uv-build-frontend`, `uv/src/commands/build_frontend.rs`, and `uv-dispatch`. Implicitly for #15750, and explicitly for #16928.
