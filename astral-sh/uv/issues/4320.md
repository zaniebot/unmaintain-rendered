# How to change and manage python version? 

---

_Issue opened by @takan1 on 2024-06-13 23:56_

I switched from rye recently and with rye, I was able to manage python version with `rye pin`. What's the best way to manage the python versions with uv?

Hi! We don't support pinning Python versions (though we will soon). Are you using our preview project interface (e.g. `uv run`, `uv lock`) or are you using our pip-compatible interface (`uv venv`, `uv pip install`)?

@zanieb I'm using `uv venv`/`uv pip` and python version management addition would be great. I'll keep using rye for now til uv supports it then!

You can do `uv venv --preview --python <version>` and we'll fetch the version for you if we can't find it. There's going to be a setting to configure it soon (#4198).
