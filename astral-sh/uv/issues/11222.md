# Please consider publishing astral-tokio-tar on crates.io

---

_Issue opened by @musicinmybrain on 2025-02-04 17:29_

### Summary

Please consider publishing the new [`astral-tokio-tar` fork](https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar) on crates.io as https://crates.io/crates/astral-tokio-tar.

### Example

This would allow the `git` dependency

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/748582ee6f3ff1007692f131fa4b59d7c100ec66/Cargo.toml#L76

to become a version-based one.

----

As maintainer of the [`uv` package in Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/uv), this would allow to me add a `rust-astral-tokio-tar` package to Fedora, rather than bundling an additional source archive in `uv` and patching `Cargo.toml` to convert the `git` dependency into a `path` dependency. That’s [permitted](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Rust/#_replacing_git_dependencies) and feasible – I am already doing it for the `async_zip`, `pubgrub`, and `tl` forks – but each additional dependency of that nature adds slightly but noticeably to the complexity of the package and the effort required to maintain it.

----

(I assume your fork might also be useful to other projects with similar requirements.)

I'm open to this. We did change a behavior or two so I would want to update the documentation and make those changes very clear.

This is great! Thanks.

One thing: could you please push a `v0.5.0` tag to GitHub? It looks like the release was tagged [`v5.0.0`](https://github.com/astral-sh/tokio-tar/releases/tag/v5.0.0) instead by mistake.

Oops, thanks. I added the tag. I'd like to remove the `v5.0.0` tag to avoid confusion...
