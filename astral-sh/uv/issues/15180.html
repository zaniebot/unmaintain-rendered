            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>uv python install --reinstall</code> is not quite like <code>uv python install</code>; it's used when you want to force reinstalling a particular version that you may have implicitly gotten from <code>uv run -p 3.x</code> etc. There isn't (to my knowledge) some other command to do this, especially not for all versions you have. So I think that it shouldn't default to adding ~/local/bin/python3.x symlinks where they didn't previously exist, because it's not the same kind of explicit request. (I think basically I'm asking for <code>--reinstall</code> to flip the default to <code>--no-bin</code>.)</p>
<p>Sort of in the same spirit as #15178; see also #15179.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.8.7</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<p>I don't think this is quite the right framing for this, because we <em>should</em> add markers to identify implicitly installed versions and avoid adding bin symlinks for those too.</p>
<p>I the main question here is should <code>uv python install 3.13 --no-bin</code> then <code>uv python install 3.13 --reinstall</code> install bin links?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My inclination is to respect the original <code>--no-bin</code> request. But I don't think the default should be <code>--no-bin</code>. Basically, if there are already bin links, reinstall them; otherwise, don't install bin links.</p>
