            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've put a decent amount of effort trying to figure out a workable &quot;monorepo&quot; solution with pip-tools/Rye/etc and now uv. What I mean by a monorepo:</p>
<ol>
<li>2+ packages with interdependencies.</li>
<li>The ability to lock dependencies across packages (where not needed, split into multiple workspaces). More sophisticated multi-version handling would be great but out of scope.</li>
<li>Multiple entrypoints. Packages are peers and there is no &quot;root&quot; package.</li>
<li>Probably want to distribute the packages in a Dockerfile or similar.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm packaging a few thoughts into this issue as I think they're all related, but happy to split things out if any portions of this are more likely to be worked on than others.</p>
<h2>Should uv support this?</h2>
<p>I think yes. Pants/Bazel/etc are a big step up in complexity and lose a lot of nice UX. uv is shaping up as the defacto Python tool and I think this is a common pattern for medium-sized teams that are trying to move past multirepo but don't want more sophisticated tooling. If you (uv maintainers) are unconvinced (but convince-able), I'm happy to spend more time doing so!</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<h3>1. Multiple packages with single lockfile</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, uv <code>v0.4.0</code> seems to be a step back for this. It's no longer possible to <code>uv sync</code> for the whole workspace (related #6874), and the root project being &quot;virtual&quot; is not really supported. The docs make it clear that uv workspaces aren't (currently) meant for this, but I think that's a mistake. Have separate uv packages isn't a great solution, as you lose the global version locks (which makes housekeeping 10x easier), so you have multiple venvs, multiple pyright/pytest installs/configs etc.</p>
<p>For clarity, I'm talking about the structure below. I think adding a <code>tool.uv.virtual: bool</code> flag (like Rye has) would be a great step. In that case the root is not a package and can't be built.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">.
├── pyproject.toml                 # virtual
├── uv.lock
└── packages
    ├── myserver
    │   ├── pyproject.toml         # depends on mylib
    │   └── myserver
    │       └── __init__.py
    └── mylib
        ├── pyproject.toml
        └── mylib
            └── __init__.py
</code></pre>
<h3>2. Distributing in Dockerfiles etc</h3>
<p>This is I think orthogonal to the issue above. (And much less important, as it's possible to work around it with plugins.) Currently, there's no good way to get an efficient (cacheable) Docker build in a uv workspace. You'd like to do something like the Dockerfile below, but you can't (related #6867).</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM python:3.12.5-slim-bookworm
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv

WORKDIR /app
COPY uv.lock pyproject.toml /app/

# NB: doesn't work as the server package isn't there!
RUN uv sync --locked --no-install-project --package=server

COPY packages /app/packages
RUN uv sync --locked --package=server
ENV PATH=&quot;/app/.venv/bin:$PATH&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If that gets resolved, there's another issue, but this is very likely to be outside the scope of uv. Just sharing it for context.</p>
<ul>
<li>Either you have to copy the entire <code>packages/</code> directory into every Dockerfile (regardless of what they actually need), forcing tons of unnecessary rebuilds.</li>
<li>OR you have custom COPY lines in each Dockerfile, which is a mess to maintain with more than a couple of packages, and has to be constantly updated to match the dependency graph.</li>
</ul>
<p>My own solution has been to build wheels that include any dependencies so you can just do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># uv is nice enough to resolve transitive dependencies of server
uv export --format=requirements-txt --package=server &gt; reqs.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then in Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">COPY reqs.txt reqs.txt
RUN uv pip install -r reqs.txt
# add --no-index to prevent internet access to ensure only the
# hash-locked versions in reqs.txt are downloaded
RUN uv pip install server.whl --no-deps --no-index
</code></pre>
<p>I've written a tiny Hatch plugin <a href="https://github.com/carderne/una/blob/main/plugins/hatch/hatch_una/hatch_build.py">here</a> that injects all the required workspace code into the wheel. This won't work for many use-cases (local dev hot reload) but is one way around the problem of COPYing the entire workspace into the Dockerfile. I don't think there's any solution that solves both together, and at least this way permits efficient Docker builds and simple Dockerfiles. (Note: since uv v0.4.0 the plugin seems to break uv's editable builds, haven't yet looked into why.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To expand on the Docker image, this is what I would want to do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM python:3.12.5-slim-bookworm AS python-builder
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv

# Create a venv at a well-known location so it can be COPY'd later
RUN uv venv /opt/python
# Tell uv to use that venv
ENV UV_PYTHON=/opt/python

WORKDIR /app
COPY uv.lock pyproject.toml /app/
# No need to COPY pyproject.toml of libs - they're all well-specified in uv.lock anyway

# Install the app without all workspace members - ie all 3rd party dependencies 
RUN uv sync --locked --no-install-workspace --package=server

COPY packages /app/packages
# Install 1st party dependencies, but only those that are needed
# Also pass the fictional `--no-editable` flag to actually bundle them into the venv
RUN uv sync --locked --no-editable --package=server


FROM python:3.12.5-slim-bookworm AS runtime

# Copy the venv that has all 3rd party and 1st party dependencies, ready for use
COPY --from=python-builder /opt/python /opt/python
ENV PATH=&quot;/opt/python/bin:$PATH&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I can't do that because:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv sync --locked --no-install-workspace --package=server</code> complains because <code>server</code> isn't there (nor are its dependencies anyway)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>it seems that <code>uv.lock</code> already has all the information needed to resolve this: it contains workspace members, so uv can know of <code>server</code>, and of its dependencies, without all <code>pyproject.toml</code> files needing to be there</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>There's no such flag as <code>--no-editable</code> - uv will install workspace members as editable packages, so <code>COPY</code>ing the venv in the final stage won't work because the packages pointed at won't be there</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>this would allow to build a complete venv that can be shipped, with all and only the dependencies it needs</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><code>uv sync</code> doesn't support targetting a venv (although that's under discussion from what I've gathered)</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(1) Yes, that would be great!
(I'll start working on a patch but I suspect I'll still be noodling by the time you merge yours.)</p>
<p>For (2), I suspect the only generally useful solution would be to encode the package-specific dependency tree in <code>uv.lock</code> (like <code>pnpm-lock.yaml</code>) rather than calculating it on the fly. That might make it harder to dovetail with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/">PEP 751</a>, but from what I understand you're planning to support pylock as an output format that uv won't use internally, so maybe not important.</p>

<h2>About (1)</h2>
<p>You're right that <code>package=false</code> does what is needed. It allows a very minimal root <code>pyproject.toml</code> that looks like the one below. The only downside is that in order for <code>uv sync</code> to sync the entire workspace, you need to add each package to <code>project.dependencies</code> and to <code>tool.uv.sources</code> <em>and</em> in <code>tool.uv.workspace.members</code>. I should have been more explicit in my first message that what I think is needed here is <code>uv sync --the-entire-workspace</code>. (This is the default behaviour in Rye and was the default in <code>uv&lt;0.4.0</code>.)</p>
<p>Alternatively a more explicit flag in the config like <code>tool.uv.workspace.this-project-is-virtual-so-sync-all-members-by-default: bool</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;monorepo-root&quot;
version = &quot;0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;==3.12&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;mylib&quot;, &quot;myserver&quot;]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = []
package = false

[tool.uv.sources]
mylib = { workspace = true }
myserver = { workspace = true }

[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [&quot;packages/mylib&quot;, &quot;packages/myserver&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h2>On (2) the Docker stuff</h2>
<p>I don't really understand how #6943 helps but seems sensible anyway. I see three obvious ways (not uv specific) of getting stuff into a Docker image:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export a package-specific <code>requirements.txt</code>, install those, then COPY in all needed packages.</li>
<li>Same for <code>requirements.txt</code>. <strong>Then create a <code>site-packages</code> and COPY that in. I assume this is what the <code>--non-editable</code> is about in #5792.</strong></li>
<li>Same for <code>requirements.txt</code>. Then create sdists/wheels from the packages (the plugin I mentioned).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these require a little pre-Docker script to generate the <code>requirements.txt</code> which isn't ideal but fine. Assuming I've understood correctly on (2) above then I'll move any more comments I have to that Issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can look into why you're seeing differences (it sounds like a bug!). I'd suggest migrating to a virtual project though, i.e., adding a <code>[project]</code> table (but not a <code>build-system</code>) to your root <code>pyproject.toml</code>.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding the <code>[project]</code> section as suggested now shows consistent behavior with or without <code>--frozen</code>.

Basically you have to add each workspace member in three places. Would be great if that could be made unnecessary (in one of the ways I suggested or some other way).</p>
<p>On (2) the Dockerfiles, the command you added helps, but it still doesn't work if there arae dependencies between packages and you haven't yet copied in the files. There's an MRE <a href="https://github.com/carderne/uv-workspace-example">here</a>. It fails when trying to run the <code>--no-install-project</code> sync because <code>packages/server</code> wants <code>packages/greeter</code> but it's not there. Currently the only way around this (afaict) is to pre-export a <code>requirements.txt</code> and use that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm probably biased, but it seems to me that a monorepo with possibly interdependent libs, and independently buildable (most of the time into Docker images) apps is a common pattern - at least it's what workspaces promote.
With that in mind, it would indeed be great to have documentation about how Astral intends us to use uv to manage such a repo and such builds. Until now, it feels like I'm hacking my way to a satisfying set-up, although uv maintainers obviously have a &quot;right way&quot; in mind.</p>
<p>That said, I must say I'm having an amazing experience with uv (and ruff, and Astral in general), and that I'll advocate to use it in all the projects I maintain!</p>

<p>Jumping in here, managing multiple environments would be very helpful. In our repo, some sub-packages have heavy ML dependencies, others have linux-only dependencies.

<p>I've managed to do that by defining apps as packages (that you target with <code>--package</code>), and extras.
For instance, I've created an <code>ai</code> package that needs tensorflow, which I added with <code>uv add --package ai --optional ml extra</code>. That way, a package that needs <code>ai</code> but never actually reaches the part where tensorflow is imported, can depend on it via <code>uv add --package consumer ai</code>, whereas a package that actually needs that would declare it via <code>uv add --package consumer ai[ml]</code> (note <code>ai</code> vs <code>ai[ml]</code>).
That's actually very useful to install a venv on an ARM macbook for a project that needs tensorflow somewhere - you run <code>uv sync</code> without <code>--extra ml</code>, so you don't end up with <code>tensorflow</code>, but everything else - good enough for developing.
Then in your actual runtime, you do <code>uv sync --all-extras</code> (assuming all extras are prod, all dev deps are declared as such) to get everything you need.</p>
<p>If you need very specific environments that are orthogonal to apps, you could create one with <code>uv init environments/my-env</code>, add deps via <code>uv add --package my-env ai</code>, and then <code>uv sync --package my-env</code>.</p>

<p>I've resolved that point by adding all local packages to the root package (<code>uv add foo</code> where <code>foo</code> is a workspace member), but I do agree it's error prone and requires an extra command each time you create a new package.</p>

<p>There's only one lockfile, so if at the root of your monorepo you run <code>uv init projects/testing-around-some-stuff</code> then <code>uv add --package testing-around-some-stuff scipy</code> you'll end up with the workspace's scipy. There's some caveats though, if you try to use in <code>testing-around-some-stuff</code> a different version of some package that's already specified in the <code>uv.lock</code>: either you'd be unable to do so because of the set of constraints, or you could and that would update that package's version for the whole workspace - not ideal either.
I'm not sure how one would create a project in a workspace and specify that it should always respect the workspace's requirements and never change them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>where i work we use http://github.com/josh-project/josh to figure out what changed (disclaimer: i'm a contributor in that project)</p>
<p>with that said I think CI is a separate problem. when it comes to python, here's what i've been able to narrow down the requirements to:</p>
<ol>
<li>it should be possible to make packages depend on packages with relative paths</li>
<li>at the same time, it should be possible to build packages for a scenario where they are eventually uploaded to a package registry, so relative paths won't work there</li>
<li>every package has multiple sets of dependencies (&quot;environments&quot;). this can be either due to feature switches or for example because CI needs more deps to run tests</li>
</ol>
<p>how we solved is for us is a custom script connected via https://github.com/recogni/setuptools-monorepo that resolves those dependencies in a desired way depending on context (for example either to <code>file://</code> path or to a name in the registry). this way we can have monorepo but we can also publish wheels from this monorepo and ship them. but i would really like to see a more &quot;native&quot; solution</p>
<p>agree to the point of having a shared lockfile, this is often a pain point</p>

<p>Thanks for the mention!</p>
<p>Yes, if I have understood the things talked about in this issue correctly I think that Polylith in combination with <code>uv</code> might be helpful. It's an architecture for monorepos originating from the Clojure community. There's tooling support, and  I'm the maintainer of the Python tooling. It works well with <code>uv</code> and here's the <a href="https://davidvujic.github.io/python-polylith-docs/">docs</a> if you want to know more.</p>

One thing that I have been struggling with how to still use <code>uv</code> workspaces's amazing single virtualenv and lock file with packages or apps with conflicting package versions. So for example shared packageA using <code>pandas==2.2.0</code> while app needs version <code>pandas&lt;2.0.0</code>.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to handle such a situation or if you have how did you handle it.</p>

<p>This is for optional dependencies only though.
There is also #4574, which would make it possible to explicitly require a private <code>uv.lock</code> and <code>.venv</code> for a given workspace member.</p>

disclaimer: I talk about the uv with polylith setup not the uv workspaces setup.</p>
<p>it depends on what you want the solution to look like. If you want to have a separate venv for this app I am not sure how you would do that. If you are ok with having one global lock and venv and use pandas==2.0.0 for development but not for deploying your app: in polylith you have one pyproject file on root level and a separate one for each project. So for the project you can add your lower bound version of pandas, so you can still deploy your app while working on supporting pandas 2.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure if this is related. If unrelated I can open a new issue.</p>
<p>I'd like to publish standalone packages from a monorepo that use an (unpublished) shared library. This comment in the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch/issues/233#issuecomment-2173239721">hatch repo</a> echoes a similar problem.</p>
<p>I have the following package structure where <code>client</code> depends on <code>shared</code>.</p>
<pre><code>packages/
├── client/
└── shared/
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to publish a standalone wheel for <code>client</code> that includes the source code for <code>shared</code> and updates the dependencies of <code>client</code> to also include dependencies from <code>shared</code>.
Ideally I can send users the <code>client</code> wheel and they can install it with no issues.</p>
<p>Right now this doesn't work because the <code>client</code> wheel generated by <code>uv build --package client --wheel</code> doesn't include the source code for <code>shared</code> or the dependencies for <code>shared</code>.</p>
<p>Couple of questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this possible with <code>uv</code> right now?</li>
<li>If not, is this potentially within scope for <code>uv</code>?</li>
</ol>
<p>I see that <a href="https://github.com/carderne/una">una</a> attempts to support this but I would be more confident in a solution built directly into <code>uv</code>. Sadly, <code>una</code> doesn't seem to work right now.</p>
<p>Proposed solution</p>
<p>I feel like what I want is a <code>--include-workspace-deps</code> flag on <code>uv build</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd replace <code>include</code> with <code>vendor</code> in your terminology. Something like that feels out of scope to me but I'm not the decider there. You can currently build 2 wheels and then you could postprocess them to vendor one into the other:</p>
<ul>
<li>extract the wheels</li>
<li>copy the shared python package into the client wheel</li>
<li>remove the shared package from the client's dependencies metadata</li>
<li>update the client's metadata to declare that it provides the shared package</li>
<li>repackage the client wheel</li>
</ul>
<p>This feels to me like a pretty unique situation you're asking for though that is outside of any standard python project workspace and is very specific to distributing the packages from uv into a wheel.</p>
<p>You could probably define a separate package + pyproject.toml already that symlinks in the code from both packages and just have uv build that when needed.</p>
<p>I'd suggest opening a separate ticket for your feature request considering workspace support is already available and this ticket probably doesn't have a super clear scope anymore.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi all, I think that thanks for --no-editable, uv works very nicely with dockerfiles / containerfiles. Based on all responses here, I now use this Containerfile, which lives in a package and which I build from the workspace root:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:3.12.5-slim-bookworm AS python-builder

ARG PACKAGE_PATH=&quot;packages/my_package&quot;

COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/uv

RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install tini


COPY uv.lock pyproject.toml /app/
WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN --mount=type=bind,source=uv.lock,target=uv.lock \
    --mount=type=bind,source=pyproject.toml,target=pyproject.toml \
    cd $PACKAGE_PATH &amp;&amp; uv sync --frozen --no-editable --no-dev


FROM python:3.12.5-slim-bookworm AS runtime

RUN useradd --uid 1001 appuser

USER appuser

# Copy the venv that has all 3rd party and 1st party dependencies, ready for use
COPY --from=python-builder --chown=appuser:appuser  /app/.venv /app/.venv
COPY --from=python-builder /usr/bin/tini /usr/bin/
ENV PATH=&quot;/app/.venv/bin:$PATH&quot;

ENTRYPOINT [ &quot;/usr/bin/tini&quot;, &quot;--&quot;, &quot;/app/.venv/bin/python&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;packages.my_package.some_script&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>The build command is run from the workspace root:</p>
<pre><code>sudo docker buildx build -t my-package:latest -f ./packages/my_package/Containerfile .
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, the line <code>COPY . .</code> can become a breakpoint, so I ended up with a funny looking <code>.dockerignore</code> file (also in the workspace root):</p>
<pre><code># contents of .dockerignore
.venv
*/.venv
*/*/.venv
*/*/*/.venv
tests
*/tests
*/*/tests
*/*/*/tests
Containerfile
*/Containerfile
*/*/Containerfile
*/*/*/Containerfile
</code></pre>
<p>It looks to me like this correctly builds a .venv with only the necessary packages and with the workspace packages installed in the .venv.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me if I missed something here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was also surprised that <code>--all-packages</code> is not the default when initially setting up my workspace. At least in my case where I'm a workspace-only project with <code>tool.uv.managed = false</code>.  However, after adding a couple of the top-level packages in the workspace as dependencies it works ok by default. I think it'd make sense to support a <code>tool.uv.sync_all_packages = true</code> however that would affect the default behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>just wanted to report that I have publishing working on a monorepo where all projects are defined in a workspace and building with &quot;uv build --all&quot;. I had some long-standing projects with a setup.py that were importing setuptools_scm to determine the version dynamically, but, when building with uv, these were unable to find the .git in the project root even with &quot;root&quot; set in the tool.setuptools_scm section. I opted to forgo setup.py entirely and use pyproject.toml for these.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say thank you. This was hugely helpful in figuring out how to set up a &quot;monorepo&quot;. It would be great to add something like this to the workspace documentation, since the existing documentation doesn't at all mention what the pyproject.toml files should look like for the workspace members, nor what the top-level pyproject.toml should look like if you don't want a top-level project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The only issue I have with this solution is that <code>--frozen</code> won't update the <code>uv.lock</code> file, but it also doesn't complain if it would need to be updated. This is a big code smell for containerized builds. You want to be damn sure that the dependencies you end up with are locked in the image at build time.</p>
<p>The issue I seem to be facing is that when using the --package flag, it wants to install my workspaces as <code>editable</code> egg packages... I don't want that. I want worksapce packages. And I want to be able to install all of the dependencies for all packages with just the root <code>pyproject.toml</code> and the <code>uv.lock</code> file.</p>
<p>This issue and the fix for it seem to accomplish that other than the 2 points:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--frozen</code> doesn't give an option for asserting the lock file doesn't change.</li>
<li>seems like if I use <code>--frozen --package &lt;MY_PACKAGE&gt;</code> then the lockfile wants to update from workspace to editable dependencies..</li>
</ul>
