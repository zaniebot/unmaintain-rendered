            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve run into the weirdness that Nox paired with uv stopped re-installing the local package and the tests ran against old code.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve bisected the behavior and it looks like the change was introduced with uv 0.2.28 because it works with 0.2.27. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be cache related since deleting the cache didn&#x27;t help.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen mentions of <code>--reinstall-package</code> for uv, but it used to work recently and I&#x27;d rather not hard-couple my noxfile to uv if it can be helped.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve ran into it while working on https://github.com/hynek/stamina so it could be a decent way to test. I&#x27;ve even added debug output out the package versions when running pytest. The number behind dev should increment after each commit.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm yes but since I didn&#x27;t want to couple my noxfile to uv (they support graceful fallbacks), I&#x27;ve set it in pyproject.toml using <code>tool.uv.reinstall-package</code>. Is that how it&#x27;s supposed to be used or will that have some weird side-effects?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hynek -- That should be totally fine. If you want to &quot;always reinstall the package&quot; (the previous behavior), that&#x27;s the right thing to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I guess it&#x27;s a documentation issue for Nox then – thanks!</p>
