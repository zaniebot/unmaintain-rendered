# How i can install lib from my own index like https://wheels.compamyname.com/python3.10?

_Issue opened by @Ada-lave on 2025-02-06 08:55_

### Question

When i try use: `uv add proxy-http-client --index https://wheels.compamyname.com/python3.10` i got error:

× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there are no versions of proxy-http-client and your project depends on proxy-http-client, we can conclude that your project's requirements are
      unsatisfiable.

      hint: `proxy-http-client` was found on https://wheels.compamyname.com/python3.10, but not at the requested version (all versions of
      proxy-http-client). A compatible version may be available on a subsequent index (e.g., https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only consider versions
      that are published on the first index that contains a given package, to avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted, use
      `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from all indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.

When i use standart pip install --extra-index-url it works and lib downloads

### Platform

Ubuntu 22

### Version

uv 0.5.26

What software are you using for the index? Can you an excerpt of the html with the links? They may have a format that uv doesn't recognize

                To specify a term which contains spaces, use single quotes like this:
                <code>'term with spaces'</code></p>
    <p>
                By using a search like <code>fieldname:term</code>,
                you can search in the following fields:<br /><dl><dt><code>classifiers</code></dt><dd>
                The <a href="https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers" target="_blank">trove classifiers</a> of a package.
                Use single quotes to specify a classifier, as they contain spaces:
                <code>classifiers:'Programming Language :: Python :: 3'</code></dd><dt><code>index</code></dt><dd>The name of the index. This is only the name part, without the user. For example: <code>index:pypi</code></dd><dt><code>keywords</code></dt><dd>The keywords of a package.</dd><dt><code>name</code></dt><dd>The package name. For example: <code>name:devpi-client</code></dd><dt><code>path</code></dt><dd>The path of the package in the form '/{user}/{index}/{name}'.  For example: <code>path:/root/pypi/devpi-server</code></dd><dt><code>serial</code></dt><dd>Undocumented</dd><dt><code>type</code></dt><dd>
                The type of text.

                End a term with an asterisk to search by prefix like this: <code>path:/fschulze/*</code></p>
    <p>
                Group query clauses with parentheses.</p>
    <p>
                Use the <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>,
                <code>ANDNOT</code>, <code>ANDMAYBE</code>, and <code>NOT</code><br />
                operators to further refine your search.<br />
                Write them in all capital letters, otherwise they will be interpreted as search terms.<br />
                An example search would be: <code>devpi ANDNOT client</code></p>
    <p>
                Boost a term by adding a circumflex followed by the boost value like this:
                <code>term^2</code></p>

    <p>
                To specify a term which contains spaces, use single quotes like this:
                <code>'term with spaces'</code></p>
    <p>
                By using a search like <code>fieldname:term</code>,
                you can search in the following fields:<br /><dl><dt><code>classifiers</code></dt><dd>
                The <a href="https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers" target="_blank">trove classifiers</a> of a package.
                Use single quotes to specify a classifier, as they contain spaces:
                <code>classifiers:'Programming Language :: Python :: 3'</code></dd><dt><code>index</code></dt><dd>The name of the index. This is only the name part, without the user. For example: <code>index:pypi</code></dd><dt><code>keywords</code></dt><dd>The keywords of a package.</dd><dt><code>name</code></dt><dd>The package name. For example: <code>name:devpi-client</code></dd><dt><code>path</code></dt><dd>The path of the package in the form '/{user}/{index}/{name}'.  For example: <code>path:/root/pypi/devpi-server</code></dd><dt><code>serial</code></dt><dd>Undocumented</dd><dt><code>type</code></dt><dd>
                The type of text.
                One of <code>project</code> for the project name,
                <code>title</code> for the title of a documentation page,
                <code>page</code> for a documentation page,
                or one of the following project metadata fields:
                <code>author</code>, <code>author_email</code>,
                <code>description</code>, <code>keywords</code>,
                <code>summary</code>. For example: <code>type:page</code>
                </dd><dt><code>user</code></dt><dd>The user name.</dd></dl></p>
    <p>
                End a term with an asterisk to search by prefix like this: <code>path:/fschulze/*</code></p>
    <p>
                Group query clauses with parentheses.</p>
    <p>
                Use the <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>,
                <code>ANDNOT</code>, <code>ANDMAYBE</code>, and <code>NOT</code><br />
                operators to further refine your search.<br />
                Write them in all capital letters, otherwise they will be interpreted as search terms.<br />
                An example search would be: <code>devpi ANDNOT client</code></p>
    <p>
                Boost a term by adding a circumflex followed by the boost value like this:
                <code>term^2</code></p>
