            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello!</p>
<p>So for the context of #9524, I was looking at an issue I am currently facing in my company.</p>
<p>Here is the error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">TRACE Extracting file name=PackageName(&quot;httpx&quot;)
TRACE Extracted 30 files name=PackageName(&quot;httpx&quot;)

</code></pre>
<p>I also reproduce by simply trying<code>uv tool install httpx</code></p>
<p>I am currently suspecting the AV to lock the <code>.exe</code> script of <code>httpx</code>.
I opened an issue on the <code>tempfile</code> crate with more details on this, and a fix idea: https://github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/316
Could you please look at it and give me your opinion on it? (Most specifically with what <code>graceful-fs</code> tries to solve and how it does it: https://www.npmjs.com/package/graceful-fs)</p>
<p>Thanks again!!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there more details on the AV vendor / configuration? I'm curious if there's known workarounds. For example, would it help if you define the environment variables <code>TMP</code> or <code>TEMP</code> to a known persisted temporary location when running uv rather than relying on the default temporary directory location for windows?</p>
<p>We override <code>TMP</code> / <code>TEMP</code> for performance reasons in our <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/.github/workflows/setup-dev-drive.ps1#L20-L21">CI tests</a>, maybe a similar approach might help your situation unless the file locking by the AV happens in any case where an executable is being moved.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes indeed, it happens every time 🙁</p>
<p>I don't know if I can share it, but the AV is a very well known one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm curious if there's known workarounds
I really think that is it what <code>graceful-fs</code> is doing..
On Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if EACCESS or EPERM error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked the directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will try tomorrow a branch of tempfile trying this workaround, to validate if it fixes it or not !</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Something that I forgot to mention, is that the behavior is a little bit random, like there is 1/50 chance of having the installation work on the system having the issue.</p>
<p>(Most probably due to the AV lock behavior)</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will prototype a custom version of <code>uv</code> using a custom version of <code>tempfile</code> with a retry mechanism and validate if it can solve the issue or not. I will keep you updated!</p>

<p>I can't reproduce this on my machine, but it's very plausible #10442 caused this, as it significantly refactors the change that fixed this issue. If so your usecase would be broken on uv <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.5.23">0.5.23</a> through <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.5.17">0.5.17</a>.</p>

<p>It doesnt work as well on  <code>0.5.16</code> (same error).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also do you have any particular antivirus running like the original issue mentions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm using a company laptop which has antivirus and other security tools scanning files and stuff in the background. This might be the cause of the issue. Unfortunately I can't turn those off.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@DarrenPadraigDV Yes, I confirm that those issues are recurrent with Crowdstrike.
I suspect that the issue is that crowdstrike does not recognize uv as a well known tool. It easily blocks uv due to software packing behavior of uv which is the role of a package manager.
I don't know how can we reach them to fix that, but with uv becoming more and more popular, the issue tends to be more and more well known.</p>
