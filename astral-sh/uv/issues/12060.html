</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I presume it's correct that it requires <code>llvmlite</code> but the lack of constraints leading to the finally selected version is quite misleading.</p>
<p>If you reverse the order of the dependencies, we'll solve this as expected</p>
<pre><code>umap-learn
numpy
</code></pre>
<p>As Charlie noted, this is a backtracking prioritizing issue. The resolution is &quot;valid&quot; but not ideal. Some details about that idea in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#basic-examples and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8157</p>

<p>Although I admit I'm still a bit confused, because how does pinning the package to the version number solve that backtracking problem? In either case it's still trying to install <code>umap-learn 0.5.7</code> right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're backtracking to a different <code>llvmlite</code> version via <code>numba</code>. It's probably due to an interaction with <code>numpy</code> and we probably try to solve the pinned version first same as when I moved it to the top of the requirements file. The resolver heuristics are sort of complicated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>fwiw <code>uv pip {compile,install} --no-build</code> also works in this case, by forcing uv to only select packages with versions that have wheels.</p>
<h3>How does the resolver fail?</h3>
<p>There is a conflict between the package <code>numpy</code> and <code>numba</code>: The latest version of numba requires <code>numpy&lt;2.2,&gt;=1.24</code>, so it's either an older numba version (without an upper bound on numpy) or an older version of pip. Currently, pip goes with the older numpy version and uv with the older older numba version.</p>
<p>We trying older numba versions, the uv resolver goes too far back into the past, down to a numba version that requires an llvmlite that fails to build on this Python version.</p>
<p>The uv resolver does detect that it goes suspiciously far back with numba and tries to reprioritize to pick a numba version before picking a numpy version, thereby reversing to the resolution that pip has. This fails because out requirements are not <code>numpy</code> and <code>numba</code>, but <code>numpy</code> and <code>umap-learn</code>. Since we currently prioritize conflicting dependencies over others and restart the resolution with <code>numpy</code> and <code>umap-learn</code> after backtracking due to reprioritizing, we end up picking the highest numpy version and an old numba version again, ending up with the observed failure.</p>
<p>We could change this order, for mixed effect on other conflict scenarios. I'm not clear on whether this would be an improvement or regression overall (#12091).</p>

<p>There are probably better heuristics uv can do here, but there's no way to get this right 100% of the time, pip also will need to be directed like this at times.</p>
<p>In general you want binary packages, especially for datascience packages, I personally have <code>--only-binary :all:</code> set and then <code>--no-binary &lt;package_name&gt;</code> for packages that have no wheel available.</p>

<p>I can appreciate the focus on 'algorithmic' trust with transparency, and your insight of pip's 'black box' resolver.
Thus I will do a breakdown of my project's trust in pip:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use other python projects that have pip as their package manager (in documentation, CI, dockerfile etc). Thus these projects are typically known to work with pip. *</li>
<li>I use pip hundreds of times so that I can see how it manages to install multiple-package projects.</li>
<li>I deploy pip to my users who then report any issues they face.
Therefore, I develop a tried-and-true approach for relying on pip - as I step through all of the issues that it has.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>projects that have &gt;= dependencies or that depend on wrong version specifiers or old setuptools might still break, of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to that, I tried a uv pip install and got a failure because I didn't specify a package's minimum version. My current 'project of projects' venv has around ~580 packages installed in total, with different wheels and packages being available for different OS platforms. As a result, one of my stopgaps was literally to just let pip do the resolution and then use <code>uv</code> to try and handle updates.</p>
<p>To that end, I'd like to ask - is <code>uv</code> faster <strong>because</strong> it has a different resolver? Would a <code>pip</code> compatible resolver always be slower?</p>

<p>Thank you for the direct info, I'm really surprised how 'lucky' npm was.</p>

<p>That's right isn't it. And unless Astral comes up with a magic bullet (which doesn't break every existing installation), the uv and pip resolvers are bound to be almost but not exactly matching up. I'd say there's money in tools that can do 99% success migrations from pip to uv. (I'm guessing something like a <code>pip install --dry-run</code> diff with <code>uv pip install --dry-run</code> and then highlight the differences in versions etc.)</p>

<p>Likely add, which does a universal resolution, can not solve for some platform or Python version for your dependencies, you should read the docs or open a separate issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have the same issue with <code>uv pip install</code>, unless I use a constraints file banning old numba versions.</p>
<p>I wonder if “has no static metadata and throws an error during build” could be temporarily interpreted as “this and all older versions are probably not compatible with current Python”, and resolution could be continued for the time being. Then if ressolution fails, the error that was recorded earlier would be displayed instead of a resolution failure.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's hard for uv to tell cases where you want to ignore an old version, such as numba, from cases where we want to fail and show the user the error, for example a database connector failed to build because the headers were missing. For this case, we should be able to solve this with better prioritization in the resolver, with the workaround of constraints that you mentioned.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, maybe a strategy could work like “start by only considering wheels for packages that have wheels”, then only start building packages if that doesn’t work?</p>
<p>pip had problems with numba and llvmlite as well in the past. These packages are a particularly complex case since numba has very specific Python version requirements (due to the bytecode parsing numba does to transform Python code)</p>

<p>It seems like a solid idea to me.</p>
<p>But as you know, any resolver changes will benefit some resolutions and hurt other resolutions. And no matter how many real world resolutions you collect it will only represent a tiny tiny fraction of all those out there.</p>
<p>So IMO you should be a little bold when you think you have a good idea, and it works well against the scenarios you do have, and revert if you get an unexpected number of complaints. Because you're not going to get complete data ahead of time.</p>
<p>Also, if I managed a resolver as fast as uv, I would consider doing a follow up resolution when an sdist build failure happened, that marked the failing package as only binary. And if the follow up resolution succeeds give a warning to the user that that was required. I guess it's a question of how much you want the user to be involved in adding their own constraints vs uv &quot;magically&quot; figuring it out.</p>

<p>I think it’s the oldest numba version with a pyproject.toml and therefore a statically determinable <code>requires-python</code> constraint.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m suggesting a robust strategy should just:</p>
<ol>
<li>at first treat all old versions that have neither declarative metadata nor a wheel for the current Python version as “doesn’t support current Python”</li>
<li>only if nothing else is possible, start resolving these old packages</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also just ran into this issue with a use case akin to <code>uv pip install numpy datashader</code>.</p>
<p>Something I've not seen mentioned in this thread is that the issue is possibly exacerbated by uv ignoring upper bounds on <code>requires-python</code>. uv will happily resolve <code>numba==0.53.1</code> on Python 3.12 and then fail to install it later, whereas pip considers that version to be ineligible at both resolution &amp; installation time.</p>
<p>In lieu of the difficult work of trying to come up with a generalised solution to improve this edge case that does not regress other scenarios, I wonder if a targeted interim workaround might be appropriate. Possibilities I can think of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving a user option to adjust solver priorities to result in something behaving <em>closer</em> to pip, possibly via<ul>
<li>Prioritising explicit constraints higher.</li>
<li>Not being so adverse to backtracking.</li>
<li>Not prioritising direct dependencies over indirect ones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Giving a user option to make the solver respect upper limits on <code>requires-python</code> (although it's not obvious whether that would actually help in this case).</li>
<li>Explicitly prioritising known problematic packages like <code>numba</code> and <code>llvmlite</code> (potentially a waste of time since it looks like a <code>numba</code> release is imminent that may avoid this particular conflict).</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@flying-sheep although I really enjoyed the speed and sleekness of uv, for projects that don't have a guarantee to work with uv, I dropped it. UV is not a drop in replacement, it's an alternative tool that you can test, and if it works, use. So maybe your pip frozen projects should work smoothly, while your loosely defined ML/AI projects have about a 20% success rate without additional fixes. The devs have responded to me on another thread, and they do not intend to replicate pip's resolver, nor maintain 2 different resolvers. uv isn't faster purely for being in rust, it's algorithm for resolution is faster.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I found the issue that talks about this: #4022. It’s confusingly titled “Consider discarding &lt; 4 upper-bound on Requires-Python” despite it apparently being the place where all upper-bounding discussion is supposed to go.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wrote some documentation for this: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/15927. The <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/requires-python-upper-limits/12663">DPO thread</a> is much more exhaustive with all pros and cons, alternatives and different cases, but this has the core points for uv in one place, and in the docs instead of a GitHub thread.</p>
<p>With the wheel tag workaround we added for numpy, and the backtracking changes we added to avoid old versions, I think numba/numpy is the one big package where uv still fails to pick a working version without user intervention.</p>

<p>They are two separate packages that do completely different things. Numpy is <em>the</em> array package and numba is a JIT compiler. What they have in common is that</p>
<ol>
<li>they deeply interface with Python internals that break every minor release (numba more so than numpy)</li>
<li>they are very popular and integral to the scientific Python landscape (numpy is the reason <code>...</code> exists in the Python language, Python’s stdlib doesn’t use it at all)</li>
</ol>
<p>But anyone could write a packages that behave that way and therefore need upper bounds!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was referring to the case where we pick the wrong numba version due to the interaction with the numpy version selection, as in the original <code>numpy</code> <code>umap-learn</code> example.</p>
<p>The problem I was referring only occurs when using numba (which depends on numpy), but not with numpy alone. numpy does not use upper bounds (numpy 2.3.3 has <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11&quot;</code>), we instead look at the ABI tags of numpy releases and fork on the Python version to include different numpy versions in a universal resolution to cover the largest possible range of Python versions. See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8492 for the evolution of the numpy handling. If you have problems with installing numpy or with universal resolution of numpy, please open an issue for that.</p>
