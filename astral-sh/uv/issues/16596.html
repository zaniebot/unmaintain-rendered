            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a use-case where a project is including a configuration file (<code>config.yaml</code>) that is outside the package directory (<code>my_project/</code>). When I do <code>uv build</code>, the configuration file shows up in the package tarball but not in the wheel. In poetry, I had this, and the file showed up in both:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;my_project&quot;
# ...

[tool.poetry]
packages = {include = &quot;config.yaml&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>For <code>uv</code>, I have this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;my_project&quot;
# ...

[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-root = &quot;&quot;
source-include = [&quot;config.yaml&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I've even tried adding <code>workspace = true</code> to <code>tool.uv.build-backend</code> but to no avail. What am I doing wrong?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>config.yaml</code> should go inside the package directory instead of into the top level of the wheel. This shouldn't really work in poetry either, as <code>config.yaml</code> is not a package. Another option for the configuration file are the data directories, which also work for arbitrary files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I agree with that. However, I'm just investigating our current poetry-based projects to see what problems we are going to have when we go to <code>uv</code> to minimize the disruption to our developer community. I'm tending to think that we will just use <code>hatchling</code> for the more exotic use-cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems that I cannot even use <code>hatchling</code> for these cases. If there are files in the wheel that are not in the source tarball, then <code>uv build</code> errors out with a stack dump in <code>hatchling</code> indicated that the wheel-only file does not exist. However, if I build with <code>hatch build</code>, I do not see this problem. I really do not want to have to include <code>hatch</code> since it has just as many dependencies as <code>poetry</code>, and our developer community does not have any familiarity with this. I will log a separate issue for this.</p>
