            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I&#x27;ve been using the great package <a href="https://github.com/fohrloop/venvlink"><code>venvlink</code></a> for years, but now I wanna migrate to <code>uv</code> only to find that it has 2 main issues with venv&#x27;s.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no way to list all the available (installed) virtual envirnments (venv&#x27;s) and their locations</li>
<li>There is no way to keep the package repository out of your project directory. I find this kind of crazy as it will scatter my entire disk with huge blobs of useless packages. Making backups completely waste of disk space as for <strong>every</strong> project I need to install a whole new set of packages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, it&#x27;s possible that I missed some uv functionality here, because I haven&#x27;t really started using it until now.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what I can do with <code>venvlink</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>List <strong>all</strong> available venv from anywhere.</li>
<li>List specific <strong>project locations</strong> that are using those venv&#x27;s.</li>
<li>Can <em>activate</em> any of those venv&#x27;s from any location in the system! 🥇</li>
<li><strong>share</strong> venv installs locations between different venv&#x27;s.</li>
<li>Keep all venv installations/files (ie. all python packages) on a separate disk.
--&gt; <strong>NO WASTED SPACE for backup!</strong> ♻</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately <code>venvlink</code> is no longer maintained and developer have no longer any interest in the project. So integration with uv is not (yet) on the table.</p>
Example
<pre><code># lsven

limesdr
llm
lunar
nanovna
osint
stats

</code></pre>
<p>And here I created a Powershell comandlet to do the above.
It should be trivial (and simpler) to recreate in bash.</p>

<p><strong>What is the current status of uv for better handling of venvs?</strong></p>

<p><code>uv</code> uses hardlinks/reflinks/symlinks (as configured, but one of them per default) for venv setup, so packages don&#x27;t actually take up all that space multiplied by the number of projects, but only once. They are cached in <code>~/.cache/uv</code> by default.</p>
<p>Since there isn&#x27;t an overhead to per-project venvs, you don&#x27;t need to set up your custom virtual environments that are shared between projects. So you also don&#x27;t need a venv listing (it&#x27;s the same as your projects listing, in this case it looks like you could just <code>ls C:\mydev</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cool. Thanks for clarifying somewhat.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s seem that if you want to use a different location, for <code>~/.cache/uv</code> you&#x27;d need to do some symlink hacking. I&#x27;m very much against keeping (any kind of) package data/directories in your home directory. I&#x27;m not on a multi-user system, and will never be, so always installs non-dev apps/tools, system wide. Unless they are to be contained for whatever reason. So it makes no sense from a data storage/backup/compartmentalization point of view.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t look into how uv does the package mgmt within that, but it seem that there is no simple way to connect the venv <em>names</em> with the actual venv <em>locations</em>, and therefore impossible to not duplicate packages. Or maybe I am wrong, so please explain.</p>
<p>And most importantly, it also seem that if I&#x27;m in one project location, lets say X, I can&#x27;t do <code>activate Y</code> to use a different environment, tha belongs a differetn project, or perhaps just a venv test setup?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed looks very similar! (TL;DR, yet.)
So looks like I missed that one, I was sure I searched all issues labelled as &quot;enhancement&quot;...</p>
