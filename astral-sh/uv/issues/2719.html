            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe we have a fixed concurrency limit, and the atomic unit is &quot;get the wheel for this distribution&quot;. For built distributions, that's typically a download + unzip. For source distributions, it's a download + unzip + build.</p>
<p>We should use separate pools for downloading vs. building, since we otherwise risk not saturating the network while we build.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think doing this fully-correctly is non-trivial since we need to change the source distribution database to return an unbuilt source.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm trying a simpler thing to start: just use separate pools for wheels and source distributions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our pool size is currently 50, how many of those would be taken by source dist builds, do you have an example?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well I think the things we want are...</p>
<ul>
<li>We should start building source distributions ASAP, and always be building as many as we have cores.</li>
<li>We should continue to download wheels at a high rate even while building source distributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm just testing against the requirements that messense posted in the other issue.</p>
