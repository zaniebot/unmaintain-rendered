            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Recently, I noticed that support for adding dependencies in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file was added, which is excellent, thank you very much.</p>
<p>However, in almost all the projects I work on, and there are quite a few, we use Poetry.</p>
<p>For example, I could install with UV and add the <code>uv.lock</code> file to Git, but the other team members are not interested (no way) in migrating to UV.</p>
<p>That said, the only way I could use UV professionally would be if UV, for example, gave up its own lock file and had a compatibility layer with Poetry.</p>
<p>Or even better, if someone created a PEP to specify a lock file for everyone to use, since it seems that just having the dependencies in <code>pyproject.toml</code> doesn’t seem to be enough.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds like you're looking for https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/</p>
<p>It's in progress and we're engaging heavily.</p>
<p>We won't be supporting Poetry's format though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That PEP sounds great to me. Poetry is very slow, and having this compatibility between teams would be fantastic. Thank you.</p>
