            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a remote server environment where I am required to use Anaconda for training the model. I want to manage and align the Anaconda environment with our build environment, and I think uv is a perfect tool for this. I&#x27;m curious about the long-term plan for uv in terms of supporting Anaconda. Exporting the Anaconda environment file would be sufficient for our needs. If you think this design aligns with your long-term plan, I am happy to help with its implementation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it&#x27;s okay to support if it works, but I&#x27;m not sure how well it will translate since Conda has, for example, different names for some packages. We can&#x27;t actually perform a resolution with Conda.</p>
