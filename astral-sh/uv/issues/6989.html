Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Based on this issue: #6007  we have already support export the requirement.txt file based on uv.lock. is it possible to support export the conda environment yaml file as well?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a remote server environment where I am required to use Anaconda for training the model. I want to manage and align the Anaconda environment with our build environment, and I think uv is a perfect tool for this. I'm curious about the long-term plan for uv in terms of supporting Anaconda. Exporting the Anaconda environment file would be sufficient for our needs. If you think this design aligns with your long-term plan, I am happy to help with its implementation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's okay to support if it works, but I'm not sure how well it will translate since Conda has, for example, different names for some packages. We can't actually perform a resolution with Conda.</p>
