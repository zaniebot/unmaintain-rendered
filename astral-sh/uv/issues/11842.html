            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After I have keyring setup with <code>uvx keyring set ...</code>, I can use <code>uv add</code> to add a private package from my private repo. But if I clone the project to another folder/machine and do <code>uv sync</code>, I got a 401 error regarding my private repo.</p>
<p>Adding environment variables or a <code>.netrc</code> file can circumvent this issue. But I'd prefer not to store credentials in plaintext on my disk.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.1 (c91ee82a8 2025-02-17)</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.12.9</p>

<p>Above is the <code>uv sync --force-reinstall --verbose</code> output with</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
keyring-provider = &quot;subprocess&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried setting <code>--keyring-process subprocess</code> on the command line but got the same result.</p>
<p>Also, in my first try, I did not specify any keyring configuration. I thought uv would pick up an available keyring automatically.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the additional details.</p>
<p>Would you mind providing logs with <code>RUST_LOG=uv=trace</code> set? That should get me the relevant logs from our authentication handler.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you have a username set in your index URL? That's also required for keyring, unfortunately.</p>
<p>For example https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/alternative-indexes/#using-keyring</p>
<p>This isn't the case for <code>pip</code> because they can just call into the Python keyring implementation directly which exposes a method for fetching both a username and password, but the keyring CLI only supported fetching a password given a username until recently (and we can't assume people are on that new version).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, if I have to put Username in the index url, it is not portable. I'd
rather use &quot;.netrc&quot; or environment variables.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's the state of keyring support. We'll add native keyring support that does not rely on the &quot;keyring&quot; Python package and then we can do what you want.</p>
