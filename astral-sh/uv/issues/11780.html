            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://crates.io/crates/r-shquote"><code>r-shquote</code> crate</a>, a new dependency added in <code>uv</code> 0.6.3 via 3e04fdb8ae7be7e99b2bb683454ed580c5da6d44, is unmaintained: https://github.com/r-util/r-shquote has been archived since 2020-04-16, and the last release was 2018-10-30.</p>
<p>I don’t have an immediate suggestion for a maintained alternative, but I still thought it was worth raising this as a potential issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Luckily POSIX shell parsing is stable, so the project being unmaintained is not as big of an issue compared to other libraries as we don't need any further updates.</p>
<p>Also the implementation is small enough that we can easily re-implement it if required.</p>

<p>I would quibble with this slightly: a “complete” crate might still have had no releases in six years, but the source repository wouldn’t be archived, and there would be somewhere to report any bugs that did materialize. Still, I understand the sentiment.</p>

<p>Yes, it would definitely be worrying if this was a more complex implementation (like html parsing let's say) as there might always be unidentified bugs and it would be non-trivial effort to maintain it ourselves.</p>
<p>But in this case implementation is very small, so if/when we encounter any bug we can just vendor the code and maintain it. So the only reason I think it is not an issue here is because the implementation is &quot;complete&quot; <em>and</em> it is very small. If any of these two conditions were false, it would not be safe to have this as a dependency.</p>
<p>This is subjective and views are my own.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I decided to vendor this anyway. We only need a single function, and given that it's archived, it'd be concerning if it actually <em>was</em> updated. I could go either way on it, but it seemed easy to do here. See: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11812.</p>
