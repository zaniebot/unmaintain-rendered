# Any plans to support packaged binary?

_Issue opened by @sdbds on 2025-01-10 00:08_

Thanks for your work, UV always great!

Recently I realized that it is convenient to package the project into an exe so that users can install all environments and third-party dependencies, like pyinstall, auto-py-to-exe.

I guess UV seems to do the same thing, since it can lock python versions, dependency versions, etc.

My experience, for what it's worth: I support a few Python-based utilities in our company, and used PyInstaller to create standalone distributable binaries. I've recently converted one such project to `uv`, by re-organizing it to be deployable via PyPI and then writing a wrapper script (or a wrapper Go program, for Windows) that silently installs `uv` (if necessary) and then runs `uv tool install <mytool>` before passing all the input arguments to the real binary. This means the user experience is unchanged - they can still download a tool with the same name, and run it with the same arguments, and be more or less oblivious to the fact that I'm dumping `uv` and a python version into `~/.local`.

Neither solution - PyInstaller, or `uv`-plus-wrapper-scripts - is entirely perfect, but so far I think I'm happier with the latter. PyInstaller is tricky to get right, especially cross-platform. And the user experience with PyInstaller is hit-or-miss; on Windows and Mac it's often painfully slow to start up, and since it's basically a self-extracting binary it has a habit of setting off anti-virus software and the like. The `uv`-plus-wrapper-script solution is generally much faster and much easier to get right, and so far at least I haven't seen it causing any real problems, but it does burn rather a lot more of the user's disk space.

The wrapper solution I came up with would be trivially adaptable to any other PyPI-distributed package, and even to non-PyPI packages with a little work. You can [take a look here](https://github.com/couchbasebuild/cbdep/tree/master/wrapper) if you like. Note that the `uv` bug I mentioned has actually just been fixed, so I can remove that workaround.

If any of the `uv` authors are reading this, I do have a dream: it would be awesome if the `uv` binary itself could identify that it was invoked with a name other than `uv`, and fall over to behaving as if it was invoked with `uv tool run <name>` (I believe similarly to how `uvx` used to work, before it was split into a separate executable). That would let people distribute `uv` itself as a fully-featured wrapper around any PyPI-distributed tool. In fact, I'm going to take a run at proposing a change like that, although I'm definitely a Rust neophyte so I'm not sure how well I can do it.

Thanks for sharing, I will check this method out.

I only know python and java, not rust at all, otherwise I would like to provide more help.

Interesting! I'd recommend opening a dedicated issue for this feature.

Thanks, I went ahead and did so: #10465 

Get a cup of coffee... brevity is definitely not one of my strengths.
