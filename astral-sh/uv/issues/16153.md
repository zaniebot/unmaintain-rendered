# Should we use Copy-on-Write for Windows Dev Drives and other ReFS drive?

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2025-10-07 15:45_

On MacOS, we default to using Copy-On-Write (reflink) for installing packages from the cache. This isolates the cache from the venv.

On Windows, we currently default to reflinks. We should explore using Copy-on-Write for ReFS drives such as Dev Drives. Is Copy-on-Write faster or slower? Is it universally available? Can we detect the drive type?
