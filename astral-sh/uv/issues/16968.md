# Warn when an environment variable overrides the effect of `uv auth login`

---

_Issue opened by @zsol on 2025-12-03 14:49_

### Summary

When running `uv auth login`, emit a warning when an environment variable is present that would override the effect of this `login` command, for example when trying to `uv auth login pyx.dev` while [`PYX_AUTH_TOKEN`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#pyx_auth_token) is set.

### Example

_No response_
