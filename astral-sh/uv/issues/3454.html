<p>I don&#x27;t know why uv&#x27;s complaining about this. There are valid wheels: https://pypi.org/project/ray/2.10.0/#files</p>

<p>I experimented with adding a mechanism to specify exact versions. It added a lot of complexity and it wasn&#x27;t clear how to display the candidate options on the CLI but I will revisit it. I was kind of waiting for someone to have a real need for it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is it a deliberate decision to keep <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> as only a external environment variable or would it be okay to have this also configurable in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I can only speak for myself, but I&#x27;d have a usecase for that. We have some projects that need to be deployed to very old macs and having that being configurable in <code>pyproject.toml</code> would make it very clear and easy to enforce for my team.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, mostly because it&#x27;s a standard environment variable read by other tools, so it&#x27;s a little unusual for us to expose it as uv-specific configuration.</p>
