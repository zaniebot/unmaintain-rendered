            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, feature request for <code>uv tool list</code> that I'm missing from pipx:  should show (or have option for) which python version was used to install each tool</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Showing python versions would allow us to decide if we can safely remove old python versions or if it's time to upgrade python for specific tool</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was very surprised today when a uv tool-installed flake8 started complaining about Python 3.12 syntax in my code, and then discovered that it was using a uv-managed Python 3.10 as the interpreter.</p>
<p>I had reinstalled all of my tools (with uv tool install --reinstall each one separately, wishing uv had pipx's reinstall-all) after an OS upgrade and expected them to use my OS-default /usr/bin/python3 (which is 3.13), not a uv python-installed old 3.10 from I don't even remember when.  I wanted to check which Python was used by each tool and hoped <code>uv tool list -v</code> or <code>--show-version-specifiers</code> would tell me, which it didn't.  I'd love a <code>uv tool list --show-python-versions</code> or something please.</p>
<p>In the mean time this works as a workaround:</p>
<pre><code>ls -l ~/.local/share/uv/tools/*/bin/python</code></pre>
