### Question

Hi, I've just installed the nomad-dev package, and everything went well until "uv run poe setup";
when I try to go on and start the uv environment, with uv run poe start, I get an error:
uv run poe start error: ServerSelectionTimeout:Error("localhost:27017": [Error 111]

thanks in advance for any support
Lorenza

I think you need to report this to poe, sorry — I can't think of how this would relate to uv.
