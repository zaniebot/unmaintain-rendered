            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm running into issues debugging my users' environments because they have got environment variables set. Is there a way for me to tell UV explicitly to ignore environment variables that the user has set? For example, I would love it if <code>--no-config</code> would additionally ignore environment variables, such that I knew I was using a &quot;blank&quot; configuration.</p>
<p>For example, they may have set <code>UV_INDEX</code> prior to installing a package with <code>uv tool install keyring</code> that would enable access to said index e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">UV_INDEX=&quot;https://oauth2accesstoken@us-central1-python.pkg.dev/.../simple&quot;
UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=&quot;subprocess&quot;
uv tool install --no-config keyring --with=keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth
</code></pre>
<p>will error from <code>uv</code> version &gt;= 0.7 (because of the change to how UV_INDEX is treated).</p>
<p>To solve this specific problem I could edit the command being run (e.g. add <code>--index-strategy unsafe-best-match</code>), but <strong>I'm looking for a general way to ignore all environment variables</strong>, as opposed to a solution to this specific example.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux 6.1.0-34-cloud-amd64 x86_64 GNU/Linux and Darwin 24.5.0 arm64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv &gt;= 0.6 (the specific example I give will fail for version &gt;= 0.7, but I'm interested in a more general solution, not this specific example)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems reasonable to support. I don't think it is today. It sounds hard because environment variable parsing happens in Clap and they're equivalent to CLI arguments from uv's perspective in many cases.</p>
