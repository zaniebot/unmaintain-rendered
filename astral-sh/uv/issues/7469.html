<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the issue wasn't VIRTUAL_ENV, but rather that we were making the venv assuming it would use the Python on the top of the PATH. cibuildwheel 2.21.1 fixes this.</p>
<p>It's really weird, though, that it no longer takes the Python at the top of the PATH when <code>--system</code> is used. If someone goes to the trouble to put Python in the PATH, intentionally skipping over it is really surprising; and if you type <code>python</code>, you don't get the one you just installed to. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    allow-prereleases: true
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3
- run: uv pip install --system some_lib
- run: python -c &quot;import some_lib&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>now fails only on 3.13 because uv installed to the 3.12 instead of the 3.13 that's been prepared by setup-python. The <code>python</code> above is 3.13, while uv is skipping it and installing into 3.12. (I've seen this failure somewhere but have forgotten which repos it affected).</p>
<p>I understand this makes sense with managed Python (where you have a bunch of Pythons and uv's just picking out the best one), but it is very surprising to have it do this to the Python on PATH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may want to consider allowing <code>--system</code> to opt-in here, but I'm a little hesitant to have different discovery behaviors.</p>
<p>cc @carljm / @AlexWaygood who suggested to me that we should not select Python pre-releases by default.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't like handling pre-releases differently from full releases in general - if someone is helping test pre-releases, making it harder for them isn't very helpful. We want to encourage pre-release to be easy to test and use like regular releases (especially RC's). The only exception I know of is the original motivation: if you have installed several <em>managed</em> Pythons, defaulting to the latest non-prerelease is a good default. But these aren't on the PATH. What about only having special handling for commands that pick up a managed release automatically, and letting PATH work normally? Is that possible?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's definitely possible — we just need to align on the behavior.</p>
<p>I believe https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7470 would achieve the behavior here.</p>
