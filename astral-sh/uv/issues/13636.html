            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>From what I understand from reading somewhere (I can’t remember where), UV’s mechanism for discovering the project root directory is somewhat complicated, involving searching upwards from the CWD for a <code>.python-version</code> file, and also searching for a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file but only one that contains a <code>[project]</code> table. That’s not exactly something that’s easy to do in a small utility shell script, yet discovering the project root can be useful in shell scripts. It would be nice if UV had a command to just print the discovered project root directory. It already does so in debug output when <code>-v</code> is passed to certain other unrelated subcommands, but it would be nice to not have to do horrid things with <code>sed</code> to the debug stream.</p>
Example
<pre><code>~/myproject/some/subdir $ uv print project-dir
/home/me/myproject
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I switched my shell script to the preview <code>workspace dir</code> command and things look good (I realize it’s preview, don’t worry, I haven’t committed anything important to it). Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah <code>workspace dir</code> is the solution for this. Thanks for following up!</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll stabilize it soon, I think.</p>
