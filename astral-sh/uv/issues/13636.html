            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>From what I understand from reading somewhere (I can’t remember where), UV’s mechanism for discovering the project root directory is somewhat complicated, involving searching upwards from the CWD for a <code>.python-version</code> file, and also searching for a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file but only one that contains a <code>[project]</code> table. That’s not exactly something that’s easy to do in a small utility shell script, yet discovering the project root can be useful in shell scripts. It would be nice if UV had a command to just print the discovered project root directory. It already does so in debug output when <code>-v</code> is passed to certain other unrelated subcommands, but it would be nice to not have to do horrid things with <code>sed</code> to the debug stream.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>~/myproject/some/subdir $ uv print project-dir
/home/me/myproject
</code></pre>
