# Add scripts to uv just like javascript's package managers

---

_Issue opened by @AmodeusR on 2025-08-03 15:16_

### Summary

UV is an amazing tool, but if there's something I miss in it is the scripts feature like javascript for quickly running shell commands. I'd love to see it being added to UV.

### Example

Easily running long shell commands with aliases through `uv run <alias>`.
