# uv lock and uv pip

---

_Issue opened by @ZuoyunZheng on 2025-03-13 00:42_

### Question

I just discovered that the packages that i install using  `uv pip install -r requirement.txt` are not listed in uv.lock.

I'm inheriting the project from non-uv users and therefore was hoping i could run `uv pip install -r requirement.txt` to let uv know all of the dependencies. But it seems this only installed the packages but did not add them to the lock file. Is this intentional? Can i make uv lock track uv pip installed packages?

### Platform

Linux 6.6.75-2-MANJARO x86_64 

### Version

uv 0.5.25

You can run `uv add -r requirements.txt`, to add them all to your `pyproject.toml`. (It's intentional that the lockfile is linked to the `pyproject.toml` and doesn't look at requirements files.)
