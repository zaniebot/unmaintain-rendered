            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Trying to run uv using VS code on windows.  Install uv on powershell using command
<code>powershell -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</code>
This installs version 0.1.33</p>
<p>If I try to create venv running command:
<code>uv venv</code>
powershell responds with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv : The term 'uv' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I install and run powershell as admin, it seems to work fine while still in admin.  This should not be the way to use it as running things with admin should be reserved to extreme cases.</p>
<p>Running windows 11</p>

<p>[!NOTE]
Running either <code>sudo powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c &quot;pip install uv&quot;</code>, or <code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c &quot;pip install uv&quot;</code> in admin mode, is a workaround if you're running into this problem.</p>

<p>I was getting the same error--long story short, <code>sudo powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c &quot;pip install uv&quot;</code> ended up working.</p>
<p>I'm running gsudo in powershell on windows 11.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>When I say it worked, I mean I can now use the <code>uv</code> command outside admin mode.</p>
<p>All below <em>did not</em> work correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip install uv</code></li>
<li><code>sudo pip install uv</code></li>
<li><code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c &quot;pip install uv&quot;</code></li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe not the same problem, but I got the same error message under discussion (uv not found on the command line), for which this is the first google result for me, on Windows 11 when I installed python from the windows store and then used its pip to install uv. Turns out that doesn't really work! So, if you're also getting this error message and the other fixes don't work for you, try installing python from the python website instead, I guess.</p>
