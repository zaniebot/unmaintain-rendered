            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should document our assumptions wrt to security. Should be mostly obvious, but warrants being written down. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You need to trust all the indexes that you use.</strong> We do not protect against malicious indexes. I think this point should be highlighted in the docs next to the index url option.</li>
<li>You have to trust the package authors of the packages you use. (This could partially change for deployment/installation with hash checking mode, which ensures that you only use files you audited and no later upload trying to be smuggled in, this prevents against a previously known good package being overtaken between resolution and installation.)</li>
<li><strong>Resolution and installation can run arbitrary code.</strong> Since you generally only resolve package you plan to run, this shouldn't change the consideration much. Use <code>--no-build</code> to disable this, even though this is more a feature for reproducibility and &quot;don't mess up my dev machine&quot; than for security.</li>
<li>Puffin currently uses no unsafe code, though some of our dependencies do and puffin itself might in the future.</li>
</ul>
