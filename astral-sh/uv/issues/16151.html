            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I have an occasional dependency on a package that is gated behind ssh that only a couple of my coworkers can get to (nuitka).</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve tried including this dependency as optional, I&#x27;ve tried it in sources, but uv sync ALWAYS wants to fetch it unless <code>--no-sources</code> is specified. However, I only want it to be fetched if I specifically request it. I was hoping that using optional dependencies would work, but it doesn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>I am working in a workspace model.</p>
<p>If this dependency exists in a pyproject.toml, anywhere, it tries to fetch it, which only works for 2 out of 10 of us.</p>
<p>Is there any way, short of only adding his dependency at the moments in time where I need it, where I can default uv to not attempting to fetch it at all?</p>
Platform
<p>Ubuntu 24.04, Linux 6.8.0-84-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
Version
<p>0.8.24</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv requires access to all dependencies at resolve time, for being able to accurately lock the package with hashes and dependencies, we currently don&#x27;t support that in a workspace.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Solved it with just, but it would be nice to have the ability to have some kind of restricted or only sometimes dependency.</p>
