            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>(I don't know if this applies to lockfiles as well -- I assume that the two are just different presentation layers for the same algorithm?)</p>
<p>Say I have a project that has <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.8&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and I am running <code>uv pip compile --universal pyproject.toml &gt; constraints.txt</code> in an environment that has Python 3.12.</p>
<p>The resulting <code>constraints.txt</code> file is not necessarily usable under Python 3.8. It may well include dependency versions that are not suitable for 3.8.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I find that <code>--python-version 3.8</code> will actually force the uv resolver to do the right thing, and generate a lot more forks to accommodate for a full range of Python versions.</p>
<p>Maybe this should be a default behaviour, at least for universal mode?</p>
<p><em>(It is really rather useful to have constraints/lock files that are portable across multiple interpreter versions -- and <code>uv</code> is already partly doing it -- for the dependencies -- but not considering the root node itself, therefore not nearly forking as much as it should.)</em></p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux (though this is OS agnostic)</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.5.30</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.12.3</p>
