# More sophisticated quiet/verbose handling

---

_Issue opened by @jaraco on 2025-03-22 19:47_

### Summary

In https://github.com/jaraco/pip-run/issues/100#issuecomment-2745439331, I'm working on updating `pip-run` to work with (and prefer) uv. One of the features of pip-run is that it defaults the installer to quiet mode, but allows the user to override and make it more verbose again. When using `pip install`, pip will allow any number of verbosity indicators (`-v`, `-q`, `--verbose`, `--quiet`, and environment variables `PIP_QUIET` and (maybe) `PIP_VERBOSE`) and sum them up to determine the verbosity. This behavior makes it easy for a wrapper like `pip-run` to adjust the default verbosity but still give the user full control over the ultimate verbosity.

`uv` on the other hand simply rejects any attempt to signal both quiet and verbose:

```
🐚 uv pip install -q -v requests
error: the argument '--quiet' cannot be used with '--verbose...'
```

I'd like for `uv` to offer a similar option (quiet by default, but maybe more verbose), preferably through the same mechanism (`--quiet` or `UV_QUIET`).

Using `overrides_with` seems fine here to me.

Point of clarification: does pip treat `-q` treated as "-1" and `-v` treated as "+1"? So `-v -q` is a no-op?

(This is slightly different from overrides-with, which would never allow you to get back to then "0" default state, which it seems like you want to support?)

-1 / +1 seems kind of wild. I guess we'd add `--no-verbose` or `--no-quiet` to reset to the default state? (or a flag that captures both?) 😭

Yes, that's right. It turns out to be quite useful when layering different inputs (`PIP_QUIET` in the environment overridden by `--verbose` or `-vv` in the CLI, or when composing CLI arguments from different sources).

It also means you can have `-q -v -qqq -vvvv` (same as `--verbose`).

Wild? It seems elegant to me. Conceptually, both `--quiet` and `--verbose` are affecting the same "verbosity" setting, just in different directions. Of course, one doesn't have to model it that way, but that's what pip does, and the approach has some nice ergonomics (mentioned above).

Ugh. Yeah, that's not great. I also think it's not quite the model I was after. I'd like the ability to increase or decrease the verbosity relative to a prior prescription. `--no-quiet` or `--reset-verbosity` _might_ work in my particular use-case, but it really complicates the conceptual model, adding a whole new `reset` aspect.

It feels a little bit like the CLI parser available is offering only `overrides_with`, which is driving the design away from a simple conceptual model. Is there a reason not to follow pip's approach and simply count the `quiet` and `verbose` flags and allowing one to cancel the other?
