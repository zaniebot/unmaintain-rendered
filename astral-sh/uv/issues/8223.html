            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When trusted publishing on github actions was requested but fails, it's usually due to some mismatch between pypi's configuration and the actual job, e.g., a missing <code>.yml</code> extension. It's cumbersome to debug since pypi will not tell you what mismatched for security, and you can only use trusted publishing in github actions, so each debugging round is starting a new publish job. To help with trusted publishing errors, we should provide a printout with debug information that the user can easily diff against the fields they entered in the pypi web interface and their github actions job configuration.</p>
