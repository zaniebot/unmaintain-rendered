            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If you are not able to enable <code>--generate-hashes</code> when using <code>pip compile</code>, you may still want some explicit wheel URLs to have hashes attached.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For example if you have this <code>requirements.in</code>:</p>
<pre><code>requests @ https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/26/ff/c71b3943bebdd9f7ceb9e137296370587eb0b33fe2eb3732ae168bc45204/requests-2.7.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl \
  --hash=sha256:20f976cdce02a42b69ce80e9e03897a51814b36d448b37288546086ebc473146
</code></pre>
<p>And you run:</p>
<pre><code>% uv --version
uv 0.7.13

% uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --no-strip-markers --no-strip-extras
Resolved 1 package in 1ms
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --no-strip-markers --no-strip-extras
requests @ https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/26/ff/c71b3943bebdd9f7ceb9e137296370587eb0b33fe2eb3732ae168bc45204/requests-2.7.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
    # via -r requirements.in
</code></pre>
<p>the manually provided hash is stripped. I think there's an argument to be made for keeping that hash since it was provided manually. I totally understand if that would be too confusing given the matrix of options here. Thanks for considering!</p>

<p>What's blocking you from using it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ha yes, I omitted that since it's not the fault of UV but the fault of our code that consumes the files. I hope to fix it soon</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>actually after a bit more debugging, the issue there is more difficult to workaround than i expected. the issue is my actual case is pytorch, so i have multiple indexes, and if i generate hashes uv is finding deps from 1 index, but then later when i consume the requirements.txt file, the consumer is finding the deps from the other index, and the shas then mismatch. I think ideally I would fix this by using uv's index selection, but since my tools consume requirements.txt files, that might be a non-starter atm.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv currently expects that indexes and files at resolve time are the same at resolve time as at install time. We're relaxing the index URL requirement (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11782), but knowing the files at resolve time is a security, we need to ensure that we've seen and locked the files at resolve time so install time has the same files.</p>
