            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My system Python defaults to using <code>dbm.gnu</code> when I use the <code>dbm</code> module (macOS, Homebrew, installed <code>python@3.12</code> and <code>python-gdbm@3.12</code>.</p>
<p>However, Python from <code>uv</code> apparently does not provide <code>dbm.gnu</code>, and hence cannot open files created with my system Python.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<pre><code>brew install python python-gdbm
uv init --python-preference=only-managed foo
cd foo
python3 -c 'import dbm; dbm.open(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)'
python3 -c 'import dbm; dbm.open(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)'
uv run python -c 'import dbm; dbm.open(&quot;test&quot;, &quot;r&quot;)'
</code></pre>
<p>The final command fails with:</p>
<pre><code>Using Python 3.12.5
Creating virtualenv at: .venv
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

    raise error[0](&quot;db type is {0}, but the module is not &quot;
dbm.error: db type is dbm.gnu, but the module is not available
</code></pre>
<p>It is not clear to me how do I tell <code>uv</code> that I would like to get a Python that supports <code>dbm.gnu</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Probably related to this: https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/technotes.html?highlight=dbm#dbm -- if yes there isn't much uv can do. You can either build your own managed python (not sure if you can use that with uv though) or use the system python.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do not understand clearly if uv depends on python-build-standalone, if this is the case, uv can do nothing about this issue, in other case, is it possible that uv can enable the gdbm module to be available?  I would love to continue using uv in cases that gdbm is required.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>is there any news on this?
I encountered the same issue today while updating one of my projects to python 3.13.5.
I get this error only because of celery, which is kind of dependent on dbm.gnu at least for the state db´s it creates for the worker and beat processes.</p>
<p>My current workaround would be to also have to install pyenv to install the working python interpreter and let uv use this as the base intepreter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do maintain <code>python-build-standalone</code>, and use it for our managed Python distributions.</p>
<p>I don't know what's to be done about the <code>dbm.gnu</code> problem though. As described in the link, it's not included because it's GPL licensed and we avoid such dependencies in the <code>python-build-standalone</code>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to work around this with uv is to set <code>--no-managed-python</code> or <code>UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE=system</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you share more about why / how Celery depends specifically on <code>dbm.gnu</code>? It looks like that's only the case if an existing state file created by a different Python version is being read? If you're using a consistent Python distribution, i.e., uv's, then it should be self-compatible?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @zanieb,</p>
<p>thank you for your input. I just double checked if your approach by deleting and recreating the state-db works with an uv managed python installation and voila it works! Insane support, love to see it!!</p>
<p>Keep up the great work you do at astral by revolutionizing the python ecosystem 👍🏻</p>
