            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Context</h2>
<p>Hey guys, I was going through how we compute interpreter information while creating virtual environment.</p>
<h2>Request</h2>
<p>Would it be useful to generate a debug message which prints out the the metadata for the interpreter?</p>
<p>For example, adding this following piece of code here https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/crates/uv/src/commands/venv.rs#L129</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">debug!(&quot;Using the following metadata for the interpreter. {:?}&quot;, interpreter)
</code></pre>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Users when reporting issues on github could just paste that piece of information in the description so that it would get easier for the contributors to debug &amp; support.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! Which metadata do you think would be useful in particular? I don't think we want to dump the debug representation of a struct as a general rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The contents which would be useful can include platform metadata, which we have access to in <code>markers</code>. To avoid printing the debug representation of the struct associated with markers, do you think it would be a good idea to create a public repr function (probably with a better name)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe. I'm pretty hesitant to add more output without a compelling case of &quot;this would have helped me solve a bug&quot;. We haven't really had problems with not knowing the interpreter platform markers in bug reports.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm that's a valid point. I guess if something comes up, it would help us know what's required and we could log that accordingly. I will close this one for now.</p>
<p>Thanks @zanieb</p>
