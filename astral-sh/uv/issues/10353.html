            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, we have a mono repo and have multiple packages each with their own <code>pyproject.toml</code>.
There are some configuration I'd like to share between these (namely our private index, and the keyring-provider = &quot;subprocess&quot; setting).
Using a workspace seems not the correct  approach as they are independent packages with their own dependencies.</p>
<p>Is there a way to have a <code>uv.toml</code> at the repo root and when running e.g. <code>uv sync</code> in a sub-folder having it also picking that up?</p>
<p>This works if I copy the <code>uv.toml</code> to each sub-directory (which I'd like to avoid) or copy it to the user config (~/.config/uv), which I'd also like to avoid as these are settings only relevant for that specific repo.</p>
<p>From https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/ it looked like the discovery walks up the directory structure, but these additional settings are neither picked up from the <code>uv.toml</code> in the parent nor in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> of the parent.</p>
