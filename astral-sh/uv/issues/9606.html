            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It'd be nice to have internationalized documentation with support for multiple languages as requested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5605#issuecomment-2495792315</p>
<p>It's unclear if this is feasible for us given our rapid pace of development.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO, there should be an infrastructure for translators too. For first milestone, I think docs could support multi versions. Also, status page for showing each language translated which version of docs would be cool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Internationalized documentation is beneficial for non-English users, but I've seen some cases where only the English version is up-to-date, while other language versions are outdated. Therefore, if you want to support non-English users, it's crucial to ensure that users are aware of whether the documentation they are reading reflects the latest version.</p>
<p>By the way, how can we ensure that the translations in other languages are accurate and reliable?
To support it, would we need a community reviewer similar to winget-pkgs?</p>
<p>Edit:
However,  if UV is developing rapidly, I would not recommend having non-English documents, as they can easily lead to misunderstandings due to obsolescence.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A good example of a project using mkdocs-material to provide internationalization is <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>. While FastAPI's documentation internationalization is not complete and some pages are untranslated (in my language), its implementation and review process might be worth referencing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the easiest starting place to have links to google translate of the page.</p>
<p>For example, for german</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ becomes https://docs-astral-sh.translate.goog/uv/?_x_tr_sl=en&amp;_x_tr_tl=de&amp;_x_tr_hl=en</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly spanish becomes</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs-astral-sh.translate.goog/uv/?_x_tr_sl=en&amp;_x_tr_tl=es&amp;_x_tr_hl=en</li>
</ul>
