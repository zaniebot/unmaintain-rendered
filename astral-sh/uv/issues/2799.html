            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>One of things I have often found pip lacking has been <code>shiv</code> or <code>pyinstaller</code> like functionality. It would be amazing (and <code>cargo/rust</code>, <code>go-like</code> if uv could build out binaries/zipped virtualenvs  like <code>shiv</code> or <code>pyinstaller</code> do. I realize that this might be out of scope for pip (it installs packages and does not build them?) but I think since this particular task is also packaging-centric, pip or uv should provide the feature/ability.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From purely a build perspective, if uv had an exposed <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_wheel/">pip wheel</a> equivalent, it might be close enough to satisfy this request and stick to standards. On the other hand, <code>pyinstaller</code> also bundles python into the mix, so it serves the different purpose by of freezing python and it's dependencies into a platform specific single binary. Definitely a wish to have something like that experience. I think once the low level tooling is flushed out, something like that can become closer to being achievable.</p>
