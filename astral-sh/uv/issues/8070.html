            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On my Mac OS Sequoia 15.0 (24A335), I'm trying to run uv and as I'm behind a company proxy, I need to use the system certificates which are not recognised by default.</p>
<p>In running the <code>uv --native-tls</code> command the help keeps being prompted. Conversely, using an <code>export UV_NATIVE_TLS=truez</code> and then running whatever I need, uv execute without issues.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you include the exact command you're running? <code>uv --native-tls venv --show-settings</code> shows that <code>native_tls</code> is being set as expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was going just with UV --native-tls because I thought this was helping to set the parameter once and for all
This doesn't sound too be the case, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I was hoping if there is any change and or chance to get more informations on how uv retrieve the local PEM file.
A --debug doesn't show the file being targeted. And I get that in the end it should be also sourcing from the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable.</p>
<p>But a valid certiificate specified in that folder keep triggering an UnknownIssuer certificate output, but when I ran a pip install all works fine.</p>
<p>Do you have any clue?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't implement the TLS stack ourself, so it's really hard for me to say what the problem is. <code>RUST_LOG=trace</code> might have more information. The certificate type might just not be supported by the library we use for TLS, in which case we'd need enough details to open an issue there.</p>
