            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have a dependency on a package, located in GitHub private repo. It's defined as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-(toml)">[project]
dependencies = [
    &quot;mypkg[all]&quot;,
]

[tool.uv.sources]
mypkg= { git = &quot;ssh://git@github.com/...&quot;, branch = &quot;master&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>When I run <code>uv sync --upgrade</code>, the package got updated (gets installed from the current <code>HEAD</code> of <code>master</code> branch).
When I run <code>uv sync --upgrade-package mypkg</code>, the package does not update (version pinned in <code>uv.lock</code> is used). It seems, that <code>uv</code> doesn't fetch from GitHub at all.</p>
<p>Is it somehow expected behavior?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 22.04</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.7.21</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, now it looks even more interesting. I have a project, that depends on two GitHub-sourced packages. One is upgraded fine on its own (<code>-P</code>), but another gets upgraded only in &quot;full upgrade&quot; mode (<code>-U</code>).</p>
<p>Here is the dependent project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-(toml)">[project]
name = &quot;mypkg-dependant&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;Add your description here&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;tnc[pkgB]&quot;,
    &quot;mypkg[all]&quot;,
    &quot;flake8&quot;,
]

[tool.uv.sources]
mypkg = { git = &quot;ssh://git@github.com/msamo-n/mypkg&quot;, branch = &quot;another-branch&quot; }
tnc = { git = &quot;ssh://git@github.com/msamo-n/exp&quot;, branch = &quot;uv-exp&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>I run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-(bash)">uv sync -v -P mypkg 2&gt;./upgrade_mypkg.log 
uv sync -v -P tnc 2&gt;./upgrade_tnc.log
uv sync -v -U 2&gt;./upgrade_all.log
</code></pre>
<p>Verbose logs are attached.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah ok, I think this is similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14954. It looks like <code>tnc[pkgB]</code> adds another Git dependency (<code>pkgB</code>) from the same repo, and we end up respecting <em>that</em> package's SHA. So you'd need to do <code>-P tnc -P pkgB</code>. It is indeed a bug.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's pretty complicated though. If you pass <code>-P tnc</code>, should we <em>not</em> upgrade <code>pkgB</code>? (If we <em>do</em> want to upgrade <code>pkgB</code>, it gets much more complex because we need to understand that they're part of the same workspace or something.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I'd say that if the upgraded <code>tnc</code> depends on different version of <code>pkgB</code>, <code>pkgB</code> should be upgraded as well. In my case, as both packages are versioned together (being in the same repo), they get upgraded together as well.</p>
<p>Actually, my goal was to keep a few packages in the same repo and install them from the same commit (for consistency).</p>
