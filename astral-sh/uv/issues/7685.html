            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I recently migrated one of our projects from poetry to uv, and one thing that made me stumble was a syntax error in my netrc file. Uv would just silently ignore the error and move on as if the netrc file did not exist, which made it a bit hard to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>I think a better approach would be if the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/84e5f6e871f344aa8b414c52bf95b22a992b382d/crates/uv-auth/src/middleware.rs#L33"><code>Netrc::new()</code></a> call returns a <em>parsing error</em>, to log a warning about it before ignoring it, to let users know why the netrc file is being ignored.</p>
