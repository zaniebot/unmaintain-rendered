            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've noticed that <code>uv</code>  still tries to resolve packages that are supposed to be irrelevant for the configured environment. I'm working on a server with a private registry where we don't have Darwin packages. When I try to install <code>ipykernel</code>, however, I see it still tries to resolve a Darwin-specific package, which then fails as it isn't available in our registry. Specifically, it's about <code>appnope</code>, which is configured as <code>'appnope&gt;=0.1.2;platform_system==&quot;Darwin&quot;'</code> in ipykernel' s pyproject.toml.(https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/8c4901d691b1f309da3b80eefad5af13d7418185/pyproject.toml#L32C6-L32C13)</p>
<p>I'm using <code>uv</code> 0.5.2 on RHEL.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;test-project&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
description = &quot;My test project&quot;

dependencies = [
    &quot;ipykernel ; sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;
]

[tool.uv]
environments = [
    &quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;
]

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You might want to add something like <code>platform_system == &quot;Linux&quot;</code> to <code>environments</code>? The system doesn't know that <code>platform_system == 'Darwin'</code> and <code>sys_platform == 'linux'</code> are mutually exclusive -- there's nothing in the spec that says they <em>have</em> to be, it's just true in practice.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh that's interesting and, though annoying, quite logical. Using platform_system indeed works and this then isn't a bug.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you think it's worthwhile, I'd be willing to add a small note to your documentation about this, as it currently uses <code>sys_platform</code> exclusively. This would then not work if any of your dependencies, like <code>ipykernel</code> uses <code>platform_system</code> instead of <code>sys_platform</code>.</p>
