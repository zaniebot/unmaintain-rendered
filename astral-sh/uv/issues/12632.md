# Could the expert in writing the document please make it clear and direct

_Issue opened by @mogoyu on 2025-04-02 17:06_

### Summary

I find your documentation quite frustrating.  I'm using a Windows 10 system, and I need to customize all cache-dir directories to the specified D:\Python\uvcache. I defined it in C:\Users\mogoyu\AppData\Roaming\uv\uv.toml as: cache-dir = "D:\\Python\\uvcache". However, when I execute "uv tool install xxx", it still downloads to the default directory instead of my custom directory.  Why can't there be a straightforward explanation of which file to edit and which parameter to add?  I've gone through a lot of information, but nothing seems to work. Can't it be clearly defined with a specific name?  Additionally, I noticed that your default settings require checking configurations in different locations. Can't all configurations be consolidated into a single file?

By "it still downloads to the default directory", what is "it"? Do you mean the tool itself, like the executable?
