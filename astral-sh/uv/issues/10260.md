# some musllinux wheels are missing

---

_Issue opened by @Freed-Wu on 2025-01-01 07:33_

https://pypi.org/project/uv/#files

There are 3 archs for musllinux

- uv-0.5.13-py3-none-musllinux_1_1_x86_64.whl (15.1 MB view details)
- uv-0.5.13-py3-none-musllinux_1_1_i686.whl (14.6 MB view details)
- uv-0.5.13-py3-none-musllinux_1_1_armv7l.whl (14.2 MB view details) 

However, there are 

uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (15.0 MB view details)
uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_s390x.manylinux2014_s390x.whl (20.0 MB view details)
uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_ppc64le.manylinux2014_ppc64le.whl (15.2 MB view details)
uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_ppc64.manylinux2014_ppc64.whl (15.5 MB view details)
uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_i686.manylinux2014_i686.whl (14.9 MB view details)
uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_armv7l.manylinux2014_armv7l.whl (14.2 MB view details)
uv-0.5.13-py3-none-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.musllinux_1_1_aarch64.whl (13.6 MB view details) 

Why some muslinux are missing?

We don't ship musl builds for PPC or S390x. There just isn't demand for them, and it takes work to maintain them unfortunately.

(Note that there _is_ a musl build for aarch64 at the bottom of your list.)

Thanks.

> There just isn't demand for them

I build https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel
Now I have to skip some platforms because I want to use uv:

```toml
[tool.cibuildwheel]
build-frontend = "build[uv]"
skip = "*_armv7l *-musllinux_s390x *-musllinux_ppc64*"
```

Otherwise I meet:

```
Error: Command ['which', 'uv'] failed with code 1.
```

Ok. I would say those platforms aren't particularly common. NumPy and SciPy, for example, don't build for any of them. Pydantic has `_armv7l` but neither of the other two.

> aren't particularly common

I see however If we want to use uv in cibuildwheel, they are required due to cibuildwheel support it by default, except you use `skip = "..."`.

For anyone use uv in cibuildwheel, here is a solution:

```toml
[tool.cibuildwheel]
build-frontend = "build[uv]"

[[tool.cibuildwheel.overrides]]
select = ["*-musllinux_s390x", "*-musllinux_ppc64*"]
build-frontend = "build"
```
