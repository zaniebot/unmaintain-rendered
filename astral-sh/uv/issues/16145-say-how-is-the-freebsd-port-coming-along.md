# Say! How is the FreeBSD Port Coming Along?

---

_@davidjayjackson_

### Summary

Hey,
It would be really great to have a native version of UV for FreeBSD/GhostBSD!
As it is, I have to install it through the "Software Station" and then install a bunch of dependencies.

I think that's a question for the FreeBSD package maintainers. If there's a problem compiling or running uv on FreeBSD please share it, but the installation flow is a question for downstream maintainer.
