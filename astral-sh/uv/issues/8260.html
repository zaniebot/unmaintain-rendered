Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>When updated, a package using <code>uv pip install -U</code> the <code>uv</code> updates its dependencies (which is nice), but it ignores upper constraints in dependencies of all installed packages.</p>
<p>In contradiction, the <code>pip</code> update only these dependencies that are enforced by minimum required version of dependency.</p>
<p>In my case, it creates a problem with any package that has <code>numpy</code> in dependencies as <code>numba</code> project do not support the latest <code>numpy</code> version.</p>
<p>Here MRE (in real scenario I was switching the <code>zarr</code> version).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to clarify what's going on here, I don't think pip is taking Numba into account at all. Rather, I think pip treats <code>pip install -U zarr</code> as &quot;upgrade zarr&quot;, whereas we treat <code>pip install -U zarr</code> as &quot;upgrade any dependencies you encounter when resolving zarr&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>pip will also let you break the environment trivially (<code>pip install numpy==2.1.2</code> would have the same problem).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes. I agree. There is difference, I try to point it in description.</p>
<p>But with pip I end with working environment, and with <code>uv</code>, the environment is broken.</p>
<p>I also expect that <code>uv pip install numpy==2.1.2</code> will break the environment. I even expect that <code>uv pip install -U numpy</code> will do this.</p>
<p>But now, I do not know how to update a single package in a way that does not break the environment, without going on PyPI and manual typing version in terminal.</p>
