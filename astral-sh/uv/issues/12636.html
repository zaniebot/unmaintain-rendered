            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p><code>python -u</code> will &quot;Force the stdout and stderr streams to be unbuffered.&quot;, this has the effect of calling all print statements with <code>flush=True</code></p>
<p>I need this for a script where I'm using subprocess and some of those commands are not buffering their output. I've looked at the documentation, but it doesn't even contain the word &quot;buffer&quot;, nor any reference to PYTHONUNBUFFERED.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is not the only option that the python interpreter has that uv might want to replicate, so maybe this is a can of worms but probably worth starting the discussion on it, if there's no existing solution?</p>
<p>A partial solution might be <code>uv run python -c</code>, but this won't work for scripts that use the script metadata for their dependencies.</p>
