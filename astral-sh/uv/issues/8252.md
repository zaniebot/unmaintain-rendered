# `uv pip install` fails when building from git repo

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2024-10-16 12:25_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

when installing my package from github, uv seems to hang forever during building.

it's an npm package bundled inside a pypi package, using pdm's build backend. it seems to hang forever during the stage where it installs its npm dependencies with lerna.

# to reproduce

sorry the build process is quite convoluted, i've commented out some stuff in this branch to make it not take as long to build. i could probably try and cut out some more of the process to try and make a minimal repro, but i've been at this for hours so i hope this repro on github is enough

```
uv pip install --verbose git+https://github.com/detachhead/basedpyright@b9080d7c9d2065259cfb900a44cd7ca1dafc79e3`
```

# logs
this is just an excerpt from where it hangs, but i can provide more if needed

it hangs at that last line.

# environment info

i've tested this on a couple different environments:

uv 0.4.22, 0.4.19
python 3.12, 3.13
windows 10, windows 11, ubuntu 22.04

# things i've tried

when installing it via any of these other methods, it builds successfully and doesn't hang (though it still takes a couple minutes to build):

- installing it with pip instead of uv:
    `pip install git+https://github.com/detachhead/basedpyright@b9080d7c9d2065259cfb900a44cd7ca1dafc79e3`
- installing it with pdm
    `pdm add --dev git+https://github.com/detachhead/basedpyright@b9080d7c9d2065259cfb900a44cd7ca1dafc79e3`
- installing it from a local file path
    `uv pip install C:\Users\user\basedpyright` (the root of my local checkout of the repo)

(possibly related? #8225)

Thanks for the repro.

Interestingly, it works fine if I clone the repo and install.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-10-16 12:51_

(But not if I install from Git as in your example.)

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-10-16 13:01_

Is there any way to get more logging out of lerna?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-10-16 13:16_

It's something specific to Lerna, related to the use of a blanket `.gitignore` in the cache:

```rust
// Add the .gitignore.
match fs_err::OpenOptions::new()
    .write(true)
    .create_new(true)
    .open(root.join(".gitignore"))
{
    Ok(mut file) => file.write_all(b"*")?,
    Err(err) if err.kind() == io::ErrorKind::AlreadyExists => (),
    Err(err) => return Err(err),
}
```

I have no idea why that's causing problems for Lerna though. I tried a bunch of other tricks like adding a non-empty `.gitignore` one subdirectory below, but none of them helped.

You can reproduce this without uv.

```
mkdir foo
cd foo
cat "*" > .gitignore
git clone https://github.com/detachhead/basedpyright
cd basedpyright
git checkout b9080d7c9d2065259cfb900a44cd7ca1dafc79e3
npm i
npm run postinstall
```

This just hangs. I think it should be filed with Lerna to be honest.
