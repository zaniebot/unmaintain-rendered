            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, are there any plans for <code>script-files</code> support like in <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html#setuptools-specific-configuration">setuptools <code>tool.setuptools.script-files</code></a>? E.g. for shell scripts.</p>

<p>I would like to move from Poetry to UV but this is blocking it for one of my projects.</p>
<p>I would like the equivalent of: <code>tool.poetry.scripts</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BenConstable9 - I believe <code>[project.scripts]</code> which is part of the official <code>pyproject.toml</code> specification will cover the functionality you are looking for? See https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#creating-executable-scripts</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903">Using uv run as a task runner</a> might be relevant?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that packages using <code>script-files</code> have been the cause of various bug reports already. That may affect its inclusion in our build backend? I&#x27;m not familiar with the state of the standards there though.</p>
<p>The <code>[project.scripts]</code> table is the recommended way to create cross-platform scripts. You can use that today https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#command-line-interfaces (and you can also use <code>setuptools</code> and <code>script-files</code> with uv)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are three different features known as &quot;scripts&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>project.scripts</code> and <code>project.gui-scripts</code>: These are standards that should be supported by every build backend, and will also be supported by uv&#x27;s build backend (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9635">astral-sh/uv#9635</a>). Note that they already work with any build backend you&#x27;re using: After installing the package, the scripts are installed and added to PATH by <code>uv run</code> or virtual environment activation. Poetry calls those <code>tool.poetry.scripts</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>scripts</code> data folder. Similar to <code>project.scripts</code> and <code>project.gui-scripts</code>, they are standards and already supported if your build backend uses them . The difference to <code>project.scripts</code> is that they aren&#x27;t generated on installation, but just files copied to the correct target, so they are less portable.</li>
<li>A task runner, such as <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903">astral-sh/uv#5903</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you move from poetry to uv, you currently need to configure this for the build backend your using, not in uv itself.</p>
