            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We want to support path dependencies in our lock file. But the data model for path dependencies in our lock file is, at the time of writing, not quite right. I believe what we <em>ought</em> to have for a path dependency is a single file URL to a directory, source distribution or wheel. But the data model currently allows for a source distribution <em>and</em> zero or more wheels, but specifically does not allow for a directory.</p>
<p>I think the current data model is mostly just a reaction to the types that we have after resolution. Namely, I think we have two related types. The first is for wheel path dependencies:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/616ed530430f08577af5ae549c3d2b525e7e34ce/crates/distribution-types/src/lib.rs#L174-L180</p>
<p>And the second is for source distribution path dependencies:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/616ed530430f08577af5ae549c3d2b525e7e34ce/crates/distribution-types/src/lib.rs#L206-L213</p>
<p>My understanding is that the second is <em>also</em> used when we have a path dependency to a directory.</p>
<p>This all matters for the lock file because if a path dependency points to a wheel or a source dist, then we want to record a hash for it. But if it comes from a directory, then we very specifically do not want to record a hash.</p>
<p>So to fix this issue, I think we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Adjust the <code>PathSourceDist</code> type so that it indicates whether it came from a real source distribution or a directory. Possibly one way to do this is to split the type in two, with one type representing source distributions and the other representing a directory.</li>
<li>[ ] Adjust the <code>Lock</code> data model so that distributions with a <code>path</code> source kind are more limited than what they are today. I think we actually do <em>not</em> want to encode the file path itself, and instead derive that from the <code>pyproject.toml</code>. (This would match what Cargo does.)</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah exactly. Cargo rebuilds the path from the <code>Cargo.toml</code> instead, as I understand it. So in order to get the path of a path dependency in a lock file, I think there is some interaction point between what's in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and what's in the lock file.</p>
<p>(There is at least one other interaction point as well: finding the relevant root package in the lock file at which to start a graph traversal.)</p>
