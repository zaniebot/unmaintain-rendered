            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>In a research data science team setting, different members might prefer to use their personal environments when doing research, but also at times be able to quickly switch between others&#x27;. What is the best way of structuring this in general? I.e. should we create an <code>envs</code> folder with subdirectories for each env?  Assuming there is single one &#x27;data-science-repo&#x27;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would say that inconsistencies don&#x27;t look good, but if deemed completely necessary, UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT is your friend. You can probably create a small bash script to switch between venvs in tandem with preserving state using group dependencies in your <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>I would also suggest/emphasize that different dependencies should be based on functionality and not user preference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One option is using <code>uv run --with &lt;...&gt;</code> to test the project plus separate dependencies. Another option is manual venv management with <code>uv venv &lt;name&gt; &amp;&amp; . name/bin/activate &amp;&amp; uv pip install &lt;...&gt;</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I should have also mentioned using <code>conda</code> works great in this case, as environments aren&#x27;t tied to a project (but the repo does have a <code>envs</code> folder with env .yml files). Maybe I should have framed the question as - is there a <code>conda</code> way of using <code>uv</code>?</p>
<p>And again, this is not a production level repository, rather an exploratory research one</p>

<p>I think you&#x27;re looking for the highly requested <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1495">astral-sh/uv#1495</a></p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure the answer at the moment is not really. At my work I still use conda to set up multiple global environments, and then uv to install Python packages in those conda environments.</p>
