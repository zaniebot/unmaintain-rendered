# Formalize policy on pip compatibility

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-02-27 17:42_

We should define a formal policy on the pip functionality and workflows we want and don't want to support. This helps us triaging issues and users to understand the scope of `uv pip`.

We now have a document that summarizes our compatibility policy, and highlights many of the areas of incompatibility: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md
