            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Please implement a way to provide index credentials in a file. Buildah can only provide build secrets as files.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>export UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PROXY_USERNAME=file=/run/secrets/username
export UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PROXY_PASSWORD=file=/run/secrets/password</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We aren't likely to implement support for arbitrary files in uv, but we're adding a (preview) keyring provider that uses a file-based based storage for credentials. Another alternative is using the existing stable keyring support and implement a keyring plugin that reads from your preferred file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How do I use the file-based keyring provider?</p>
<p>I have, I think, a common use case, where I:</p>
<ul>
<li>use buildah</li>
<li>run <code>uv sync</code> in the Containerfile</li>
<li>use a private repository/index</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>uv auth</code> CLI is persisting secrets to a plaintext store, but that's different than mounting secrets into individual files. The preview portion of <code>uv auth</code> is the system-native storage backend.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To implement your own file based keyring provider, you'd install a package like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/de1479c4ef41106d5e87f5ad6ba27b9f94c46b0c/scripts/packages/keyring_test_plugin but read from files. It sounds like a pain, but might be a viable workaround.</p>

<p>I'm curious, could you share a resource that claimed this? In general I'd expect the opposite to be true: a secret in a file is <em>de facto</em> globally readable to all other processes on the system (including anything that might have a global-read primitive, e.g. a path traversal bug in a web server), whereas environment variables are resident in process memory and can't be accessed without direct process memory read access. This is why the typical assumption for secret materials is that process memory is safe; if an attacker can read e.g. TLS session keys from memory, then most other security properties for a system are moot.</p>
<p>(I say &quot;de facto&quot; because in principle you could use user/group management to isolate files, but in practice most machines are single-user machines with a single relevant &quot;persona&quot; for credential management purposes.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Environmental variables can apparently leak accidentally. After a quick search, I found two relevant sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37049439/is-passing-application-configuration-in-stdin-a-secure-alternative-to-environmen - explains some cases</li>
<li>https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/introduction - this whole security solution revolves around bypassing k8s secrets using volumes, which mount files</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that it is important to note that I am using <code>uv</code> from a container. I didn't even think of a single-user machine and storing a static file with secrets to my index.</p>
<p>So I would correct my statement to &quot;files are more secure than environmental secrets <em>in a containerized environment</em>&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We had e.g. a case where a build backend dumped all env vars on failure (because you need them for debugging), leaking credentials in their setup (no CI credential redaction). That's unlike files, which generally don't get dumped and where access needs to be intentional (unlike using <code>os.environ</code>).</p>
<p>In my experience, files are easier to reason about because they have clear access rights and access is clearly defined e.g. for containers, while env vars generally often get propagated implicitly, often without documentation about it.</p>
<p>It would be ideal to have credentials in the system credential storage which can only be accessed by a dedicated API for secrets, offering good protections against for env var dumping and path traversal bugs, but these are more often than not available in environments such as docker. (This is not a statement about the security about system credential managers, but about the ergonomics of handling credentials as a user.)</p>
