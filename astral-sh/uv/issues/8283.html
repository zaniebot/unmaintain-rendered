            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I couldn't find how I can specify which package should be retrieved from which package repository.
Most of the packages are retrieved from pypi, but for some packages we would like to retrieve
them from a gitlab instance, either via a group URL or a project URL. How can I specify that?</p>
<p>In poetry we could add the different URLs and bind them to kind an identifier and then with poetry config
I could add then authentication to those identifiers. Is there something similiar in uv?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we support a similar scheme -- check out the newly updated <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/">index</a> documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It allows you to assign packages to indexes, define credentials in environment variables, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That looks great, but could I suggest one improvement. In addition to the ENV variables, could you also add an mechanism to store them in a file somewhere centrally? Or could you add to uv the possibility to point to a .env file where it picks up additional env variables?</p>
<p>Tbh. I would like to have a user and also system wide configuration file, where we could store such informations or at least link to those informations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can already define indexes at the system or user level. See the docs: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/.</p>
