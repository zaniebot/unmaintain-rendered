# uv pip compile support for setup.py and install_requires

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

It seems that currently `uv pip compile` only supports `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.in`. 

Will `uv pip compile` support `setup.py`'s `install_requires`? If advertising as a drop in replacement for `pip-tools`, it might be nice to call it out one way or another.

Hi. This looks like a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1624

That issue is for setup.cfg. I was specifically asking about setup.py

👍 It's actually the same underlying problem, so I think it makes sense to merge into that issue.

If anyone have issues with generating requirements.txt from setup.py, try updating uv to the latest version. I did it so and it worked for me. Currently I am using uv version `0.1.31`

👍 We added `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` support in a recent release.
