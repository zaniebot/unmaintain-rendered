# Inconsistent behavior when `source .venv/Scripts/activate` on Windows

---

_Issue opened by @jfcherng on 2024-02-16 17:33_

When in git-bash (https://gitforwindows.org/) shell on Windows,

## With `pip`

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
echo $PATH  # ".venv/Scripts" is added into PATH
```

## With `uv`

```bash
uv v
source .venv/Scripts/activate
echo $PATH  # ".venv/bin" is added into PATH, and this is wrong
```
