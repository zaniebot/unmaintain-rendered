# Bug: `uv venv` activation uses system `pip` instead of virtual environment's `pip`

---

_@guillermodotn_

### Summary

### Description

When creating a virtual environment using `uv venv` and subsequently activating it, the `pip` executable found via `which pip` points to the system-wide `pip` installation rather than the `pip` executable within the newly created virtual environment. This behavior is counter-intuitive and can lead to unexpected package installations in the global environment, potentially causing conflicts or polluting the system Python installation.

In contrast, when using Python's built-in `venv` module, activating the environment correctly directs `which pip` to the virtual environment's `pip` executable, which is the expected and desired behavior for isolated environments.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Create a virtual environment with `uv`:**
```bash
uv venv
```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
```bash
source ./<venv_name>/bin/activate
```

3. **Check the `pip` executable path:**
```bash
which pip
```

### Expected Behavior

After activating the `uv` virtual environment, `which pip` should output the path to the `pip` executable located within the virtual environment (e.g., `./venv/bin/pip`). This ensures that any subsequent `pip install` commands operate within the isolated environment.

### Actual Behavior

After activating the `uv` virtual environment, `which pip` outputs the path to the system-wide `pip` executable (e.g., `/usr/bin/pip` or similar, depending on the system configuration).

### Example demonstrating the issue (Actual Behavior):

```bash
$ uv venv # Creates a virtual environment
$ source ./<venv_name>/bin/activate # Activates virtual environment 
$ which pip # Shows the path for pip tool
/usr/bin/pip # <--- This is the system pip, not ./<venv_name>/bin/pip
```

### Comparison with `python -m venv` (Expected Behavior):

```bash
$ python −m venv .venv # Creates a virtual environment named ′.venv′
$ source .venv/bin/activate # Activates virtual environment
$ which pip
/home/user/path/to/project/.venv/bin/pip # <--- This is the virtual environment's pip (correct)
```

### Proposed Solution (if any)

The activation script generated by `uv venv` should correctly modify the `PATH` environment variable or create appropriate symlinks to prioritize the virtual environment's `pip` executable over the system's pip.


### Platform

fedora 42

### Version

uv 0.7.17

### Python version

Python 3.10

We don't include pip in the uv-created environment by default, since it typically isn't necessary. You can run `uv venv --seed` to include pip.
