            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>python-build-standalone only builds the latest patch release for each Python version, so if I want to pick up the benefits of some fix (e.g. the Tkinter fix), I need to either <code>uv python upgrade</code> or <code>uv python install --reinstall</code> depending on whether I already have the latest patch release or not, and these commands don't communicate whether I am. This confused me personally for a bit when I released 0.8.7 and saw matplotlib continuing to break, because apparently I was on 3.13.3 and uv didn't upgrade me.</p>
<p>I would like some command, perhaps <code>uv python upgrade --reinstall</code>, with the following behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I don't have the latest patch release for a given Python minor version, upgrade it.</li>
<li>If I do have the latest patch release, reinstall it. (At some point we can skip the reinstall if we know that I have the latest build, but we don't currently track that.)</li>
<li>If I have any symlinks in ~/.local/bin/python3.x pointing at older patch releases, upgrade them, but do not create new symlinks when they do not exist.</li>
</ul>
