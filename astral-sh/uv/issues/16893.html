            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>E.g. running <code>uv tool install changedetection.io==0.51.4 --python 3.11</code> fail with an error, since pre-releases are not allowed for this package.</p>
<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of pyppeteer-ng==2.0.0rc10 and changedetection-io==0.51.4 depends on pyppeteer-ng==2.0.0rc10, we can conclude that changedetection-io==0.51.4
      cannot be used.
      And because you require changedetection-io==0.51.4, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: `pyppeteer-ng` was requested with a pre-release marker (e.g., pyppeteer-ng==2.0.0rc10), but pre-releases weren't enabled (try: `--prerelease=allow`)
</code></pre>
<p>But installing <code>uv tool install git+https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io.git@0.51.4 --python 3.11</code> works without any errors.</p>
<p>Since in both cases the same pre-release package is requested, shouldn't it behave the same?

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Should this be documented or it applies to many other areas, so it wouldn't make sense to document it in just <code>--prerelease</code>?</p>
<p>And reading <code>--prerelease</code> option description - isn't installing this package from <code>pip</code> falls into <code>Allow pre-release versions if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements</code> and it should be accepted when installing from <code>pip</code> too? Since it has explicit pre-release marker in the requirements - <code>pyppeteer-ng==2.0.0rc10</code></p>
