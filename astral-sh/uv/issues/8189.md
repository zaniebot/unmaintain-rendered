I'm not sure. They're intentionally distinct.

`uv run -p 3.13 python -c "import sys; print(sys.base_prefix)"` matches the free-threaded version if it's installed which is sort of problematic — I don't know if we should ever consider 3.13 and 3.13t equivalent.

Yeah interesting. This was also mentioned on Discord:

```
uv run -p cpython-3.13.0-linux-x86_64-gnu python
Python 3.13.0 experimental free-threading build
```
