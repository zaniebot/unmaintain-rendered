            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>uv supports <code>--exclude-newer</code> (and a corresponding config option) for limiting resolutions by a cutoff date. This is really great for reproducibility (assuming stable resolutions), since new versions won't be picked up.</p>
<p>A related but slightly different concept is &quot;cooldowns&quot;: instead of being a fixed cutoff date, a cooldown is a <em>rolling</em> duration. Dependency releases made within the cooldown period are not eligible for resolution. This doesn't have the reproducibility benefits of <code>exclude-newer</code>, but it <em>does</em> have supply-chain security benefits: most compromised dependencies are identified and remediated within hours or days of active exploitation, meaning that a cooldown of 1-2 weeks (as a default) is likely to catch the overwhelming majority of potentially malicious dependency changes.</p>
<p>Prior art for this exists in Dependabot and Renovate, as well as ecosystem-specific functionality in JS (pnpm's <code>minimumReleaseAge</code>). Dependabot and Renovate do a decent job, but supporting cooldowns directly in packaging tools conveys nontrivial benefits: it ensures that the cooldown is enforced uniformly (versus just on automated updates) and ensures that a single tool has a single source of truth about dependency ages (this is a problem for Dependabot in particular, which sometimes makes somewhat opaque resolution decisions/has opaque cooldown behavior).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>A rough sketch design: uv grows a <code>--cooldown &lt;duration&gt;</code> option (and corresponding setting). This option would be used like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console"># add 'sampleproject', but only selecting releases/dists &gt;= 7d old
# --cooldown defaults to 7d
uv add --cooldown sampleproject

# can be made explicit
uv add --cooldown=14d sampleproject
</code></pre>
<p>(And similarly for all other mutative uv commands.)</p>
