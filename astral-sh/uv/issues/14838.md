# create statically linked single binary python applications similar to bun & deno

_Issue opened by @kskarthik on 2025-07-23 07:42_

### Summary

I believe this would be a great addition. It solves the distribution problem of python applications.

The python interpreter & the application dependencies can be bundled together in a single binary

Bun & Deno compile commands are a good examples to loot at.
