            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm using uv and portable uv-executed scripts, as I recently wrote about here: <a href="https://dev.to/aaronsteers/the-modern-ways-to-not-install-python-1e85">The Modern Ways to (not) Install Python and Virtual Environments - DEV Community</a></p>
<p>Now, I'd like to give myself and my team a way to maintain uv scripts with the help of IDE linting. I think this is possible if I locate the uv-managed venv. Is there a way to locate this path? (With the understanding that the path may be ephemeral, changing without notice?)</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Darwin 25.0.0 x86_64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv-self 0.6.12</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb - Thanks very much for your reply. I really like the simplicity of the <code>uv python find</code> syntax, but it doesn't work correctly in my trials. Instead, it prints a uv-managed python path that does not have hash parts. (Perhaps it is resolving the symlink?)</p>
<pre><code>aj:repos aj.steers$ uv python find --script=airbyte/poe-tasks/get_connector_matrix.py
/Users/aj.steers/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.0-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.12
</code></pre>
<p>The second option does work, although a bit more verbose and clunky if typing by hand.</p>
<p>This version (with or without <code>--dry-run</code>) seems to be a balance of sane-to-type while also not an insane amount of output:</p>
<pre><code>aj:repos aj.steers$ uv sync --script airbyte/poe-tasks/get_connector_matrix.py | grep &quot;environment&quot;
Using script environment at: /Users/aj.steers/.cache/uv/environments-v2/get-connector-matrix-1bd340654832c662

</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas on whether <code>uv python find</code> could be updated to not traverse symlinks (if that's indeed what is happening), and/or have a another option to use that command with the --script arg to locate the script's venv?</p>
<p>Totally okay either way - I'm unblocked now, and I see that <code>sync</code> operations print it by default, which is handy for what I'm hoping to train team members on.</p>
<p>Much thanks!
AJ</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For documentation purposes:</p>
<p>Confirmed that appending <code>/bin/python</code> to the end of the discovered path, and then passing that to VS Code as its interpreter works beautifully to get linting working. 💎 ✨ 💎 ✨</p>
<p>Screenshot or it didn't happen 😄</p>

<p>Note the intellisense for the <code>typer</code> library works correctly, despite being a third party library that is only used in that script's venv.</p>
<p>Note also in the bottom status bar the text &quot;<code>3.12 (get_connector_matrix.py)</code>&quot; indicating the found Python version, as well as the helpful indicator of the venv corresponding to my script. 🎉</p>
<p>I'll leave this issue open for replies to my inquiries in my prior comment - but feel free to close/resolve after replying. Thanks!!</p>

<p>Did you run <code>uv sync --script ...</code> first?</p>
