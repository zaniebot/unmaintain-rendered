# Should we show URLs or versions when uninstalling URL-based dependencies?

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-18 15:02_

Right now, when we uninstall a distribution that was installed via a URL, we show the version rather than the direct URL. Is this wrong?

For example, if you _reinstall_ Black as editable, we show the removed Black as a version:

```
 - black==23.10.2.dev15+gf7cbe4a
 + black @ ../black
```

I tend to think we should show the URL.

Huh it's cool that we have the full version like that. We should probably use the URL... although I wouldn't mind both?

```
black==23.10.2.dev15+gf7cbe4a [from git+https://github.com/psf/black]
```
