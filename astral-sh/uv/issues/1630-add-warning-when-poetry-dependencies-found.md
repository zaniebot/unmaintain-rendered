# Add warning when `poetry` dependencies found instead of PEP 621 dependencies

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-18 07:47_

This results in an empty lock file and has caused some confusion:

- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1619
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1597

We can detect this case and warn.
