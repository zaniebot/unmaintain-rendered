# UV can not fall back to compatible PySide6 installation

_Issue opened by @aduhan on 2025-08-15 14:14_

### Summary

When I do "uv add PySide6", I get this:
```
Resolved 9 packages in 12ms
error: Distribution `pyside6==6.9.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on Linux (`manylinux_2_36_aarch64`), but `pyside6` (v6.9.1) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux_2_28_x86_64`, `manylinux_2_39_aarch64`, `macosx_12_0_universal2`, `win_amd64`, `win_arm64`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels
```

I then add the following to pyproject.toml:
```
[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
    "sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64'"
]
```
When I do "uv add PySide6" again, I get this:
```
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers: platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux'):
  ╰─▶ Because all versions of pyside6 have no `platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux'`-compatible wheels and your project depends on pyside6, we can
      conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: Pre-releases are available for `pyside6` in the requested range (e.g., 6.0.0a1.dev1606913934), but pre-releases weren't enabled (try: `--prerelease=allow`)

      hint: The resolution failed for an environment that is not the current one, consider limiting the environments with `tool.uv.environments`.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.
```

### Platform

Raspberry PI OS 12, manylinux_2_36_aarch64

It sounds like they don't provide any wheels for `manylinux_2_36_aarch64`. What do you expect us to install?

When using pip, it automatically detects and installs a compatible version, which is PySide6 6.8.0.2

---

Thanks! https://inspector.pypi.io/project/pyside6/6.8.0.2/ does indeed provide `PySide6-6.8.0.2-cp39-abi3-manylinux_2_31_aarch64.whl`. You set your required environment to `2_36` though, which doesn't consider _older_ wheels. Want to try `2_31` instead?

_Comment by @aduhan on 2025-08-15 14:44_

I just tried with `2_31`, but unfortunately it also does not work:
`No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers: platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_31_aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux'):`

Can you share the full message please?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-08-15 14:56_

I don't think `platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_36_aarch64'` will work. The output on that machine will just be something like:
```
>>> platform.machine()
'aarch64'
```

I think the error is "correct", in that you're on ARM, but their ARM wheel requires glibc 2.39 or later, and you're on 2.36.

@zanieb Sure:
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers: python_full_version >= '3.14' and platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_31_aarch64' and sys_platform
  │ == 'linux'):
  ╰─▶ Because all versions of pyside6 have no `platform_machine == 'manylinux_2_31_aarch64' and sys_platform == 'linux'`-compatible wheels and your project depends on

@charliermarsh Yes correct. I am on 2.36, and PySide6 6.8.0.2 requires glibc 2.36, while the newest version requires 2.39 as you pointed out, but uv does not seem to install it.
I also tried 'aarch64' for the platform_machine flag, so basically:
[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
    "sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'aarch64'"
]


but then I get this:
error: Distribution `pyside6==6.9.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on Linux (`manylinux_2_36_aarch64`), but `pyside6` (v6.9.1) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux_2_28_x86_64`, `manylinux_2_39_aarch64`, `macosx_12_0_universal2`, `win_amd64`, `win_arm64`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-08-15 15:26_

Right, I think this is basically unsupported, because you can only narrow resolution with environment markers, and there are no markers for glibc versions.

---

_Comment by @aduhan on 2025-08-15 15:46_

I see. Thank you. Would be great to support those markers or some other solution (like pip?), due to Qt (with its python bindings PySide6) being such a huge framework worlwide.
