            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a way to force uv to skip certain dependencies? Specifically we use docker containers <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch">maintained by Nvidia</a>, which come pre-installed with various python ML packages on the system level (torch, apex, amp_C, flash-attn). If I use <code>uv venv --system-site-packages</code> then I can access those dependencies, the problem is that if any package that I install has a transitive dependency on one of these packages (primarily torch), then the one installed in venv will be chosen over the system one, and things break. I&#x27;d like to be able to specify that torch for example should not be installed as a transitive dependency, but I&#x27;m not sure how to do this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be great to have a proper solution for this, not just a hack. We have a similar situation in our container setup, but the number of packages much larger.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think using overrides with an &quot;impossible&quot; marker is actually kind of a fine solution? The alternative is that we introduce something non-standard.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you both. Super helpful. The solution seems fine to me.</p>
<p>For anyone else that stubmless upon this issue. Add the following to your pyproject.toml. If you have a top-level pyproject.toml and any additional package specific ones, you should add it to the top-level pyproject.toml</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    &quot;torch; sys_platform == &#x27;never&#x27;&quot;,
]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would just note that this is quite a  dangerous solution to the original problem, since if a package depends on a torch version that is not satisfied by the underlying environment this will result in a broken installation.</p>

<p>This is a very reasonable workaround.
BUT, this does not work with <code>--universal</code> parameter :(</p>
<p>Instead I have written an obviously false another constraint. For example</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    &quot;torch; python_version &lt; &#x27;3.0&#x27;&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
