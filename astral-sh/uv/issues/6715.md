# Support passing `--cert` and setting `cert` in `uv.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @kohlrabi on 2024-08-27 19:15_

With the merge of #6591 it is now possible to trust hosts to disable certificate verification, but compared to pip the "other way" around, providing  a valid cert, is still a bit a bit lacking. I know it's currently possible to set a path to a cert file using `SSL_CERT_FILE`, but I think it would be more in line with pip and more consistent if `--cert CERTFILE` could be passed on the command line, and `uv.toml` got an option to set the cert file as well.

does `native-tls` work for your use case? https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6572#issuecomment-2594166728

Thanks @DetachHead, I have not tried. I didn't add the cert to the OS store, I just have a file. I will try.

@DetachHead I think there definitely is a use case for a `--cert` argument and/or environment variable for configuring the certificates. If using self-signed enterprise CA and a locally hosted package store, you may not want to build the certs into the image, instead treating it as a docker secret for security purposes. 

This is easily accomplished with `pip` by passing the cert as a secret (e.g. `--mount=type=secret,id=certificate`) and then telling pip where the cert is just for that command with `--certs /run/secrets/certificate`. To make this happen with `uv` currently requires either a multi-stage build that copies the `.venv` directory over to a bare image, or several extra commands per RUN command that performs a uv pip install.
