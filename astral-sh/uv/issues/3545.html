Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>The Readme (which to my knowledge is currently the only documentation available) mentions the availability of configuration values in <code>uv.toml</code> and <code>pyproject.toml</code>. It does not, however, mention which configuration values are available.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have an overview of what is available here to more easily discover the <code>uv</code> features one might want to use.
If it is planned to support adding all CLI arguments also as a configuration value (like <code>pip-compile</code> does), it would also be nice to have documentation on how those CLI arguments translate to the configuration values.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We already create and publish a JSON Schema for this which is the hard part. Maybe there's something low-effort we can do to generate visual documentation from that.</p>
<p>Separately, if you have the TOML extension installed in VS Code, you should already get completion:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh That's great. Just want to add that when I go to astral.sh and click on &quot;Docs&quot; I get redirected immediately to the <code>ruff</code> docs :)
Don't see a way yet to get to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ without typing it out (It's also not linked in the sidebar of the repo)</p>
