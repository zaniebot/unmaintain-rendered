Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>This is reproduced from a private repository.</p>
<p>https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library
https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_app</p>
<p>We've some packages that are named with underscores then referenced as git dependencies. Some of the dependencies are hand written so match the exact names like this:</p>
<p>https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_app/blob/24b446b856475297785d5d240a3dc08086fa51b5/pyproject.toml#L7-L12</p>
<p>In general use this all works, we can use <code>uv run</code>, <code>uv lock</code> and others. What goes wrong is if we try use management commands:</p>
<pre><code>uv remove https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library.git --verbose
error: invalid value 'https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library.git' for '&lt;PACKAGES&gt;...': Not a valid package or extra name: &quot;https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library.git&quot;. Names must start and end with a letter or digit and may only contain -, _, ., and alphanumeric characters.

For more information, try '--help'.
</code></pre>
<p>I think what's happening is that you folks are applying normalization prior commands: https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/#normalized-names which is totally reasonable. I'm mainly reporting as the behaviour caused quite a lot of confusion in the project (migrated from Poetry) and it might be possible to adjust the errors to lead folks down better paths.</p>
<p>There are also various other surprises if you say use <code> uv add https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library.git</code> as you'll then get conflicting TOML parsing with the overlapping entries.</p>
<p>Personally I think we're doing something ill-advised, though it's permitted by https://peps.python.org/pep-0503 so we're planning to just move all our project-names over to <code>-</code> as it'll just be simpler that way.</p>
<p>Also to note if everything is done with <code>uv add</code> and <code>uv remove</code> it works as the normalized names are written to pyproject.toml.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh you're right I've confused the issue with that, I got into that when debugging around the issue @tpgillam more clearly reported (and has been extracted as <a href="#8330">separate issue</a>). Since I've mentioned that though: I do somewhat expect symmetry between <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> but that would be a different request. What I'd actually go for in that case is detecting special cases like GitHub repositories and erroring inviting people to <code>uv remove example_python_library</code> or <code>presumably uv remove example-python-library</code> for clarity</p>
<p>The other issue of adding the dependency again:</p>
<pre><code> uv add https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library.git
 Updated https://github.com/cgravill/example_python_library.git (2ada4bd)

<p>is also an annoyance. The slightly more involved context that comes from is we also specify git <code>rev</code> so I was trying to update the handwritten entry. The failure made me incorrectly conclude that <code>uv</code> couldn't handle updates at all. Depending how the fix for #8330 goes it might also fix this!</p>
