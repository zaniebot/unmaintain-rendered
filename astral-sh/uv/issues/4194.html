            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is very similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4102, but for general marker expressions. For example, if a resolver state was forked via a dependency specification like <code>quux ; sys_platform == &quot;linux&quot;</code>, and then we come across a dependency specification like <code>foo ; sys_platform == &quot;windows&quot;</code>, then we should ignore that dependency entirely in that specific fork of the resolver because it can never happen.</p>
