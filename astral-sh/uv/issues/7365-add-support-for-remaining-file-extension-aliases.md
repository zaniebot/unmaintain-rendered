# Add support for remaining file extension aliases

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-13 15:54_

See: https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/111eed14b6e9fba7c78a5ec2b7594812d17b5d2b/src/pip/_internal/utils/filetypes.py#L8.

It's an identical change to #7201, but with a different set of aliases. Good first PR for anyone interested.
