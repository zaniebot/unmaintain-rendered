            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello,
I am trying to examine a migration from poetry to uv, and there's a specific feature I just couldn't find in uv, which is critical for me.</p>
<p>In poetry, I could install local directories of the project as packages, so that I could import them from anywhere and there would be no problem, whether it's scripts, tests, just ipython.</p>
<p>The way I did it in pyproject.toml in poetry is the following:
<code>packages = [{ include = &quot;package1&quot;, from = &quot;back/deps&quot; },{ include = &quot;package2&quot;, from = &quot;back/subdir&quot; }]</code></p>
<p>package1 and package2 have<code> __init__.py</code>, but are not python packages. They don't have <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>setup.py</code> or anything.
package1 also has subdirectories with <code>__init__.py</code>, for example I need to be able to <code>import package1.schema.types</code></p>
<p>What is uv's way to deal with such dependencies? I couldn't find a way which doesn't force me to make them a package.
Thank you</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The structure and contents of what you install is managed by the build backend, not by uv; you could even keep the poetry core backend to install packages as you used to do while using the uv cli interface for installing. Overall, we do recommend using workspaces and the regular package structure for easier maintenance and better tooling integration.</p>
