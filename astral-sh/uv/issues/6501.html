            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there, thanks for this tool, it's been a pleasure to use!</p>
<p>I have a feature request that I think would be useful. In conda you can have globally accessible envs and activate them anywhere with <code>conda activate env_name</code>. These envs simply live in <code>~/.miniconda</code>. I really like this feature because I often find myself keeping an old venv while working on a feature that requires a new dependency and creating a new venv for that. I think it would be nice to be able to run <code>uv activate env_name</code> from anywhere instead of <code>source path/to/project/.venv/bin/activate</code>. This would likely require an option when creating a venv, e.g <code>-n &lt;env_name&gt;</code> which would then automatically store the env somewhere sensible under that name and allow for <code>uv activate env_name</code></p>
<p>This definitely may be out of scope for uv, so feel free to ignore it :smile:</p>
