# Uv build default

---

_Issue opened by @HoseynAAmiri on 2025-07-22 16:29_

### Question

How can I make new project or library build default to hatchling instead of uv_build? It seems like the new version of uv (v8.1) uses uv_build now instead of hatchling (v7.1).

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

_No response_

I'd recommend using `--build-backend hatchling`. There's not a persistent setting,
