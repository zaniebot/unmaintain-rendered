Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Now that uv has support for managing projects, it would be great to know the current <em>state</em> of uv. By state, I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a project is detected, what's the name of the project?</li>
<li>What is the path to the python interpreter that will be used</li>
<li>What virtual environment will be used</li>
<li>... and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, pdm has <code>pdm info</code> which shows information about the current state of the environment. Similarly, rye has <code>rye show</code> which does something similar. It would be nice if <code>uv</code> supported a similar command.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is already a point of discussoin in #5966</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would expect the command <code>uv show</code> to take an additional argument. I feel like saying &quot;uv show what?&quot;. The verb &quot;show&quot; in English takes an object.</p>
<p>The command <code>pip show &lt;packagename&gt;</code> takes a package name as an argument, and <code>uv pip show &lt;packagename&gt;</code> follows this design. The <code>apt</code> command also takes a package name as an argument: <code>apt show &lt;packagename&gt;</code> (on Debian and Debian-based Linux distributions). NPM also follows this pattern: <code>npm show &lt;packagename&gt;</code></p>
<p>I'm not against the idea of this subcommand in principle, I just would like it to be named something other than &quot;show&quot;. I think <code>rye show</code> is the only example I can find of a show subcommand that does not take an additional argument.</p>
