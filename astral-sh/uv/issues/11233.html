<p>While trying to install torch on an external harddrive, I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>[2025-02-04 19:49:50.325] [info]    × Failed to download `typing-extensions==4.12.2`
  ├─:arrow_forward: Failed to read from the distribution cache
  ╰─:arrow_forward: Incorrect function. (os error 1)
  help: `typing-extensions` (v4.12.2) was included because `torch`
        (v2.6.0+cu124) depends on `typing-extensions`
PS D:\&gt; echo &quot;_-end-1738727383800:$?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I noticed this only happens when the drive is exFat format. NTFS works fine. Also I set these environment variables to also live on the external drive:</p>
<pre><code>UV_CACHE_DIR
UV_TOOL_DIR
UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR
UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR

</code></pre>
<p>I tried setting the cache on the main file system and I get a warning that the file systems are differentm, but it still works ultimately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So both <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> and the install target are on an exFAT drive? Is it fixed by setting <code>UV_LINK_MODE=copy</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, both cache dir and the install target are on the drive.
I tried <code>UV_LINK_MODE=copy</code> and <code>symlink</code> and both give the same error. I wonder if it's because uv is not on the external drive? The main drive is on a different file system.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It shouldn't matter that we're on different drives, afaik.</p>
<p>Interesting that it fails on <em>read</em></p>

<p>Can you share debug logs as described in #9452? Is there a reason you bypassed our issue template?</p>
