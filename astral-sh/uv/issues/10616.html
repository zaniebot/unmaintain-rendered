            <div class="timeline-body"><p>we'd like to read and operate uv configuration and lockfiles from Python code.</p>
<p>Instead of using Json or Toml parser directly on those files, is there any proper way to do stuff like this in Python project.</p>
<p>like <code>import uv.dependencies</code> or <code>import uv.configurations</code>.</p>
