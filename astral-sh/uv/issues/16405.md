# Set console title when using `uv run`

---

_Issue opened by @moi90 on 2025-10-22 07:18_

### Summary

I think it would be helpful if `uv run` would set the console title to the binary/script that is executed. When using `uv run` inside `tmux`, all the panels are just called "uv", which is not really helpful.

### Example

Executing `uv run script.py` would automatically change the console title to `script.py`.

Noting: the escape sequence for setting a console/terminal/tab title isn't super well standardized, so this might not be easy to do in a broadly compatible fashion.

(Some terminals, like Ghostty, also restrict in-band title manipulation, since it's been a source of [exploits](https://dgl.cx/2024/12/ghostty-terminal-title)).
