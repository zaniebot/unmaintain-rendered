<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
the project was created by uv init.
suppose that my current python version is 3.12.1,how can it be upgrade to 3.12.4.I am not sure if I can make it by changing pyproject.toml or .python-version.or I just use uv to manage dependencies?

```
uv --version
uv 0.4.27 (36b729e92 2024-10-25)
```

Even though patch versions can cause compatibility issues, you can still switch the Python version for your virtual environment. Here's how: ``uv venv -p 3.12.4 --allow-existing``
```
      --allow-existing                       Preserve any existing files or directories at the target path
 ```
 However, I got this method from this comment (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8217#issuecomment-2455693139), so for more detailed information, you might need to refer to it.

what is the best practise,if the python version is required to be updated?I only use **uv pip** to manage packages now.
I am using conda as virtual env manager.when I want to change the python env,just issue **conda activate {env}**
uv is a tools to manage python packages and python environments,which can be recorded in file and committed in vcs.
how can I migrate from conda/venv  projects to uv projects?

If you want specificity at the patch level, I'd say update your `.python-version` to be explicit with `3.12.4`

@zffocussss If you only use conda for managing virtual environments and don't need to install any dependencies with conda or have a centralized need for managing virtual environments, then you can use ``uv venv`` to create virtual environments instead.
As for the document of ``uv pip``: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/
In essence, the choice to migrate is determined by your reliance on conda-specific features that are not offered by alternative tools.

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-09-02 19:54_

We added `uv python upgrade` for this purpose.
