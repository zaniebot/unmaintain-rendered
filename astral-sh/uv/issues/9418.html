<p>I am in the process of creating a bunch of projects that all require the same index settings and <code>constraint-dependencies</code>. I was wondering it is possible to create a project with <code>uv init</code> and pass some kind of option to use a file as a template. I tried <code>--config-file</code> passing a <code>uv.toml</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>[[index]]
name = &quot;some_index&quot;
url = &quot;some_url&quot;
explicit = true

[sources]
some_dep = { index = &quot;some_index&quot; }

# see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7703">astral-sh/uv#7703</a>
constraint-dependencies = [&quot;kaleido!=0.2.1.post1&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>but it did nothing. Note that using a workspace is not an option for me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see. I&#x27;m not using a workspace because I need all projects to be independent from each other and with their own venv folder.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just some input on this for design purposes. Somewhat different use-case I suppose, happy to move if there&#x27;s a better spot for it:</p>
<p>I find myself lately <strong>creating a lot of small projects</strong>; probably has something to do with AI tools like Cursor allowing creating a project to explore something instead of just using a free-standing script. Even though they&#x27;re small I want <code>uv</code> (already indispensable) and Git, etc., since these &quot;side projects&quot; have a habit of growing beyond initial expectations.</p>
<p>When I create a new project, I find myself always <strong>copying <code>ruff</code>, <code>pyright</code>, and <code>pytest</code> settings into <code>pyproject.toml</code> from a prior project</strong> since I use mostly the same settings on most all my projects; line length, strict mode, which lints to use/exclude, etc.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a developer frequently using <code>uv</code> to create a new project
I would like to configure <code>pyproject.toml</code> settings to be added to each new project during <code>uv init</code>
Such that hand-customization of a new project with routine details is minimized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m sure there are other settings that would be worthwhile to &quot;templatize&quot;, but this is the aspect that I see drawing my attention most frequently in recent experience.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this would be really useful. uv is great for managing many small projects, even when not using workspaces. Having some kind of <code>pytemplate.toml</code> in a parent directory and/or in the home config folder, which automatically gets picked up by uv init and adds the configuration from <code>pytemplate.toml</code>, can be useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe not the ideal solution, but I have been using a <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> template to have this functionality: https://github.com/tim-hilde/dotfiles/tree/main/cookiecutter/python_minimal</p>
