Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Previously, I was using an older version of <code>typer</code> where you needed to add the <code>typer[all]</code> extra to get full functionality. I deleted that extra since it is no longer needed, but for some reason, whenever I run <code>uv sync --upgrade</code>, I get warning messages about it. Seems like maybe this old dep config is sticking around in a cache somewhere?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, do you have a way to reproduce? I wasn't able to reproduce.</p>
<p>I don't see an extra in <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/typer/blob/master/pyproject.toml">typer </a> called <code>all</code> in 0.12.5.
It seems <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/typer/blob/0.11.1/pyproject.toml">0.11.x</a> did have it.</p>
<p>When I installed 0.11.x with all and upgraded it to 0.12.5 I didn't get a warning unless <code>all</code> was still referenced in pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>Lastly, which version of <code>uv</code> are you using?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I need to try a minimal example as well, but what you are describing is more or less what I believe I did. I do have other deps that also rely on <code>typer</code> and it may be possible that they had <code>typer[all]</code> in their <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but I also did not see anything that looked like an extra related to <code>typer</code> anywhere in my project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems likely the request comes from a transitive dependency?</p>
<p>We just display this warning whenever we look at a package request https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/5ab860be20e75451c3c9c779c5f552b3fd0cb2ad/crates/uv-resolver/src/resolution/graph.rs#L347-L354</p>
<p>I don't think it'd be easy for us to display where the request came from in this context.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was getting this exact warning today when i was upgrading a FastAPI app from Poetry to uv. Turns out I had forgotten to delete the OLD <code>.venv</code> from Poetry which still had an older version of <strong>something</strong> that wanted <code>typer[all]</code>. Deleted the <code>.venv</code> and issue was gone.</p>
<p>EDIT: actually turns out it was another external library (ironically one of my own) that still used the <code>typer[all]</code> dep. Fixed this and all good so it's prob similar for your case</p>
