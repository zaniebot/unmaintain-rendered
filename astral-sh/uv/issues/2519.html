This should probably happen after upstreaming the ability to customize the error message for each constraint. Which in turn is dependent on https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/190</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've just run into a similar issue with how verbose <em>uv pip compile</em> is which was more than just a slight inconvenience since we run it as a docker build step and docker compose truncates the step output at 2 MiB with no work-around (maybe a work-around with buildx but not docker compose build - see https://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/484 and https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6332 for context). I see the output of <em>uv pip compile</em> for a while then just:  <em>[output clipped, log limit 2MiB reached]</em></p>
<p>A dependency error happened after that but I spent hours looking for a Docker limit work-around to no avail and ended up having to hack the constraints to find out what the problem dependency was. I was checking the <em>uv pip compile</em> arguments to see if there's a way to make it less verbose or only show errors but I saw no options, other than <em>--quiet</em> which I didn't try because it sounded like that would remove all output completely and I wasn't sure if that included errors)</p>
