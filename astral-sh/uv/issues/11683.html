            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Support for HTTP (not HTTPS) as a Git URL was discontinued starting from version 0.6.2 of uv. However, we are still utilizing this in our internal server, and we would like to continue using it.</p>
<p>We would like to request the reintroduction of this feature. Alternatively, if there is any workaround or alternative solution, please let us know.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
