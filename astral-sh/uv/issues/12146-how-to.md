### Question

How to set a centralized path for venv so that uv looks only in one directory? I have a disk with a small amount of memory, on which all projects are and a separate E disk for pip/docker/TEMP/poetry/cache. I want to move uv environments to E:\uv-venvs, but I don't understand whether this feature has been implemented in more than half a year since the last similar issue.

### Platform

Windows10 22H2 64bit

### Version

latest

This looks like a duplicate of #1495.

You can set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` if you'd like, to override the virtual environment location on a per-project basis.
