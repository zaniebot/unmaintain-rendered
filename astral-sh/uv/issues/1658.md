# Failed to Detect the Operating System Version

---

_Issue opened by @PeterParker on 2024-02-18 17:32_

Using `uv venv` inside a [RedHat UBI9 Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/redhat/ubi9/tags) leads to an error after failing to detect the operation system version:

```
#144 ... RUN uv venv --verbose
#144 0.174   × Failed to detect the operating system version: Couldn't parse /bin/ls for
#144 0.174   │ detecting the ld version: Invalid magic number: 0x622f7273752f2123
#144 ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c uv venv --verbose" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

I have installed `binutils` and ensured that `ld` is available.

A simplified Dockerfile to reproduce would be something like this:

```
FROM redhat/ubi9:9.2

RUN yum -y update && yum -y install binutils python-pip
RUN pip install uv
RUN uv venv
```

Actually, I was running `0.1.2` and it looks like it has already been fixed in `0.1.4`.

Closing, apologies for noise.
