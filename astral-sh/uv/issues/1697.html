            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since virutalenv 20, it's included a <code>virtualenv=</code> field in <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> to indicate the version of virtualenv that created the venv. It would be nice to provide a similar <code>uv=</code> (suggested) field to report the version of uv used to create the virtualenv. This would also help nox detect which tool created the virtual environment to handle switching more elegantly.</p>
<p>There is a <code>gourgeist</code> field, don't know what that is, but if I can be sure that always means <code>uv</code>, that would be fine (though knowing the uv version would still be nice). Though from some quick searches, perhaps it would only be there <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/b76efc62a72ed8031aa91ae80bb1b4a159bd3d21/crates/gourgeist/README.md?plain=1#L5">on UNIX systems</a>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>gourgeist</code> is the crate by @konstin that actually manages virtual environments. It'd make sense to have it accept a name / version to pass through though and use <code>uv</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(To avoid confusion: there's a version at https://github.com/konstin/gourgeist but we ended up moving all the crates into this repo so that we could develop them as a monorepo. We'll likely either deprecate https://github.com/konstin/gourgeist and publish from here in the future, or back changes from this repo back out to https://github.com/konstin/gourgeist. But all development should happen on the version of <code>gourgeist</code> in <code>crates</code>.)</p>
