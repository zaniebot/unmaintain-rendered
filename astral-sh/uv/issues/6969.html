            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a feature request to be able to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">declare script dependencies</a> directly in the first cell of a jupyter notebook.  This way we could have completely isolated environment per notebook.  We would have to be able to use <code>uv run</code> with jupyter notebooks and the vscode scenario would also need to be looked at with extensions, but this would be awesome.</p>
