            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi all, thanks for making uv!</p>
<p>I'm trying to make a monorepo with uv and I'd love to do some base uv configuration in the root level <code>pyproject.toml</code>. Things that are most likely to be the same for all packages, e.g. package indices. But I'm not using workspaces because the packages will have conflicting dependencies. This is also listed as a reason in the docs, see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/#when-not-to-use-workspaces But some packages will have some custom uv config in <code>[tool.uv]</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> but I noticed that this will cause the package to ignore everything set in <code>[tool.uv]</code> by the root <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I suppose this is intentional, but I could imagine my use case being relevant as well.</p>
<p>After all, I saw that ruff offers some explicit opt-in to inherit from some other config, see https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#extend which is really good for my use case! (I wish pyright and pytest would make it as easy... edit: pyright actually has an <code>extends</code> option, see <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration?id=environment-options">here</a>. pytest does not prioritize that as of now, see <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13173">here</a>)</p>
<p>Relatedly, there already seems to be some config merging logic https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/ but it's only for <code>uv.toml</code> user/system-level files.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Not exactly sure about the exact design of it but having this</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># ./pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
required-version = &quot;&gt;=0.5.25&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># ./sub/pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>it would be cool to have some way to let the <code>./sub/pyproject.toml</code> inherit the <code>required-version</code> from <code>./pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe like ruff does it</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># ./sub/pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
extend = &quot;../pyproject.toml&quot;
environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we're somewhat unlikely to do this, but I understand the problem you're facing. I don't <em>think</em> we'd do the same thing in Ruff if we were to re-implement it today. The inheritance causes a lot of complexity and confusion for users. We <em>do</em> support inheritance of user- and system-level settings (e.g., <code>~/.config/uv/uv.toml</code> as in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/ -- that gets combined with your <code>pyproject.toml</code>), so that's one option, but it doesn't help with sharing across a team.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're facing this as well as our monorepo gets larger. Each package probably has a 100 lines worth of cut-n-pasted <code>pyproject.toml</code> to configure ruff, mypy, and pytest.</p>
