<p>Running <code>uv help</code> works just fine.</p>
<h3>Interesting solution</h3>
<p>Renaming uv.exe from <code>.venv/Scripts/uv.exe</code> actually makes installation work</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Typically you would install uv globally, since uv doesn't need to be in the virtual environment in order to create it or install into it. (But it's also a known issue on Windows that uv cannot uninstall itself.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahh that's not really clear from the instructions. I assumed it's like <code>pip</code> where it needs to be installed in the virtualenv!</p>
