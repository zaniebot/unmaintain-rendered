# outdated command for uv install on landing page

---

_Issue opened by @BenediktMaag on 2025-02-10 08:26_

### Summary

On https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation the installation command says:

- powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

but on https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer it says:

- powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

which is actually the command you need to paste unless you have already set the execution policy globally.

Please update the line on the landing patch to that of the installation page.
