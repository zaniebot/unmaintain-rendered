# there is no version of certifi==2024.8.30

_Issue opened by @robinjhuang on 2024-09-21 02:33_

uv: 4.14 on Windows

Called this: `python.exe -m uv pip install -r C:\Users\...\requirements.compiled`

Got this error. I am confused because certifi 2024.8.30 DOES exist on pypi.

```

   Because there is no version of certifi==2024.8.30 and you require

I think you'll need to provide the `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` (as in the header of the file)

See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#packages-that-exist-on-multiple-indexes for details

Thanks for the quick response. @zanieb 

Why is `unsafe-best-match` needed? I thought the default `first-match` behavior is to search all the indexes until a match is found? If it cannot find it on the `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121` url, it should look on pypi simple?

 The error makes it seem like it cannot find the match on any index?

I think the error message could be improved. With `first-match` if there's _another_ version of the package on the first index we won't look at further indexes for that packages (to defend against dependency confusion attacks).

So it found another version of the package and stopped looking. Thanks for explaining!

I'll be adding a hint to the error message explaining this soon.
