# Unable to Install PyQt5 on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 with uv

---

_Issue opened by @nimaxin on 2025-03-18 12:16_

### Question

I'm trying to install the `pyqt5` library on a Linux server with the following specifications:
```
OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble)
Architecture: ARM64 (aarch64)
```
However, when I run:
```uv add pyqt5```

I get this error:
```bash
error: Distribution `pyqt5-qt5==5.15.16 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
```
It seems that there's no pre-built pyqt5 package for arm64. I tested this on an x86_64 machine, and it worked fine.

I’ve tried solutions from stackoverflow and ai generated suggestions, but none of them worked.

The only way I managed to install pyqt5 was using:
```sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5```

However, my project uses uv, and I’d prefer to install it that way.
Any workaround to make it work with uv on arm64?

### Platform
OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble)
Architecture: ARM64 (aarch64)

### Version
uv 0.5.11

Unfortunately no, if there's no prebuilt wheels shipped for ARM Linux, then I think the best we can do is build from source!

I tried building from source several times but couldn't get it to work, so I decided to migrate my server to an x86 architecture.

x86 also has this problem, but using `uv pip install PyQt5` is OK
