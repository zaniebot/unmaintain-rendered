Yes. You can run with `--dry-run` to see an example path:

```
❯ uv sync --script foo.py --dry-run
Would create script environment at: /Users/crmarsh/.cache/uv/environments-v2/foo-2c4831fb2085849c
```

Is the result of using uv run foo.py --dry-run the same as the command you mentioned above?

There is no `--dry-run` on `uv run`, but the command would ultimately use the same environment, yeah.
