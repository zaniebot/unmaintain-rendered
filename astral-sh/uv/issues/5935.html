            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a way that I can utilize <code>uv</code> to install packages sourced from a conda base environment into a virtual environment created with <code>uv</code>?</p>
<p>My use case is that I have an offline system with the Anaconda python distribution used solely for the bundled interpreter and  packages provided.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t really want to utilize <code>conda</code> for creating virtual environments with their YAML file approach. I&#x27;d much rather utilize <code>uv</code> for package management &amp; virtual environment creation, and define my project dependencies the normal way with <code>pyproject.toml</code> (with the obvious limitation that any projects on the system have to utilize pinned versions of packages available in the Anaconda distribution).</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>It seems like <code>uv</code> is not actually creating a venv with the system site-packages. It doesn&#x27;t detect <code>pytest</code> as being already installed in the venv (<code>pytest==7.4.4</code> ships with Anaconda).</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what the <code>pyproject.toml</code> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don&#x27;t really respect <code>--system-site-packages</code>. We allow writing it to the virtualenv, but we don&#x27;t actually query it, it just makes them available at the runtime.</p>
<p>I think there&#x27;s no way to accomplish what you&#x27;re describing. If you were using the Conda environment and installing packages etc., we&#x27;d respect <em>those</em>, but we don&#x27;t support reading packages from another environment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--no-dev</code> applies when installing, not when resolving. To sync, we have to resolve, and the resolution is failing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree I don&#x27;t think we can really support this. I think you&#x27;d have to use <code>uv pip install --no-deps</code> or something and remove all the existing dependencies from a <code>requirements.txt</code>?  Seems a bit weird.</p>
<p>Sorry we aren&#x27;t much help here. Let us know if you figure something out!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we may eventually support using a system environment with <code>uv sync</code>, but I don&#x27;t know that we can support this kind of &quot;layered&quot; environment.</p>
