# ARMv7 Linux Musl

---

_Issue opened by @dynasticorpheus on 2024-02-16 05:54_

As ruff enthusiast I would love to see uv-armv7-unknown-linux-musl target made available for this great initiative. Very useful for environments like Alphine linux and OpenWRT.

Just want to confirm that the [uv-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.1.2/uv-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz) variant doesn't work here, right?

@charliermarsh Ok I need more coffee it seems, only checked the table where it is not mentioned but not actual assets list. I do however get below error when trying to venv on OpenWRT master build.

```
uv -v  venv test

Failed to detect the operating system version: Couldn't detect either glibc version nor musl libc version, at least one of which is required
```

Clearing the cache does seem to work

```
uv -v clean

Clearing cache at: /mnt/usb02/data/.cache/uv
Removed 2 files (44B)
```
