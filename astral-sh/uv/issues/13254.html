            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Thanks for adding the <code>uv version</code> command! I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bug or not, but it feels strange that the version number in uv.lock is not updated by <code>uv version</code>.</p>
<p>We currently have a dynamic version number in pyproject.toml. In the CI pipeline we set the version of the build in an env var, then do:</p>
<pre><code>uv sync --locked # locked to ensure the build is reproduceable and pyproject.toml matches uv.lock
uv run --no-sync ruff check
# Some other stuff
uv build
# Some other stuff
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to change this so we just set the version number in pyproject.toml at the start of the CI run using <code>uv version 1.2.3</code>. This doesn&#x27;t work as the subsequent <code>uv sync --locked</code> step gives the error &quot;The lockfile at <code>uv.lock</code> needs to be updated, but <code>--locked</code> was provided. To update the lockfile, run <code>uv lock</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>The error makes sense, but wouldn&#x27;t it be better to either update the lock file as part of <code>uv version</code> or perhaps even omit the version from uv.lock like when dynamic versions are used?</p>
<p>I could solve this by doing <code>uv version 1.2.3 &amp;&amp; uv lock</code> after the sync (some of our later stages require it to be locked) but it feels wrong.</p>

<p>I think this is even breaking the <code>uv version</code> command, not sure if there is a priority for bugs but this one is definitely an important one</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Additionally, it seems that <code>lock</code> and <code>sync</code> do something slightly different. If I do a <code>lock</code> after a <code>version</code> update the lock file gets updated, but then if I later do a <code>sync</code> I get a message saying that the package version is updated. The latter only happens once and doesn&#x27;t seem to change the lock file, but it&#x27;s unclear why it does that if all the files are already up to date.</p>

<p>Good news the fix is written and will hopefully land soon (it&#x27;s unfortunately a bit of a non-trivial change, in spite of the net effect usually being &quot;edit this one string in a toml file&quot;).</p>
