# Ignore the plus suffix in the version

_Issue opened by @ismail on 2024-02-16 11:28_

If you have too much time on your hands and compile CPython from git, you get a version like this

```
❯ /usr/local/work/cpython-3.12/bin/python3 --version
Python 3.12.2+
```

`uv` atm doesn't like the `+` at the end:

```
❯ uv venv -p /usr/local/work/cpython-3.12/bin/python3 envs/stats
  × Querying Python at `/usr/local/work/cpython-3.12/bin/python3.12` did not return the expected data: found a `+` indicating the start of
  │ a local component in a version, but did not find any alpha-numeric ASCII segment following the `+` at line 1 column 353:
  │ --- stdout:
  │ {"markers": {"implementation_name": "cpython", "implementation_version": "3.12.2", "os_name": "posix", "platform_machine":
  │ "x86_64", "platform_python_implementation": "CPython", "platform_release": "5.10.209-175.858.amzn2int.x86_64", "platform_system":

  │ "/usr/local/work/cpython-3.12/lib/python3.12", "sys_executable": "/usr/local/work/cpython-3.12/bin/python3.12"}
  │ --- stderr:

  │ ---
```

It'd be nice if `uv` can be more relaxed in version parsing.

Thanks for reporting. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1357 reports a similar issue and we'll use that one to track our work.
