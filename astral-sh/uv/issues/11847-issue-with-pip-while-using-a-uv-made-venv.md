# Issue with pip while using a UV made venv

---

_Issue opened by @Elmekior on 2025-02-28 03:04_

### Summary

Hello! 

It looks like there is a problem with the way pip is handled inside of a uv generated virtual environment

```
uv init --name "test" --no-readme --python "3.7" --python-preference only-managed --no-package
uv venv --python-preference only-managed --seed --link-mode=copy
```

Once this is done, I activate the venv and then do a pip list and get the following error 

```
(uv_venv) PS F:\Project\uv\uv_venv> pip list
  File "F:\Project\uv\uv_venv\.venv\Scripts\pip.exe", line 1
SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xe8' in file F:\Project\uv\uv_venv\.venv\Scripts\pip.exe on line 2, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
```

I am unsure if this could affect other executable launched this way. 

### Platform

Windows 11

### Version

0.6.3

### Python version

3.7.9

Does this occur on Python 3.8 and later? We don't officially support Python 3.7.

I just tested and it works with a python version of 3.9 generated by UV ( My system was Python 3.9 in both cases), same was tested with 3.8 so those are good

I have a workaround for now in 3.7 ( which is one of the version my company is targetting) which is to directly call python -m pip list instead of just pip list from the command line. Sorry for opening the issue, I didn't realize 3.7 wasn't officially supported :)

I believe this would be closed by https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8649, but it's unclear if that PR will be merged, since we don't support Python 3.7.

I can certainly understand the reasoning behind all of this. In my case, we are still working with Python 3.7 systems and updating this is out of my scope for the next 2 years at the very least. 

I understand you guys not wanting to support python 3.7 for most of the UV code but hopefully this gets patched at least so that the generated venv has the same behavior than the others. I'll watch this ticket from time to time to see if this ever gets resolved :) 

Again appreciate the time and help
