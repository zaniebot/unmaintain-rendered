            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>After a period of use, I would like to say that uv is the ultimate python package solver.</p>
<p>But I still  feel uncomfortable about the way uv handle with mutli-env.</p>
<p>uv allow user create another venv in workspace, but this new venv will not be directly used by uv even after activated. Unless you specific the python interpreter.</p>
<p>This is a very counter-intuitive setup. Because it&#x27;s obvious that user want to use the new venv directly after activate it.</p>
<p>By my view, this is because uv insist on  &quot;one project, on env&quot; idea. But, I would still suggest that uv should allow more flexible conda-like venv switch. As this will not only benefits the user, but also will  attract more conda users.</p>
Example
<p>After  <code>uv venv env_name</code> and <code>env_name/bin/activate</code>, the <code>uv run</code> should directly use new env&#x27;s python interpreter not the .venv&#x27;s python.</p>

<p>What&#x27;s your use-case for creating a second environment in a project? Have you tried using the <code>--active</code> flag?</p>

<p>I see. And yes, I tried <code>--active</code>, but still I would argue this is not a intuitive setup.</p>
<p>I want make a project to do some practice on different RL architectures  (like a RL Gym) and compare those stuff&#x27;s performance . And I was kind worry about these architectures conflict with each other. So I try to use multi-env with uv.</p>
<p>And here we are.</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion.</p>
<p>I realized that I was still using conda-mind. I know how uv handle with these problems now.</p>
