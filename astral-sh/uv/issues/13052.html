            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently, <code>uv sync</code> is exact by default and <code>uv run</code> is inexact by default. <code>uv run</code> being inexact by default has led to some &quot;this worked for me when I tried it&quot; confusion here so we'd find it helpful if there was a configuration setting that would make <code>uv run</code> exact by default as well.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For example, a setting</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
run-exact = true
</code></pre>
<p>That would have the effect of passing <code>--exact</code> to every invocation of <code>uv run</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ran into this too - the difference in behavior between <code>sync</code> and <code>run</code> is really mysterious and does lead to confusion. I think a common mental model is that &quot;uv run automatically syncs before running&quot;, so if the behavior between the two differs, it becomes not the case.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the backwards compatibility constraints are for the project, but if at all possible, it would be great to</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the default for <code>run</code> to <code>--exact</code> to match <code>sync</code></li>
<li>Allow adding a setting to use <code>inexact</code> by default when desired / to preserve existing behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise being able to at least force exact at the config level would still help.</p>
