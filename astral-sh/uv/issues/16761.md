# Support proactive cache pruning

---

_Issue opened by @paveldikov on 2025-11-17 15:25_

### Summary

# The use case
`uv cache prune` is great. It is a relatively cheap operation and it helps a lot with managing storage, and also repairing cache locations that have been wrecked by services external to `uv`, such as `tmpwatch` (see also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6147)

The problem is that I need to remember to call it, or more precisely, to educate/remind my users to call it. This is easier said than done...

# The proposal
Support a very simple best-effort mechanism whereby I can define something along the lines of

```toml
# uv.toml
cache_prune_freq = "2d"
```

And then, when I run `uv sync` or `uv pip install` or whatever, the command will -- before it runs! -- evaluate whether a prune is in order, and if so, do the prune.
