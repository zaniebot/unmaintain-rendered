            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a monorepo where that has <code>project.requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;</code>. Most of the apps + libraries use Python 3.13. One of the workspace members has to be pinned to 3.12 due to a dependency.</p>
<p>When I run <code>uv</code>, I get the conflicting Python Requirements error.</p>
<p>Is there a way to have workspace members have conflicting Python Requirements without an error?</p>
<p>Or do I need a workaround...I tried to have the app requires the Pinned 3.12 configured with <code>project.requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;</code> while setting <code>tool.uv.python-version = &quot;3.12&quot;</code>...with the other apps having <code>tool.uv.python-version = &quot;3.13&quot;</code> but it didn't work.</p>
<p>I removed the conflicting apps from the workspace members...and that worked.</p>
<p>I guess I can reason about the baseline libraries that supports all apps can be a workspace member. But the conflicting apps + conflicting libraries must be excluded. Fortunately dependency sources can be added using <code>path</code>...so it works. I suppose supporting multiple versions of python in a workspace is out of the scope of this library.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AnhQuanTrl I created a separate VirtualEnv for each package in the monorepo. And had no workspace members in the root package.</p>
