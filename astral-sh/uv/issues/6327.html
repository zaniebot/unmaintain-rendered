Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>We have the environment variable <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> in combination with cache sharing across users. It seems that when a python version is downloaded, it doesn't end up in the cache dir. Resulting in each user downloading the python version separately.</p>
<p>I'm assuming this isn't intended behavior as <code>uv python install --help</code> does include the 'Cache options' section</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah the Python versions are installed into the &quot;data&quot; directory rather than the &quot;cache&quot; directory. You can set <code>UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR</code> or <code>XDG_DATA_HOME</code> to control this.</p>
