Do you have minimal example code that we can run that shows the problem, and can you show a screenshot from a regular Python vs. a screenshot from an Astral-provided Python?

**The following is the comparison between English and Chinese of tkinter with Python 3.13 installed via uv.**
This is the default font size.

This is font size 15 (with font size 15, some font sizes may still directly result in garbled characters).

We might need to build Xft or fontconfig/freetype/something in python-build-standalone.

(Honestly I expect we'll get comments about fonts in English now that matplotlib is working....)
