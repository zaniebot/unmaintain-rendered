            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I would like to have <code>pypy3</code> in my PATH so I can run it when I know I need PyPy specifically, but also keep CPython as the default <code>python3</code> in my PATH. This doesn't seem possible with <code>uv python install</code> at the moment.</p>
<p>Currently, running <code>uv python install pypy --preview</code> installs it as <code>python3.11</code> and adding <code>--default</code> installs it as <code>python</code>/<code>python3</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I opened a PR based on the idea that this would not be configurable — which might not be what the Astral folks have in mind.</p>
<p>It would be my preference though, and matches what other package managers like <code>brew</code> or <code>apt</code> do.</p>
