            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello astral team!
We're designing a UI that dynamically creates venvs, installs packages and runs subprocesses. For the venv creation and package installation bit, we're using uv (of course!) in the backgroud because of its speed.
Now even if uv is super fast, our users still have to wait for a few minutes sometimes and would like to get some information on the current venv creation / package installation status. Of course, we could simply redirect stdout to a console somewhere in the UI but I'd like to get something a little bit more UX friendly, like displaying a progress bar from our UI front end framework (PyQt to name it).
So, I don't know if it is/would be possible to have an option on the two commands we're using here (<code>uv venv</code> and <code>uv pip install</code>) to replace the standard output by something rather simple e.g. <code>0/10</code>, <code>1/10</code>, ... that we could easily send through a regex and integrate in the UI?
Cheers,
Matt</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's an interesting idea... but I'm a bit inclined to have this kind negotiated with json(-lines) output, similar to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages">how cargo/rustc does it</a>. Potentially related:</p>
