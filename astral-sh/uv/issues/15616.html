            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I like to use <code>uv</code> to handle building documentation with sphinx for non-python programs.</p>
<p>For this reason, the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file can contain stuff which wouldn't be valid for a python project.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>project.name</code> might have spaces, or the version might be <code>0.7.6-nbxyz7.r12</code>.</p>
<p>Currently, uv will generate a warning, and that is fine.</p>
<p>This ticket is just to please consider not making these warnings become errors, unless there's a flag to ignore this new behavior.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately, PEP 621 mandates specific rules for name and version for a valid <code>pyproject.toml</code>. For those projects, sphinx should offer options (such as <code>tool.sphinx</code>) to override the display name and display version to avoid creating an invalid <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see the point concerning adding this to sphinx. But that would require <code>uv venv .venv</code> to know it's only for a sphinx usage.</p>
<p>But I will counterpoint that <code>uv venv .venv</code>, or <code>uv pip install</code> doesn't need (in some cases), to check if the name or version is correct. This is the part were it shows a warning. Maybe it should check/warn only if the name/version is used for something.</p>
<p>Of course, would it become an error, I would change my workflow. But I think I just needed to raise the point.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is not an issue around uv's behavior, it's about <code>pyproject.toml</code> being defined with a schema that only allows specific values for <code>project.name</code> and <code>project.version</code>. I'm surprised that Sphinx allows this, given that it's bound to the same rules and will fail to publish if it uses a non-compliant <code>pyproject.toml</code> itself. uv assumes a valid Python project for its operations, and we can't guarantee that we'll continue to accept invalid <code>pyproject.toml</code> files in the future.</p>
<p>What Sphinx settings are you using, do you have a reproducible example? According to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#project-information Sphinx uses strings in Python, for which the strings you shared are valid. I couldn't find references to using <code>pyproject.toml</code> for configuration in their docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't Sphinx behavior. Sphinx probably doesn't even use pyproject.toml. It's more of a workflow issue, or a layout issue.</p>
<p>In the project, pre-commit and sphinx is used. But this isn't a python project. Some tools, such as codespell (used via pre-commit), use pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>For Sphinx, building in a venv is recommended. Since I'm moving from (...) to uv, I now have these warnings.</p>
<p>Because I use template projects (think cookiecutter), the <code>docs/conf.py</code> Sphinx file uses the values from <code>pyproject.toml</code>. This allows the file to be the same amongst all other projects, with only pyproject.toml containing the project specific stuff.</p>
<p>So, in order not to bother you much more, I think I'll add a specific tools.sphinx section, that overrides when required the root name and version.</p>
<p>I just committed and pushed my WIP so you can have a look for yourself (branch uv-example): https://gitlab.com/cappysan/asustor/netboot.xyz/-/tree/uv-example?ref_type=heads</p>
