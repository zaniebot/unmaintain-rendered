            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have two projects, both of which I control -- so this is not a blocker for me, but I think it&#x27;s doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>I have a consuming project, <code>seattle-2025</code>, that has <code>requires-python = &quot;~=3.12.3&quot;</code> and a dependency project, <code>nomnom-hugoawards</code> that has <code>requires-python = &quot;~=3.12.4&quot;</code></p>
<p>On the surface, these seem to be satisfiable when resolving dependencies for <code>seattle-2025</code>; there are plenty of Python versions in the range, including <code>3.12.4</code>.</p>
<p>However, when I attempt to sync, here&#x27;s what I get:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv sync
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (&gt;=3.12.3, &lt;3.13) does not satisfy Python&gt;=3.12.4,&lt;3.13
      and nomnom-hugoawards==2025.0.0b5.dev1 depends on Python&gt;=3.12.4,&lt;3.13, we can conclude that
      nomnom-hugoawards==2025.0.0b5.dev1 cannot be used.
      And because only nomnom-hugoawards==2025.0.0b5.dev1 is available and your project depends on
      nomnom-hugoawards, we can conclude that your project&#x27;s requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (&gt;=3.12.3, &lt;3.13) includes Python versions that are not
      supported by your dependencies (e.g., nomnom-hugoawards==2025.0.0b5.dev1 only supports &gt;=3.12.4,
      &lt;3.13). Consider using a more restrictive `requires-python` value (like &gt;=3.12.4, &lt;3.13).
$ uv --version
uv 0.4.27 (36b729e92 2024-10-25)
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but I would expect dependency resolving to find the intersection of the required python versions, rather than require the consumer to be a superset. I wasn&#x27;t able to infer this behavior from the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#source-distribution">resolver docs</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, I&#x27;d expect 3.12.4 to satisfy the resolver.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Your project needs to be a subset, since right now, your project says it supports Python 3.12.3, but you have a dependency that doesn&#x27;t support that version. We&#x27;re not looking for a single version that works; we&#x27;re looking to create a resolution that works for all the stated Python versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh... okay, that is very much not how I interpreted those bounds.</p>
<p>Fair enough, and I&#x27;ll make the changes on my end -- the nice part about controlling both sides of this!. I suppose on some level this is a documentation bug report, then. Thanks!</p>
