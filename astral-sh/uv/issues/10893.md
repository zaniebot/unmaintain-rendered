# Ability to use `python-dbg` as a python specifier

---

_Issue opened by @adrinjalali on 2025-01-23 11:33_

### Summary

In the context of working on `numpy`, I ended up with a CI using `python3-dbg` failing. In order to reproduce that locally, I would have liked to have a `uv venv -p python312-dbg` or similar to have an environment with that python.

Instead, I had to compile `python-dbg` on my machine, and use that binary as a python specifier.

To be clear, this is what I had to install: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-dbg

Example CI run I'm trying to reproduce: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/runs/12927283485/job/36052517088?pr=26018

### Example

```sh
uv venv -p 312-dbg /path/to/venv
```
