<p>Hi astral team,</p>
<p>When trying to install a package created by another team in my company (and stored on our corporate Artficatory) with the command <code>uv pip install package_name==5.0.1</code>, I get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Using Python 3.7.9 environment at:
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because futures==3.1.1 was yanked (reason: Does not declare incompatibility with Python 3) and package_name==5.0.1 depends on futures==3.1.1, we can conclude that package_name==5.0.1 cannot be
      used.
      And because you require package_name==5.0.1, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>The similar <code>pip install</code> command works fine though, <code>pip</code> only warns about the yanked package but doesn&#x27;t stop the installation, so I&#x27;m wondering how to deal with this case. Is it possible to force install yanked packages with <code>uv pip install</code>? I didn&#x27;t find anything in the doc or in the tracker about it.</p>
<p>Cheers,
Matt</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, if you request the package explicitly, we allow it: <code>uv pip install futures==3.1.1</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @charliermarsh,</p>
<p>Thank you for that. However, the solution isn&#x27;t ideal for my use case, as the <code>uv pip install</code> command is actually automated within a more general package installation tool. In essence, users (who are non-developers) provide a <code>package_name</code> and its <code>version</code> to the GUI tool, and they expect everything to install smoothly. They aren&#x27;t even aware of what the dependencies are.</p>
<p>Therefore, the solution would require first extracting the yanked dependencies and then explicitly appending them to the <code>uv pip install</code> command. I suppose this might be doable, but it seems like it would complicate the process. Do you think it would be possible to add something like a <code>--ignore-yanked-dependencies</code> option to simply skip those during installation?</p>
<p>Cheers,
Matt</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, pip works here because the dependency (or transative dependency) has a pinning requirement (==).</p>
<p>I assume, similar to pre-releaes, that uv calculates upfront from user requirements what yanks it allows?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My understanding is that yanking a package should not break a previous working install. Since uv fails when a transitive dependency is hard pinned but yanked, this is not the case. Perhaps my understanding is wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: from <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/project-management/yanking/">PyPI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A yanked release is a release that is always ignored by an installer, unless it is the only release that matches a <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/">version specifier</a> (using either == or ===).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t know if I have the same problem or not:</p>
<p>I have a package which includes an optional dependency on a yanked version of pyrfc (this it the latest/last version):</p>
<pre><code>[project.optional-dependencies]
sap = [
    &quot;pyrfc==3.3.1&quot;,  # <a href="https://github.com/SAP-archive/PyRFC/issues/372">SAP-archive/PyRFC#372</a>#issuecomment-2483383627
]
</code></pre>
<p>If I use this package from its local path (editable) there&#x27;s no issues with adding <code>my-package[sap]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.sources]
my-package = { path = &quot;../my_package&quot;, editable = true }
</code></pre>
<p>But if I publish it to a corporate index there&#x27;s an error because of the yanked package <em>pyrfc</em>:</p>
<pre><code>[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pypi-local&quot;
url = &quot;https://my.corp/repository/pypi-local/simple/&quot;
explicit = true
</code></pre>
<pre><code>uv add my-package[sap] --index pypi-local=https://my.corp/repository/pypi-local/simple/

  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (platform_machine == &#x27;x86_64&#x27; and sys_platform == &#x27;linux&#x27;):
  ╰─▶ Because pyrfc==3.3.1 was yanked (reason: No longer supported, see <a href="https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/issues/372">SAP/PyRFC#372</a>) and my-package[sap]==0.2.0 depends on pyrfc==3.3.1, we can conclude  
      that my-package[sap]==0.2.0 cannot be used.
      And because only my-package[sap]==0.2.0 is available and your project depends on my-package[sap], we can conclude that your project&#x27;s requirements are unsatisfiable.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When it&#x27;s a local package, there&#x27;s a direct dependency on the yanked version so it&#x27;s allowed.</p>
<p>When it&#x27;s a remote package, it&#x27;s not. You need to allow <code>&quot;pyrfc==3.3.1&quot;</code> by adding it as a dependency to the root package you&#x27;re trying to use <code>uv add</code> on.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb i&#x27;ve discovered (by accident) that as of version 0.8.20 pyrfc is added successfully as a transitive dependency with <code>uv add</code>. So I don&#x27;t have to add it explicitly.</p>
