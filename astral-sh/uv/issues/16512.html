            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Export the project's lockfile to an alternate format.</p>
<p>At present, both requirements.txt and pylock.toml (PEP 751) formats are supported.</p>
<p>The project is re-locked before exporting unless the --locked or --frozen flag is provided.</p>
<p>uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.</p>
<p>If operating in a workspace, the root will be exported by default; however, a specific member can be selected using the --package option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unclear if this exports just the default group, all groups, default+optional groups but not dev groups, or what.</p>
<p>There are options for <code>--all-extras</code>, <code>--extra</code>, <code>--group</code>, <code>--no-default-groups</code>, <code>--no-dev</code>, <code>--no-extra</code>, <code>--no-group</code>, <code>--only-dev</code>, <code>--only-group</code> ... but none of them clarify explicitly what the default behaviour is.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>It just needs a short sentence to say what the default behaviour is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's has the same semantics as <code>uv run</code> and <code>uv sync</code>, we use the default groups. I'm not sure it's worth calling that out explicitly since all of our commands are operating that way?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It'd be great to have this referenced in the command docs</p>
<p>I looked carefully through the command docs and it did not occur to me, nor was there any hint mentioned, that the behaviour is configured that way. I doubt I would ever have looked under &quot;Concepts&quot;</p>
<p>I just wanted to lookup the behaviour of the command, not read the whole manual.</p>
