# Detect and install tool python version

---

_Issue opened by @Tobi-De on 2024-10-15 21:56_

This isn’t an issue, but since there’s no discussions tab, I’ll post it here.

Is it possible to install a tool with the appropriate python version it needs without knowing it in advance? (in an automated fashion)

Here’s my scenario: I have a package  for which I build a wheel file. I then move the wheel file to another server that has  uv installed. Let's say my package specifies python >= 3.13, and the server has Python 3.12 installed. If I run uv tool install <path_to_wheel>, it doesn’t work because Python 3.13 isn’t installed on that server, which makes sense.

Is there a way to automatically detect the Python version of the tool (maybe that can be extracted from the wheel somehow) and install the appropriate version? I want to automate this process, so I’m wondering if there’s a trick or method that can make this work.

Possibly related to my issue https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8206 ?

You want uv to automatically detect that 3.13 is the suitable python version to use. I want uv to detect that 3.12 is the suitable python version to use.

Yep similar issue, in my case I want to use uv as part of an automated deployment workflow for any random packaged application, manually specifying the python version is not really an option

Yep, I think it does
