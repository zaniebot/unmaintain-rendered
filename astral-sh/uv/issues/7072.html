            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Love this project! I&#x27;ve been tracking this project for only a couple weeks and the pace of feature development is incredible.</p>
<p>My company is deciding on our next set of tools for Python application and library development (which is currently a mix of setuptools with make, and poetry), and I discounted uv due to its lack of universal lock file support only two weeks ago. If there was a roadmap with rough timelines it would help with our decision making e.g. I&#x27;m currently proposing hatch with uv as the installer backend, but uv now has build support, and will likely replace a lot of other hatch cli features at this rate.</p>
<p>Is there a roadmap for future features/releases and/or a target feature set for a stable (v1) release?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That project is actually relatively outdated, as those were tasks we wanted to accomplish before announcing all the recent new features.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t have a public roadmap and, if we add one, we&#x27;re very unlikely to provide timelines. We do intend to continue to grow the features for parity with other project management tools like Hatch, Rye, and Poetry.</p>
