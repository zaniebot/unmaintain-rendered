            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>my project uses maturin as the build backend, and when uv installs the project with <code>uv sync</code>, maturin does not build it in debug mode. for that, i need to run <code>maturin develop</code>. however every time i use <code>uv run</code>, it reinstalls the project in the wrong mode so i need to run <code>maturin develop</code> again for debugging to work.</p>
<p>it would be nice if i could configure uv to never install the current project. alternatively, the <code>--no-install-project</code> argument could be added to <code>uv run</code></p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>i'm trying to set up debug configs for my vscode extension for a language server that's written in rust, see https://github.com/tach-org/tach/pull/860</p>
<p>i mostly have it working, but it breaks whenever i run any command with <code>uv run</code> and i have to remember to run <code>maturin develop</code> again</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd also recommend first checking <code>uv sync -v</code>, the other option we have is to configure maturin so that it uses debug builds for editable builds. (It's a bigger problem with PEP 517 that we don't have a good way to tell backends whether we want a debug or a release build.)</p>

<p>i think it might just be because i've been tweaking my <code>pyproject.toml</code> a lot while i'm trying to get everything set up how i want it.</p>

<p>this is what i had in mind as well, but i'm quite new to maturin and i couldn't find any documentation for configuring its build backend, so i wasn't sure whether this was an issue with uv or maturin. should i open an issue on maturin instead?</p>
