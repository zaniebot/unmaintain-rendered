            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At present, our resolver does not deal with cross platform concerns. Instead, it assumes there is a single fixed set of marker values for the current environment, and makes decisions based on those. Even more, the structure of the code itself is oriented around this assumption.</p>
<p>In this ticket, we'll need to relax one manifestation of that assumption: the collapsing of distribution &quot;simple&quot; metadata down into a single wheel/sdist. Right now, this happens at a fairly low level in our <code>VersionMap</code>:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e33ff95575e8165078799548070210947d1cfad0/crates/uv-resolver/src/version_map.rs#L344-L431</p>
<p>That is, when retrieving metadata for a distribution, we almost immediately collapse the metadata down into the single &quot;best&quot; wheel based on the current marker environment. But in a cross platform context, all of the wheels need to make it into the lock file somehow, and thus we can't discard this metadata.</p>
<p>I think the simplest change we can make here is to continue selecting the &quot;best&quot; wheel at this point, but instead of throwing away everything else, a <code>PrioritizedDist</code> hangs on to it. And this information probably needs to be threaded through to other downstream types, such as <code>ResolvedDist</code> (and of its &quot;built&quot; member types).</p>
