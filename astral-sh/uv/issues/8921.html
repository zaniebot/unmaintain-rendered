            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello. I'm new to uv and trying to incorporate it into my existing project.</p>
<p>I executed the following command and got an error:</p>
<pre><code>$uv add rdrobust==1.2.1
× No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (python_full_version &gt;= '3.8' and python_full_version &lt; '3.10'):
╰─▶ Because rdrobust==1.2.1 depends on scikit-learn&gt;=1.2.0 and your project depends on rdrobust==1.2.1, we can conclude that your project depends on scikit-learn&gt;=1.2.0.
And because your project depends on scikit-learn==1.0.2, we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.
help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.
</code></pre>
<p>I understand the reason for the error. What I am confused about is: I set <code>resolution = &quot;lowest-direct&quot;</code>. In such a situation that &quot;the current foo dependency version is too low to meet the new bar dependency conditions&quot;, I expected that uv would Update the foo dependency to the minimum necessary version and update the lock file. Am I misunderstanding <code>uv add</code>? Or what should be the best practice for uv in this case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv add</code> won't modify any of the <em>existing</em> constraints in the <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and it will respect the constraint you provided. So if you already have <code>scikit-learn==1.0.2</code> in your project, and you <code>uv add rdrobust==1.2.1</code>, which requires <code>scikit-learn&gt;=1.2.0</code>, there's no way for us to resolve the dependencies.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A difference would be if you did like... <code>uv add rdrobust&gt;=1 --resolution lowest-direct</code>. Then we'd try to find the <em>lowest</em> version of <code>rdrobust</code> that's greater than or equal to version 1, and still satisfies the rest of the requirements.</p>
