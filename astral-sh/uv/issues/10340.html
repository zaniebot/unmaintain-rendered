system has python version

Python 3.12.3
which python
/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>for which tkinter is working fine.</p>
<p>But if i install python other than system version. than uv is not able to find tkinter and getting error
This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.</p>
<pre><code>uv --version
uv 0.5.13
</code></pre>
<p>Even i tried</p>
<pre><code>uv python uninstall 3.13
uv python install 3.13
</code></pre>
<p>I have observed this problem on Ubuntu 24.04LTS?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The error &quot;This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.&quot; is not the same as 6893/129 - it's #7036 / astral-sh/python-build-standalone#421. It should have been fixed a long time ago. If you're still seeing it, please take a look at the suggestions in the https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7036#issuecomment-2963558120 .</p>
<p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, can you please report what the exact uv command you're running that gets the error, and what the output of <code>uv run python -VV</code> is? I want to make sure you're not still on an old version of Python. <code>uv python uninstall 3.13; uv python install 3.13</code> is sometimes not sufficient.</p>
<p>(Perhaps you upgraded in the last few months and this is no longer happening....)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm still facing the same issue. In my case I'm trying to run a cell with <code>ipykernel</code> in VS Code. Running <code>uv run python -VV</code> I get:</p>
<p><code>Python 3.13.3 (main, Apr  9 2025, 04:03:52) [Clang 20.1.0 ]</code></p>
<p>The code I'm trying to run:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

message = tk.Label(root, text=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
message.pack()

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>What I've tried:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv python install --reinstall 3.13</code>, deleted <code>.venv</code> and created a new one.</li>
<li><code>uv python uninstall 3.13</code> followed by <code>uv python install 3.13</code> and creating a new <code>.venv</code>.</li>
<li>I created a <code>.py</code> file with the same code. If I run this file or <code>python -m tkinter</code> (with uv venv activated) I receive the following message:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>[xcb] Unknown sequence number while appending request
[xcb] You called XInitThreads, this is not your fault
[xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
python: ../../src/xcb_io.c:157: append_pending_request: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_unknown_seq_number' failed.
Abortado (imagem do núcleo gravada)
</code></pre>
<p>Which seems to me some kind of memory error.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if I run the same file under system interpreter, it runs normally.</p>
<h3>THE WEIRDEST OF ALL</h3>
<p>If the code is the following:</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>It runs normally!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@EvandroJRSilva The bug you're describing was fixed recently (it's not the same as the bug this issue was about), and also
it sounds like you're on an older version of uv itself, which is getting you an older build of our Python versions. Can you try</p>
<pre><code>uv self update &amp;&amp; uv python upgrade --reinstall
</code></pre>
<p>? (The date in your Python version needs to be at least August 8, 2025.)</p>

<p>Indeed! After updating uv everything works fine! Thank you very much!</p>
