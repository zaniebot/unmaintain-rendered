            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be beneficial to me (and I think in general) to be able to generate a <code>requirements.txt</code> file from the <code>uv.lock</code> file. It would be useful for installing requirements without having to resolve dependencies using a different installer in environments where <code>uv</code> is not installed, and also for having other tools that don't support the <code>uv.lock</code> file format (e.g. Dependabot) be able to know the project's pinned dependencies.</p>

<p>If using <code>uv sync</code> which creates a <code>uv.lock</code> file in a Docker, does <code>uv sync</code> take care of setting up references to the venv correctly ?
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#installing-a-package makes no mention of <code>uv sync</code> or <code>uv.lock</code></p>

<p>I'm talking about this section of the doc:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use the system Python environment by default, set the UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">ENV UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, a virtual environment can be created and activated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">RUN uv venv /opt/venv
# Use the virtual environment automatically
ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/opt/venv
# Place entry points in the environment at the front of the path
ENV PATH=&quot;/opt/venv/bin:$PATH&quot;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming if I use <code>RUN uv sync --locked</code> instead (to make sure the installation respects the lock file), that I don't need to mess around with venv setup ? (I just need to update my docker entry point command to use <code>uv run</code> instead of <code>python</code>, ref to our current transition to UV https://github.com/BesLogic/releaf-canopeum/pull/195/files#diff-1fc9c5328b5af6b1065537cb89aa7298eb7ba1d338b5bee8fd07553b6f56576f )</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I haven't written documentation for using the new APIs in Docker yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a simple explanation as to why it's not referenced ^^</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm just ensuring that the <code>uv.lock</code> file should be usable in Docker. Which removes the need for this feature request for me.</p>

<p>We may add support for syncing to a system environment (as requested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5964) to make this a little simpler in CI and containers.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have this use case right now; maybe the insight is useful. There are strict requirements only to deploy stable software in the deployment targets. That rules out uv on the deployment targets by our current rules. The devs still want to use uv and uv project management and it is pretty confusing to have the <code>requirements.txt</code> that is used for deployments and the <code>uv.lock</code> within the repo.</p>
<p>This can be solved by CI/CD but reducing steps and complexity is the signature of uv/ruff for me.
Loving the tools btw, y'all are doing gods work</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also am finding a need to produce a <code>requirements.txt</code>, but just for non-dev packages.  The current path I have in our pipeline looks something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv sync --no-dev
uv pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can check that requirements file against <code>safety</code> (or dependabot) for vulnerabilities, then do a <code>uv pip install -r requirements.txt --target dist</code> so we can package it up along with src into a zip file to deploy to a lambda function.</p>
<p>It definitely would be easier to operate directly against the <code>uv.lock</code>, but in the meantime converting that directly into a <code>requirements.txt</code> for compatibility with other tools would be great.</p>

<p>I think supporting <code>requirements.txt</code> input and output is wise to maintain compatibility with legacy tooling that isn’t yet caught up with PEP 621.</p>
<p>I have documented one such use case for <code>requirements.txt</code> here: #6422</p>

<p>Yeah, the <code>uv pip</code> interface never touches the lockfile. You <em>can</em> use the <code>uv pip</code> workflow if you want, but you lose the benefits of the unified <code>uv sync</code>, <code>uv lock</code>, <code>uv run</code> APIs.</p>
