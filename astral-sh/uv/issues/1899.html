            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for your work on uv and ruff! I would like to suggest changing the <code>uv pip</code> subcommand name. <code>uv</code> and <code>pip</code> are different tools. <code>uv</code> is not necessarily going to implement the same interface as <code>pip</code>. It feels a bit crummy to write a replacement to another tool and then take its name. I would suggest renaming the subcommand to <code>pkg</code> or something similar that&#x27;s more descriptive and won&#x27;t lead to unnecessary confusion. Leaving <code>pip</code> as an undocumented alias makes sense, but I don&#x27;t think it should be the default name for the package management subcommand.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note the intent is only for this to be our <code>pip</code>-compatible interface and we do intend to have entirely separate interfaces for all of the same functionality but with a new workflow. There are many tools with <code>pip</code> in the name, e.g. <code>pipx</code>, <code>pip-tools</code>, etc. Nonetheless, we agree though changing the name might make sense and are considering a few options.</p>
