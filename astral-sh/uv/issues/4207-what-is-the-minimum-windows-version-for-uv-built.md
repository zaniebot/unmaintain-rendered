# What is the minimum Windows version for UV built with Rust 1.78?

---

_Issue opened by @FishAlchemist on 2024-06-10 17:53_

The README only mentions that Windows is supported.
I checked the Github Action logs and it looks like uv is built with Rust 1.78. So the minimum supported version is Windows 10, right?

Yes, I believe it's now Windows 10.
