            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While it is not explicitly stated, the PyPA guide to the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file uses two spaces for the default indentation of TOML arrays - see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements. uv is currently using four spaces.</p>
<p>I know that uv is able to respect the existing indentation level in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5009) which is nice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wanted to pose this as an open question as to what the default setting should be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am upvoting for two spaces as well.</p>
<p>Alternatively, uv could respect <code>.editorconfig</code> if available.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Any chance to see it implemented? Switching to two should be quite easy to achieve. I also observed that uv adds trailing comma to the last array element, something that my current formatter removes, but I would be ok to reconfigure it to add them just to keep up with uv.</p>
<p>Another alternative would be allow execution of a formatter command after changing the file, so the formatter would fix the file to match current rules.</p>
