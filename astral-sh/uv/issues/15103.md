# uv export doesn't heed UV_NO_EDITABLE

---

_Issue opened by @jnns on 2025-08-06 10:31_

### Summary

Although I somehow assume this is intentional, it was unexpected behaviour for me: when requirements are exported using `uv export` the environment variable `UV_NO_EDITABLE=true` is not taken into consideration. 

```bash
❯ env UV_NO_EDITABLE=1 uv export --format requirements.txt > requirements.txt 

❯ cat requirements.txt
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv export --format requirements.txt
-e .
```

To be fair, the description of the environment variable only mention installations. I just assumed the env var would apply to all commands that take the `--no-editable` parameter:

> If set, uv installs any editable dependencies, including the project and any workspace members, as non-editable.

<details>
<summary>Verbose output of `uv export`</summary>

```
