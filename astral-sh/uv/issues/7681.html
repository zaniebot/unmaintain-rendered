            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi thanks for the great project!</p>
<p>I'm coming from <code>poetry</code> where i can do a <code>poetry update</code> and that updates my lock files to all the latest versions allowed.
With <code>uv</code> i'm failing to do that in particular, i get a warning that one of my package has been &quot;yanked&quot; and it's quite frustrating it doesn't upgrade it automatically.</p>
<p>i understand there is <code>uv sync --upgrade-package ...</code> but this is not what i'm looking for. i want a command that updates all my dependencies without having me to know which one i want to update.</p>
<p><code>uv sync</code> or <code>uv lock</code> doesn't update the lockfile.
i'm on macos, with version <code>0.4.15</code> (and tried with <code>0.4.16</code>)</p>

<p>I think what you're looking for is <code>uv sync --upgrade</code></p>
