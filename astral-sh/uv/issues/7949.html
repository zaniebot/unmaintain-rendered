<p>I use pyenv to manage python versions on my computer (apple m1).
The problem is that if the specified python version was not already installed by pyenv, <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> wouldn&#x27;t activate the virtualenv (and reported no errors).</p>
<p>How to reproduce:
For example, if I have python 3.12.5 but not 3.12.6 available in pyenv. If I do</p>
<pre><code>uv init -p 3.12.6
uv add ipython
source .vene/bin/activate  # does nothing
</code></pre>
<p>It <strong>wouldn&#x27;t activate the virtual env</strong>. Though it was actually created and python 3.12.6 was added by uv. <code>uv run</code> worked well.</p>
<p>Instead, if I start with <code>uv init -p 3.12.5</code> the issue was gone. The only difference is that <code>3.12.5</code> was already installed previously by pyenv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s interesting that if I do install the desired python with python (pyenv install 3.12.6), then it works --- <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> will activate the virtual env created by uv. Though the venv python activated was actually managed by uv (linked to <code>~/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.6-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.12</code>) and has nothing to do with pyenv.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s confusing to me why it failed to activate venv at the first place since the later installed python by pyenv was not used in the virtual env in anyway (I suppose).</p>
