            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>something i've always found very annoying about virtual environments is that for whatever reason the scripts are located in <code>.venv/bin</code> on linux &amp; macOS, but <code>.venv/Scripts</code> on windows. this regularly causes issues if i'm configuring someting to use a script installed in my venv, only to realize that i can't commit the config file because it only works on my machine but not other developers who may be using a different OS.</p>
<p>example with dprint: https://github.com/dprint/dprint/issues/859#issuecomment-2868290521</p>
<p>since uv can manage virtual environments itself, i wonder if it's possible to add an option to make the file structure of the venv consistent regardless of the user's OS</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The structure of venvs is largely defined by CPython and by PEP 405, it would have a lot of side effects to deviate from a structure that a lot of software has come to depend on.</p>
