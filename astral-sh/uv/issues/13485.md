# Make UV_GIT_LFS active by default on some url

---

_Issue opened by @gsemet on 2025-05-16 07:34_

### Summary

When installing some on our dependencies by URL, we need to set {{UV_GIT_LFS=1 uv run...}}.

Would it be possible to have this option definied somewhere arround the URL, to specify that a given git+https needs LFS, and another one does not.

Ideas:

```
uv add git+lfs+ssh://git@github.com/...
```

### Example

_No response_

It'd be good if you could point to a standard or other tool that does this :) otherwise it's a good idea!

i think nobody does it, that's the problem. But being first might lead the way to others :D

Not using git LFS by default is `uv`-specific behavior, no other tool I know of does this. So no other tool would require such an URL scheme.

But @gsemet is right that if `uv` wants to stick with this rather surprising behavior, a project that depends on a git dependency with LFS files needs some mechanism for declaring this `uv`-specific requirement, perhaps in something like a `[tool.uv.lfs]` section.

I'd be more interested in adding something to the sources entry, e.g., `git-lfs = ...` or `git = ..., lfs = true`, as a starting point rather than making up syntax for URLs

+1 - I'd be also interested in such a feature.

Another idea that I had was having this as a value in the config:

~~~toml
[tool.uv]
use-lfs = true
~~~

Not sure, if this is feasible... Your proposed solution would anyway allow more fine-grained control...

@zanieb Any update on this one?

Thanks! 🙏

Sure, the update is that I tried to prototype it but couldn't get LFS to work in the test case so I set it aside to revisit https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/15563 

If anyone wants to work on it, feel free.

Great! How does it works with ‘uv tool *’ ?
