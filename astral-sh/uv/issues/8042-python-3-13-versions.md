# Python 3.13 Versions

---

_Issue opened by @Odud on 2024-10-09 09:35_

A question, not really an issue. When I install Python 3.13 I see that it is picking up release candidate 3 `Python 3.13.0rc3 (main, Oct  2 2024, 16:40:04)` and not the final version released on Oct 7. it probably makes no difference to me but I was wondering when the version that uv sees gets updated.

Are you on the latest version of uv? We released Python 3.13 last night, but the versions are tied to the uv version, so you need to update uv itself.
