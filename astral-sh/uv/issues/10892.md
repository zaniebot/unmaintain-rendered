# warning: `uv publish` is experimental and may change without warning

---

_Issue opened by @RobertCraigie on 2025-01-23 11:02_

### Question

When running `uv publish` I get this warning

```
warning: `uv publish` is experimental and may change without warning
```

Is this still true? The [Publishing a package guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/#building-your-package) and the [CLI reference](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish) don't mention anything about it being experimental.

### Platform

Darwin 24.1.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.5.23 (ba42467f1 2025-01-23)

There are no blockers or planned breaking changes anymore, but we still need to do the actual stabilzation.
