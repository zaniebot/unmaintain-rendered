            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have been using the package management <code>uv</code> features, albeit in preview. Amazing product, responsiveness and pace of development 🚀</p>
<p>PDM has a great feature: the <code>pdm init</code> command can take <code>--cookiecutter</code> or <code>--copier</code> optional argument to initialise a project (including scaffold) using a template <a href="https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/template/">ref</a>. I don't know how to reproduce that in <code>uv</code> - I don't know what template engine there is in Rust, maybe Armin's minijinja? Would be a slick feature.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed. Scaffolding from community templates would be a nice (but not critical) next step. No comment on cookiecutter vs. copier vs. other.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Add perspective as an interested user, tracking this and #9754:</p>
<p>I think project template generation is a big win, and should be closely integrated with <code>uv init</code> to make it a natural part of the project. It could be argued that such a system already exists, it just has one trivial template. That's the UX experience, and the only thing beyond that I'm interested in <em>as a user</em> is the quality of the template library. (Aside: <code>uv</code> should take advantage of the best project template library it can find. The only one I could find is https://www.cookiecutter.io/)</p>
<p>That said, my developer mind keeps coming back to &quot;tools&quot;, and the idea that every lifecycle stage (init, lint, build, test, publish) essentially has a specific tool associated with it (whether internal or external), and there are levels of mappings between those tools and build lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>global default (what uv does out of the box)</li>
<li>user defaults (in ~ somewhere)</li>
<li>project settings in pyproject.toml</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a simple way to set those mappings (edit config files, or a <code>uv</code> sub-command like <code>uv default build hatch</code> where hatch is installed by <code>uv tool</code>) would go a long way to generic tool support.</p>
