            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>For the purposes of being able to attach a debugger to Python processes running in uv managed interpreters I would like to be able to get an interpreter with debug symbols. However the interpreter that uv installs by default doesn't have them.</p>
<p>This PR seems to suggest that there was going to be a --debug flag added that might have accomplished this but it doesn't look like that happened as far as I can tell?</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5451</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>macOS, Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.5.20</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you just want debug <em>symbols</em> instead of a separate build with debugging enabled, those are available from the full releases at https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases . <code>uv</code> installs the stripped install-only archives, but unstripped archives are available too.</p>
<p>We can certainly do something to automate the process of downloading the right version (or maybe we should run a debuginfod server or something), but I figured I'd mention it in case you have a core file or something and want a symbolicated backtrace—you shouldn't need to recreate the problem on a separate build, you should be able to point your debugger at one of the full releases.</p>
