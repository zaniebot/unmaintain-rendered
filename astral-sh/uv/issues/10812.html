<p>Add a flag that forces <code>uv</code> to work completely locally, with no changes to the global environment.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have two use cases for which a completely local installation (no global python, no global cache, perhaps not even a global <code>uv</code>) is needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Distributing packages to systems that don't have, or can't have Python installed (see eg. <a href="https://gist.github.com/morags/c1c7db99b911dfec259eec0a1bb97689">here</a>).</li>
<li>Installing a package that is sensitive to non-ASCII paths (eg. <code>C:\Users\Иван\AppData\Roaming\uv\</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>At the moment there are several flags and environment variables that allows you to control parts of this behavior, like <code>--cache-dir</code> and <code>UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR</code>, but it would be useful to have a single flag that concentrates all of them and forces <code>uv</code> to work in a completely isolated fashion.</p>
<h2>Suggested behavior</h2>
<p><code>uv &lt;command&gt; --local &lt;folder&gt;</code> runs a command in a given folder without touching the global environment, including caches, Python installations and configuration files.</p>
