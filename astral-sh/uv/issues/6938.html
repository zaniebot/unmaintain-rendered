            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I originally opened this in https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/issues/1317 but I guess uv would be a better place now?</p>
<p>Currently, ansible-galaxy does have its own mechanism to download collections/roles as described in https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html. It can use a <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#installing-roles-and-collections-from-the-same-requirements-yml-file">requirements.yml</a> file to specify which collections/roles to download but it has no support for lock files (see <a href="https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues/1358">ticket</a>).</p>
<p>Since uv wants to be a one-stop solution for everything python, how about supporting declaring ansible-galaxy collections/roles in a pyproject.toml and get all the nice features of uv while working on ansible projects?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've created a small wrapper at https://github.com/metio/ansible-wrapper that uses <code>uv</code> to handle Python version and project dependencies as well as ansible-galaxy dependencies. It still relies on ansible-galaxy and does not use <code>uv.lock</code> but the user experience is similar to what I originally wanted.</p>
