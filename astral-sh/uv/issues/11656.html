            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Yesterday I broke my VS Code setup in a project I am working on.</p>
<p>Do find the issue I created a very simple project with one main.py file which I wanted to debug in VS Code.
I also reinstalled VS Code and the Python Debug Extensions.
Additionally I installed multiple older Versions of the Python Debug Extension.</p>
<p>Commands I used to create the venv:</p>
<pre><code>uv init
uv sync
</code></pre>
<p>Then I set the Interpretor in VS Code and configured the launch.json.</p>
<p>Starting now the Debugger, nothing happend.
The debugger immediately stops.</p>
<p>When switching to another virtual environment installed on my machine (conda), the debugger works as expected.</p>
<p>After some tests I figured out that maybe the &quot;uv sync&quot; was the problem.
When using this commands:</p>
<pre><code>uv init
uv venv
</code></pre>
<p>...it seems to work.</p>
<p>Is this as expected or a bug?</p>
<p>Maybe it will help the one or other in the future.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know faced the same issue in another project where I am switched to UV now.
There I saw that the python interpretor points to &quot;..venv\Scripts\python&quot; after creating the venv with uv.
This does not work and the VS Code debugger wont start.</p>
<p>On my working environment it points to &quot;..venv\Scripts\python.exe&quot;.</p>
<p>Can this be the issue?
After I changed it it worked.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue can be closed.
The problem was the VS Code interpretor path.
Running uv commands in a different order seems to fix my problem, but I was wrong.</p>
