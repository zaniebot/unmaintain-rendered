# Translations of the documentation

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-12-03 14:26_

It'd be nice to have internationalized documentation with support for multiple languages as requested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5605#issuecomment-2495792315

It's unclear if this is feasible for us given our rapid pace of development.

IMO, there should be an infrastructure for translators too. For first milestone, I think docs could support multi versions. Also, status page for showing each language translated which version of docs would be cool.

Internationalized documentation is beneficial for non-English users, but I've seen some cases where only the English version is up-to-date, while other language versions are outdated. Therefore, if you want to support non-English users, it's crucial to ensure that users are aware of whether the documentation they are reading reflects the latest version.

By the way, how can we ensure that the translations in other languages are accurate and reliable?
To support it, would we need a community reviewer similar to winget-pkgs?

Edit:
However,  if UV is developing rapidly, I would not recommend having non-English documents, as they can easily lead to misunderstandings due to obsolescence.

A good example of a project using mkdocs-material to provide internationalization is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). While FastAPI's documentation internationalization is not complete and some pages are untranslated (in my language), its implementation and review process might be worth referencing.

I think the easiest starting place to have links to google translate of the page.

For example, for german
* https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ becomes https://docs-astral-sh.translate.goog/uv/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=de&_x_tr_hl=en

Similarly spanish becomes
* https://docs-astral-sh.translate.goog/uv/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=es&_x_tr_hl=en
