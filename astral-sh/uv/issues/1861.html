Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Command, using uv 0.1.7:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv pip install &quot;flit-core==2.3.0&quot; --no-cache --no-binary flit-core --reinstall
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">Resolved 2 packages in 394ms
error: Failed to download distributions
  Caused by: Failed to fetch wheel: flit-core==2.3.0
  Caused by: Failed to build: flit-core==2.3.0
  Caused by: Invalid pyproject.toml
  Caused by: TOML parse error at line 4, column 16

4 | backend-path = &quot;.&quot;
  |                ^^^
invalid type: string &quot;.&quot;, expected a sequence
</code></pre>
<p>This has been fixed in <code>flit-core&gt;=3</code>, but pip installs <code>flit-core==2.3.0</code> without errors so pip must be more permissive here. (Actually, it looks the internal type in pip isn't correct in the one place where <code>backend_path</code> is typed and then this is unnoticed in practice due to <code>list(&quot;.&quot;) == list([&quot;.&quot;])</code>.)</p>
<p>If it weren't a build backend I would not be concerned about an older now-patched version of a library that can't be installed from source, but it's thwarting me in some cases when testing with <code>--no-binary :all:</code> for packages with <code>flit_core&lt;3</code>.</p>
<p>In general, it might also be useful to have an official supported way to override build requirements, especially given the explicit support of overrides for other purposes?</p>
