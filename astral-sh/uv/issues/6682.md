# Build pyproject-build.exe not provided

---

_Issue opened by @lambda-science on 2024-08-27 10:06_

From the docs: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/#building-your-package
Build your package with the official build frontend:
`uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer uv`

My output:
```python
cmeyer@LPF2LY4JD MINGW64 ~/code-project/project-pythia/pythia-client (main)
$ uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer uv
The executable `pyproject-build` was not found.
warning: An executable named `pyproject-build` is not provided by package `build`.
The following executables are provided by `build`:

I don't understand, it was working few days ago. The error is not helpful

Thanks for the report! Sorry you ran into that — looks like something is mixed up.

What version of uv are you using and what version worked?

Hey, thanks for the fast answer.
Yes I guess it's a cringe Windows effect (yet another one, using Windows for work is only suffering)
My UV version is:
```
$ uv --version
uv 0.3.3 (deea6025a 2024-08-23)
```
I guess it worked on 0.3.0. But someday without updating it stopped working also on 0.3.0, so I updated thinking it was a simple bug (to 0.3.3) and nope it doesn't work

Okay great good to know. We'll look into this.

What environment and terminal are you using? I tried this in powershell and a mingw shell, but `uvx --from build pyproject-build` passed in both for me

How I could give you more informations on my environnement ? Some command/variable ?

It fails in MINGW (Git for Windows), Powershell and CMD. => They don't activate the `.venv` by default
BUT, new info: it works in JetBrains IDE because the integrated terminal activate the `(.venv)` by default.
```python
(.venv) PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia> cd .\pythia-client\
(.venv) PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia\pythia-client> uv --version
uv 0.3.3 (deea6025a 2024-08-23)
(.venv) PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia\pythia-client> uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer uv
* Creating isolated environment: venv+uv...
* Using external uv from C:\Users\cmeyer\.cargo\bin\uv.EXE
* Installing packages in isolated environment:
  - hatchling
* Getting build dependencies for sdist...
* Building sdist...
```

If I `deactivate` it before:
```python
(.venv) PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia> deactivate
PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia> cd .\pythia-client\
PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia\pythia-client> uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer uv
The executable `pyproject-build` was not found.
warning: An executable named `pyproject-build` is not provided by package `build`.
The following executables are provided by `build`:
- pyproject-build.exe
```

And by the way it only works because I've put `build` as a dev dependency in my virtual env. If I do `uv remove --dev build`, the old error is back
```python
(.venv) PS C:\Users\cmeyer\code-project\project-pythia> uvx --from build pyproject-build --installer uv

My PATH variable (puting `.cargo\bin` on top doesn't change anything)
