            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been successfully using uv self update for many months but as of last week I have ben receiving the following error message...</p>
<p>➜  ~ uv self update
Found existing alias for &quot;uv self update&quot;. You should use: &quot;uvup&quot;
info: Checking for updates...
error: error decoding response body
Caused by: there are extra bytes after body has been decompressed</p>
<p>I am on MAC OS Seqouia 15.1.1 and using iTerm2 to run the update command.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue with uv or something that has changed with my local setup?</p>
<p>Thanks,
Kev</p>

<p>Can you try <code>RUST_LOG=trace uv self update</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately nothing stands out there. I've reached out to the <code>cargo-dist</code> team which maintains the library we use for the self-updates.</p>
