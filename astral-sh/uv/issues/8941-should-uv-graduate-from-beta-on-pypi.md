# Should `uv` graduate from 'beta' on PyPI?

---

_@paveldikov_

The release announcement for 0.5.0 alludes to `uv`'s increasing maturity; maybe the time is now?

Cf. `ruff` already having been classified as `5 - Production/Stable` for quite some time now.

IME it's not a big issue, but it does on occasion raise some eyebrows: _'is it appropriate to cast our lot with a package that is marked as beta?'_
