            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Following up from #10942, I&#x27;ve found two more UV binary releases broken on a Raspberry Pi 5, from Snap (v0.8.10) and Homebrew Linux (v0.8.12). Same jemalloc error. The curl install script <em>does work</em> and is what I&#x27;m using for now.</p>
<p>Note: Despite Homebrew&#x27;s warning about arm64 not being supported with bottles, it poured uv from a bottle.</p>

<p>FWIW, this is probably because you either have Homebrew&#x27;s developer mode enabled or you&#x27;ve explicitly set <code>HOMEBREW_ARM64_TESTING</code>: Homebrew <em>does</em> have ARM64 Linux support, but it&#x27;s currently in beta per <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/19208">Homebrew/brew#19208</a>.</p>
<p>The relevant check is here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/e910f91124dc0bb84368e183288629a2b83a817d/Library/Homebrew/extend/os/linux/diagnostic.rb#L82-L93</p>
<p>That being said, you&#x27;re right about this being a bad build 🙂 -- @zanieb&#x27;s pointer makes sense to me as a fix, so I&#x27;ll look at getting that upstreamed into Homebrew&#x27;s bottle build.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the quick response! This is my first day using Homebrew Linux – I may have accidentally turned on developer mode.</p>
<p>I had the same error with difftastic but building that from source fixed it (reported <a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/issues/872">Wilfred/difftastic#872</a>). Thought I&#x27;d try building uv too, but after three freezes I&#x27;ve learnt 8 GB RAM + default 200 MB swap isn&#x27;t enough. 😅</p>
<p>I&#x27;m setting up cross-platform dotfiles and learning there&#x27;s no good abstraction for package managers. It&#x27;s already sprawling with macOS/brew, Termux/pkg, Ubuntu/apt+snap, RPiOS/apt+snap+brew+curl|sh. I have one more to go with Armbian for Rockchip64 SBCs.</p>
<p>The dream: <code>(brew|pkg|sudo apt) install [package list]</code> and no special cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No problem! It looks like the brew rebuild has gone through; could you do a <code>brew update &amp;&amp; brew reinstall uv</code> and see if it works for you now?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes! It works! Would it be too much to ask for the same fix for difftastic and fd? Those are the other two with the same jemalloc error on my Pi.</p>

<p>Glad to hear it!</p>
<p>Neither of those is an Astral project, JFYI. But I&#x27;ll be able to look at those later today potentially. In the mean time, if you file an issue for those on homebrew-core&#x27;s issue tracker, another maintainer might be able to get to them first.</p>
