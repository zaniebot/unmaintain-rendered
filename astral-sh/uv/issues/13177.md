# Versioning tools with pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @tiberium on 2025-04-28 14:21_

### Question

When reading the docs, I see two examples of integrating `ruff` into the project, and it is a little bit confusing to me.

First one is by defining dependency groups:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#development-dependencies

```
pyproject.toml

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
  "pytest"
]
lint = [
  "ruff"
]
```

Second one, as a Python tool:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#commands-with-different-package-names

```
uvx --from 'ruff==0.3.0' ruff check
```
--First question--
Since both use cases are mentioned by you in the docs, I assume that there have to be 2 completely different use cases, different workflows for using `ruff` (one requiring the dependency group, second one a tool). Can you please provide more details when would you recommend to use which approach?

--Second question--
Why `uvx` way of using `ruff` couldn't take by default the version from the dependency-group? Or maybe - to be more precise - version from a specific dependency-group. Maybe something like that:

`uvx --from-dependency-group=lint ruff check`

Of course the issue is not only about `ruff` itself, but - in general - about managing the tools in projects.

This is something we plan on solving more generally with the task runner (#5903).

Yeah let's track via #5903, though it's also related to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7186.
