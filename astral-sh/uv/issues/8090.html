<p>Is this explicitly banned? I think <code>group = [&quot;my-project[test]&quot;]</code> might &quot;just work&quot; in uv because of how we treat package names that are shadowed by the project?</p>

<p>I am asking about the equivalent of <code>constraint-dependencies</code>, which I don't see addressed. I have a similar use case as discussed https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6518 . We use a managed airflow service. For dag development we only need a subset of the installed py dependencies and installing every py dependency is challenging and overkill because it requires several system dependencies. I'm slowly converting people to use uv, one of the motivations is having an easy, declarative approach to setting up a virtual environment for development.</p>
<p>here is an example from pyproject.toml from a repo that contains dags:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [apache-airflow[gcp,beam]==2.9.1]
constraint-dependencies = [ long list of transient dependencies from cloud composer docs]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions#images-composer-2">cloud composer docs</a>
I want to install what i need but I want to make sure I don't install a transient dependency with a different version from our prod environment.</p>
<p>1 difference from the other issue is we are not using the official airflow constraints file from the url (this is what i used to use before we moved to the managed airflow). Right now I am copying the list of installed packages into my pyproject.toml file.</p>
