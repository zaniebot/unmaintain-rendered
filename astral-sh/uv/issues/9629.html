            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A colleague of mine ran into this issue when installing a package with <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab68379e-6137-4394-b5a9-048496226381" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>And this was part of a larger install script to install a number of conda and python dependencies. And they concluded that this was an issue with the dependencies.</p>
<p>I made the same assumption as well, and since I had only ran this version on MacOS, I first thought &quot;oh <code>uv</code> is resolving dependencies differently on macos and windows&quot;. And then when I tested it on my Windows VM, I didn't experience an issue which made me look at the error message more carefully.</p>
<p>Looking at the error message now, it is obvious it is a certificate issue. It says &quot;Failed to download&quot; and &quot;UnknownIssuer&quot;. But it was easy to miss for two people (just two data points, I know)</p>
<p>I think the last line where &quot;help: ...&quot; is printed seems to imply it is because of a dependency version issue? And that might have been the source of confusion.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there are incremental improvements possible here? Maybe <code>uv</code> can skip the help when running into a certificate issue? Or print a different help message that points the user to the<code>uv</code> docs on how to resolve SSL issues?</p>
<p>Feel free to close this issue if you think it's not worth any changes. After reading the <code>uv</code> docs and if I were to run <code>uv sync</code> from the command line myself, it would be super clear that this was a certificate issue to me. I'm coming at this from the perspective of making an automated install for a user that doesn't have to think about &quot;conda&quot; or &quot;uv&quot; or any of the dependencies involved to setup a project and would like the help messages to be more precise for a user that is using <code>uv</code> for the very first time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report!</p>
<p>@charliermarsh we may not want to show this message for download failures?</p>
<p>We should also probably special case the certificate errors.</p>
