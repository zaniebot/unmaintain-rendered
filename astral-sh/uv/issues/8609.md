# Support `uv export --script`

You should be able to point to a PEP 723 script to get a requirements.txt of the resolved dependencies.

This would be awesome (especially for the jupyter notebook stuff around uv I'm tinkering with). 

I made [an attempt](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/main...manzt:uv:manzt/export?expand=1) at a PR, but got a bit stuck. It seems like workspaces are pretty connected with `uv export` right now and wasn't sure of the right way to push forward (i.e., create a virtual workspace or special case scripts). Maybe some of the code is useful.

@malikrohail feel free, but note @manzt has some work in progress and said it didn't seem trivial.

_Comment by @manzt on 2024-10-29 01:42_

Probably won't have time to touch for a bit so go right ahead! Thought I'd share WIP in case any of the code is helpful.
