<h2>Context</h2>
<p>I'm running ML workloads on <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/">Anyscale</a>. They have a proprietary version of Ray which is only available when running on their platform, and they have provided me with a URL to a wheel to use the proprietary version.</p>
<p>However, I would also like to run my code locally, and so would need the <code>ray</code> dependency to resolve when the direct URL is not usable. Locally I would use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ray/">open-source version</a> which is available on public PyPI.</p>
<p>I'm having a hard time configuring this -</p>
<h2>What I have tried</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>uv add &lt;direct url to wheel&gt;</code> -&gt; works on Anyscale but not locally</li>
<li>Add two sources to <code>[tool.uv.sources]</code> for package <code>ray</code> -&gt; does not work as requires markers for each source, and I don't know of any reliable markers that I could use here</li>
<li>Somehow using a different source for dev and another for prod, but couldn't find a way that works</li>
</ul>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>macOS 26.2 arm64 for dev, some Linux amd64 for Anyscale</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.9.17</p>
