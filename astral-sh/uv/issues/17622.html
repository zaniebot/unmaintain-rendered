            <div class="timeline-body">Question
Context
<p>I&#x27;m running ML workloads on <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/">Anyscale</a>. They have a proprietary version of Ray which is only available when running on their platform, and they have provided me with a URL to a wheel to use the proprietary version.</p>
<p>However, I would also like to run my code locally, and so would need the <code>ray</code> dependency to resolve when the direct URL is not usable. Locally I would use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ray/">open-source version</a> which is available on public PyPI.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time configuring this -</p>
What I have tried
<ul>
<li><code>uv add &lt;direct url to wheel&gt;</code> -&gt; works on Anyscale but not locally</li>
<li>Add two sources to <code>[tool.uv.sources]</code> for package <code>ray</code> -&gt; does not work as requires markers for each source, and I don&#x27;t know of any reliable markers that I could use here</li>
<li>Somehow using a different source for dev and another for prod, but couldn&#x27;t find a way that works</li>
</ul>
Platform
<p>macOS 26.2 arm64 for dev, some Linux amd64 for Anyscale</p>
Version
<p>uv 0.9.17</p>

<p>This seems to break UV workspace dependencies, maybe similar to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7572">astral-sh/uv#7572</a>.</p>
<p>I get following error starts occurring if I add the URL source and try <code>--no-sources-package</code>. Neither of the packages have dependencies on ray.</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv sync --locked --no-sources-package ray
error: Failed to generate package metadata for `input-data==0.1.0 @ editable+packages/input_data`
  Caused by: Failed to parse entry: `offer-gen`
  Caused by: `offer-gen` references a workspace in `tool.uv.sources` (e.g., `offer-gen = { workspace = true }`), but is not a workspace member
</code></pre>

<p>Do I understand correctly that there were no resolutions yet in the issue? Or I did not at least catch anything that I could immediately implement on my side. 🤔</p>
