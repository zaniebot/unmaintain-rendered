# Enable multiple tools in one env

---

_Issue opened by @nixjdm on 2025-02-12 04:49_

`uv tool install glances` and `uv tool install ipython` make those tools generally available in my shell, and they are isolated from each other.

What if I want to install libraries, like numpy or requests, in the same env that ipython is installed in? Or many other libraries? If I recall, I could do this with rye or pipx, but I've looked and talked to a few others, and can't figure it out in uv - so I think this ability doesn't exist yet. If it does, how do I do it?

I'm not asking to put all tools in one env, but to optionally install more than one tool in a shared env.

I toyed with making a uv env in my home directory and using `uv add` rather than `uv tool install`, but that changes how all of the projects under my home directory are treated.

This is supported already `uv tool install --with numpy --with requests ipython`

Thank you, that does what I asked for. I have a follow-up that I still don't see, but it's distinct, so I'll make a new issue for it and close this.

Although this is marked as closed, I enconted that jupyter-nbconvert comes from nbconvert, while jupyter itself comes from jupyter-core, so I haven't found a way to get both jupyter and jupyter-nbconvert to come from the same venv, since 

1. `uv tool install nbconvert --with jupyter` makes jupyter-dejavu, and jupyter-nbconvert available
2. `uv tool install jupyter-core --with jupyter --with nbconvert` make jupyter, jupyter-migrate, and jupyter-troubleshoot available.
