            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/commit/936e6cdc42f44365e087a4ba7148238afc090b0b CI has been failing on <code>test-system / python3.9 via chocolatey</code></p>
<p>Upon investigation, the only relevant difference between this run and the last is that the windows image has changed.</p>
<p>The previous image used to ship with <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/win25/20260105.172/images/windows/Windows2025-Readme.md#language-and-runtime">python 3.9 pre-installed</a>.</p>
<p>The new image ships with <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/win25/20260105.172/images/windows/Windows2025-Readme.md#language-and-runtime">python 3.12</a> instead.</p>
<p>I'm not certain exactly what was going on before but chocolatey was complaining and putting the installed python over (???) the one which came with the image?</p>
<pre><code>WARNING: Provided python InstallDir was ignored by the python installer
WARNING: Its probable that you had pre-existing python installation
WARNING: Python installed to: 'C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\Python\3.9.13\x64'
WARNING: Installation folder is not the default. Not changing permissions. Please ensure your installation is secure.
</code></pre>
<p>But now this warning is gone but the installation directory is different:</p>
<pre><code>Python installed to: 'C:\Python39'
</code></pre>
<p>But in both cases, we're still picking up the python in <code>C:\hostedtoolcache\windows\Python\</code> except now it's 3.12.</p>
