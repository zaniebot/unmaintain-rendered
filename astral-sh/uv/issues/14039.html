            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently, <code>uv</code> does not provide a straightforward way to export or restore tools installed via <code>uv tool</code>. For users who have many tools installed, or who rely on complex installations (e.g., tools with multiple optional dependencies, which is common in data science workflows), there is no simple mechanism to back up these tools' environments and restore them across different machines.</p>
<p>This feature exists in Homebrew via the <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Brew-Bundle-and-Brewfile"><code>brew bundle</code></a> command, which allows users to generate a Brewfile that lists all installed applications. This file can then be used to reproduce the setup on another machine.</p>
<p>It would be very helpful if <code>uv</code> offered a comparable feature: the ability to export the list of installed tools and their configurations into a file, and restore them from that file on another system. This would significantly simplify environment setup and synchronization across multiple devices.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-sh">uv tool dump &gt; toolfile.txt
uv tool restore toolfile.txt
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The difficult part here is defining a (toml) export format that we can commit to supporting over many versions. It may be easier to fold this into https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903, where each tool would be defined in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and tied to that <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12533</p>
<p>I actually think we're pretty far along on a TOML format, because we already write TOML tool receipts to our storage — we'd just need to do the work to make a similar format user-facing.</p>
