# `uv` can't install post-release packages.

### Question

```
$ uv pip install mkdocstrings-owa==1.16.12.post1
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of mkdocstrings-owa==1.16.12.post1 and you require mkdocstrings-owa==1.16.12.post1, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
$ pip install mkdocstrings-owa==1.16.12.post1
# install works well
```

post-release is supported on pypi, we may refer to https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/versioning/.
I'm curious about whether this miss for post-release install is intended or not.

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

Oh well, I guess it was because of just slow update of cache in somewhere. After a while the `uv pip install mkdocstrings-owa==1.16.12.post1` works.
