# Add link to documentation (docs.astral.sh/uv)

---

_Issue opened by @nikhilweee on 2024-08-09 18:19_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

For weeks, I thought `uv` did not have documentation available apart from the README. Then I stumbled upon [docs.astral.sh/uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

It would be great if this link could be advertised at least in two places:
1. In the repository "About" section
2. Relevant sections in the README.

A good comparison is `ruff`, which has a link to its docs in the repository "About" section and in various places in its README.

Honestly I'm fine with just doing (1), but that needs to be done by an admin.

You can follow https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5606 and #5607 

This documentation is not intended for public consumption yet, hence not being advertised anywhere. We'll announce it soon!

If you have feedback though, please feel free to comment at #5605 — I'd love to hear your perspective on the documentation itself.

Apologies for not searching enough, I remember searching the issues for any links to documentation a few days ago but those issues you refer to were opened last week. Eagerly waiting for the docs! Thank you for all the hard work!
