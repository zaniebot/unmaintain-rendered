            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now I've been able to do this by adding an include in a MANIFEST.in file.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there could be a setting in pyproject.toml or an uv command to do this.</p>
<p>Sorry if I missed something if this is already possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately this is build-backend specific, i.e. that file is <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/miscellaneous.html">setuptools-specific</a>. As a a build frontend, we can't easily provide a way to do this across various build backends. When we have our own build backend (which is in progress), we'll be able to provide this if you're using our backend.</p>
