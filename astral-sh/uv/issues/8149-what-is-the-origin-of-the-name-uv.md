# What is the origin of the name `uv`?

---

_Issue opened by @johnthagen on 2024-10-12 18:47_

When I introduce `uv` to my colleagues, a surprising number of them ask me "what does `uv` stand for?" or "where did that name come from?".

Some come up with their own interpretations such as "ultraviolet light = fast", etc.

Is there anything documented about the origin of the name "uv", if only so I can point the extra curious folks at? Was it simply chosen as a short CLI name that didn't conflict with other Linux utilities? Is there a deeper meaning known only to Charlie? 😄

Yeah for me it's short for "ultraviolet" though we liked that there were a few different possible interpretations. We wanted something that was (1) available on PyPI and elsewhere, (2) had minimal conflicts with other software projects, and (3) was easy to type!
