# Write timout for publishing

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-10-04 13:51_

Currently, we use a high read timeout for reqwest in uploads (#7923) since reqwest is lacking a dedicated write timeout option (https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2403). Instead, this should be properly solved by a write timeout (also 30s) and no total limit on the upload time.
