# Better documentation for `uv sync -v`

_@konstin_

Users often asks about problems that get explained in the verbose logs, and can often self-debug by running `uv sync -v` or `uv pip install -v`. We should document verbose mode more prominently. A possible location could be https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/help/.
