            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not directly GitHub actions related, however keen on some recommendations for handling UV cache in a CI environment such as GitHub / Jenkins etc.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a statement in the docs clearly documenting it&#x27;s not safe to modify the cache manually</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that it&#x27;s not safe to modify the uv cache directly (e.g., uv cache clean) while other uv commands are running, and never safe to modify the cache directly (e.g., by removing a file or directory).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However often in CI environments we might not want to have an infinitely growing cache, using cleanup configurations such as max cache sizes / keep by last used etc. However reading the above, worried that policies such as these might corrupt the cache / cause issues.
How would we cleanup caches safely in a CI environment, without having to drop the whole cache?
I.e. clean all artifacts not used in the last week, etc.</p>
<p>Do let me know if this should be tracked under a separate issue.</p>
