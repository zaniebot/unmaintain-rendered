# `--no-sync` for `uv run` via configuration parameter

_Issue opened by @tinovyatkin on 2025-03-24 14:23_

### Question

Hi there! 👋

Is there a way to configure the default behavior of the `uv run` command? Specifically, I’d like to make `--no-sync` the default for my project—ideally through a setting in `uv.toml` or `pyproject.toml`.

I couldn’t find anything in the documentation that suggests this is currently possible. Did I miss something? And if not, would you consider supporting this kind of customization in the future?

Thanks for the great work on uv!

I also would like to be able to add `--inexact` to the uv config in `pyproject.toml`.
Context: I can not specify GDAL as dependency because the version depends on what is installed on the system. I install it manually like this: `pip install gdal=="$(gdal-config --version).*"`. Now without `--inexact` GDAL gets removed from the environment. I do not want to think or communicate to every developer that `--inexact` is needed.

Thanks for this awesome tool!
