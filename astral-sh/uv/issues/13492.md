I cannot reproduce, this `uv pip install jaconv==0.4.0` works for me. Are you using any non-standard settings?

I get the same issue when installing `fvcore==0.1.5.post20221221` or `click-completion==0.5.2`.

It happens inside Ubuntu 22.04 Docker containers on both Ubuntu 25.04 (x86_64) and L4T 36.4.3 (arm_64) machines.

I installed uv and python as follows:

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.7.4 /uv /uvx /bin/
ENV UV_LINK_MODE="copy" UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION="1"
RUN uv python install 3.10

...

# non-root user
RUN uv venv --python 3.10
```

```bash
Using Python 3.10.12 environment at: py310
0.720   × Failed to download and build `fvcore==0.1.5.post20221221`
0.720   ├─▶ Failed to extract archive: fvcore==0.1.5.post20221221

```

I'm hitting this very frequently, locally and on CI, in the last 24 hours or so. I can resolve it locally by `uv cache clear <failing package>` and rerunning. I can't, however, reproduce it once resolved.

We accidentally changed the cache format in the 0.7.4 without noticing, causing these errors, sorry! Cleaning the cache will fix this, but we're also shipping a fix with the next release.
