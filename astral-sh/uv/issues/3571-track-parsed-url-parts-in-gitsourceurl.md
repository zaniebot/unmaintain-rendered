# Track parsed url parts in `GitSourceUrl`

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-05-14 10:19_

Like in `GitSourceDist`, we should track the parsed url parts in `GitSourceUrl` to resolve https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3458/files#r1599281039. Half of it is https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/konsti/track-url-parts-in-git-source-url, but it still needs lifetime fixes for `resolve_requirement`.
