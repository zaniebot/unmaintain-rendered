            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>We manage dependency groups in <code>requirements.txt</code> by <code>uv add -r requirements.group_x.txt --group group_x</code>.</p>
<p>Say we have 3 groups, where group_1 and group_2 share a common package, and group 3 doesn't, so there is no reason to make that package common across all groups. What would be the best way to update the common package and have the state/dependency versions maintained in the respective <code>requirements.txt</code> files?</p>
<p>Currently, I am doing <code>uv remove common_package</code> from all the group, then updating the requirements.txt,  and finally <code>uv add -r requirements.group_x.txt --group group_x</code> one by one. I wonder if there is a way to update the common package in one go?</p>

<p>Thanks @konstin, I can see that people are doing a similar thing from the scripts -- removing packages one by one and adding them back probably because there isn't any official documentation or built-in solution for package updates. But I can't tell if we are being hacky or that this is the standard way recommended by the official maintainers.</p>
