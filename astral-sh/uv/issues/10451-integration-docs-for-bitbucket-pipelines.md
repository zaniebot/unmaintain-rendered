# Integration docs for Bitbucket Pipelines

---

_@ghost_

After looking for quite sometime I couldn't find anything related to using `uv` In Bitbucket Pipelines. I was thinking of writing a small article but I think adding to docs will be more helpful to everyone. 

Can I raise a pull request for review?

If you think it's suitable for the UV document, then go ahead and create a PR.
The creation of PRs for the integrated document is not restricted to UV team members

Thanks! I looked at few of those examples and created a PR. I hope someone can pick it for review.
