            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just try rescanning it in a few days. The UV doesn't have a digital signature. Once it's added to the database in a few days, it's less likely to be flagged as a virus

<p>However, UV also passed the winget-pkgs scan, and coupled with the fact that only a very small number of virus scans detected it, it seems to be a false positive

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@FishAlchemist indeed most probably it is <code>false-positive</code>. How do you initiate the rescanning of the package and do you think this will be reflected on the chocolatey page?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@VOVELEE I just clicked <strong>Reanalyze</strong> on VirusTotal to rescan it. I'm not sure about the correct rescan process for Chocolatey, since I barely use it.</p>
