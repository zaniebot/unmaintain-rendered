  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of my-package==1.3.3 and you require my-package==1.3.3, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: `my-package` was found on https://pypi.internal-index.com/simple/, but not at the requested version (my-package==1.3.3). A compatible version may be
      available on a subsequent index (e.g., https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only consider versions that are published on the first index
      that contains a given package, to avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted, use `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to
      consider all versions from all indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.

</code></pre>
<p>It looks like the issue is here:</p>
<pre><code>WARN Skipping file for my-package: Failed to parse `requires-python`: `^3.10`
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't understand why it's failing to parse the version field.
Idk if it matters, but this package that I'm trying to install was packaged using poetry</p>

<p>That's not a valid dependency specifier. See:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#requires-python</li>
<li>https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll need to open an issue with Poetry. You should use <code>&gt;=3.10,&lt;3.11</code> instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Got it.
It would be helpful though to have an actual error message by default (without the need of specifying <code>-vv</code>).
Most users (like myself) wouldn't know about <code>-vv</code>, so can be very tricky to debug</p>
