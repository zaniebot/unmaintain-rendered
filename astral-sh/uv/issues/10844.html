            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a pyproject.toml like</p>
<pre><code>[project]

requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;typing-extensions&gt;=4.0,&lt;5.0&quot;,
    &quot;tomli&gt;=1.1.0; python_version &lt; '3.11'&quot;,
    &quot;click&gt;=8.0.0&quot;,
]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    &quot;pre-commit&gt;=4.0.1&quot;,
    &quot;pylint&gt;=3.3.3&quot;,
    &quot;pyright&gt;=1.1.392.post0&quot;,
    &quot;pytest&gt;=8.3.4&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-cov&gt;=6.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;ruff&gt;=0.9.2&quot;
]
docs = [
    &quot;furo&gt;=2023.9.10&quot;,
    &quot;readthedocs-sphinx-search==0.3.2&quot;,
    &quot;sphinx==8.1.3&quot;,
    &quot;sphinx-copybutton&gt;=0.5.2&quot;,
    &quot;sphinx_rtd_theme==3.0.2&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>and get the following error when i do <code>uv sync --python 3.11</code></p>
<pre><code>uv sync --no-cache --python 3.11
  x No solution found when resolving dependencies for split
  | (python_full_version == '3.9.*'):
  `-&gt; Because the requested Python version (&gt;=3.9) does not satisfy
      Python&gt;=3.10 and sphinx==8.1.3 depends on Python&gt;=3.10, we can conclude
      that sphinx==8.1.3 cannot be used.
      And because pymend:docs depends on sphinx==8.1.3 and your project
      requires pymend:docs, we can conclude that your project's requirements
      are unsatisfiable.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (&gt;=3.9) includes Python versions
      that are not supported by your dependencies (e.g., sphinx==8.1.3 only
      supports &gt;=3.10). Consider using a more restrictive `requires-python`
      value (like &gt;=3.10).

</code></pre>
<p>I also have no other mentions of &quot;docs&quot; in my pyproject.toml (e.g not in the default groups of tool.uv)
What exactly am i doing wrong here?</p>
<p>My runtime dependencies support down to python 3.9, but for development (or rather docs) i require at least 3.10 which i have available locally and at readthedocs.</p>

<p>is just a confusing way to describe how the group is being included in the resolution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, the project is called pymend. I would just like to be able to install it locally with <code>uv sync</code> and not have the docs group be included. Currently readthedocs still works best with just a separate requirements.txt file so i am using it there but already wanted to create the group in my pyproject.toml. I guess i can just remove it for now but i still dont quite understand how it is blocking it on a uv sync if i havent specified it as being used.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We perform a lock for the entire project (regardless of selected groups) before syncing the subset you asked for.</p>
<p>e.g., this fails on lock:</p>
