            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am using <code>uv</code> to make it easier to distribute our Python CLI. I would like our installation process to be as easy as possible, but there's one step of friction on Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We ask the user to run <code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://mycompany/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</code>, which hosts a modified version of the <code>uv</code> <code>install.ps1</code> script with one additional command to install our package</p>
</li>
<li><p>The command runs the following code at the end of the install script:</p>
<pre><code>Write-Information &quot;everything's installed!&quot;
  if (-not $NoModifyPath) {
    Add-Ci-Path $dest_dir
    if (Add-Path $dest_dir) {
        Write-Information &quot;&quot;
        Write-Information &quot;To add $dest_dir to your PATH, either restart your shell or run:&quot;
        Write-Information &quot;&quot;
        Write-Information &quot;    set Path=$dest_dir;%Path%   (cmd)&quot;
        Write-Information &quot;    `$env:Path = `&quot;$dest_dir;`$env:Path`&quot;   (powershell)&quot;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>This requires our users to read this note and run the specified command (or open a new shell).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there hack or workaround to automatically modify the user's <em>current</em> shell so that they don't have to start a new shell or run this command, and immediately use our tool (or <code>uv</code>)? It would be amazing if we could get some help to make this smoother.</p>
<p>Also generally, it would be very helpful if <code>uv</code> had a blessed script about how to distribute packages using the <code>uv</code> installer as the base. Thank you all for the excellent tool!</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>User runs:</p>
<pre><code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>User can immediately then run:</p>
<pre><code>uv --version
</code></pre>
<p>And it would work</p>

<p>I'm afraid not, even official microsoft installers have this limitation (there's an equivalent problem on unix too).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. At the moment, UV is a single executable file.
Accordingly, you can write a small launcher that downloads this file from github and runs your script through it.
I've already tried this, I liked it, everything works well.
UV downloads itself, downloads python, and runs your python script. Everything happens very quickly. Fast, simple.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What about
<code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot; &amp;&amp; $env:Path += &quot;;$HOME/.local/uv/bin&quot;</code></p>
