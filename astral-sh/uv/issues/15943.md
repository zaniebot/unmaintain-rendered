# Make --frozen default instead of the other way round

---

_Issue opened by @ghpqans on 2025-09-19 07:59_

### Summary

Forgetting to specify `--frozen` on `uv sync`, `uv run` etc. mostly changes `uv.lock` file.
However, the sense of the `uv.lock` file is to maintain exactly the same set of dependencies over source-trees of different developers working at the same project.

I think it would be better to make it the default to not implicitly change the `uv.lock` file until explicitly requested.


### Example

One way that might be useful is to perform `uv-lock` with `pre-commit` in CI.

I don't know when the `--frozen` flag is no longer used, but it does not change the `uv.lock` file anymore.

Do I understand correctly, that the `--frozen` is already the default in newer versions of `uv`? Is this kind of deprecating my request? Please clarify

We're unlikely to change the current default behavior, while there are pros and cons, we found automatic lockfile updates to work better with most workflows. You can set the `UV_FROZEN=1` environment variable if you want to change this behavior on your machine.

I'll try that. Sounds doable.
