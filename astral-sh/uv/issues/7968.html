            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At <code>winget</code> the latest available version of <code>uv</code> is v0.4.15. But currently v0.4.18 is already released. It would be good if the latest version of uv could also be obtained via winget.</p>

If you need it on winget, maybe it would be faster to open a PR to provide the new version?
Because winget doesn't seem to be an officially maintained source by UV.</p>
<p>Edit:
Someone has opened a PR.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, thanks. I assumed that it is officially supported as it is also mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#winget">official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Have you considered having a member of the UV team create PRs for UV on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs">winget-pkgs</a>?
Or let the community create PRs for UV on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs">winget-pkgs</a> on their own?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I'm unsure about the specific licensing terms for distributing binaries under MIT and Apache-2.0 licenses, and I want to avoid violating any CLA agreements. However, based on my understanding of these licenses, as long as I provide the original source and licensing terms, I should be fine.</p>
<p>Edit:
After verifying that there are no problems and that no identical PRs exist, I will complete <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/pull/179771">my pull request</a>.
The PR Merged.</p>

<p>Also, as the pull request is directly created by the package publisher &amp; author, the pull request will be &quot;privileged&quot; and can immediately merged after validation pipeline is passed. Contributors &amp; volunteers don't have these privileges, and they might not be noticed at once, leading &quot;always outdated&quot; problem.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh">JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh</a>, he performs version updates frequently and all these updates are synced and merged to <code>winget</code> source soon after the release action. 🙏🏼</p>
