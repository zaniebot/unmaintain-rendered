            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
How Your Idea Would Work
<p>The workflow you&#x27;re proposing would be a huge quality-of-life improvement. It might look something like this:
Your pyproject.toml has an unpinned dependency like &quot;torch&quot;.
You run uv sync.
uv checks its global cache and sees that the last version of torch you installed from the nightly source was 2.7.0.dev20251012.
It then quickly checks the online repository and sees that a newer version, 2.7.0.dev20251013, is available.
Instead of just automatically downloading the new one, it prompts you:
Found a recent version of &#x27;torch&#x27; (2.7.0.dev20251012) in your cache.
The latest version available is 2.7.0.dev20251013.</p>
<p>Use the cached version and skip the download? [Y/n]:</p>
Why It&#x27;s a Great Suggestion
<p>It Promotes Stability by Default: This makes your environment&#x27;s versions &quot;sticky.&quot; They won&#x27;t change unless you explicitly tell them to, which is much safer than automatically grabbing the latest, potentially broken, nightly build.
It Saves Time and Bandwidth: It directly avoids the slow dependency resolution and re-download process for minor updates.
It&#x27;s User-Centric: It makes the tool feel more like an intelligent assistant that understands your workflow, rather than just a command executor.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll add prompting for this, it doesn&#x27;t really mesh with the overall user experience we&#x27;re trying to build.</p>
<p>I think you are asking for a similar thing to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16108">astral-sh/uv#16108</a> though.</p>

<p>This is provided by lockfiles. I recommend using them. If you&#x27;re using <code>uv sync</code>, then you should be already. We don&#x27;t fetch new versions unless you use <code>--refresh</code> or <code>--upgrade</code>.</p>
