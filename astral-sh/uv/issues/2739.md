# Can this install the right version of python?

_Issue opened by @dillfrescott on 2024-03-31 02:40_

Or do i have to go out and download the right version of python for the project I'm trying to run?

```shell
× Could not find `python.exe` through `py --list-paths` or in 'PATH'. Is Python installed?
```

Thats a bummer, especially considering you can only install one version of python at a time on windows without using third party tools such as conda...

It should be included in the venv!

We don't currently bootstrap uninstalled Python versions but we plan to in the future. (This will be the first piece: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2617)

I'm not sure if you consider these third-party, but you can install as many Python versions as you like from both python.org directly and the Windows Store via the Pythons that are distributed by the PSF.
