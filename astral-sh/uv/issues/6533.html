Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<h2>In Short</h2>
<p>I would like the uv install shell script to allow installing a tool in the same line.</p>
<p>Not sure the right API, but a single line to copy paste and have the tool available, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh?tool=my-awesome-cli | sh
</code></pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For people building CLIs (e.g. with Typer) that work as independent tools (users don't necessarily need to interact or know about Python) it would be nice to provide a simple way to install those CLIs.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Right now, installing a Python CLI requires something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Python</li>
<li>Install <code>pipx</code></li>
<li>Run <code>pipx install my-awesome-cli</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of things to explain and a lot of things to do and understand for someone that just wants to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ my-awesome-cli
✨ magic ✨
</code></pre>
<h3>With uv</h3>
<p>Now with uv, that could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install uv with:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Install my tool with:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv tool install my-awesome-cli
</code></pre>
<p>That's still a 2-step process.</p>
<h3>Alternatives bundling</h3>
<p>There are some alternatives that bundle everything in a single installer like PyInstaller, Py2exe, PyOxidizer.</p>
<p>Those all result in having a single self-executable that has everything, including Python. But that means developers need to use that to build the bundle and build for each platform, test it, etc.</p>
<p>I think this would be similar to what is requested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5802</p>
<h3>Alternative with pure <code>pip</code></h3>
<p>There's also the alternative of not explaining much, just expecting users to have Python installed, and telling them to install with <code>pip</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ pip install my-awesome-cli
</code></pre>
<p>but that means that by default people would install in the global environment with all its problems.</p>
<p>Requiring people to install Python, <code>pip</code>, then <code>pipx</code> to be able to install my CLI package can be too cumbersome to have it as the main/official solution.</p>
<h2>uv shell script with tool</h2>
<p>What I propose is, it would be great if there was a way to put a single snippet in the docs for a CLI tool that would take care of installing the CLI app with anything necessary (that users of just a CLI probably don't care about, like Python, venvs, etc).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh?tool=my-awesome-cli | sh
</code></pre>
<p>It would be very easy to embed that in the README of a CLI tool, just copy the install scripts for uv and add the tool parameter, and users would get the CLI with everything needed already there.</p>
<p>That would simplify the process for tool developers, and being a single line to copy would be a very appealing reason to just suggest uv instead of any additional process with other tools.</p>
<p>A side effect would be that final users would then end up having uv in their system for anything else. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cool idea! I wonder if we could do something like create a dedicated shell script for this that does something like...</p>
<ol>
<li>Checks if you have uv installed, if not, download to a temporary directory</li>
<li>Installs the tool with uv</li>
<li>If uv was temporary, removes it</li>
</ol>
<p>So we don't install uv and leave it around if they're just installing some tool?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds cool! :rocket:</p>
<p>I actually wouldn't mind keeping uv around, I want it to become the de facto standard for installing Python and Python projects. :sunglasses:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a cool idea! One liners are always awesome.</p>
<p>I agree with @tiangolo that users can quickly get overwhelmed and bogged down by all the idiosyncrasies of (properly) setting up a python environment.</p>
<p>Would it be a bad if <code>uv</code> bootstrapped itself? Perhaps on first run (with any command) it could copy itself to a canonical user directory (<code>home/.cargo/bin</code>) and add that location to the path for future invocations (would have to refresh the active terminal for path changes).</p>
<p>Then tool usage could just look something like this:</p>
<p>Linux</p>
<pre><code>curl -L https://astral.sh/uv ; ./uv run my-awesome-cli
</code></pre>
<p>Windows</p>
<pre><code>curl -L https://astral.sh/uv.exe ; uv run my-awesome-cli
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe even set up a platform detection/redirect for the right binary if that’s possible when interfacing with the website from <code>curl</code>? I know that it’s possible from a browser.</p>
<p>(On Windows <code>curl</code> uses <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code> in both PowerShell and Command Prompt. System PowerShell doesn’t support <code>&amp;&amp;</code> but newer versions do.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Came here to say this would really make a big difference in tool installation convenience. I cooked up something real quick, if it helps anyone in the meantime.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">curl -LsSf https://uhd-urz.github.io/py/install.sh | sh -s -- &lt;package-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also just host the <a href="https://github.com/uhd-urz/py/blob/main/install.sh">installation script</a> under your domain/repo and it should work the same way.</p>
