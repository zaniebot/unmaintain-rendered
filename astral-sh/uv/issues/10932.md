# Ability to "Run Python file" using "uv run" in VS Code

---

_Issue opened by @valentincalomme on 2025-01-24 09:27_

### Summary

I love the ability to run standalone scripts. However, I wish there was a way to do it with the "play" button in VS Code. It simply needs to run the opened script using "uv script".

This could be implemented in a `uv` VS Code extension, similar to a `ruff` extension.

With that said, here are some additional ideas for features that a `uv` VS Code extension could provide:
- ability to visualize the dependency tree (i.e., results of `uv tree`)
- wizards to add or update dependencies
- ability to view installed tools
- manage Python versions, etc.
