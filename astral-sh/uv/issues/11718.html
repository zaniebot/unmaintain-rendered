<p>Hello!</p>
<p>How can I provide dynamic fields when using uv build backend? For example a dynamic <code>version</code>?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As someone using <code>setuptools-scm</code> for over a decade I really wanted to attempt a more major switch to uv (instead of just making use of it as pip and pip-tools replacement). still, not being able to get the dynamic versioning from git tags seems to be quite a big issue.</p>
<p>I was able to find https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning/ interesting but sadly that seems to be focused on hatchling and I do not want to entry into that domain.</p>
<p>If I am to repace setuptool-scm with something, I don't want it to be poetry or hatchling, it has to be something <code>uv build</code> centric.</p>
<p>If someone already managed to get this to work, mention me here with a link. I am very curious to try it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, me too I just changed the version to 0.0.0 and on CI, before <code>uv publish</code> I bump with <code>uv version</code>. That pipeline already extracts the right version number from git tags.</p>

<p><code>uv build</code> works perfectly fine even if you have hatchling in your <code>pyproject.toml</code> for building. I use this combination all the time, it's very fast and works great.</p>
<p>Maybe you already knew this, and actually was talking about <code>uv_build</code> (the build backend) rather than <code>uv build</code> (a command in the frontend). And I'm definitely not objecting to this feature request. I just thought it worth noting for anyone who doesn't realise that you can mix and match build frontends and backends.</p>
