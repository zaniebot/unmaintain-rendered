# Remove use of expensive packages in tests `tool_run_csv_with` and `tool_run_repeated_with`

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-01-15 21:05_

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7909 added some test cases like `tool_run_csv_with` and `tool_run_repeated_with` which appear in our slow tests list (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/878#issuecomment-2593922536) presumably because they're using expensive packages like `pandas` and `numpy`. We shouldn't use big packages like that unless we absolutely have to.
