It renders correctly for me, did you resize the window while it was resolving?

For what it's worth, tmux 1.9 is over a decade old. I'm not confident that updating tmux will help (and I wasn't able to repro your issue by building 1.9 locally and trying it in my Alacritty terminal), but it's worth a shot. Also what terminal are you using?

ah its the tmux synology comes with that is very old indeed! ;)

I'm using https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/ for Windows as a terminal. Do you think that might be the issue? I'll try another one
