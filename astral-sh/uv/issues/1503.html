            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It appears (juding by <code>strace</code> output) that <code>uv</code> doesn't currently support reading pip's config files (e.g. <code>/etc/xdg/pip/pip.conf</code>). The feature I'm after specifically is already described in #1474 (support for the <code>cert</code> entry in the config file/via a cmdline flag) but I'm curious about the general stance the <code>uv</code> takes with reading pip's config files, and other potential users might be interested too.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd prefer <em>not</em> to read configuration files designed for other tools. Like, we should support a configuration file and configuration format, but (similar to in Ruff), I'd prefer if it's our own format, etc. Otherwise, we have to figure out how to support reading those files across multiple versions of the target tool, and support any changes they make to the format in the future.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Makes a lot of sense, and thank you for the <em>rapid</em> response! Looking forward to trying <code>uv</code>!</p>
<p>Happy for this issue to be closed as far as I'm concerned, though it might be worth mentioning this stance in the readme/documentation. PRs welcome?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it makes sense to document this yet as we're still establishing our formal stance around configuration files. I appreciate the offer though!</p>
