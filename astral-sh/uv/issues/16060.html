            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>uv is already an excellent tool, but some common developer workflows are still missing or incomplete. Below are several feature requests that would make uv more practical in everyday use.
1.	One-click upgrade of all packages in a bare venv
•	A command such as uv pip upgrade --all to upgrade every installed package in the current virtual environment.
•	This is particularly useful for quick experiments or temporary environments.
•	At the moment, this workflow is only possible in project mode (uv sync --upgrade), not in plain virtualenvs.
2.	Respect existing pip configuration (pip.conf / PIP_INDEX_URL)
•	Many users and organizations already configure custom indexes or mirrors via pip.conf or environment variables.
•	uv currently does not read these settings. Supporting them would lower the barrier to adoption.
•	Clearly documenting which pip settings are supported (and which are not) would also help.
3.	Show Python version for installed tools
•	uv tool list should display which Python interpreter each tool uses.
•	This makes it easier to debug path and environment issues, especially when multiple Python versions are installed.
4.	More intuitive editable installs
•	Improve support for uv pip install -e . or uv add --editable.
•	Developers frequently use editable installs for local development; behavior should be predictable and stable.
5.	Better workspace / monorepo support
•	Large projects often have multiple sub-modules.
•	uv could provide stronger support for shared dependencies, lock file management, and cross-module sync in monorepo structures.
•	Current behavior sometimes causes “module not found” or import issues in these setups.</p>
