            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is something I encounter regularly on Linux and Windows systems managed by companies, universities, research institutes, or other organizations: Python is installed system-wide and has system-wide packages in <code>/usr/local</code>. When users use pip outside a venv, packages will be installed in <code>~/.local</code>. Python will import from both sources.</p>
<p>How to reproduce on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-is-python
$ pip install numpy  # install as &quot;normal&quot; user
$ sudo su -  # switch to root
# pip install pandas  # install as root
$ exit  # switch to &quot;normal&quot; user
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy, pandas
&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.__file__
'/home/username/.local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py'
&gt;&gt;&gt; pandas.__file__
'/usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/dist-packages/pandas/__init__.py'
</code></pre>
<p>To me this seems to be desirable behavior for pip outside of venv. But I would understand if you don't want to support this because you (iiuc) want to encourage venv usage and added <code>--system</code> only for CI.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To clarify, pip supports installing to <code>~/.local</code> via the <code>--user</code> option. As mentioned above, this option is automatically a fallback when the system python install is not writeable. My guess is that this was deemed as a preferred behaviour so that users don't try to re-run pip with sudo.</p>

<p>I've been trying to be &quot;good&quot; and use <code>pipx</code> instead for these cases, e.g. python CLI application that I want globally. Would be great if <code>uv</code> eventually supported something like this (&quot;global venvs&quot;?) so that the <code>--user</code> option is not needed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Global packages allows you to install isolated applications at the system(global) level. These can be applications/cli's managed by admins for systems with multiple users.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>cli A uses pydantic v2</li>
<li>cli B uses pydantic v1</li>
</ul>
<p>All users should be able to use both cli A and B. Without the global/system feature these packages dependencies will conflict. The PR from pipx allows for these to be installed in isolated environments but available to all users at the global/system level.</p>

<p>I'm not actually trying to install a shared tool, it's just a package that would normally (with <code>pip</code>) fallback to installing to user.</p>
<p>My environment is in a Docker container, where I don't really need another python environment. I didn't want to add a venv to avoid increasing complexity, and I didn't want to run <code>uv pip install</code> with root privileges for security concerns. So it looks like I'm out of options.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't currently plan to support <code>--user</code> as I'm not yet convinced that it outweighs its complexity budget. In other words, it adds a lot of complexity (both to uv and to the user experience) but doesn't strike me as sufficiently useful to merit it -- the situations in which folks want it seem rare and I feel like the alternative solutions are totally fine (I don't think adding a venv is a big problem, nor is running with root privileges in a container). But I may change my mind on this in the future based on demand.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh The <code>--user</code> would matter if <code>uv</code> wants to tackle the enterprise environment. A lot of places require containers to be rootless in production. For local dev, homelabs, etc probably doesnt matter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But it seems natural that those containers could just use a virtual environment?</p>
<p>In practice, you may also be able to use <code>--prefix &lt;PATH_TO_USER_DIR&gt;</code>, e.g., <code>--prefix /Users/crmarsh/.local</code>, but not sure if that will work as expected on all Linux distros if they patch <code>distutils</code> or <code>sysconfig</code>.</p>
