            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Hello uv developers, thank you so much for your all efforts to develop uv! I want to suggest one small suggestion for the documentation.</p>
<p>At first, I didn&#x27;t understand the behaviors of <code>source-exclude</code> and <code>wheel-exclude</code> of uv build backend; specifying <code>wheel-exclude</code> only affects the contents of .whl but <code>source-exclude</code> affects both .tar.gz and .whl.</p>
<p>There are two options both for sdist and wheel (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#build-backend_source-exclude and https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#build-backend_wheel-exclude), made me think that each option would work for sdist and wheel, respectively. But when I create a wheel, the setting in <code>source-exclude</code> also applied to .whl (which surprised me a bit).</p>
<p>After reading the documentation of <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build"><code>uv build</code></a>, I noticed that <strong>the wheel was made from the source distribution when I ran <code>uv build</code></strong> (not <code>uv build --sdist --wheel</code>) and I understand the reason of this behavior (so, I had to read the docs more carefully). But I also think it would take time to understand this behavior for users directly landing the settings documentation.</p>
<p>Given the journey, I have one suggestion; how about adding some explanation about <code>uv build</code> (=wheel will be created from sdist) in the documentation for <code>source-exclude</code>? (I think it would be sufficient to add a link to uv-build from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#build-backend_source-exclude). Of course, I&#x27;d be happy to make a pull request if it would help.</p>
