# Tool to compare resolutions again pip-tools

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-10-26 11:42_

At the moment, we have no way of checking that our resolution are correct

Very basic script:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

TEMPD=$(mktemp -d)

time RUST_LOG=puffin=debug cargo run --bin puffin -- pip-compile ${1} > $TEMPD/puffin.txt
# > WARNING: --strip-extras is becoming the default in version 8.0.0. To silence this warning, either use --strip-extras
# > to opt into the new default or use --no-strip-extras to retain the existing behavior.
time pip-compile --strip-extras -o - -q ${1} > $TEMPD/pip-compile.txt
diff -u $TEMPD/pip-compile.txt $TEMPD/puffin.txt
```

Should we close this for now?

Yes, `compare_with_pip.py` works fine.
