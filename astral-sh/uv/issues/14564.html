            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! Thanks so much for uv!
So the issue is that, I have one package which does some compilation during the wheel build stage, and I want to disable it. It supports disabling it via env vars, but passing them seems to be not possible to the build stage of only this package via <code>pyproject.toml</code>?
The closest I've found is to add to this package:</p>
<pre><code>if &quot;electrum_ecc.dont_compile&quot; in sys.argv:
    sys.argv.remove(&quot;electrum_ecc.dont_compile&quot;)
    ELECTRUM_ECC_DONT_COMPILE = &quot;1&quot;
else:
    ELECTRUM_ECC_DONT_COMPILE = os.getenv(&quot;ELECTRUM_ECC_DONT_COMPILE&quot;) or &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>And then in my <code>pyproject.toml</code> in uv:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
config-settings = { &quot;--build-option&quot; = &quot;electrum_ecc.dont_compile&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>But the problem is, it does work, but this option is passed to all package builds
So when a non-related package is being built, it errors out because it doesn't know such thing:
<code>invalid command name 'electrum_ecc.dont_compile'</code></p>
<p>If I could provide it only during the wheel build of this specific package, it would help a lot!</p>
