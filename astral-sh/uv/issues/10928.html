            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently, uv supports entrypoint scripts but strictly requires package installation, which is problematic for standard applications with no packaging intentions. It would be great to support certain features of npm's scripts, e.g defining commands that are pre-configured with certain flags, as a new subcommand.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In similar fashion to npm:
<code>&quot;run_with_debug&quot;: &quot;uv run --directory src flask --app hello run --debug&quot; -&gt; uv execute run_with_debug</code>
Assuming paths are properly configured, this would also allow the user to execute a command such as the one above from any subdirectory under the project's root.</p>
