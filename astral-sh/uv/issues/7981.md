# Patch version resolve

---

_Issue opened by @matthias-Q on 2024-10-07 18:00_

Hi,
I want to migrate from a setup.py to pyproject.toml + uv setup. In my current configuration I use patch version pinning, e.g. `package==1.8.*`. Pip installs version 1.8.10, which is the latest version. `uv` installs 1.8.0, which I find odd. The same happens for `package~=1.8`. I think this is a bug.

I use uv 0.4.11 on Linux.

Hmm, I was running this today in an CI pipeline and tested it extensively. Now I also cannot reproduce this. Ok sorry for the hassle. I will close this issue.
