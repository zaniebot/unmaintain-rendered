            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A realization I came to when reading over the marker tree code (while reviewing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21050">astral-sh/ruff#21050</a>). We currently impose two domain constraints on a given marker tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>requires-python</code> range.</li>
<li>Known mutually-incompatible marker pairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first we handle using the &quot;complexify&quot; and &quot;simplify&quot; routines, where &quot;complexify&quot; maps ranges outside of the domain to false, while &quot;simplify&quot; removes these ranges entirely. The second we handle somewhat ad-hoc by simplifying away incompatible markers.</p>
<p>Looking at both of these cases as domain restrictions, we can instead represent inputs outside of the domain as &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; nodes, which are simplified away when checking satisfiability and when rendering the tree, which only consider inputs within the domain. This should also enable optimal simplification when considering mutually-incompatible pairs.</p>
<p>Ideally this means &quot;complexify&quot; maps ranges outside the domain to &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;, and &quot;simplify&quot; goes away entirely, similar to the &quot;restrict&quot; operation we had before <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6268">astral-sh/uv#6268</a>. However, it&#x27;s possible that we need to keep &quot;complexify&quot; and have &quot;simplify&quot; instead perform the domain restriction via &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; nodes, depending on how we need to handle merging overlapping domains.</p>
