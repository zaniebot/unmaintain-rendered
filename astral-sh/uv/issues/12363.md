# Clarification on recommended usage of uv for collaborative projects on network drives

### Question

Hi!

First off, thanks a lot for the great work that's being done on uv 👊 

I'm involved in trying to standardize Python usage a bit more at our company, and as part of that we're currently recommending uv with miniconda as a fallback. We have a really diverse set of users: experienced developers, data scientists, and other scientists/engineers, although certainly not as diverse as the users of uv 😉.  We're really hoping to have one tool across these users to simplify collaboration. There's several issues that are relevant to us, for example: #1703, #1495, #1156, #11314, #6834.

I think the data science needs are covered well by other issues, so I won't repeat that. However, there's fewer issues on recommend practices for working on network drives. This is most relevant for our scientists/engineers who typically collaborate on projects whose files are stored on network drives. Project files can be quite large, and typically exist alongside simple Python scripts for processing them. Users aren't commonly accessing these drives at the exact same time, but different people can rotate into the project, or need to access it for legacy reasons. Additionally, it could be the same person accessing the project folder from a different remote computer (e.g. different workflows requiring different hardware). Most users are on VS Code.

The problems they've had are:

1. Can't use uv's project centric commands (e.g. sync, add, etc.) in the network drive, since the virtual environment created only works for the computer + user that created it.
2. Getting VS Code to recognize the environments.

I note that there's VIRTUAL_ENV for _environment centric_ workflows, and PROJECT_VIRTUAL_ENV for _project centric_ workflows, which somehow seem relevant. This user group would prefer not to use environment variables, and are looking for a more seamless approach, especially considering they might hop between several projects in a single day. Ideally, they could open a visual studio code workspace on a mapped network drive, run one command (e.g. uv sync), and then start their workflow.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, including if there's any planned improvements you think would be relevant 😄 

PS - I'll also share this thread with my colleagues who may add additional info to better describe use cases.

Best regards,
Ryan

Hi, I am just following up to see if there's been any consideration given to the above?

I think #1495 is the "key" missing feature for you, where you'd set that to some local location and each user would have a different environment store.

The problem is that there's no way for the editor to find those environments, e.g., we'd need to add a VS Code plugin for discovering the environments. We could write a `.venv` file that links to the project environment, but that will rely on all users having the same target location so they don't clobber each other.

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13989 (or something like it) might also help for recognizing cases where the .venv doesn't match the current machine and needs to be recreated?
