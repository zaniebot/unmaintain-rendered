# Inconsistent `hint` and `help` text in resolver failure

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-07-12 12:08_

Given:

```toml
[project]
name = "project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = [
]
```

Running:

```
❯ uv add "mcp[cli]"
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (python_full_version == '3.9.*'):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.9) does not satisfy Python>=3.10 and your project depends on mcp[cli],
      we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.13, the resolution failed for other Python versions supported by your
      project. Consider limiting your project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking
        and syncing.
```

The hint text is rendered by us; the help text is rendered by Miette. And they appear at different levels of indentation, with different styling (`hint` is bold, `help` is not).

I can reproduce on main branch. @charliermarsh Should we update the hint or help text format here?

```bash
Using CPython 3.12.9
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (markers: python_full_version == '3.9.*'):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.9) does not satisfy Python>=3.10 and your project depends on mcp[cli], we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.12, the resolution failed for other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting your project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and syncing.

I think we want to use `hint:` everywhere and drop `miette` entirely, but I don't know how much work that will be.
