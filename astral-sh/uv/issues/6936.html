            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve been trying to track down some info related to &quot;why is uv&quot; faster than <code>pip</code> and I was somehow successful. I found that this is often the first question I get when I mention <code>uv</code> to people. I say &quot;it&#x27;s faster than <code>pip</code>&quot; and people say &quot;yeah, but how, you&#x27;re still downloading the same stuff?&quot;.</p>
<p>I would find it extremely helpful to have some section explaining the performance gains.</p>
<p>Obviously, no need to delve into <code>rust</code>-specific optimization or even internal secrets, but I think it would be great to have some sort of blog-like section explaining why <code>uv</code> works as fast as it does</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this probably makes more sense as a blog post than documentation that we maintain, but yeah it&#x27;d be cool to write! cc @konstin who did some work on this previously.</p>
