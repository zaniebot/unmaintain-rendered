# uv export with --no-editable still contains the dot from the editable install

_Issue opened by @marioweid on 2025-01-16 08:07_

Hey,

i noticed this when i was trying out the uv pre-commit hooks (`uv-export`).
When running `uv export --no-hashes --no-dev --no-editable --output-file=requirements.txt`, the 3rd line of the file (the line where the editable install is without the --no-editable argument) still contains the dot of the `-e .`
This leads to an error when you try to install the constrain file using pip.

```
ERROR: Can't verify hashes for these file:// requirements because they point to directories:
    <ci_workspace_here> (from -r requirements.txt (line 3))
```

command: `uv export --no-hashes --no-dev --output-file=requirements.txt`
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv export --no-hashes --no-dev --output-file=req.txt
-e .
aiohappyeyeballs==2.4.4
aiohttp==3.11.11
...
```

command: `uv export --no-hashes --no-dev --no-editable --output-file=requirements.txt`
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv export --no-hashes --no-dev --output-file=req.txt
.

...
```

Solved:
`--no-editable` might be the wrong argument, `--no-emit-workspace` did the trick
