# git tag not preserved on compile requirements, converted to SHA

_Issue opened by @nmichlo on 2024-05-31 12:13_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


The git tag is not preserved when compiling (unless I missed a config option) -- This is also an incompatibility with `pip compile` which preserves this information.

for example
```
echo "uv @ git+https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git@0.2.5" > r.txt

uv pip compile r.txt
```

results in:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile r.txt
uv @ git+https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git@47db418ba26dd4b720ec968b2520f2483842419d
    # via -r r.txt
```

The above should be:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile r.txt
uv @ git+https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.git@0.2.5
    # via -r r.txt
```

This is intentional — we lock to a specific revision.

Closing as "working as intended".

Understood for security reasons, is there any possibility of adding a CLI flag to allow this as it does break direct 1:1 compatibility when moving from pip-compile, so that this can be re-enabled?

@charliermarsh I've run into a case where this causes an error.

If resolved and the downstream repo lists the tag, then the upstream repo that installs using this file causes a resolution error because the tag does not match the SHA.

This would be considered a bug as it generates an invalid requirements file that can't be installed.

Can this issue be reopened for discussion regarding this?

Can you give a concrete example? It seems _correct_ to fail there.
