            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm trying to install the <code>pyqt5</code> library on a Linux server with the following specifications:</p>
<pre><code>OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble)
Architecture: ARM64 (aarch64)
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I run:
<code>uv add pyqt5</code></p>
<p>I get this error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">error: Distribution `pyqt5-qt5==5.15.16 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that there's no pre-built pyqt5 package for arm64. I tested this on an x86_64 machine, and it worked fine.</p>
<p>I’ve tried solutions from stackoverflow and ai generated suggestions, but none of them worked.</p>
<p>The only way I managed to install pyqt5 was using:
<code>sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5</code></p>
<p>However, my project uses uv, and I’d prefer to install it that way.
Any workaround to make it work with uv on arm64?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (Noble)
Architecture: ARM64 (aarch64)</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.5.11</p>
