            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I ran into a situation where downgrading one dependency caused many other packages to update unexpectedly.</p>
<p>My project depends tightly on the darts library. I initially added it using:</p>
<p>uv add u8darts[all]</p>
<p>This created a requirement like u8darts[all]&gt;=0.37.1 in my pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>At some point, darts was updated to version 0.38.0 (not sure when it happened), which introduced breaking changes. To fix this, I tried downgrading with:</p>
<p>uv add u8darts[all]==0.37.1</p>
<p>However, uv then upgraded many other dependencies in the environment, even though I was only trying to downgrade this one package.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Why does uv trigger many package upgrades when downgrading a single dependency? Probably this is the cause for darts being upgraded to 0.38.0 in the first place. How can I avoid this?</p>
<p>What’s the recommended workflow for pinning or downgrading a dependency like this without affecting unrelated packages?</p>
<p>What am I missing or doing wrong here? What’s the best setup or workflow for this kind of use case?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Windows 11</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.11 (0632e24d1 2025-03-30)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@JuanCruzC97  have u tried isolation or dependencies constraints settings from <code>uv</code> you can refer <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/">here</a>  and also try to update <code>uv</code> version to <code>latest</code> by <code>uv self update</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should happen very rarely, and only when there was a conflict resolving dependencies, in a way that uv couldn't resolve when starting with the versions in the lockfile. I recommend putting upper bounds on dependencies which tend to make breaking changes as protection, otherwise uv can't really know that it must not upgrade.</p>
