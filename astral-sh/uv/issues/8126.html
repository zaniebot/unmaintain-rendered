            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think that this is an issue, it's most likely a question.</p>
<p>In my case, I am using the <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pkgs/container/gdal/259415026?tag=ubuntu-small-3.9.2">GDAL official docker image</a> that already comes with its bindings and Python packages properly installed. I would like to use UV to manage this system's Python installation and to add other packages on top of it. I have seen the flag <code>--system</code> but I'm not certain what it does, it definitely doesn't let me to do this.</p>
<p>For example, the system's installation has the <code>gdal</code> package properly installed but not <code>pandas</code>, so I would like to use UV to install <code>pandas</code> on the system's installation and run my scripts without the need for creating a virtual environment.</p>
<p>I have tested as well setting the following environment variables:</p>
<pre><code>ENV UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON &quot;true&quot;
ENV UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE &quot;only-system&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But still, when I run <code>uv run --frozen python main.py</code>, it creates a virtual environment instead of running over the system instalation. This also happens when running <code>uv sync</code> 🤔</p>
<p>FYI: GDAL is a geospatial set of tools that are usually quite tedious to install, so using the official docker image is a practical way to do so, better than just starting from the Python image and installing GDAL to it</p>
