            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First of all, thank you for a great tool!</p>
<p>I have not used anything else than .venv and pip before, so I may have different needs from the documentation than most. With that in mind, could we get more use-case based documentation?</p>
<p>My specific use case was that I had a project in a repo that I wanted to set up on a different computer. Reading the documentation, about lockfiles: <code>This file should be checked into version control, allowing for consistent and reproducible installations across machines.</code>, I figured that the uv.lock file should be checked into version control, and used to reproduce the environment on the differenct computer. However <code>git clone (..) &amp; uv init &amp; uv sync</code> overwrites the <code>uv.lock</code> file. I think that means that both <code>pyproj.toml</code> and <code>uv.lock</code> should be checked into version control?</p>
<p>Just a small proposal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syncing projects across machines</p>
<p>To sync projects between machines using version control, check in both the uv.lock file and pyproj.toml into version control. On the new machine, clone your repository. Run uv init (?) / run uv sync (...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related to this is the use case of adding uv on already existing projects (uv init will generate a folder structure and hello.py and thus doesn't like the right way of doing this.)</p>
<p>I think for us that are new to tooling systems like this, it will help a lot to follow specific use-case as all the different concepts can be a bit overwhelming when trying to piece it together.</p>
