            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How does <code>uvx</code> determine which Python version to use when <code>--python</code> is not explicitly specified?
I had a quick look through the document, but I couldn't find anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The document version I'm looking for is the one generated using commit 21408c1f351b159a9b590bcfefcfe645838e33c1</p>

<p>If UV first analyze the requirements to determine the supported Python version range, and then run the default Python discovery rules based on the results, would it be a better way to find the Python version?</p>
<p>However, it seems like Pip can still download packages even if they aren't explicitly categorized for a specific Python version. For instance, MonkeyType's highest categorized version is Python 3.10, but it can be installed in a Python 3.12 environment.</p>
<p>Despite the questions I raised about this find strategy, it seems to have had no practical impact.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The supported Python range of... all possible versions of the requirements? Then we try to find out if you have that installed? I don't think that's really tractable, but we have a bigger problem: we need a Python interpreter for markers to figure out what your platform is — we usually need a Python interpreter before we can start resolution for an installation.</p>
<p>We ignore upper bounds on package's Python requirements, generally.</p>

<p>Explicitly specifying --python for this issue might be the best solution.
Therefore, should the document mention that uvx uses Python discovery rules?
If a specific version is required, --python should be explicitly specified.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess I feel like that's implicitly documented? Nearly every command uses Python discovery rules. I can try to add some clarity about that to the documentation though.</p>
