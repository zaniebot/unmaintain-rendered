            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If a source distribution requires <code>hatching&gt;=2.0.0</code>, and we have <code>2.0.1</code> in the cache, but <code>2.0.2</code> is available on PyPI, we should just use <code>2.0.1</code> (whereas the resolver would often choose <code>2.0.2</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm a little worried about this causing hard to debug build failures, we use a seemingly random version in the middle between oldest and latest possible version that might lack bugfixes, even though it works on another machine that doesn't have the cache. As a user, always using the latest version would be more intuitive for me.</p>
<p>We should consider printing the build environment when reporting build failures. When we stick with the cache strategy, we should also tell the user how to override it.</p>
<p>We also can't save the build dependencies in the lockfile because they are not static (<code>get_requires_for_build_wheel</code>) and the build often only happens on some platforms. Using the main resolution as base for the sdist resolution would be certainly helpful though.</p>
<p>One other interesting approach: If we had the possible to do a resolution as of a specific timestamp, we could do the resolution at the same timestamp as the lockfile. I'm not sure if this is a good idea (it's definitive not obvious to a developer trying to debug a build failure), but it would be an alternative that's similarly predictable to always picking the latest version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>source distribution building is so slow that i don't think the resolution matters anyway, so i'm also fine with just moving this to the future milestone.</p>
