# uv 0.5.25 and later fail on Windows arm64 because they do not install Python

---

_Issue opened by @JayBazuzi on 2025-02-13 21:59_

### Summary

We really love uv and the fact that it solves so many Python bootstrapping and module management problems, regardless of environment. We were surprised to discover this problem.

**Note** This problem still occurs with the latest version of uv, 0.5.31.

# Problem

uv stops working as of version 0.5.25+ on Windows Arm64.

# Machine setup

- Mac with Apple silicon
- Parallels
- Windows 11 (Arm)

# Steps to reproduce

On a Windows arm64 machine, cleaned with:

## Clean the machine
```bat
del /s/q %USERPROFILE%\.local\
del /s/q %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\uv\
del /s/q %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\uv\
```

**Note** It's odd that we have to clean both `AppData\Roaming` and `AppData\Local`. Is that intentional?

## Works on 0.5.24

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.5.24/install.ps1 | iex"
uv run python --version
```

Gives:

```
Python 3.13.1
```

## Does not work on 0.5.25+

```bat
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.5.25/install.ps1 | iex"
uv run python --version
```

Gives:

```
error: No interpreter found in virtual environments, managed installations, search path, or registry
```

Also,

```bat
uv python install
```

Gives

```
error: No download found for request: cpython-any-windows-aarch64-none
```

# Recommendations

If you cannot find an arm64 Python for Windows, it should probably default back to the x64 Python for Windows.

# Extras

This is a related bug, but we do not believe ours is a duplicate: https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/386 because this used to work and now it doesn't.

# Followup

P.S. We would be happy to do a Zoom call about this, if that would be helpful.

Hmm, this is interesting. I thought we only started publishing ARM Windows binaries in 0.5.25, with https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10885. Is it the case that on 0.5.24, `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.5.24/install.ps1 | iex"` installs the x86 uv binary?

@charliermarsh I just ran into the same problem with 0.6.0. It does indeed look like 0.5.24 is installing an x86-64 binary:

```powershell
PS C:\Users\mattie\.local\bin> wsl file uv.exe
uv.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows, 6 sections
```

To confirm: I assume the uv installed by 0.6.0 (or any recent version) _does_ work if you already have Python installed on the machine? And the issue is just that we can't find a Python to install?

It seems like, at minimum, we should accept an x86 Python download here, since Windows ARM has emulation enabled by default.

There are a bunch of places that this fallback could go... I guess a special case in `PythonDownloadRequest::satisfied_by_key` is sort of the "obvious" one. But we might want to explicitly prefer ARM versions over x86 versions, which may require putting this somewhere else?

I implemented something similar for https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9788 — it was kind of awkward.

I don't think we should just do it for download requests, because we'd also want to accept discovered x86-64 interpreters, right? I can probably look into this unless you're particularly interested.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-02-16 15:58_

Feel free to take it, I was just looking to do it if it was easy. But yeah, I believe it has to be reflected in at least two places.

It looks like y'all might have this in hand but just in case it's useful, this is what I ran into yesterday—

1. New ARM Windows 11, never had Python or uv.
2. Installed uv 0.6.0 to run a project.
3. "uv sync" showed "error: No download found for request: cpython-any-windows-aarch64-none" which led me here.
4. Installed 0.5.24 via the one-liner. "uv sync" et al. started working as it was pulling the AMD64 python build (and that's when I posted that my uv.exe was an x86-64 version.)

Since then, I did update—both with the 0.5.25 one-liner and with "uv self update"—and the AMD64 Python is indeed still working with no fuss.

Yeah the difference is now we have ARM64 Windows binaries of uv but only AMD64 Windows Python downloads — so you're getting the "better" uv binary for your platform but it can't find Python downloads. You could install the AMD64 uv 0.6.0 (i.e., from GitHub Releases) and it'd work as before.
