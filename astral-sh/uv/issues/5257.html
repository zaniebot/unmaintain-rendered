<p>Jupyterlab wants to handle Ctrl-C but it doesn't get a chance to do it when started from uv run.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce</p>
<ol>
<li>uv init jptest</li>
<li>cd jptest</li>
<li>uv run --with jupyterlab jupyter-lab</li>
<li>Wait 3 seconds</li>
<li>Ctrl-C</li>
</ol>
<p>Jupyterlab prints something like this</p>
<pre><code>Shut down this Jupyter server (y/[n])? [W 2024-07-21 15:57:14.911 LabApp] Could not determine jupyterlab build status without nodejs
[I 2024-07-21 15:57:19.915 ServerApp] No answer for 5s:
[I 2024-07-21 15:57:19.915 ServerApp] resuming operation...
</code></pre>
<p>No input reaches jupyterlab after the Ctrl-C, so it doesn't get an answer to its y/[n] question.</p>
<p>Depending on circumstances jupyterlab is either continuing to run or shutting down in the background. <code>uv run</code> seems to terminate itself and leave its child process running.</p>
<p>Both jupyterlab and uv run receive the signal? In the Expected behaviour, jupyterlab should handle this signal alone (and it does so using the prompt in the output)?</p>
<p>I think a good solution to this would also solve the ipykernel launch problem mentioned in #3095.</p>
<p><code>rye run</code> handles this one as expected. <code>pdm run</code> doesn't let jupyter-lab handle the signal but at least jupyter-lab is not left running detached.</p>
<p>Wish would be that it works the same way as if the user is running <code>.venv/bin/jupyter-lab</code>, if that's possible.</p>
