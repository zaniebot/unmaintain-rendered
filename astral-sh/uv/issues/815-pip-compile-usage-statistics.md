# `pip-compile` usage statistics

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-01-06 03:49_

I performed the following GitHub code searches:

- `"pip-compile"` [79.4k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22pip-compile%22&type=code)
- `"pip compile "` [71.2k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22pip-compile%20%22&type=code)
- `"pip-compile-multi"` [3.2k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22pip-compile-multi%22&type=code).  
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile"` [50.7k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile" language:text` [50.4k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22+language%3Atext&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile" language:text  NOT is:archived` [45.6k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile" language:text  NOT is:archived NOT is:fork` [25k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived+NOT+is%3Afork&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile-multi"` [2.6k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile-multi%22&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile-multi" language:text  NOT is:archived` [2.5k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile-multi%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile-multi" language:text  NOT is:archived NOT is:fork` [1k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile-multi%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived+NOT+is%3Afork&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile" language:text NOT is:fork repo:DataDog/dd-trace-py` [2k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived+NOT+is%3Afork+repo%3ADataDog%2Fdd-trace-py+&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile" language:text  NOT is:archived NOT is:fork org:DataDog` [3.6k files](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived+NOT+is%3Afork+org%3ADataDog&type=code)
- `"This file is autogenerated by pip-compile" language:text  NOT is:archived NOT is:fork NOT org:DataDog` [21.5k](https://github.com/search?q=%22This+file+is+autogenerated+by+pip-compile%22+language%3Atext++NOT+is%3Aarchived+NOT+is%3Afork+NOT+org%3ADataDog&type=code)


From which we can derive that:

- At most, 5% of `pip-compile` users opt for the derivative `pip-compile-multi` project
- There are probably less than 20k public projects on GitHub using `pip-compile`
    - Many projects generate more than one requirement file
    - Alarmingly `DataDog` has 3.6k generated files with 2k in a single repository

This is a work in progress. Prompted by looking for good candidate projects to test UX on.

My two cents, I would expect applications and not libraries to make more use of pip-compile-multi, as many times, running VS testing requirements are separate in these (it's been the case in all companies I have seen pip-compile / pip-compile-multi being used).

Libraries are less likely to rely on pinned dependencies (at least in python) than applications. Having requirements pinned is usually only used for tests, because runtime dependencies can't be pinned.
