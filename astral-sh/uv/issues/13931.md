# `pyproject.toml` config setting equivalent for `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`

_Issue opened by @zach-overflow on 2025-06-09 19:12_

### Summary

First off, thanks for this incredible tool! Second, please correct me if I'm not understanding correctly, but it seems that there's no `toml` based per-project support for indicating a custom virtualenv name / path. This issue is a request for a toml-equivalent of the [`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_project_environment) environment variable.

Alternatively, if there's a way to add TOML support for a `.env` file path, that would be great and would solve the same issue since I could just have per-project `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` values set in a `.env` file referenced by the project's toml config.

### Example

#### Example 1: A toml equivalent of `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`

```toml
[tool.uv]
uv-project-environment = "./.custom-venv-name"
```

#### Example 2: toml support for referencing a `.env` file 

```toml
[tool.uv]
uv-env-file = "./.env"
```

Then setting `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` in the project-specific `.env` file:
```shell
# my project's .env file at the root project folder
UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=./.custom-venv-name
```
