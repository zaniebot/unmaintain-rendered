            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I've seen many ways to install <code>uv</code> in a container layer, so that it's further re-distributed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pip install uv</code></li>
<li><code>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh</code></li>
<li><code>COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/</code></li>
<li>etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, all these result in having the <code>uv</code> executable, but none of the artifacts that are legally required to be able to redistribute it.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> itself is licensed under <code>Apache-2.0 OR MIT</code> (to use an SPDX expression) and both of these licenses have the obligation to also include the license text alongside the executable. The MIT license also introduces the obligation to include the copyright notice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the executable contains dozens of other modules (crates), each of them under its own license (usually the same <code>Apache-2.0 OR MIT</code>, but I have not checked them all). For each one of these, obligations also exist for redistribution.
For example, taking one of the dependencies in random, the <code>spdx</code> crate under the <code>MIT</code> license requires to somehow include its copyright notice (<code>&quot;Copyright (c) 2019 Embark Studios&quot;</code>) when redistributing it.</p>
<p>Is there a &quot;distribution&quot; of <code>uv</code> that includes all this information, so that it makes re-distribution easier?</p>
