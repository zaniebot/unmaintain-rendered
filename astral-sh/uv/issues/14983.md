# Incorrect Package version being installed

---

_Issue opened by @arun0908 on 2025-07-30 22:42_

### Summary

I am trying to install a library [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm/). Previously I had a 0.0.17 version installed globally. I created a new local virtual environment with UV initialized in it. When I tried to install the package in this environment it installed the same 0.0.17 version. I upgraded the package globally with pip and in the virtual environment uninstalled it, upgraded UV from 0.7.1 -> 0.8.4, and tried to install it again, but still installs the 0.0.17 version. Python version - Python 3.11.9

Attaching screenshots for the same.

Hi Zanieb,

The latest version of the [PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pypi.org/project/pymupdf4llm/) is 0.0.27 which was supposed to be installed instead of the 0.0.17 version being installed.

The log file is attached for reference. Kindly let me know if you need anything else

Can you demonstrate the issue in a new project? e.g.,

```
uv init example
cd example
uv add pymupdf4llm
```
