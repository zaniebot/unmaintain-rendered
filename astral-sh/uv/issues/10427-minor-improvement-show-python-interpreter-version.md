# [minor improvement] show Python interpreter version in `uv tool list`

---

_@richieadler_

Currently, is not easy to know with what Python version each tool was installed. (I thought that was the role of the `--show-version-specifiers` switch, but I can't find a difference between the output with and without the switch.)

A way to display the interpreter version in the output would be useful.
