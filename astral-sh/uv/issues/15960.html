            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The default behavior of <code>uv venv</code> is creating an virtual environment in the current working diretory.If I add next param like <code>~/.venvs</code> which is troublesome, the vscode python extenion can't recongnize the environment outside the working directory automatically.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>So I wish uv could be configured to behave like poetry which can create virtual environment outside the working directory and make it recongnized by vscode python extention which will save lots of time activating the venv in a new terminal againg and againg.</p>

<p>This is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1495, though I think your problem goes away if you instead use <code>uv sync</code> in projects since that's intended to create a virtual environment in the project root for discovery with IDEs.</p>
