            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have some dependencies that are installed from a private gitlab repository through the use of a deploy token as a security authentication.</p>
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>When I run the uv export command these security tokens do not appear in the generated requirements.txt file ending up in an error while trying to download them using pip install.
Following the same procedure using pipenv works.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Given a pyproject.toml with the following structure</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;placeholder&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11.7&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;dependency_placeholder&quot;
]

[tool.uv.sources]
dependency_placeholder = {tag = &quot;0.2.1&quot;, git = &quot;https://deploy_token_placeholder@gitlab.placeholder.com/placeholder&quot;}
</code></pre>
<h3>Uv export</h3>
<p>When running the <strong>uv export --no-hashes -o requirements.txt</strong> the requirements.txt file gets generated missing the gitlab deploy token as the following:
<code>dependency_placeholder @ git+https://gitlab.placeholder.com/placeholder.git@b10aff6850ff80246ba3c363bd9efff0ac13b057  </code></p>
<h3>Pip install</h3>
<p>Then when running the pip install -r requirements.txt command the missing deploy token causes it to ask for a basic authentication and fail:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting dependency_placeholder@ git+https://gitlab.placeholder.com/placeholder.git@b10aff6850ff80246ba3c363bd9efff0ac13b057 (from -r requirements.txt (line 112))

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand, but the requirements.txt file being generated at the moment is not working as it's missing the token authentication from the dependency repository.
Could it be set as an option to also output the credentials during export, or is there another way to workaround this issue while generating the requirements.txt file?
At the moment this is a blocking issue for me for migrating from pipenv package manager to uv.
Let me know, thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Like I was saying at the moment this is a blocking issue for me from switching from pipenv to uv.
Just to give a bit more context on my use case I need this feature because I'm using Elastic Beanstalk with a python platform.
Uv is not supported yet as a package manager, the only ways to install the dependencies are through requirements.txt and pipenv <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/python-configuration-requirements.html">docs</a>.
My idea was to use uv locally and generate the requirements.txt file with <strong>uv export</strong> command at the moment of the deploy but as seen in the comments above since there is no token authentication in the repository URL the deploy is failing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>~~My original issue #12581 was closed as a duplicate to this one as I assume that the root mechanism that &quot;eliminated&quot; the token is the one that &quot;eliminated&quot; the extra index url in mine, but if this issue diverges (as it seems to) the area of using flags to allow/disallow safe or unsafe exposure to credentials, would you consider splitting the issue into more than one? Since there is no safety consideration (as far as I am aware of) in exposing the index from the existing pyproject.toml index into the requirements.txt.~~</p>
<p>~~Sorry if I'm speaking out of line here.
Regardless, thank you for your time and effort and I will appreciate any decision you may choose.~~
Written here in error, please ignore.</p>
