# Elide interpreter path from debug logs when using managed toolchain

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-06-16 23:34_

e.g.

```
Using Python 3.11.9 interpreter at: /Users/zb/Library/Application Support/uv/toolchains/CPython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none/install/bin/python3
```

We should just say we're using a managed toolchain here and display the path to the executable as a trace-level log. I think the path is still useful for system interpreters.
