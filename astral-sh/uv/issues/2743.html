            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This a suggestion for a possible <code>uv pip compile</code> feature.</p>
<p>In our dev tooling, we check if the .txt file is newer than the corresponding .in file. If it is, we do not run the pip compile step.</p>
<p>This allows us to automatically run pip compile as part of our normal dev commands, as mostly its a no-op. However, if the .in file has changed, we automatically re-compile and re-install. This is very useful if merging or switching branches, as running tests will install any changed dependencies automatically. It also means you can just add a dependency in the .in, and the compile is automatic.</p>
<p>uv&#x27;s pip compile is <em>much</em> faster, but in our testing, its not fast enough to avoid needing this check/skip step if we want to auto-compile.</p>
<p>This seems like a useful pattern, so I wonder if a <code>--skip-if-newer</code> or similar option would be worth considering, that implements this logic?</p>
<p>There&#x27;s one wrinkle we&#x27;ve found with this system - it doesn&#x27;t interact well with pre-commit&#x27;s auto stashing/unstashing of changes, which modifies the mtimes, so it sometimes runs compile step when it doesn&#x27;t need to.  We&#x27;ve used content hashes instead of mtime to work around this, but now you need another file <em>somewhere</em> to track the hash.</p>
<p>Just an idea, whilst I&#x27;ve been playing around with moving to uv. Thanks for all your work!</p>
