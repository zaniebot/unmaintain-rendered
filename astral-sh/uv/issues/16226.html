            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For <a href="https://inspector.pypi.io/project/pymeshlab/">pymeshlab</a> I have a dependency (nerfstudio) that has this condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">&quot;pymeshlab&gt;=2022.2.post2; platform_machine != 'arm64' and platform_machine != 'aarch64'&quot;,
&quot;pymeshlab&lt;2023.12.post2; sys_platform == 'win32' and platform_machine != 'arm64' and platform_machine != 'aarch64'&quot;,
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is running and blocking on linux as if the<code>sys_platform</code>is ignored. Most of the errors I have seen on this where for Source Distributions which doesn't seem to be the case for pymeshlab. Inmz case it fails to resolve for <code>2022.2.post2</code> even though I should be using a higher version.</p>
<p>Any idea what would be happening? I suspect it is because nerfstudio built its wheel as <code>none-any</code>? It is a wheel built for linux so I am still a bit confused why that would fail</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.05 - Linux 6.14.0-33-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.7.13</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.12</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My guess is that this is related to uv's creation of a universal lockfile? To create a <code>uv.lock</code>, we need to resolve all dependencies, even those that won't be installed on the current platform; in this case, we need the dependencies for both versions. You can try to solve this with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
environments = [&quot;sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>That will avoid including the Windows branch in your <code>uv.lock</code>.</p>
