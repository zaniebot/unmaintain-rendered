            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm exploring the uv package manager and came across the <strong>caching mechanism</strong> it employs to improve performance and dependency management. While caching is undoubtedly useful, I have a few questions regarding its <strong>backward compatibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I upgrade uv to a newer version, will the cache created by the older version still be usable?</li>
<li>If not usable, how will uv handle the old-dated cache? Does uv throw, or delete/update quietly?</li>
<li>What would be the best practice to do with uv-cache when upgrading the uv?</li>
</ul>
<p>Any insights, official documentation links, or experiences with managing the uv cache would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Generally, yes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The cache buckets are versioned. If we change the cache in a backwards incompatible way, a new bucket will be used. <code>uv cache clean</code> should be used to remove old cache buckets.</p>

<p>Nothing :)</p>
