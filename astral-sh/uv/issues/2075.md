Could you please add the commands you used, your operating system and your python version?

This is not reproducible in a new venv,  (using uv 0.1.12)

```
 uv pip install Django
Resolved 3 packages in 212ms
Downloaded 3 packages in 3.22s
Installed 3 packages in 1.06s
 + asgiref==3.7.2
 + django==5.0.2
 + sqlparse==0.4.4
```
