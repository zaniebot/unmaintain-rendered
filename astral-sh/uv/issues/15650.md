# Infinite recursion when parsing circular -r references in multiple requirements.txt

---

_Issue opened by @dean-tate on 2025-09-03 03:29_

### Summary

Definitely just an edge case but came across this when I inadvertently setup a requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt file with circular references.

requirements.txt
```
# Main production dependencies
requests

# Include development requirements
-r requirements-dev.txt

```
requirements-dev.txt
```
# Development-specific dependencies
pytest

# Include main requirements
-r requirements.txt

```
`uv pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Expected Behavior
I would expect uv to detect the circular dependency, issue a warning (e.g., "Skipping circular inclusion of requirements.txt"), and gracefully stop parsing the recursive include rather than crashing.

Actual Behavior
uv crashes with a stack overflow error.
