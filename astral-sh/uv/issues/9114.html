            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just can't figure it out.</p>
<p>I was going to use <code>pip install build; python -m build</code> as a stepping stone towards converting the project to uv... so I figured I'd <code>uvx</code> it, and can't figure out the syntax... if it's possible at all.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you run <code>uvx build</code>, it should point you to that:</p>
<pre><code>❯ uvx build
Installed 3 packages in 7ms
The executable `build` was not found.
warning: An executable named `build` is not provided by package `build`.
The following executables are provided by `build`:
- pyproject-build
Consider using `uvx --from build &lt;EXECUTABLE_NAME&gt;` instead.
</code></pre>
<p>(The extra <code>--from</code> is necessary because <code>build</code> names its executable <code>pyproject-build</code>, not <code>build</code>.)</p>
