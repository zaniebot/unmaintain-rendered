# Syncing UV with system python [follow up]

---

_Issue opened by @Ben-Epstein on 2025-02-10 16:13_

### Question

Similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6834 I am trying to use uv in CI to sync my lockfile with the system python.

I have a command like so
`/bin/sh -c "UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$(python -c \"import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_config_var('prefix'))\") uv sync"` where the python command evaluates to 
```
Using CPython 3.11.9
error: Project virtual environment directory `/usr/local` cannot be used because it is not a compatible environment but cannot be recreated because it is not a virtual environment
```
Is there any more detail as to what this means or how to debug it?

Thanks!

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04

### Version

It's probably a Python version mismatch. What does your project require? Do you have a `.python-version` file?

#11227 tracks improving the error here.
