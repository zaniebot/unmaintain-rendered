            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>We managed to make some progress in getting authentication for private gitlab.com package registries to work with <code>keyring</code> and a forked, heavily modified 1Password backend, but now we're stuck and confused about the weird urls <code>uv</code> is requesting credentials for: It seems as if <code>uv</code> &quot;mixes&quot; index urls and package names.</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Creating a venv for a project with one dependency on a package from a private gitlab package registry works ✅.
Creating a venv for a project with two dependencies on packages from two private gitlab package registries fails ❌.</p>

<h2>Minimal reproducible example (MRE)</h2>
<p>We have created several projects / repositories to facilitate reproducing issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>A public <a href="https://github.com/DesmoDyne/uv-mre-01"><code>uv-mre-01</code> Github repo</a> with multiple sample uv python projects that use dependencies from private GitLab package registries; the project that reproduces this issue is <a href="https://github.com/DesmoDyne/uv-mre-01?tab=readme-ov-file#project-0201">Project 02/01</a>.</li>
<li>Two GitLab repos that provide dummy python packages via their private package registries. These repos must obviously be private, so not even posting any links here; their python packages are accessible to the GitHub project - assuming authentication works. They are called <code>uv-mre-01-dep-01</code> and <code>uv-mre-01-dep-02</code>.</li>
</ol>
<details>
  <summary>Notes</summary>

<ul>
<li>The MRE is actually not strictly <em>minimal</em>; there is smoke test and some more projects that reproduce problems we have run into that are beyond the scope of this issues. However, authentication for private package registries might be a bigger issue, so setting up a solid test bench might prove helpful mid-term.</li>
<li>More, similar test/client or dependency projects might be needed in the future. Both the GitHub and the GitLab sample repos were therefore created in a mostly automated fashion to easily add more MREs as the need arises.</details>

</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick shell script to set up things to reproduce the issue (for copy &amp; paste):</p>
<p>UPDATE: This has been made simpler by means of an insecure keyring backend, see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12004#issuecomment-2746364629">commment below</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir -p ~/Temp/uv_issue_12004 &amp;&amp; cd $_
git clone --quiet https://github.com/DesmoDyne/keyrings.onepassword
uv tool install keyring --with-editable ~/Temp/uv_issue_12004/keyrings.onepassword)
git clone --quiet https://github.com/DesmoDyne/uv-mre-01
(cd uv-mre-01/project-02-01 &amp;&amp; uv sync --verbose)
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>This obviously modifies an existing <code>keyring</code> tool installation, which can be undone using</p>
<pre><code>(cd &quot;$(uv tool dir)/keyring&quot; &amp;&amp; uv pip uninstall annotated-types keyrings.onepassword markdown-it-py mdurl onepassword-sdk pydantic pydantic-core pygments rich typing-extensions)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/#uninstalling-a-package"><code>uv pip uninstall</code></a> doesn't seem to support uninstalling a package <em>and all its dependencies</em>, so need to list them all.</p>
<p>Optionally, run the &quot;smoke test&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">(cd uv-mre-01/project-00-01 &amp;&amp; uv sync --verbose)
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>and create the venv for a project with only one dependency:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">(cd uv-mre-01/project-01-02 &amp;&amp; uv sync --verbose)
  ...
</code></pre>
<h2>The Keyring 1Password backend</h2>
<p>This is beyond the scope of the uv project, but some wider context might be helpful.</p>
<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

<p>We tried to use <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/keyring">Keyring</a> with the 1Password third party backend mentioned on the keyring page - <a href="https://github.com/falling-springs/onepassword-keyring"><code>onepassword-keyring</code></a> - but that implementation was apparently never meant for anything more than personal use by its author. It is currently dysfunctional - it never returns any credentials, but only a <code>[use 'op item get &lt;item ID&gt; --reveal' to reveal]</code> message - unless its source code is monkey-patched.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/falling-springs/onepassword-keyring/forks">two public forks</a>, one of which <a href="https://github.com/rdhyee/onepassword-keyring/commit/b9190a47810e070b72bba55bc25b944f8b03c61a">fixed the problem mentioned</a>, but never published that fix as a package.</p>
<p>The alternative we are currently using is <a href="https://github.com/risqcapital/keyrings.onepassword"><code>keyrings.onepassword</code></a>; we forked that project and added some logging to a file: <code>keyring</code> and its backends communicate over <code>stdout</code>, so can't just use <code>print(...)</code> for logging.</p>
<p>As <code>uv</code> works with <em>index urls</em>, but 1Password works with <em>vault items</em>, we also added a rudimentary map to translate the former to the latter.</p>
<p>Finally, to reduce the effort to reproduce this issue to the least amount possible, we removed the need to install the 1Password application, the 1Password CLI, set up any items in any 1Password vaults or pass any environment variables.</p>
<p>This is just an awful hack. But maybe it helps us to fix this issue.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/DesmoDyne/keyrings.onepassword">https://github.com/DesmoDyne/keyrings.onepassword</a> for details.</p>
</details>

<h2>Further questions and concerns</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Why does <code>uv</code> append any package name to the index url configured in <code>pyproject.toml</code> at all ? We've been using package registry urls ending in <code>.../simple</code> for many years (but then - we always had our packages on gitlab.com 🤷🏻‍♂️) - which is also really similar to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/simple-repository-api/#base-html-api">PyPI base url</a> <code>https://pypi.org/simple/</code>; possibly related: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11236">11236</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why is there a query for <code>https://pypi.org/simple/uv-mre-01-dep-02/</code> ? The <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#index">Index docs</a> say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using an <code>index</code> source pins a package to the given index — it will not be downloaded from other indexes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but from our observations, this doesn't seem true 🤷🏻‍♂️ We also tried adding <code>explicit = true</code> to the <code>[[tool.uv.index]]</code> sections, taken from <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/#pinning-a-package-to-an-index">Pinning a package to an index</a>, but that doesn't seem to do anything 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does the query for <code>https://pypi.org/simple/uv-mre-01-dep-02/</code> mean that a package with the same name is installed from PyPI - instead of from our own package registry - if authentication fails ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do I have to be worried that that query leaks the credentials for our package registry to PyPI ?</p>
</li>

<p>It's somewhat hard to spot, but <code>uv</code> now queries credentials for the url for the first dependency with the name of the package of the <em>first</em> dependency appended - as opposed to the name of the package of the <em>second</em> dependency appended as before.</p>
<p>Possibly, the order in which credentials are queried simply is random 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>
<p><strong>Problem is that <code>uv</code> never queries any credentials for the second dependency.</strong></p>
<p>We were in the process of butchering our <a href="https://github.com/DesmoDyne/keyrings.onepassword">custom dev keyring backend</a> even further and ignore the part of first the url (up to <code>simple</code>) entirely and return credentials based on only the appended package name - which is complete nonsense, but at least would get us unblocked - but if <code>uv</code> never asks for all the credentials it needs, we seem stuck completely 😞.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is relevant yet, still trying to sort out what's going on, but I think GitLab has a setting which forwards to PyPI on unauthenticated requests? Is that on for your repository? It's possible that's where the PyPI request comes from?</p>

<p>I'd be happy to do so, but there is no <code>uv.lock</code>; <code>uv</code> doesn't seem to get to the point where it writes that file 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Wow! That is <em>something</em>. Here we are, looking at <code>uv</code> doing funny stuff - while in fact, it's actually GitLab doing funny stuff 🤪</p>
<p><em>Why on earth would they do that ?!?</em></p>
<p>Can't really think of a situation where that would be needed or useful, but it seems to open all kinds of security holes ?!?
Well, at least they clearly document it: <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/package_registry/supported_functionality/#forwarding-requests">Forwarding requests</a>; they even do so twice: <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/pypi_repository/#package-request-forwarding-security-notice">Package request forwarding security notice</a>.</p>
<p>We're on gitlab.com, so we don't have Admin privileges.</p>
<p>For anyone in the same boat: The <em>Packages and Registries</em> section of the group settings looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95ed8fc8-c1cb-43ce-bf32-d14bd1330796" alt="Screenshot Chrome gitlab-groups-settings-packages-and-registries" /></p>
<p>The <em>What are the risks?</em> link leads to the <em>Forwarding requests</em> section above.</p>
<p>By default, <em>Package forwarding</em> is enabled for both npm and PyPI packages.</p>
<p>Disabling both (npm packages are obviously not part of the picture, but the issue is the same); also verified the setting for all subgroups (which is what the <em>Enforce PyPI setting for all subgroups</em> presumably does).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the result seems the same:</p>

<p>That's <code>uv-mre-01-dep-01</code> in the first two lines of log output and <code>uv-mre-01-dep-02</code> in the third one. We are logging any <code>uv</code> queries for credentials in our Keyring backend and we never see any queries for <code>uv-mre-01-dep-02</code> there. (UPDATE: We actually do, see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12004#issuecomment-2709768394">next comment</a>).</p>
<p>Just speculating here, but maybe the <code>Skipping keyring lookup ...</code> line happens because <code>uv</code> doesn't query credentials for all private package registries, but tries <code>pypi.org</code> directly ?!?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, so we've run this a couple of times and we can report the following:</p>
<p>The behavior how <code>uv</code> queries credentials doesn't seem deterministic.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, we log the package registry urls in our Keyring backend and we see two cases of urls coming in:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/67672163/packages/pypi/simple/uv-mre-01-dep-01/</code>:
that's the url (up to <code>simple/</code>) for the first dependency with the package name of the <em>first</em> dependency appended</li>
<li><code>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/67672163/packages/pypi/simple/uv-mre-01-dep-02/</code>:
that's the url (up to <code>simple/</code>) for the first dependency with the package name of the <em>second</em> dependency appended</li>
</ol>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a way to trigger one behavior or the other: Running the same command repeatedly; sometimes it's this, sometimes it's that.</p>
<p>We never see a query for the url of the second dependency, i.e. something with <code>67685669</code> in it instead of <code>67672163</code> (that's the GitLab project ID by the way).</p>
<p>Speculation: The order of the dependencies that <code>uv</code> tries to acquire credentials for is random 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>
<p>Our observations suggest that there are two bugs:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv</code> &quot;mixes&quot; dependency urls and package names - hence the second case above (which seems just plain wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️)</li>
<li><code>uv</code> never attempts to acquire credentials for a second dependency from a private package registry</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, it seems at least questionable why <code>uv</code> appends any package names to the url at all, but different package registries might have different conventions / expectations; maybe better leave that for later...</p>

<p>You could confirm by using a different username. We should do https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4583 to resolve this, and fetch credentials for each username / index URL combination instead of username / realm.</p>

<p>It'd still be a bug to be ignoring sources, but this should make the index priority very clear.</p>

<p><code>RUST_LOG=trace</code> sets the log level for child dependencies too — those logs are from PubGrub. <code>-v</code> only controls uv's log level.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for your responses, @zanieb 🙏🏻</p>
<p>I upgraded <code>uv</code> to latest <code>0.6.9</code>.
I changed the two usernames <code>dummy</code> to <code>username_uv-mre-01-dep-01</code> / <code>...-02</code> to make them distinguishable.
I re-ran all sample projects and updated the sample log output.
(Referencing the posts in here when committing those changes, so GitHub should auto-link those somewhere in here...)</p>
<p>The good new first: Creating a venv works now 👍</p>
<p>However, <code>uv</code> still seems inconsistent in what kind of package registry urls it queries credentials for - but now in a different way than <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12004#issuecomment-2709768394">reported above</a>; can't say if this behavior is new, but I don't think I ever observed it in the past:</p>
<p>Before, it was e.g. <code>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/67672163/packages/pypi/simple/</code> with <code>uv-mre-01-dep-01/</code> or
<code>uv-mre-01-dep-02/</code> appended, see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12004#issuecomment-2709768394">my earlier comment</a> and the log output in this comment below.</p>
<p>Now, I'm <em>sometimes</em> getting the same as before, but at other times, I get full urls to a file, e.g. <code>https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/67672163/packages/pypi/files/613e63a34f4680f53ba6cf12da6e4f850c3deacf4f7492757f70beda199a651d/uv_mre_01_dep_01-0.0.0.tar.gz</code>.</p>
<p>In fact, I seem to be getting different behavior while I'm re-running things to produce log output for this post:</p>
<p>First behavior in <em>Full log output</em>, second behavior in <em>Full TRACE log output</em>. Reproducing it here unchanged.</p>

<p>Also, the full log output seems significantly shorter 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have created an <a href="https://github.com/DesmoDyne/keyring-insecure-backend">insecure keyring backend</a> to help fixing <code>uv</code> authentication issues and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyring-insecure-backend">uploaded it to PyPI</a>.</p>
<p>Install <code>keyring</code> and the backend:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool install keyring --with keyring-insecure-backend
</code></pre>
<p>This still modifies an existing keyring tool installation, but undoing that is now also simpler:</p>
<pre><code>(cd &quot;$(uv tool dir)/keyring&quot; &amp;&amp; uv pip uninstall keyring-insecure-backend
</code></pre>
<p>Create an environment to reproduce the issues reported here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir -p ~/Temp/uv_issue_12004 &amp;&amp; cd $_
git clone --quiet https://github.com/DesmoDyne/uv-mre-01
(cd uv-mre-01/project-02-01 &amp;&amp; uv sync --verbose)
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>The backend logs the urls <code>uv</code> queries credentials for; if any are missing, they can be added to the <code>.json</code> file the backend uses to store credentials.</p>
<p>Our GitHub / PyPI / Python packaging skills are inadequate, so the files involved most likely do not get installed to the appropriate locations; if anyone does in fact use this, I'm happy to help with any problems.</p>

<p>Regarding (1), that's really weird behavior. I'm not sure why that would happen — I can try to reproduce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe because the usernames were the same (<code>dummy</code>) for both dependencies ?
That mixup seems to have gone away since I changed those 🤷🏻‍♂️
Time allowing, I can revert that change and see if the mixup comes back.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm trying to reproduce the issues you're seeing here. Following your instructions (and using <code>dummy</code> as the username for both), I haven't yet seen the mixed and matched URLs you describe (using the latest uv). I've tried multiple runs on both macOS and in a Docker container with Ubuntu 24.04. Would it be possible to create a Docker version that would make this easier to reproduce?</p>
<p>Or was I misinterpreting your comment <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12004#issuecomment-2746349599">here</a>? I took &quot;I'm sometimes getting the same as before&quot; to mean you were still sometimes seeing the mixed and matched URLs, even with the latest uv.</p>
