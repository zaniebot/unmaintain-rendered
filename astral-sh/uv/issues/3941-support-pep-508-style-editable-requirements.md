# Support PEP 508-style editable requirements

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-31 13:39_

For example, `--editable "mypkg[dist] @ git+https://github.com/username/mypkg"` is supposed to work. That it doesn't work in pip right now is an implementation limitation. See: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1289.
