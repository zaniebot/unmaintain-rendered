Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hi there,
I noticed that the current README doesn't include instructions for upgrading <code>uv</code>. I think it would be helpful to have a small section below the &quot;<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation">Installation</a>&quot; section that explains how to upgrade the tool. I had some trouble finding the correct upgrade command and had to search through the documentation pages.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to include this in the README? I'd be happy to contribute by submitting a small PR if needed :^)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
