            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just a thought that for transparency it would be nice if it was made obvious what the source is for <code>uv python install</code>.</p>
<p>At the very least it would be good to show it when <code>uv python list</code> is called.</p>
<p>Equally <code>uv help python</code> or <code>uv python -h</code> might give a short explanation as to where the interpreters come from, who compiles them and is responsible for them, etc.</p>
<p>It'd also be good if the source URL was printed during installation. The information is of course available by running with the <code>--verbose</code> flag but naturally this is not normally turned on.</p>
<p>Distro package managers also usually tell you what they have planned before they do it. That is not the approach you have taken for <code>uv pip install</code> or <code>uv add</code> either, which I assume is a design decision, but it would still be good if it was made more clear post-execution what was done and the URL was at least printed during the installation process.</p>
