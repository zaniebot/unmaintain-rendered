# Documentation: Incorrect definition of “module” as “directory with __init__.py” — should be “package”

### Question

I noticed a terminology inaccuracy in the [documentation: Concepts/Build Backend/Modules](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/build-backend/#modules).

Current wording:

> “Python packages are expected to contain one or more Python modules, which are directories containing an `__init__.py`.”

This is technically incorrect according to Python’s language specification. According to [Python Docs - Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html):

> “A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.”

And [Packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages):

> “Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using ‘dotted module names’... The `__init__.py` files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages.”

So saying “modules, which are directories...” misrepresents the fundamental Python concept.


### Platform

The term "package" is overloaded in Python: We're using it both for something with an `__init__.py` and for packages that you can install. This is hugely confusing to users, referring to those to different but close concepts (a distribution usually contains `__init.py__` files) by the same name. Instead, we use the terminology that's used in other programming languages and that is also popular within the Python community: A package is something you install, a module is a part of a package. For the build backend, we're being overly specific with modules, as we require an `__init__.py[i]`, currently neither single file projects nor shared libraries are supported.

Thanks for the clarification! I appreciate the reasoning behind the terminology choice. All clear on my end.
