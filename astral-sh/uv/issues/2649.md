# uv use wrong interpreter when `uv venv`, and activated wrong environment when activate venv

_Issue opened by @kevindaffaarr on 2024-03-25 15:07_

<!--

Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
**Run On**
uv version: 0.1.24
OS: Windows 11

## Problem Reproducing
I have multiple python version in my PC with aliases python, python310, and python311. I already install uv in python311 by
```
python311 -m pip install uv
```

And then I check the other python
```
python -m pip freeze // there is no uv installed

python310 -m pip freeze // there is no uv installed
```
which is expected.

Then I trigger command for creating a virtual environment:
```
python311 -m v venv
```

## First Problem
The first problem is, uv use python alias (which is python 3.10.8) as interpreter.

## Second Problem
After I activate the venv and pip freeze
```
source ./.venv/Scripts/Activate
pip freeze
```
It resulted the activated python interpreter of my other folder with installed packages, meanwhile my current Lib folder is empty.
