Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>two issues compound here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uv checks the extra index url before the primary index url</li>
<li>Uv gives up if it finds <em>any</em> version in the extra index url, even if that version doesn't satisfy the constraints.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a situation where:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>really old</em> versions of package <code>the-downstream</code> exists in the extra index url</li>
<li>modern versions of the package exist in the primary index url</li>
<li>When I try to add the <code>name-redacted</code> package, pinning it to a modern version, uv fails to resolve with an incorrect resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional info</h3>
<p><code>the-downstream&gt;=3.1.0</code> is available in the primary index, and the index is accessible.
If i reconfigure the global configuration to swap <code>index-url</code> and <code>extra-index-url</code> with each other, the install succeeds.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>reading that documentation, UV behaves the exact opposite of how i expected.</p>
<p>with <code>poetry</code>, we set our internal private index as the <code>primary</code> index so it always checked it first.
we set our pypi mirror as a <code>secondary</code> so it had a fallback for nonlocal packages
we set public pypi as <code>explicit</code> so it would never reach out to public pypi.</p>
<p>But with UV the logic is reversed,
we set our internal private index as the secondary/extra, and our pypi mirror as primary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, that sounds right to me. We don't support &quot;named&quot; index priorities like that yet -- they will come in the future. For now, we're just leveraging the existing <code>--index-url</code> and <code>--extra-index-url</code> scheme that came from <code>uv pip</code>. With <code>--index-url</code> and <code>--extra-index-url</code>, it is far more common for users to prefer that packages are selected from the <em>extra</em> index if possible. (E.g., it's very common to set the PyTorch index to <code>--extra-index-url</code>; if you did that, you would never want <code>torch</code> from PyPI to be preferred.)</p>
