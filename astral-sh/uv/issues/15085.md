You want `@ git+https://...` I presume?

I think so, but I'm using uv pip compile to compile the default requirements-uv.txt, if we can automatic transform github url end with 'git' to git+？

Can you share a complete example please? How are you generating the requirements file? See #9452 for more details on what we usually need to help you.

After careful consideration, this seems inconsistent with pip. My apologies for bringing this up; I think we can close this issue. Thank you.
