# Support pypy and other interpreters

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-01-19 20:04_

This requires conditionally switch the `cp` prefixes in the wheel tags for the appropriate pypy or other prefixes.

https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/blob/187ccef4e1dc84413118756d701ddaf40dd07e11/crates/platform-tags/src/lib.rs#L42-L71

I consider pypy the main priority, we can make follow up issues for other interpreter.

Where do we get the right prefix?

We have to port https://github.com/pypa/packaging/blob/4d8534061364e3cbfee582192ab81a095ec2db51/src/packaging/tags.py

I can do it, looks fun, and requires me to install Pypy.
