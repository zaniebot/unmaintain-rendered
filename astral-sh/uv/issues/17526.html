            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a breakout from #17426, since we need to obtain clarity/consensus on an approach here.</p>
<p>TL;DR: URLs don't necessarily have a clear filename suffix. When this happens, uv doesn't have a filename to use for the URL's content, which could be either a sdist or a wheel. Consequently, the URL is rejected.</p>
<p>One thing we could do (for a subset of scenarios) is to honor the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header, which <em>can</em> include a <code>filename</code> field.</p>
<p>pip appears to do this, and gives it precedence over any inferred filename:</p>
<p>https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/545eda389c41478e2f99d23212254d757d8c2cef/src/pip/_internal/network/download.py#L105-L117</p>
<p>Some things we need clarity on (these may already have answers, I just haven't collected the information together):</p>
<ol>
<li>How does this interact with other PEP 508 (and non-standard) distribution name/filename specification mechanisms for URLs?</li>
<li>There are other <code>Content-Distribution</code> mechanisms for specifying filenames, e.g. <code>filename*</code>. We should see if pip handles these, if they do the precedence between them correctly, etc.</li>
</ol>
