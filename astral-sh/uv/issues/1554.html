            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Bug description</h3>
<p>I have a repository containing different projects with varying requirements.txt because each project is build and deployed separately with their respective dependencies. I use pip-sync to update the virtual environment with all the requirements.txt at once, and pip-sync will only fail if the same package is declared more than once with different pinned versions. This is a feature as it helps me make sure I don't have conflicting versions, which would cause my virtual environment to be inconsistent with at least one project.</p>
<p>uv fails when there are duplicate package declarations, even if they all have the same pinned version.</p>
<h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>
<pre><code>$ cd $(mktemp -d)
$ mkdir project{1,2}
$ echo 'attrs==23.2.0' &gt; project1/requirements.txt
$ echo 'attrs==23.2.0' &gt; project2/requirements.txt
$ uv venv
$ . .venv/bin/activate
$ find . -name 'requirements.txt' | xargs uv pip sync
</code></pre>
<h3>Current behavior</h3>
<pre><code>error: Failed to determine installation plan
  Caused by: Detected duplicate package in requirements: attrs
</code></pre>
<h3>Expected behavior</h3>
<p>Should install the duplicate package if the version is the same in all files, as pip-tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip install pip-tools
$ find . -name 'requirements.txt' | xargs pip-sync
...
Installing collected packages: attrs
Successfully installed attrs-23.2.0
</code></pre>
<p>Should fail only if there are different versions for the same package, as pip-tools:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir project3
$ echo 'attrs==23.1.0' &gt; project3/requirements.txt
$ find . -name 'requirements.txt' | xargs pip-sync
Incompatible requirements found: attrs==23.1.0 (from -r ./project3/requirements.txt (line 1)) and attrs==23.2.0 (from -r ./project1/requirements.txt (line 1))
</code></pre>
<h3>Additional context</h3>
<p>Using uv 0.1.2 and python 3.11.7</p>
