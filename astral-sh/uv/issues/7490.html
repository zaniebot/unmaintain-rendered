            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Dear everyone,</p>
<p>I could not find this information in the https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/ documentation. I need to run a specific tool using <code>uvx</code> but it requires a specific matplotlib backend. Therefore, I need to run it as <code>MPLBACKEND=agg uvx cellxgene-schema validate anndata_human_immune_cells_cxg.h5ad</code>. However, it's a bit annoying to have to specify the environment variable like this. What is the best way to set this environment variable for the tool environment?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding my support to this issue. My use case is a bit different but I think that any solution for this issue would cover mine.</p>
<p>I'm using uv in package mode false to manage an ansible orchestration project. There are some ansible environment variables I would like to have set when I run <code>uvx</code>. It would be really nice to be able to define them in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> so that they're built into the venv and easily versioned as part of the project.</p>
