            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We have a large monorepo with multiple projects. We'd like a global uv.lock to enforce consistent dependencies, are provided by the workspace feature.</p>
<p>However, the current workspace feature is prone to &quot;dependency ghosting&quot;, where <code>uv run</code> for one package will install its dependencies into the workspace venv. A following <code>uv run</code> for a different package will then also have access to those dependencies, even if they are not specified within the second package's pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>It would be ideal to have a global uv.lock for the whole workspace (to enforce version consistency) but separate venvs for each package within the workspace (to avoid dependency ghosting).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like you might just want to use <code>uv run --exact</code>?</p>
<p>We're considering multiple virtual environments though, there are various problems it makes easier.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I realized that we actually need not just separate venvs but also separate lock files for each package, so I'm closing this issue here.</p>
