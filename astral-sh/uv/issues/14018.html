            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When installin pydevd_pycharm using uv, the package doesn't work and throws an issue. However, installing with regular pip does not.</p>
<p>How to replicate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir /tmp/pydev_test
python -m venv /tmp/pydev_test/.pip
python -m venv /tmp/pydev_test/.uv
</code></pre>
<p>Place this file on /tmp/pydev_test/</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pydevd_pycharm
pydevd_pycharm.settrace('localhost', port=12345, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)
test = &quot;test&quot;
print(test)
</code></pre>
<p>For pip:</p>
<pre><code>source /tmp/pydev_test/.pip/bin/activate
pip install pydevd pydevd_pycharm
python main.py
</code></pre>
<p>For UV:</p>
<pre><code>source /tmp/pydev_test/.uv/bin/activate
uv pip install pydevd pydevd_pycharm
python main.py
</code></pre>
<p>If a pydev debugger is running, pip version successfully connects to debugger.
but the uv version throws this error:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I noticed this issue as well.
In my project I didn't make any changes to the dependencies, but when I had to update my Dockerfiles after 3.12.11 was released, this started happening, so I reverted images back to 3.12.10 and this issue persists.</p>
<p>Thanks for the workaround! ... <strong>EDIT:</strong>
<strong>the workaround didn't work for me.</strong></p>

<p>The thing is that I tried an older version of pydevd_pycharm that I know for sure worked for me in the past, and even the latest version of pydevd_pycharm and regardless of the version, it doesn't work for me anymore.</p>
<p>Somehow I suspect that it'd be worth trying to downgrade uv and try again because I did also run 'uv self update' since. So I tried with uv versions 0.7.0 and 0.6.7 as well and the issue is identical.</p>
<p>To be honest I'm not sure what the issue is, but I'm experiencing the same issue and it came out of nowhere.
If you need more context let me know.</p>

<p>I tried running uv cache clean after uv sync and before installing pydevd_pycharm. Same with just pip seeded into the venv. Didn't help.
pip cache purge
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall pydevd-pycharm==252.18003.35</p>
<p>No matter if I use pip or uv pip or clear cache or not, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I tried the --only-binary option:
uv pip install pydevd-pycharm --no-cache --reinstall --no-deps --only-binary pydevd-pycharm --python /venv</p>
<p>python -V : Python 3.12.10 ; which python : /venv/bin/python

╰─▶ Because all versions of pydevd-pycharm have no usable wheels and you
require pydevd-pycharm, we can conclude that your requirements are
unsatisfiable.
hint: Wheels are required for <code>pydevd-pycharm</code> because building from
source is disabled for <code>pydevd-pycharm</code> (i.e., with <code>--no-build-package       pydevd-pycharm</code>)</p>
<p>The latest version: pydevd-pycharm==252.21735.39 has the same issue.</p>
<p>Is there a pydevd_pycharm repo where I can open an issue?</p>
