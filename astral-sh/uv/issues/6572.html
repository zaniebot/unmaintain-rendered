            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like bad practice to check-in an SSL certificate — can you share more about why you're doing that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it's a corporate environment with custom internal certificates that need to be known about by the libraries the project uses. it's much easier to just commit the certificate than getting everyone in the team to manually configure their tools to use it</p>

<p>I should clarify what I was thinking originally
**Supporting CLI equivalent and global settings (e.g. pip.conf style), not at project level pyproject.toml</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it might also be worth noting that my team uses <a href="https://pyprojectx.github.io/">pyprojectx</a> to manage the uv installation locally in our project instead of installing it globally. we prefer to minimize the amount of stuff we have to install/configure globally</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>just found out about the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#native-tls"><code>native-tls</code></a> option, which works for my use case.</p>
<p>i'll leave this issue open in case anybody needs to be able to specify the path to the cert file</p>
