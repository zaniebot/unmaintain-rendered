            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have seen this mentioned in #8525 and #9747, but I still have issues with installing any python behind company proxy: uv retries multiple times, but then fails (I get &quot;Failed to extract archive&quot;).</p>
<p>Should I assume that it is a company proxy issue, or is there anything I can do on my side?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Windows</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.5.25 (9c07c3fc5 2025-01-28)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Try downloading manually and see if it is blocked: https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20250311/cpython-3.11.11+20250311-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-install_only.tar.gz</p>
<p>The link redirects to a https://objects.githubusercontent.com/ link which may be blocked in your corporation. If it is blocked you need to decide whether it is worth raising this to your IT depeartment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It works fine on my Linux workstation here at my company, but not on Windows. I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>Failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/downloa/20250317/cpython-3.10.16%2b20250317-x86_64-windows-msvc-install_only_stripped.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>It works fine to download it directly from PowerShell though.</p>
<pre><code>Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/downloa/20250317/cpython-3.10.16%2b20250317-x86_64-windows-msvc-install_only_stripped.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>So the issue must lie with uv or any of its dependencies.</p>
<p>I have tried on uv version 0.6.7</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thanks @charliermarsh  and @notatallshaw for your reply.
The manual download worked fine in my case, so it was not a matter of  https://objects.githubusercontent.com/  being blocked in my case.</p>
<p>I have updated uv (to 0.6.6 and again to 0.6.8) and everything works, very confusing.</p>
