            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm using uv with inline scripts in a nextflow pipeline, which involves running certain tasks many times in parallel. When two tasks implemented by the same script land on the same cluster node, I'm seeing an error which I believe is caused by a race condition in the environment creation:</p>
<pre><code>  error: The directory `/tmp/gpires-uv-cache/environments-v2/build-parquet-0118330146dbc8a9` exists, but it's not a virtual environment
</code></pre>
<p>My interpretation of this is that one of the processes sees that the environment doesn't exist yet and starts creating it, the other process(es) arrive(s) a little bit later and see(s) the folder exists but isn't (yet) a valid environment.</p>
<p>This happens because the environment path is just based on a hash of the script path, as far as I can tell from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/c10c84a588fa91ab52e54ea353f2c928356a9e1b/crates/uv/src/commands/project/mod.rs#L653-L674">here</a></p>
<p>Likely I just have to avoid using inline scripts but I was wondering if you had other recommendations?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd expect us to handle this race condition.</p>
<p>We should probably lock the directory while creating and mutating it.</p>
