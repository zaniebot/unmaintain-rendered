# Is there any way in future release UV is planning to have the explicit command to activate / remove the venv ?

### Question

I am not sure whether it's a good suggestion to compare the pipenv workflow and uv, please correct me if i am off the track.

- As in case of pipenv, if there's isn't venv created for the project, invoking `pipenv shell` will create the venv automatically and activates it.

- Do we have any plan / existing command to remove venv post de-activation?


### Platform

Linux 5.14.0-427.40.1.el9_4.x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.6.17

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1910

What's the use-case for deleting the environment post-activation?

I mean't deletion of venv directory post "deactivation".

Context: Pipenv has the command like "pipenv --rm" when executed post exiting the virtual environment, will remove the venv directory.

Yeah, why do you want to be able to do that?

It helps to clean up the .venv atleast in case of dev environment, for a quicker cleanup. I agree that we can manually delete perfrom `rm -rf .venv`, Yet Just out of curiosity, querying if we have any plans to have an --rm flag to clean up the venv as like pipenv and venv activation command.

Eg : 
- uv rm [ Removing the venv directory associated with a pyvenv.cfg file.
- uv activate - Activates the venv.

I understand it helps clean it up, but.. why do you need to clean it up?

See the aforementioned issue for details on why activation is complicated. I don't think we can implement a meaningful `--rm` flag without the `uv shell` command.

I don't think we'll add a dedicated `uv rm` flag for deleting environments without strong motivating use-cases.

Agreed, my only thought is to have an option that allow me to start from scratch if my current venv has been messed up with multiple packages.

Lets say I am working on venv "A" - where I have messed with with some misc, Instead of doing rm -rf .venv, Just thought If we could have an command just "uv rm' which will clean up __pycache__, egg-info, .venv.
