### Summary

```
$ ls ~/.local/bin/python3.*
ls: cannot access '/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/python3.*': No such file or directory
$ uv python upgrade
warning: `uv python upgrade` is experimental and may change without warning. Pass `--preview-features python-upgrade` to disable this warning

/home/ubuntu/.local/bin/python3.12  /home/ubuntu/.local/bin/python3.8
```

`uv python upgrade --no-bin` doesn't exist, and `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_BIN=0` doesn't affect its behavior. But to be clear I think this should not be the default behavior at all.

### Platform

Linux

### Version

uv 0.8.7

### Python version

Apparently, Python 3.8, who knew
