# Use terminal colors to improve readability of requirements

_@zanieb_

As discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2601

We should be able to improve the readability of requirements by bolding package names or dimming specifiers.

It'd be nice to toggle to a different output that uses more whitespace when colors are disabled.
