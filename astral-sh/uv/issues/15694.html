            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As a long-time sufferer of working on a Rosetta system, I'm delighted about <code>--python-platform</code>!</p>
<p>The way I'd like it to use is setting it once in a directory (e.g., using Direnv) and forget about it: <code>export UV_PYTHON_PLATFORM x86_64-apple-darwin</code></p>
<p>But currently I have to pass it to every instance of <code>uv sync</code> or more importantly <code>uv run</code> (I know there's caveats to this statement, but I really like to be able to just <code>uv run</code> when coming into a directory with no regard for previous activity).</p>
<p>This would ensure that I never can get accidentally in the state of creating a venv for the wrong platform.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Today 🌧️:</p>
<pre><code>uv sync --python-platform=x86_64-apple-darwin
uv run --python-platform=x86_64-apple-darwin pytest
</code></pre>
<p>A better tomorrow ☀️:</p>
<pre><code>export UV_PYTHON_PLATFORM=x86_64-apple-darwin
uv sync
uv run pytest
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does it work it you instead chose an x86_64/arm64 Python interpreter in that directory? uv sync and runs based on the existing Python interpreter, so this should be more convenient.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we shouldn't add that env var, I'm instead looking for something that makes working under rosetta feel more native than toggling <code>python-platform</code>, which was built for cross-platform venv creation rather than systems with transparent emulation.</p>

<p>Unless you mean uv's interpreters, that is what I'm doing now but it's a bit hairy.</p>
<p>I used to set <code>UV_PYTHON=python3.13-intel64</code> but that's not something that is supported: #7684</p>
<p>I've been told there's better support for platforms coming – which I supposed this is part of it?</p>
<hr />
<p>FWIW, my current approach is an <code>just</code> recipe like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-just">install:
    #!/usr/local/bin/bash
    set -euo pipefail

    eval &quot;$(sed -nE 's/(PY=.*)/\1/p' Dockerfile)&quot;
    uv sync --python=&quot;$PY-intel64&quot;

    if [ &quot;$(.venv/bin/python -c 'import platform; print(platform.machine())')&quot; != &quot;x86_64&quot; ]; then
        echo -e 'venv not amd64!';
        exit 1;
    fi
</code></pre>
<p>which so far has proven to be robust enough. But requires the detour to determine the Python version (which is my main annoyance) and <code>uv run</code> doesn't work unless it ran first.</p>

<p>This is new to me and it works!</p>
<p>But while it's better than my current solution, I would really like to not have to extract the Python version myself which is exactly what <code>UV_PYTHON_PLATFORM</code> would achieve for me, unless I'm missing something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should also support <code>UV_PYTHON=x86_64</code> now.</p>
<p><code>UV_PYTHON_PLATFORM</code> is more nuanced, it won't affect interpreter selection, just override tags during resolution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ohhh, this looks great! Just to verify my observation:</p>
<p>If I set <code>UV_PYTHON=x86_64</code> and pyproject.toml says <code>project.requires-python = &quot;==3.14.*&quot;</code> I will reliably and officially get <code>3.14-x86_64</code>? If so, I'm good and this can be closed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't merge <code>--python</code> requests with <code>requires-python</code> ranges. That's unfortunately more complicated :) Let's track that in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16654</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aww, so what’s the semantics of setting <code>UV_PYTHON=x86_64</code>? “Default version on Intel”?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah it'll take the first version it finds and fail if it doesn't fulfill <code>requires-python</code></p>
