            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's two parts to this issue, though the overarching request is same, hence while I'm posting them together.</p>
<h2>Problem 1: <code>uv format</code> cannot be disabled</h2>
<p><code>uv format</code> is a command that will run ruff over the project, and grants an entrypoint to a command that isn't how the developer of the project may have opted to have formatting run. (anti-ethos to <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/idea-introduce-standardize-project-development-scripts/67194/35">this comment on python discussions</a>)</p>
<h2>Problem 2: <code>uv format</code> has vendor lock-in</h2>
<p>When a project has a different formatter already in use in their project, it would be beneficial to be able to configure <code>uv format</code> to use that designated formatter.</p>
<p>Hatch already has an <a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/how-to/static-analysis/behavior/#customize-static-analysis-behavior">implementation of this</a> which allows selecting dependencies for its <code>hatch fmt</code> command and creates a specific environment for running lint and format. uv already has the necessary tooling to create a temporary environment with these specified dependencies, and could most likely implement something like this for <code>uv format</code>.</p>
