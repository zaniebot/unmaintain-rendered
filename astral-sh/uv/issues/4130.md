# Add uv script to pyenv's pip-rehash

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-06-07 13:47_

See https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/tree/master/pyenv.d/exec/pip-rehash

This is used to recalculate the environment on installation and there are shims for `pip`, `conda`, and `easy_install`.

This will resolve the problems described at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1586

Tracking in `pyenv` at https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/2979

They've suggested we should provide a pyenv plugin that adds this functionality. If someone is interested in exploring that please let us know!
