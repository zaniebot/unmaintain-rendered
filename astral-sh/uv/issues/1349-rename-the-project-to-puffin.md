is there some history/rationale here?
i started looking into uv today and wondered why it was called so.

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-03-08 21:34_

We considered a _ton_ of names — it's really hard to pick a name without collisions these days so every name was a balance of tradeoffs.

`uv` was given to us on PyPI,  is Astral-themed (i.e. ultraviolet or universal), and is _short_ and easy to type.

🤷‍♀️
