            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm working on a project where a needed library is supplied in the form of a shared object (ex: <code>sdkPy.cpython.so</code>).</p>
<p>This is usually not a problem, since we can import it normally with python. However, when using <code>uv</code> to manage the virtual environment and then running it with <code>uv run</code> it's unable to find this library.</p>
<p>Is there any way to add them as local source or manual imports of some sort so the interpreter can actually find them? Should it be in a specific folder? Currently it's sitting alognside the file that imports it (say <code>src/[libname]/wrap/sdkPy.cpython.so</code>)</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>fedora 6.16.3-200.fc42.x86_64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.8.8</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The best practice here is to build the share library into a wheel and install that wheel into a project, is there a reason why you're using the raw library?</p>
<p>For debugging import problems, I'd start with looking at <code>sys.path</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>Sorry for the lateness. The reason I'm using the raw library is because the 3rd party provided it like that, and at my team we can't spare much time into building a wrapper around it.</p>
<p>This library references another local library (also provided by 3rd party), which we believe is the actual C library.</p>
<p>We got it working by using <code>importlib</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
