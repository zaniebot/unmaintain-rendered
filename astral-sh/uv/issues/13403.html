            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I came to uv from <a href="https://rye.astral.sh/">rye</a>, as it was recommended in the home page as its successor. For now the migration has been pretty smooth, the user experience in both frameworks is very similar.</p>
<p>Is there any reason to keep using rye over uv? Any advantage of rye that uv does not support yet?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Overall, uv is more mature, better supported and has more features than rye. The main feature that's still missing is the task runner (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903), but generally use uv over rye.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we recommend using uv over Rye -- it's more feature-complete, better supported, and more extensively-tested. The main missing feature (as @konstin said) is the task runner.</p>
