# Wishlist: option to let `uv tool list` show the version of the python interpreter for the tools

---

_Issue opened by @sergiocallegari on 2025-10-10 17:28_

### Summary

Looking for something like `--show-python-interpreter`.
Rationale: when a new release of Python appears, it might not be possible to update all the tools to using it. Having a quick way to check the leftovers might be nice.

### Example

_No response_

You have been faster in creating a patch and shipping a new version than me at commenting. I am amazed. Thanks!
