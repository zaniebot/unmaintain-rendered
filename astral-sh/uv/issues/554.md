# Repeatedly building local source distribution fails

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-04 22:17_

I'm getting, e.g.:

```text
error: Failed to download distributions
  Caused by: Failed to build: service @ file:///Users/crmarsh/workspace/path/service
  Caused by: failed to rename file from /Users/crmarsh/Library/Caches/puffin/built-wheels-v0/c61d38458d575226/.tmpbMovkL/service-0.1.9-py3-none-any.whl to /Users/crmarsh/Library/Caches/puffin/built-wheels-v0/c61d38458d575226/service-0.1.9-py3-none-any.whl
  Caused by: Is a directory (os error 21)
```

This is similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/pull/545, but the trace is different -- so I don't know that it's the same.

I'm seeing this in a lot of places, where directories already exist, and/or we assume that directories are archives? For example:

```rust
error: Failed to unpack wheels
  Caused by: Failed to unpack: package==0.19.1
  Caused by: failed to read from file `/Users/crmarsh/Library/Caches/puffin/built-wheels-v0/pypi/package-0.19.1.tar.gz/package-0.19.1-cp310-cp310-macosx_12_0_arm64.whl`
  Caused by: failed to read from file `/Users/crmarsh/Library/Caches/puffin/built-wheels-v0/pypi/package-0.19.1.tar.gz/package-0.19.1-cp310-cp310-macosx_12_0_arm64.whl`
  Caused by: Is a directory (os error 21)
```

Here's another, different trace where we're seemingly building setuptools twice or something:

```text
error: Failed to download distributions
  Caused by: Failed to build: service @ file:///Users/crmarsh/workspace/path/service-0.3.390.tar.gz
  Caused by: Failed to install requirements from setup.py build (install)
  Caused by: Failed to unpack build dependencies
  Caused by: Failed to unpack: setuptools==69.0.2
  Caused by: failed to rename file from /Users/crmarsh/Library/Caches/puffin/wheels-v0/pypi/.tmpkz0sbR to /Users/crmarsh/Library/Caches/puffin/wheels-v0/pypi/setuptools-69.0.2-py3-none-any.whl
  Caused by: Directory not empty (os error 66)
```

It looks like https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/pull/545 fixes some both not all of these. (It doesn't fix the first one.)
