# 'uvx' exclude-newer based on release date of the tool's version

---

_@MattiasDC_

### Summary

I'd like to have reproducible tool executions. Currently the way I do it is by fixing the version of the tool, complemented by the `exclude-newer` option. My suggestion is to simplify this by having an option to base the `exclude-newer` date on the release date of the version of the tool I'm running.

Small quality-of-life improvement, not an issue if deemed 'not worth it'
