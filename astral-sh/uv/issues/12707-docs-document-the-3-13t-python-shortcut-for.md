# docs: Document the "3.13t" python shortcut for installing freethreaded python

---

_@nonZero_

The following command works for install python 3.13's experimental freethreaded distribution:

`python install 3.13t`

However it is not documented anywhere on uv's docs.

Is this a version specifier? Some other magic?

It should probably be noted here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#requesting-a-version
