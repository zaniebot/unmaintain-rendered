            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm using <code>uv build</code>/<code>uv publish</code> to publish to PyPI, as explained in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/#publishing-to-pypi">documentation</a>. I'm relying on the fact that PyPI will ignore files that are already uploaded, if their hash is identical. But it seems that the <code>uv</code> version is included in the wheels. In the <code>package_name-package_version.dist-info/WHEEL</code> file I can see:</p>
<pre><code>Wheel-Version: 1.0
Generator: uv 0.9.9
Root-Is-Purelib: true
Tag: py3-none-any
</code></pre>
<p>So it seems to me that whenever the <code>uv</code> version changes the hash of the wheel will change, and this will lead to an error when uploading, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to publish `dist/fps_auth-0.9.4-py3-none-any.whl` to https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
  Caused by: Upload failed with status code 400 Bad Request. Server says: 400 File already exists ('fps_auth-0.9.4-py3-none-any.whl', with blake2_256 hash '4125836b389d515f7a7f4a846ffbd73e1c1213ab7f15df3a1a56fac4e3480866'). See https://pypi.org/help/#file-name-reuse for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.9.9</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's correct, but that problem shouldn't be unique to uv, but occur with most build backends (and independent of the build frontend), which write their version in the the <code>WHEEL</code> file. In other ecosystems that don't support the ignore behavior PyPI has, specific upload triggers are commonly used, such as a git tag for small projects with a single project in the repo or GitHub Actions workflow triggers for more complex projects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the answer, yes I saw that <code>hatchling</code> included its version too.
After reading #7917, I understand that I was relying on a feature that <code>uv</code> decided to not support.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For now I'm using the workaround in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7917#issuecomment-3552425346.</p>
