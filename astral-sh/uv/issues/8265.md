# Support for `purl` notation

---

_Issue opened by @chrisrodrigue on 2024-10-16 17:39_

Greetings,

I think it might be a good idea for `uv` to adopt the robust Package URL (PURL) specification which specifies canonical package URLs that are independent of the platform or package manager. It has many implementations and adopters.

https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec

[`pypi`](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst#pypi) and [`cargo`](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst#cargo) are native types of the spec. All types support [these qualifiers](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst#known-qualifiers-keyvalue-pairs).

I think that it would be reasonable for a user to be able to install packages using `purl` notation, and automatically update `pyproject.toml` based on qualifiers in the `purl`.

## Examples
`uv pip install pkg:pypi/flask@3.0.3`
`uv add pkg:pypi/flask@3.0.3`
`uv add pkg:pypi/flask@3.0.3?vcs_url=git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git`
`uv add pkg:pypi/flask@3.0.3?repository_url=https://example.com`
```
uv add pkg:pypi/flask@3.0.3?download_url=https://pypi.io/packages/source/f/flask/flask-3.0.3.tar.gz&checksum=sha256:ceb27b0af3823ea2737928a4d99d125a06175b8512c445cbd9a9ce200ef76842
```
