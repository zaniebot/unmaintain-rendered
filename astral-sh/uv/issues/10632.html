            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On CI or CD environments, the BuildKit cache mounts might not be available, because the VM or container is ephemeral and only normal docker cache will work.</p>
<p>So an alternative is to use a typical Dockerfile with layers that are built incrementally, for this scenario, pnpm fetch is the best option, as it only needs the pnpm-lock.yaml file and the layer cache will only be lost when you change the dependencies.</p>

<p>It seems that uv can also add similar features to better comply with the CI/CD build process。</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>uv sync</code> is probably fine for this? But the suggestion is that it would need to require <em>only</em> the <code>uv.lock</code>, is that right?</p>
