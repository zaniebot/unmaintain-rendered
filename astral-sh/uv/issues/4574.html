            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Workspace members currently share a single <code>uv.lock</code> and <code>.venv</code>, which comes with a couple of side-effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>there can't be two packages with conflicting dependencies, even if they are independent executables.</li>
<li>you can accidentally reference code from any workspace member without having to declare a dependency, and unit-tests or linters are unlikely to notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is unlike most languages, but usually no big deal, and having one <code>.venv</code> is convenient for most use-cases.</p>
<p>But it isn't for everyone, and I think it would be useful to introduce a distinct kind of member, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>will be excluded from the shared <code>uv.lock</code>/<code>.venv</code></li>
<li>will have its own <code>uv.lock</code>/<code>.venv</code>, with only itself and its dependencies (workspace and otherwise).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried to achieve this with one simple <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4499">change</a>, and it mostly works, but it's clunky and I think it could be much better.</p>
<p>Let's say we have this tree:</p>
<pre><code>monorepo
├── apps
│   ├── app1
│   └── app2
└── libs
    ├── lib1
    └── lib2
</code></pre>
<p>And let's say we're ok with libraries using the default shared lock, but apps should not.</p>
<p>The workspace could be defined as</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [&quot;libs/*&quot;]
private-members = [&quot;apps/*&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This is both explicit and efficient because workspace discovery won't have to read individual <code>pyproject.toml</code> files.
Wrote <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4610">a basic implementation</a> with a sample workspace.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be a really clean solution to the refactor I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>It also seems like a lightweight change that unlocks a lot of the what Pants can do (finding the minimum set of dependencies required for each project, although that works per file and is a lot more powerful).</p>

<p>Excluded projects cannot use workspace dependencies, these can.
And they're  allowed to have conflicting dependencies because they use private <code>uv.lock</code> and <code>.venv</code> directories and aren't included in <code>members_as_requirements</code></p>

<p>Yesterday I couldn't resist trying to implement it, it turned out to be a lot more straightforward than I expected.
Created https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4610 as a POC.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@idlsoft @charliermarsh that would be really nice to have as a feature, especially for us that work on monorepos. I'm working on such a monorepo where some of the members of the workspace have conflicting dependencies (that is common for ML libraries), but also some common ones. That would require having separate venvs/locks for those packages but I'd still like to have common dependencies for all of the packages on the workspace level vs. not having a workspace at all, so I don't have repeated/common dependencies specified in multiple <code>pyproject.toml</code> files.</p>
<p>The example repo on your PR is exactly what I was looking for: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/tree/5f2d0323d6330395dc8b62c6a126a234176165f0/scripts/workspaces/shared-libs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The PR <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4610">!4610 </a> by @idlsoft has not been updated since a few months, and now has merge conflicts.
I am too interested in this feature : I have a repository containing several tools, each a workspace member, all under a common lockfile, but each tool have different needs, and I don't want to install everything in each's Dockerfile, I'd prefer to have per-tool lockfiles.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the Dockerfile I copied the member's <code>pyproject.toml</code> and the global <code>uv.lock</code>, then <code>RUN uv sync --frozen -no-dev</code>, and it installed only the member's dependencies (using information from the lockfile).
It's a bit cumbersome to have to add the global lockfile when building each tool's Dockerfile, but it worked for me.</p>
