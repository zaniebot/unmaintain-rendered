            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Now that uv supports tools, is it a good id that uv manages its own installation ?
If I do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv tool install uv
</code></pre>
<p>and then uninstall the uv I used to run this, am I likely to get into problems ?</p>
<p>Also, should that be what the install script does ? Is there a good reason that I need to add multiple paths to my PATH, and <code>uv</code> itself is not in <code>~/.local/bin</code> and instead in <code>~/.cargo/bin</code> ?</p>

<p>Uhh.. I guess it'd work. I wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<p>What other paths do you need? Isn't there just one?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, we want to move it but haven't for backwards compatibility. We will eventually.</p>
