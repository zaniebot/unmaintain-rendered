### Question

Hello

I'm running uv 5.2.9 in Windows 11.
In the "pyproject.toml" I have the dependency of "sqlalchemy>=2.0.37", but is installed "sqlalchemy>=2.0.38".
How can I upgrade pyproject.toml using some uv command?

I've read this topic ans try some commands, but didn't worked.
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/#locking-requirements

This command generate a requirements.txt and there sqlalchemy
```
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt is "sqlalchemy==2.0.38"
```

I would like to update pyproject.toml and set dependency to sqlalchemy>=2.0.38. but not manually.

Thanks
