            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>When compiling a Python extension using Meson&#x27;s <code>py_installation.extension_module()</code>, Meson looks for the Python development headers using pkg-config. Because the prefix in python-build-standalone&#x27;s <code>pc</code> file is <code>/install</code>, the build fails.</p>
<p>The sysconfig paths in PBS are fine, but for better or worse Meson tries pkg-config before sysconfig. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a universal way (e.g. one that works for subprojects) to use sysconfig before pkg-config in Meson, but even if there was, it seems like it would be preferable to fix the <code>pc</code> file.</p>
<p>Is that possible? Could uv fix the <code>pc</code> file after extraction? I guess this wouldn&#x27;t help non-uv PBS users, however.</p>
<p>I realize this is <a href="https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/quirks.html#references-to-build-time-paths">documented</a>, so apologies for raising a known issue! But it took a little sleuthing to figure out how Meson was even picking up this <code>/install</code> path, so I thought I&#x27;d at least share that here.</p>
<p>For completeness, here&#x27;s the <code>.pc</code> file:</p>
python-3.13.pc
<p>

<pre><code>❯ cat /mnt/home/lgarrison/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.13.1-linux-x86_64-gnu/lib/pkgconfig/python-3.13.pc
# See: man pkg-config
prefix=/install
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include

Name: Python
Description: Build a C extension for Python

Libs.private: -lpthread -ldl  -lutil
Libs: -L${libdir}

</code></pre>
</p>
 

<p>Here&#x27;s where Meson tries pkg-config before sysconfig: https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/blob/0b9baf573bf2b1619d7822f67965a35391172625/mesonbuild/dependencies/python.py#L391</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the output of Meson&#x27;s <code>python_info.py</code> script that uses sysconfig for discovery (looks fine):</p>

python_info.py output

<pre><code>❯ python mesonbuild/scripts/python_info.py | jq | grep /install

<p>There&#x27;s a constellation of sort-of similar uv issues around sysconfig variables (e.g. those linked from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8429">astral-sh/uv#8429</a>), but I think in this case the issue is specifically with the pkg-config file. I couldn&#x27;t find an existing issue about that.</p>
Steps to reproduce
<p>Here is a reproducer on a small project. I&#x27;m happy to work on making it more minimal if that would be helpful.</p>
<pre><code>❯ git clone https://github.com/lgarrison/pycorrfunc.git
❯ cd pycorrfunc
❯ git checkout c869af8feb936960ef3673aa0974eb332c47fc8a
❯ uv sync --python-preference=only-managed

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Meson needs to know the &quot;official interface flags&quot; for linking to libpython, primarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>what <code>-I/path/to/Python-dot-h</code> path to use for compiling</li>
<li>what <code>-L/path/to/libpython -lpython3.XX</code> flags to use for linking:<ul>
<li>when <code>embed: true</code> is used, for example when compiling a python loadable plugin for a C++ application that includes scripting support for perl/python/guile/lua/ruby/tcl</li>
<li>on platforms such as Android or Cygwin, where linking to libpython is required even for compiling importable modules</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this accurately is a bit of a hodgepodge. The base code for implementing this is at https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/blob/master/mesonbuild/dependencies/python.py</p>
<p>Notice there are two methods: pkg-config, and sysconfig. The sysconfig method uses <code>find_libpy()</code> and <code>find_libpy_windows()</code> which you will note doesn&#x27;t actually use sysconfig directly, but does various searches by manually constructing details from sysconfig <code>base</code>, <code>DEBUG_EXT</code>, <code>ABIFLAGS</code>, <code>py_version_nodot</code>, <code>py_version_short</code>, <code>implementation_lower</code>, <code>ABI3DLLLIBRARY</code>, <code>INCLUDEPY</code>, <code>include</code>, <code>platinclude</code>, <code>ABI3DLLLIBRARY</code>, <code>ABI3LDLIBRARY</code>, <code>LDLIBRARY</code>, <code>LIBDIR</code>, etc, as well as hardcoding certain known assumptions about the shape of the install layout for PyPy.</p>
<p>This will hopefully get a lot better when https://peps.python.org/pep-0739/ is approved and deployed, which guarantees that any platform can describe via JSON what pkg-config already consistently describes (but requires pkg-config to be installed, which is not necessarily the case on Windows).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here&#x27;s the output of Meson&#x27;s <code>python_info.py</code> script that uses sysconfig for discovery (looks fine):</p>
</blockquote>
<p>python_info.py is used for discovery of various things pkg-config doesn&#x27;t describe, like &quot;whether you are in a venv&quot; or &quot;what are the standard paths for site-packages etc&quot;, &quot;am I PyPY or CPython&quot;, &quot;am I free-threaded&quot;, &quot;what is the limited API suffix&quot;, etc. We also save the exhaustive details of <em>every</em> sysconfig variable, just in case we need it later on (and indeed it&#x27;s needed for the guesswork in <code>dependencies/python.py</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently it assumes the flags are trusted and passes them to the compiler -- it&#x27;s the compiler that decides they aren&#x27;t trusted. There are some nuances around for example <code>-I/usr/include/python3.13</code> where that path doesn&#x27;t exist on your machine, but the compiler will locate it via a sysroot in <code>/usr/aarch64-pc-linux-gnu/usr/include/python3.13</code> so it&#x27;s not immediately obvious when to second-guess the results.</p>

<p>Aside: thanks for pinging me on this. :heart: I&#x27;m interested in helping people with meson issues and this overlaps with my interest in the python ecosystem / building code, so I&#x27;m absolutely comfortable with being pinged any time you have a question for me or simply think I&#x27;d be interested.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it help anything to make the .pc file use relative paths from <code>${pcfiledir}</code>? From <code>man pkg-config</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The installed location of the .pc file. This can be used to query the location of the .pc file for a particular module, but it can also be used to make .pc files relocatable. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>prefix=${pcfiledir}/../..
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be what Meson&#x27;s own <code>pkgconfig.relocatable</code> option does for .pc files it produces. (See also a little discussion in openssl/openssl#13080 which points out some issue with sysroots which might not be relevant to us.)</p>
<p>If so then we can just make this change in python-build-standalone and avoid having to patch on install.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>relocatable pkg-config files are a <em><strong>really bad</strong></em> tradeoff for a project that expects to be installed to a non-relocatable place, i.e. /usr and simply have done with. You never ever use the functionality, so any cost is too much. Furthermore, it results in paths such as <code>-I/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/../../include</code> which aren&#x27;t great since that&#x27;s a compiler default search path and normally, without <code>--keep-system-cflags</code>, those get stripped.</p>
<p>So of course, openssl cannot simply use them and have done with, which was what that ticket was about.</p>
<p>For python-build-standalone, the same tradeoffs can be made that meson makes when you explicitly enable relocation. You know, on a per project or per binary distribution basis, that it is <em>very</em> likely to be relocated, thus by default the flags are simply broken, but relocatable pkgconfig files transition it from being &quot;broken all the time&quot; to &quot;working most of the time&quot;. That makes it very much worthwhile.</p>
<p>Additionally, uv may not be concerned about people installing python using uv in order to cross compile with a sysroot. Probably, most people using sysroots have careful setups which include building cpython from source. Also, pkgconf is pretty popular these days and people generally don&#x27;t use the original pkg-config (it isn&#x27;t 2020 anymore!)</p>
<p>So all in all I think you should use relocatable pkg-config files, yes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>... yes it does. Sorry for not catching that!</p>
<p>There may still be value in making the pkg-config file relocatable upstream; it would make the <code>pc</code> file more useful for non-uv users, and it would save uv from having to patch it at runtime. What do you think?</p>
