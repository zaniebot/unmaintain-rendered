            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I saved my PyPI API token in a local file located in the git root directory (possibly not a great idea), which is not tracked by Git, but located in the git root directory.</p>
<p><code>uv publish</code> published this untracked file and I can be retrieve from https://github.com/pypi-data/... This issue has been detected automatically by a github-action bot and my key was revoked. This is nevertheless annoying with respect to security.</p>
<p>Thank you for making <code>uv</code>, which is a great tool</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As far as I know, <code>uv publish</code> does not interact with git related stuff directly, so don't see why the file not being tracked by git should matter. Don't blame uv for your insecure handling of your credentials.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for blaming<code>uv</code>, this was clearly my fault .</p>
<p>I was naively assuming that <code>uv publish</code> was relying on the content of <code>pyproject.toml</code> exclusively.</p>
