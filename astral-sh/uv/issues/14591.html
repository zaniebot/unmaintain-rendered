<p>sync seems unable to find our specially-built <code>lxml</code> wheel, and is instead attempting to build lxml from an sdist (we ignore manylinux wheels from pypi, via the <code>no-manylinux</code> package):</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The wheel is present in that directory. uv is able to find pure-python wheels in that directory just fine, but seems to trip on wheels with the <code>linux</code> tag.</p>
<h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>
<p>I have pushed a self-contained dockerfile repo here, including the wheels (both amd64 and arm64 variants) involved: https://github.com/craigds/uv-sync-bug</p>
<p>Just build the repo and it demonstrates the issue; uv fails to find those wheels and falls back to building from an sdist (which fails due to missing build deps, but that's not the issue)</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>ubuntu or debian, tried amd64 and aarch64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.7.20</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.10.12</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>oh, I should note: uv <em>does</em> install this wheel just fine if I pass the filename to <code>uv pip install</code>:</p>
<pre><code>root@72f872e12dda:/app# uv pip install /build-cache/python/wheelhouse/lxml-5.4.0-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl
Resolved 1 package in 5ms
Prepared 1 package in 59ms
Installed 1 package in 4ms
 + lxml==5.4.0 (from file:///build-cache/python/wheelhouse/lxml-5.4.0-cp310-cp310-linux_aarch64.whl)
</code></pre>
<p>So, I don't think there's anything wrong with the wheel, just that sync is ignoring it in favour of the sdist for some reason.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using <code>--frozen</code> means that uv will use the sources recorded in your lockfile as they exist at the start of the command, verbatim. So I don't think the <code>--find-links</code> entry is being consulted at all. You should incorporate the <code>--find-links</code> when you lock, so that it's encoded in the lockfile.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>interesting, thanks for the response. This seems to be a problem even without <code>--frozen</code> though (interestingly, it's not trying to build the wheel now though):</p>
<pre><code> &gt; [7/7] RUN uv sync -vvv --no-index --find-links=/wheelhouse/ --inexact --package lxml --all-groups --refresh:

</code></pre>
<p>(I've updated the linked repro dockerfile to use the above)</p>
<p>I can't immediately think of a way to use uv with our workflow, because I don't think we can add the wheelhouse source to our lockfile:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lockfile is generated by a developer before committing</li>
<li>wheels for all dependencies are built later by CI using <code>pip wheel</code></li>
</ul>
<p>since the wheel doesnt' exist when the lockfile is generated, we can't insert it in there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--package lxml</code> means &quot;the package in the workspace named <code>lxml</code>&quot;.  You can't put arbitrary dependencies there -- it has to be a workspace member. You should omit that argument.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>aha, so <code>--package</code> is referring to a subpackage of a monorepo or something like that; not &quot;only try to install/update a specific dependency from my big list of dependencies&quot; 👍</p>
<p>yes it's working without that option and installing the wheel regardless of the lockfile 🎉</p>
<p>thanks loads for your help, very much appreciated 💯</p>
