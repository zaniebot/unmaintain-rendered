# Why uv does not seems to see python packages installed in a different site-packages

---

_Issue opened by @ccoulombe on 2025-10-31 19:07_

### Question

Hello,

We have python packages provided from different `site-packages`, but `uv pip list` does not seem to see them.

For example, on our HPC systems
```
module load python/3.13 arrow/21
uv venv --clear TESTY
source TESTY/bin/activate
```
Then:
```
(TESTY) $ uv pip list
Using Python 3.13.2 environment at: TESTY

(TESTY) $ pip list | rg pyarrow
pyarrow            21.0.0
```

The `site-packages` are listed in `$PYTHONPATH`.

What am I missing in order for `uv` to see those packages ?

Thanks

### Platform

Linux

### Version

0.9.2

uv does not include pip in the virtual environment by default, so `pip list` is likely showing you packages in some other environment (since it's likely the global `pip`).

You can run `uv venv --seed` to include pip if necessary.

Even with a `pip` installed, it is not showing the packages installed from other `site-packages` as pip naturally does.
```
$ module load python/3.13 arrow/21
$ uv venv --seed --clear TESTY
Using CPython 3.13.2 interpreter at: /cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/easybuild/software/2023/x86-64-v4/Compiler/gcccore/python/3.13.2/bin/python
Creating virtual environment with seed packages at: TESTY
 + pip==25.2+computecanada
Activate with: source TESTY/bin/activate
$ source TESTY/bin/activate
(TESTY) $ uv pip list
Using Python 3.13.2 environment at: TESTY
Package Version
------- ------------------
pip     25.2+computecanada
(TESTY) $ uv run which pip
/home/coulombc/TESTY/bin/pip
(TESTY) $ which pip
~/TESTY/bin/pip
(TESTY) $ pip list | rg pyarrow
pyarrow            21.0.0
(TESTY) $ uv pip list | rg pyarrow
Using Python 3.13.2 environment at: TESTY
(TESTY) $
```

It look like it may be an issue related to `uv` not seeing the PYTHONPATH perhaps?

Thanks!

That sounds right -- is this a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2500? We don't read arbitrary locations from `sys.path`.

Looks like a duplicate yeah.

The packages are available from a different site-package as mentioned, which is not the same as the one from the virtual env. 
To be precise, the packages are available from ` $EBROOTARROW/lib/python3.13/site-packages/` while the virtual env. has `$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.13/site-packages/`.

Any quick fix? Thanks
