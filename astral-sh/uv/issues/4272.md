# Marker normalization doesn't collapse non-pre-release ranges

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-12 14:15_

We don't recognize that `python_version < "3.7" or python_version >= "3.7"` evaluates to `true` because of our use of min versions to handle pre-releases.

Although, it is true that `3.7.0a0` does not match either of these markers.

What if we had a rule like... if none of the versions contain pre-release or post-release or dev release or local release, then we use different semantics and ignore those things?
