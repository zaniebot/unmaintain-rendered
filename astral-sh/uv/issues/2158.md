# `uv pip install --verbose` not displaying native extension build logs

_Issue opened by @abetlen on 2024-03-04 15:46_

Hi there!

First off fantastic project, I'm currently in the process of moving over most of my ci to `uv` but I just ran into a little issue regarding logging build information for native extensions.

# Issue

When building and installing native extensions it's commonly useful to print verbose logs from the build steps (usually cmake logs). With `pip` adding `--verbose` seems to be sufficient to get these logs printed however with `uv pip` I haven't been able to get them to print no matter what options I set (maybe I'm doing something wrong).

# Minimal Example

```bash
python3 -m pip install uv
git clone https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core.git
cd scikit-build-core/docs/examples/getting_started/c
# Installing using pip --verbose prints cmake logs
pip install --verbose --editable .
# However with uv pip it does not
uv pip install --verbose --editable .
```

# Expected Output

```

Thanks for the well written issue :)

Is this a duplicate of either

- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2146
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1567

or is it different somehow?

@zanieb woops, yes sorry it is a duplicate. I did search first but I guess I missed those somehow. I'll close this issue!
