To avoid paging if that's your deal.

I'm confused by this issue, `uv help` doesn't seem to page its output. I actually couldn't find any other command that uses a pager by default. 🤔 

Could it be that I have some local config that messes things up?

Nevermind, disregard my previous comment. I'm dumb and should search better. 🤦‍♀️ 

I also tested using an outdated version of `uv` instead of `main`.
