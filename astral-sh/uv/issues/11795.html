            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Now I&#x27;m faced with the fact that the name I chose for the project turned out to be unsuitable for me. I&#x27;m going to rename the project, and for this I need to change the pyproject.toml file, the src/project_name folder, and the imports in all internal files.
Therefore, I have a question, is it possible to add such &quot;sugar&quot; to UV?</p>
Example
<p>uv rename new_project_name</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Wintreist why not to use &quot;replace all&quot; in VS Code (whatever)?</p>
<ol>
<li>Change name in pyproject.toml</li>
<li>Rename project folder</li>
<li>Mass replace regex &#x27;^from &lt;old_name&gt;.$&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;from &lt;new_name&gt;.&#x27;</li>
<li>Mass replace regex &#x27;^import &lt;old_name&gt;&#x27; =&gt; &#x27;import &lt;new_name&gt;&#x27;</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@vladyslav-burylov, I did it. I got it by with even less steps. I changed the name in pyproject.toml, then renamed the folder via F2, and the Python extension replaced the imports with the new one.</p>
<p>that&#x27;s why I wrote that it&#x27;s &quot;sugar&quot;. I can do without this functionality, but if it is there, it will be convenient</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would also like you to develop this functionality; changing names and having to do certain things manually is tedious. I hope you can implement it in the near future.</p>

<p>Try Claude code (paid, sorry). It runs such tasks perfectly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m also having the same problem integrating the UV library into Databricks, especially with Spark and its parallelization-based system. I&#x27;ll wait patiently for a solution for this type of platform.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve just had the same problem - I firstly created a project (thoughtlessly) through PyCharm GUI, then initialized through uv, then after some time decided the name has to be changed to better reflect the code purpose. I&#x27;m implementing changes manually, however I&#x27;d feel more certain about making all appropriate changes if uv did this for me. Thanks in advance :)</p>
