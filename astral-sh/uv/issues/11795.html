            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Now I'm faced with the fact that the name I chose for the project turned out to be unsuitable for me. I'm going to rename the project, and for this I need to change the pyproject.toml file, the src/project_name folder, and the imports in all internal files.
Therefore, I have a question, is it possible to add such &quot;sugar&quot; to UV?</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>uv rename new_project_name</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Wintreist why not to use &quot;replace all&quot; in VS Code (whatever)?</p>
<ol>
<li>Change name in pyproject.toml</li>
<li>Rename project folder</li>
<li>Mass replace regex '^from &lt;old_name&gt;.$' =&gt; 'from &lt;new_name&gt;.'</li>
<li>Mass replace regex '^import &lt;old_name&gt;' =&gt; 'import &lt;new_name&gt;'</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@vladyslav-burylov, I did it. I got it by with even less steps. I changed the name in pyproject.toml, then renamed the folder via F2, and the Python extension replaced the imports with the new one.</p>
<p>that's why I wrote that it's &quot;sugar&quot;. I can do without this functionality, but if it is there, it will be convenient</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would also like you to develop this functionality; changing names and having to do certain things manually is tedious. I hope you can implement it in the near future.</p>

<p>Try Claude code (paid, sorry). It runs such tasks perfectly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm also having the same problem integrating the UV library into Databricks, especially with Spark and its parallelization-based system. I'll wait patiently for a solution for this type of platform.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've just had the same problem - I firstly created a project (thoughtlessly) through PyCharm GUI, then initialized through uv, then after some time decided the name has to be changed to better reflect the code purpose. I'm implementing changes manually, however I'd feel more certain about making all appropriate changes if uv did this for me. Thanks in advance :)</p>
