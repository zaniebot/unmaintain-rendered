# Why does `uv pip` use the global pip instead of the venv one?

### Question

I create my .venv using `uv venv --seed` to include pip there, where my venv has Python 3.9 and the global Python is 3.7. 

However, when I run `uv pip list`, it prints the packages in the global environment instead of those in my project:
```bash
 ~ uv pip list
Using Python 3.7.3 environment at: /.../anaconda3
Package                            Version
---------------------------------- ---------
alabaster                          0.7.12
anaconda-client                    1.7.2
anaconda-navigator                 1.9.7
anaconda-project                   0.8.3
asn1crypto                         0.24.0
astroid                            2.2.5
astropy                            3.2.1
...(a lot going on)
```
which is the exact output of the command `pip list` (except for the first line `Using Python ...`).

`uv python find` resolves to my venv interpreter `/home/.../.venv/bin/python3`, and apparently, I have to activate venv first to let `uv pip` use the venv pip:
```bash
 ~ source .venv/bin/activate
 ~ uv pip list
Package           Version
----------------- -----------
absl-py           2.3.1
colorlog          6.9.0
et-xmlfile        2.0.0
exceptiongroup    1.3.0
immutabledict     4.2.1
iniconfig         2.1.0
numpy             2.0.2
...(all the packages in my project)
```
but in that way I can just use `pip list` instead, so I don't think activating the venv should be necessary for correctly using `uv pip`. Is this an intentional behavior?

### Platform

Linux 3.10.0-1160.102.1.el7.x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

 uv 0.8.9

Maybe the cause is that I have conda base environment activated by default. When I deactivte conda, `uv pip list` resolves to the correct packages:
```bash
 ~ conda activate
 ~ uv pip list
Using Python 3.7.3 environment at: /data01/.../anaconda3
Package                            Version
---------------------------------- ---------
alabaster                          0.7.12
anaconda-client                    1.7.2
anaconda-navigator                 1.9.7
anaconda-project                   0.8.3
asn1crypto                         0.24.0
astroid                            2.2.5
astropy                            3.2.1
atomicwrites                       1.3.0
attrs                              19.1.0
...(everything in conda base)
```
v.s.
```bash
 ~ conda deactivate
 ~ uv pip list
Package           Version
----------------- -----------
absl-py           2.3.1
colorlog          6.9.0
et-xmlfile        2.0.0
exceptiongroup    1.3.0
immutabledict     4.2.1
iniconfig         2.1.0
numpy             2.0.2
...(everything in my project)
```
So in some commands conda overrides uv?

Yeah if you have an active environment we'll generally prefer that over discovering an environment on the file system.
