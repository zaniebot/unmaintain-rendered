# Split `Printer::stdout()` to be harder to get wrong

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2025-12-04 15:22_

Currently, multiple locations that have machine readable output use `printer.stdout()`. This means that they don't output when `-q` is set, breaking the interface contract. We should break `stdout` and `stdout_important` into different functions named after their purpose, such as machine-readable output, that react appropriately to `-q`.

I think we can split `Printer.stderr` too, generally the goal should be to identify current use-cases and then see how we can group them. Here are some ideas off the top of my head:

- `stream_for_machine_output`
- `stream_for_progress`
- `stream_for_status_update`
- `stream_for_success_summary`
- `stream_for_failure_summary`
