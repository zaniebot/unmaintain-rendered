<p>I would expect at least the latest Python version? And probably not a specific variant?</p>
<p>This seems like it might be a pain to fix.</p>

We'd have to disable the matrix approach if we want some kind of order.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I gave it a try and it didn't quite work as I expected, GitHub seems to sort based on when digests get pushed, so re-doing the <code>docker-publish</code> job at the end (which only updates the tags) didn't help and we'd have to rebuild a new image to have the digests change. It seems like a limitation on Github's side to not allow configurability of which tag gets featured. I'll keep thinking about it.</p>

<p>I found a trick by leveraging annotations proposed in #7568 by which makes this achievable.</p>
