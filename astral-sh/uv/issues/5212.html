In Windows(GUI), using the <code>more</code> is a bit cumbersome for me. It would be better to output everything at once and then I use the mouse to find the information I need.</p>

<p><code>--no-pager</code> seems to be a hidden parameter, I didn't see it in the help. <br>
But it does meet my requirements. <br>
Windows (GUI) only explicitly specifies the use of the graphical interface of Windows. <br>
Q: why that makes it preferable to scroll?
A: Since the help of CLI is not so much that I can't scroll through it with a mouse, I let it output all at once so I can use the mouse to find what I need, instead of using <code>more</code> to view it line by line.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah sorry I think there are some technical difficulties in getting it to display without displaying a bunch of other options. I've created an issue to track that at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5221</p>
<p>Some of our help is really long and we only expect it to get longer. I think I'd prefer to stick to paging by default and let people opt-out as needed.</p>
