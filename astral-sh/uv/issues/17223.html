            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Related to and discussed in #17177 (specifically see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17177#discussion_r2631958153_">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17177#issuecomment-3684275691">this</a>).</p>
<p>Some tests are heavily IO bound and running all of them concurrently makes them individually take much longer and sometimes lead to flakiness especially on windows.</p>
<p>Currently we consider <code>python_install::</code> <code>python_update::</code> and <code>python_find::</code> tests to be IO bound but these are very coarse grained selectors and do not catch many of the tests which could trigger similar issues.</p>
<p>If tests could be tagged somehow, and potentially selected for by nextest this would help improve this.</p>
<p>One option could be to add each io bound test to a submodule within its test module. e.g. mod io_bound {...}; This would then allow these to be selected with <code>test(::io_bound::)</code>. Alternatively we could tag these another way and write a tool which generates a profile override for nextest.</p>
Example
<p>Tests would time out less often.</p>
