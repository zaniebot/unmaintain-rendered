            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my projects that use <code>uv</code> I've developed a pattern (which I've encoded in a <a href="https://github.com/rmorshea/python-copier-template?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-in-the-box">template repo</a>) where I define a script called <code>dev.py</code> that uses <code>click</code> to define a CLI and automate common tasks (e.g. running tests, building docs and linting). With that in mind it would be nice if it were possible to define a &quot;default script&quot; so that, instead of typing <code>uv run dev.py ...</code>, I could avoid typing <code>dev.py</code> each time and use a shorter command a la <code>yarn run</code> or <code>npm run</code> which inherit commands from the <code>scripts</code> section of <code>package.json</code>. Since <code>uv run</code> wouldn't be suitable for this due to the fact that positional arguments would be confused with executables, an alternative command like <code>uv do ...</code> would be necessary. A hypothetical configuration could look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.do]
command = &quot;uv run dev.py&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I understand this might be considered relatively niche, however I could imagine a feature like this negating the need for UV to develop it's own system for defining and executing &quot;user scripts&quot; as other package managers in the Python space have (e.g. <a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/1.12/config/environment/overview/#scripts">Hatch's</a> and <a href="https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/scripts/#user-scripts">PDM's</a> approaches). Instead, UV could defer to existing tools in the Python ecosystem for this like <a href="https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/">Nox</a> or <a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/">Invoke</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, this sounds like an implementation of #5903 that just invokes a third-party tool? Sort of a plugin system?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I think it could function that way. Put another way, I'm proposing that UV provide a command for projects to alias in whatever way they might want.</p>
<p>Taking the initial <a href="https://github.com/taskipy/taskipy">taskipy</a> example from #5903 you could configure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[dependency-groups]
dev = [&quot;taskipy&quot;]

[tool.uv.do]
command = &quot;uv run task&quot;

[tool.taskipy.tasks]
hello = &quot;echo Hello from taskipy!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Any then run:</p>
<pre><code>uv do hello
</code></pre>
<p>I see two main advantages of this approach has over #5903:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you choose to use another tool to manage your scripts you don't need to ensure you've copied them both under <code>[tool.uv.tasks]</code> and that tool's configuration location of choice. To me, having a bunch of &quot;tasks&quot; which look like <code>uv run uvx --from=rust-just just &lt;the-task&gt;</code> seems redundant and annoying to maintain. Instead, under this proposal you could simply configure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.do]
command = &quot;uv run uvx --from=rust-just just&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>As mentioned above, UV doesn't need to develop and maintain a task running system that will inevitably grow in scope and complexity. While choosing not to provide a task runner out of the box might not conform to people's expectations, I think it could be pretty easily addressed with a short and easily discoverable section of documentation that provides a recommended solution for people to copy-paste into their projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One downside of this proposal vs #5903 is that new contributors to a project that uses UV won't always be able to look for the same <code>tool.uv.tasks</code> configuration to find the set of common commands they might want to run.</p>
