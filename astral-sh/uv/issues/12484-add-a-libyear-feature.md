# Add a libyear feature

---

_@SebCorbin_

### Summary

See https://libyear.com/ for the explanation, the idea is to calculate how far behind dependencies are in a project.

For python projects there is [pylibyear](https://pypi.org/project/pylibyear/) available but it could really use [performance optimizations](https://github.com/sam-atkins/pylibyear/issues/12), and then I though of `uv` that already manage dependencies, so it could also report libyear-style!

### Example

Sounds cool, but we're focusing on friction points rather than new functionality in the short-term.
