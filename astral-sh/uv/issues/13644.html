            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>While trying to create a new pyproject.toml in a pre-existing project, I decided to add the latest version of the PostgreSQL adapter, which would be psycopg3. However, I got this instead:</p>
<p>╰─▶ Because there are no versions of psycopg3 and you require psycopg3&gt;=1.0, we can conclude that your
requirements are unsatisfiable.</p>
<p>What do you mean 'no versions'? I don't understand this at all. psycopg3 has been out for a while. It's on pypi.  They are up to version 3.2.9. Or did this mean there were no versions on my machine? But that doesn't make sense either, because this was a request to put it on my machine.</p>
<p>I just put &gt;=1.0 because that was before I looked it up, and I figured 1.0 was a safe guess</p>
<p>Your clarifying words of wisdom greatly appreciated.</p>
