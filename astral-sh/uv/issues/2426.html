Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>When Ruff reached 0.1.0, a custom versioning scheme was adopted, which is sort of like SemVer with an extra 0. at the start:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/6998</li>
</ul>
<p>uv is already at 0.1.8 but it has a breaking change: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.1.18. This is not a number I'd pay attention to for a breaking change :)</p>
<p>What is uv's versioning policy? SemVer? Custom like Ruff? Another custom scheme? Or even CalVer like pip?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do not have a versioning policy yet since it's such a new product. I think we're likely to bump the minor version number for major breaking changes but there <em>will</em> be small breaking changes in patch releases as we rapidly improve uv. We're very likely to switch to SemVer with <code>1.0.0</code> but may introduce a versioning policy before then.</p>
