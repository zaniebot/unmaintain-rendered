# Add Claude's Model Context Protocol(MCP) to automated tests(CI).

---

_Issue opened by @FishAlchemist on 2025-03-25 06:30_

### Summary

Currently, the uv project's automated tests do not include the installation of Claude MCP. This means that future uv releases may inadvertently break compatibility with MCP.

MCP is gaining popularity, and its official MCP Python SDK recommends using uv. Additionally, some users are utilizing uvx to bind MCP servers to clients, highlighting the growing reliance on uv for MCP-related workflows.

**Proposed Solution:**

I propose adding the installation of Claude MCP to the uv project's automated testing suite. This will ensure that every uv release can successfully install MCP, guaranteeing ongoing compatibility and reliability for users who depend on this combination.

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Compatibility:** Prevents future uv releases from breaking MCP installation.
* **Enhanced Reliability:** Ensures that uv remains a reliable tool for MCP users.
* **Increased User Confidence:** Demonstrates uv's commitment to supporting popular tools and workflows.

Actually, all of the above was basically generated by AI. I had AI help me expand on my request. 
If there are no plans to add it to the testing, would anyone consider adding it to the Integration guides?

Edit:
OpenAI's Agents SDK also supports MCP.

Why would we fail to install MCP?

It's not that it can't be installed. I just wanted to ask if there's any consideration to adding MCP to UV's automated testing, to ensure all future versions can be successfully installed.

Unless there's something particular about the package, I don't see why we'd want dedicated test coverage. Maybe eventually it'd be nice to test if we can install many packages in the ecosystem, but it's far more likely there will be a problem with the package than uv.
