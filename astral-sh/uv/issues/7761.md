# Allow users to define multiple, disjoint explicit indexes

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-28 18:08_

I.e., this should work:
```toml
[project]
name = "project"
version = "0.1.0"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["jinja2"]

[tool.uv.sources]
jinja2 = [
    { index = "torch-cu118", marker = "sys_platform == 'darwin'"},
    { index = "torch-cu124", marker = "sys_platform != 'darwin'"},
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "torch-cu118"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118"

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "torch-cu124"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124"
```
