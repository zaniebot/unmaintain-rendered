            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently it's possible to override a packages <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#dependency-metadata">dependency metadata</a>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;chumpy&quot;
version = &quot;0.70&quot;
requires-dist = [&quot;numpy&gt;=1.8.1&quot;, &quot;scipy&gt;=0.13.0&quot;, &quot;six&gt;=1.11.0&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice to do that for build dependency and backend metadata, there are two scenarios I can see this being useful in:</p>
<ol>
<li>A new version of a build backend gets released with backwards incompatibilities, only a small number of unmaintained dependencies need fixing to pin to an older version of the build backend</li>
<li>A user dependency on a legacy setuptools project and it would work except for the fact the project is unmaintained and does not provide a pyproject.toml</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm a little unsure on my second example whether in general it would be enough to specify a build backend, or if in general it would need something more. In general I may have not fully thought through the complexities, so I understand if this isn't possible. This is something I think would be helpful to the ecosystem, not something I personally need.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
version = &quot;0.8.0&quot;
requires-dist = [&quot;numpy&gt;=1.8.1&quot;, &quot;scipy&gt;=0.13.0&quot;, &quot;six&gt;=1.11.0&quot;]
build-requires-dist = [&quot;setuptools&lt;78&quot;]
build-backend = [&quot;setuptools.build_meta&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>FWIW, I do not see this proposal as a solution to that particular situation, this is a per package solution, whereas that affected many packages, so I'm not sure this would scale well.</p>
<p>I think uv consistently supporting <code>--build-constraint</code> across all its commands is a better solution to that particular situation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're working on support for this, with another motivating example being the <em>extension</em> of build requirements for specific packages.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also, <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/#recommendations-for-build-frontends-non-normative">the spec</a> actually says that build frontends should provide some tooling for users like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>build frontends SHOULD provide some mechanism for users to override the above defaults. For example, a build frontend could have a --build-with-system-site-packages option that causes the --system-site-packages option to be passed to virtualenv-or-equivalent when creating build environments, or a --build-requirements-override=my-requirements.txt option that overrides the project’s normal build-requirements.</p>
<p>The general principle here is that we want to enforce hygiene on package authors, while still allowing end-users to open up the hood and apply duct tape when necessary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm happy with this being closed, but on consideration this does not completely cover this, you may want to override a pinning or an upper bound, e.g. in the future you may want to override <code>setuptools==70</code> to <code>setuptools==100</code>, I don't believe that's possible with this new feature.</p>
<p>I don't have a specific use case for this right now though, so maybe re-raise this when someone actually needs it.</p>
