# support a consistent file structure for virtual environments across operating systems

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-05-12 03:42_

### Summary

something i've always found very annoying about virtual environments is that for whatever reason the scripts are located in `.venv/bin` on linux & macOS, but `.venv/Scripts` on windows. this regularly causes issues if i'm configuring someting to use a script installed in my venv, only to realize that i can't commit the config file because it only works on my machine but not other developers who may be using a different OS.

example with dprint: https://github.com/dprint/dprint/issues/859#issuecomment-2868290521

since uv can manage virtual environments itself, i wonder if it's possible to add an option to make the file structure of the venv consistent regardless of the user's OS

### Example

The structure of venvs is largely defined by CPython and by PEP 405, it would have a lot of side effects to deviate from a structure that a lot of software has come to depend on.

Yeah, I think this would be too disruptive unfortunately.
