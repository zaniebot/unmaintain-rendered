# uv init should do git init before getting author information from git

---

_Issue opened by @sebastianw on 2025-08-19 08:42_

### Summary

When using git to get the author information for `pyproject.toml`, I wondered why it was only getting my name but not my email address.

I use `includeIf` in `.gitconfig` to set email address depending on folder (work/private):

```gitconfig

[user]
name = My Name

[includeIf "gitdir:~/repositories/work/"]
  path = ./.gitconfig.work
[includeIf "gitdir:~/repositories/privat/"]
  path = ./.gitconfig.privat
```

git will only include these files when called in a directory with a `.git` subdirectory, as the config states:


> The data that follows the keyword gitdir: is used as a glob pattern. If the location of the .git directory matches the pattern, the include condition is met.
> 
> The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from $GIT_DIR environment variable. If the repository is auto-discovered via a .git file (e.g. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the .git location would be the final location where the .git directory is, not where the .git file is.
> 
> 

When doing `uv init` it seems that the author information is collected from git before the git repository gets initialized which means it can't get the email information.

If possible it would be nice if uv could init git before collecting the author information from it so that the email address is included in `pyproject.toml`.
