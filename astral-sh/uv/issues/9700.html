            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is it safe to clean up duplicate lines in the <code>uv.lock</code> file? Can this be done as part of the <code>lock</code> procedure? In my lock file&#x27;s resolution-markers section, have lines repeated thousands of times.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>resolution-markers = [
    &quot;python_full_version &lt; &#x27;3.9&#x27; and platform_machine == &#x27;aarch64&#x27; and platform_system == &#x27;Linux&#x27;&quot;, # (repeated more than 19,999 times)
    &quot;platform_system == &#x27;Darwin&#x27;&quot;, # (repeated 18,751 times)
    # ... ad nauseum
]
</code></pre>
<p>This leads to a ~190k-line lock file. Though this is quite a nice bump to my performance metrics at work, DevOps is asking why my python repository is not mostly python code 😅.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to clarify... it&#x27;s a single <code>resolution-markers</code> at the top, with those lines repeated infinitely?</p>
<p>Or you have a bunch of different <code>resolution-markers</code>, like one on each package, with unique entries?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, those should definitely be de-duplicated. Do you have lots of conflicting extras or something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nope, it was the same pyproject.toml as #9701. After nuking the lock file and re-creating it&#x27;s back down to ~3k lines with no repetitions.</p>
<p>At one point the <code>lock</code> actually brought down my EC2 instance. But restarting and re-locking &quot;just worked&quot;. I unfortunately no longer have the ginormous lock file for reference.</p>
