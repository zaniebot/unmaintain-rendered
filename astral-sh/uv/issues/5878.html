Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>I wonder if it's possible to make the reason why a package can't be installed when setting <code>UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER</code> a bit clearer. Currently</p>
<pre><code>No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of my-package==0.5.0 and you require
      my-package==0.5.0, we can conclude that the requirements are
      unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>is a bit baffling to some users (me!) that might've forgotten to bump the <code>UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER</code> date to support the new version of a package.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! Unfortunately this is intentional and a requirement for having the output of the resolver be deterministic.</p>
<p>We could consider moving the reproducible error messages behind a flag, but right now we need it for our test suite.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If someone is interested in taking this on with a separate <code>UV_TEST_EXCLUDE_NEWER</code> or something I'd review. Something like #844 is one solution or we can report exclude newer incompatibilities directly as we do for other unusable distributions — I left myself a nice little message about this https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/35b982446d8c4a1a6562f0ffaf8d985916838439/crates/uv-resolver/src/candidate_selector.rs#L493-L507</p>
