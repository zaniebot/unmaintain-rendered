# how to plain print uv sync progress in docker

_Issue opened by @YoniChechik on 2024-12-26 10:07_

I'm syncing uv inside Dockerfile and while building (with plain flag of docker compose), I cant see the progress of the uv installation untils it finishes. Is there any flag to enable plain print for uv?

I don't think so. Can you give an example of a tool that provides plain progress like that, for reference?

`docker build --progress plain` for example.
