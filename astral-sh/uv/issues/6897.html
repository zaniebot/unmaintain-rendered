Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with `uv`.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hello! I've recently started experiencing issue when installing <code>fastembed</code> package. Seems like it depends on <code>pystemmer</code> library, which has some problems with building in <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>Trace:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">❯ uv add fastembed-haystack
Resolved 181 packages in 76ms
error: Failed to prepare distributions
  Caused by: Failed to fetch wheel: pystemmer==2.2.0.1
  Caused by: Build backend failed to build wheel through `build_wheel()` with exit status: 1

</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas how to fix it? Also fails with <code>uv pip install</code>.</p>
<p>uv version: 0.4.0.
platform: WSL2
python: 3.12.5, also fails on 3.11.9, 3.11.6, and seems like all 3.11+???</p>
<p>Why am I assuming that it might be related to <code>uv</code> specifically: I was able to install and build the same packages in <code>pyenv 3.12.0b4</code>.</p>
<p>UPD: Full logs: <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16825770/log.txt">log.txt</a>.</p>
<p>UPD2: was able to install on python 3.10.12 (<code>uv</code>).</p>
<p>UPD3:  Was able to install on 3.12.5. I just installed pip using uv pip install pip and then added my dependency:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv pip install pip # in case you dont have regular pip in your env
pip install pystemmer
uv add fastembed-haystack
</code></pre>
<p>Question: are there more elegant solutions, and how can i avoid doing those workarounds and just install normally in the future?</p>
<p>UPD4: Got a response in pystemmer github. Apparently, when you directly specify that you want to use a <code>gcc</code> instead of clang as a compiler during installing this package using regular uv means, it works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">CC=gcc-11 uv pip install pystemmer # or
CC=gcc-11 uv add fastembed-haystack
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to use gcc by default (instead of clang)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, seems like that! I think the issue can be considered resolved. However, IMO it would be nice to have an option to choose default compiler used in uv without environment variables.</p>
