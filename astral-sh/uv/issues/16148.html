            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Here&#x27;s an mre <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;test&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;
dependencies = [
  &quot;coverage[toml] ; python_version &lt; &#x27;3.11&#x27;&quot;,
  &quot;coverage &gt;= 7.10.0&quot;,
]

[build-system]
requires = [&quot;uv_build&gt;=0.8.23,&lt;0.9.0&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;uv_build&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>running <code>uv sync</code> with a <code>lowest-direct</code> resolution produces a warning</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv sync --resolution=lowest-direct
⠙ test==0.1.0
warning: The direct dependency `coverage` is unpinned. Consider setting a lower bound when using `--resolution lowest` or `--resolution lowest-direct` to avoid using outdated versions.
Resolved 3 packages in 61ms
      Built test @ file:///private/tmp/test
Prepared 2 packages in 158ms
Installed 2 packages in 2ms
 + coverage==7.10.0
 + test==0.1.0 (from file:///private/tmp/test)
</code></pre>
<p>I think in this instance the warning is misleading (incorrect ?), because there exists no scenario where <code>coverage</code> would be resolved without a lower bound, but I figure the warning is the result of a sanity check that runs on single requirements, rather than on a &quot;merged&quot; view (for lack of a better word). I understand this could be tricky to fix because one would need to (partially) resolve the dependency tree ahead running this sanity check, which can easily turn into a chicken VS egg problem. It&#x27;s a really minor thing however, and can easily be worked around on the user side by merely duplicating the lower bound; I just thought I might raise awareness on this quirk before resorting to that.</p>
Platform
<p>Darwin 24.6.0 arm64</p>
Version
<p>0.8.23 (00d3aa378 2025-10-04)</p>
Python version
<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s relevant, but I saw this on 3.10</p>
