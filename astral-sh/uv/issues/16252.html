            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I uninstalled Python 3.13 from my system, and reinstalled it using the new Python Manager. As a result, the old <code>python.exe</code> no longer exists. Now, when I run <code>uv tool list</code> I get:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Querying Python at `C:\Users\Gustav\AppData\Roaming\uv\tools\nox\Scripts\python.exe` failed with exit status exit code: 103

[stderr]
did not find executable at &#x27;C:\Users\Gustav\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe&#x27;: The system cannot find the path specified.
 (run `uv tool install nox --reinstall` to reinstall)
</code></pre>
<p>This is reasonable (although it would be nice if the error was handled better, maybe by listing <code>nox</code> but with a note that the Python executable wasn&#x27;t found, rather than a raw error). But what <em>isn&#x27;t</em> OK is that the recommended action, <code>uv tool install nox --reinstall</code>, fails with the same error. Reinstalling a broken tool should work, not fail with the same error that is the reason you&#x27;re trying to reinstall!</p>
<p>Uninstalling nox (and then installing it from scratch) did work, although I&#x27;d prefer it if reeinstalling could be made to work, rather than changing the recommendation to uninstall and then reinstall.</p>
<p>As a side note, if I had been able to reinstall nox, it&#x27;s not obvious to me whether I&#x27;d expect it to be updated to use Python 3.14, or to still try to use Python 3.13 (and fail because I don&#x27;t have Python 3.13 installed) - although I&#x27;m fine if it worked like uninstall/reinstall and used the default system Python (3.14). I definitely <em>wouldn&#x27;t</em> want it to install a uv-managed copy of Python, though - I&#x27;m careful to manage my persistent Python installations via the standard Python installer, not via uv, and I wouldn&#x27;t want that to change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This bug is Windows-specific, we&#x27;re handling this case correctly on Unix (with a warning and hint, non-fatal). Draft PR with a fix: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17176">astral-sh/uv#17176</a></p>

<p>I definitely <em>wouldn&#x27;t</em> want it to install a uv-managed copy of Python, though - I&#x27;m careful to manage my persistent Python installations via the standard Python installer, not via uv, and I wouldn&#x27;t want that to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way to ensure that is to have a global <code>uv.toml</code> that sets the python preference to only-system, then uv won&#x27;t use managed interpreters at all (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#python-preference).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a side note, if I had been able to reinstall nox, it&#x27;s not obvious to me whether I&#x27;d expect it to be updated to use Python 3.14, or to still try to use Python 3.13 (and fail because I don&#x27;t have Python 3.13 installed) - although I&#x27;m fine if it worked like uninstall/reinstall and used the default system Python (3.14).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current Unix behavior that the PR ports to Windows is that <code>--reinstall</code> with a broken existing venv looks for the system default, unless otherwise specified e.g. with <code>-p</code>, so it will use 3.14. That&#x27;s specific for broken interpreters, which doesn&#x27;t allow us to reuse the actual venv interpreter, so we fall back to standard priorities (we could try reading the version from <code>pyvenv.cfg</code>, but I&#x27;m not sure if the experience is better if we force 3.13 with <code>--reinstall</code> without the user having requested it with <code>-p</code>)</p>
