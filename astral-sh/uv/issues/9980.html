            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thx again for the tool. I think having uv-managed python is very convenient, and I'd be happy to have this level of control which is less independent on OS, and more straightforward than using deadsnakes.</p>
<p>When I benchmark speed of uv-managed python vs deadsnakes (setup: ubuntu 22.04, python 3.11) on production workload, I observed that distribution from deadsnakes is 1.5-5% faster. My observation is in line with Itamar's remarks here: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/uv-python-production/ , though he used different test setup.</p>
<p>I wonder if this gap can be reduced (and is this due to older glibc?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using older versions of build tooling is the primary difference I would presume, though I can't say for sure without trying it out. It's tough to balance the backwards compatibility goals with performance in this instance though.</p>
