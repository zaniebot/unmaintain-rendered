            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We typically <em>don't</em> do this, e.g., <code>uv pip install /path/to/dir</code> will <em>not</em> read configuration from <code>/path/to/dir/pyproject.toml</code> -- it only discovers configuration from the current working directory and above. (An exception is for named, pinned indexes in sources -- those are always respected.)</p>
<p>For tools, though, it seems like it might make sense to always respect the project configuration, since you can only provide a single target anyway. (E.g., you can <code>uv pip install /foo /bar</code>, in which case it becomes ambiguous whether we should respect any or all of the configuration files; but tools always install a single target.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is actually sort of tricky to implement because the settings resolution happens before we resolve the install target.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like if there were a message in the terminal about if we are using the &quot;globally installed&quot; tool version, or a version from a <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I run tools in various projects and it would be confusing to me if behavior changed without warning.</p>
<p>Should this be tagged as <code>breaking</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh sorry, this wouldn't change the tool <em>version</em>. It would just mean that if the tool's <code>pyproject.toml</code> defined (e.g.) an <code>[[index]]</code>, we would respect that <code>[[index]]</code> rather than ignoring it as we do today (we only respect explicit named indexes in that case, which tends to be confusing).</p>
