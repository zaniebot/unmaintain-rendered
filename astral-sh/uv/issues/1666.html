<p>This works, but <code>poetry export &gt; requirements.txt</code> creates UTF16-LE file, while <code>uv pip install -r requirements.txt</code> expects UTF-8, so I manually need to re-save it in UTF8. It is not a problem, but would be cool if <code>uv</code> would detect input file encoding...</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install -r .\requirements.txt
error: failed to read from file `.\requirements.txt`
  Caused by: stream did not contain valid UTF-8
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For sake of not making an even bigger mess in the ecosystem it would be ideal if this stays as UTF-8. I'm perplexed that poetry would generate a UTF-16 file and I can only assume this is because it picks up some weird default encoding by accident.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Poetry does not generate a utf-16 file.</p>
<p>If told a filename to write to, it writes utf-8.  However OP is redirecting stdout, presumably the encoding is whatever the python interpreter says it is in that environment</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The UTF-16 encoding was most likely picked up from the environment. As I stated in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1634#issuecomment-1951496960">here</a>, stream redirection is not the way to export to requirements file. We use UTF-8 when writing to files.</p>
