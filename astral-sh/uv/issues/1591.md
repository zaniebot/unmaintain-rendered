# uv self update

---

_Issue opened by @woutervh on 2024-02-17 14:21_

Poetry can udate itself via

```
poetry self update
```

see 
https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#self-update

An uv-equivalent would be nice, given the fast iterations

FYI, I needed to do this yesterday and found `uv pip install --reinstall uv` worked.

I don't know if *how* you installed uv affects that, maybe that's only for via originally installing it from Pip.

This is on the roadmap, probably via [`cargo-dist`](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist)
