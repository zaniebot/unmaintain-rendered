            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With <code>uv==0.4.30</code>, there is a big time variance in &quot;Prepared X packages in Ys&quot; in GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>Note 3.11 takes ~0.5 min and 3.12 takes ~13.5 min.</p>
<p>I think what's happening is Python 3.12 is being installed during the &quot;Prepared&quot;, and this takes like 13 mins.</p>
<p>I guess the request is to split out installs of new Python versions into a different timing log line, for more understandability</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think that the Python install should take that long, that's surprising.</p>
<p>Do you have verbose logs?</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there's a great way for us to improve the timing report if that is the case though, it's challenging implementation-wise.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi Zanie thanks for the quick response. I just did a CI run with <code>uv sync --verbose</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.11: https://github.com/Future-House/paper-qa/actions/runs/11730068134/job/32677083704</li>
<li>Python 3.12: https://github.com/Future-House/paper-qa/actions/runs/11730068134/job/32677084030</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this time it did not happen, both <code>uv sync</code> took 32 seconds. So I am not sure what to do here, maybe it was some quirk of GitHub Actions Runner.</p>
<p>Anything we can do here? Or should we just close this issue</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we can do anything. Seems like something weird happened.</p>
<p>Fwiw I gave this a quick try and we download the Python version before printing the &quot;Resolved&quot; message so that can't be the cause</p>
