            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For developing applications with <code>uv</code> that are intended to be deployed to serverless environments, it would be awesome if I could run <code>uv init --docker</code> and get <code>Dockerfile</code> and <code>.dockerignore</code> files generated that follow uv best practices.</p>
<p>These could be taken from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example">uv-docker-example</a>.</p>
<p>This would greatly speed up development and would make <code>uv</code> even more usable! 😄</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Addition of new <code>--docker</code> flag to the <code>uv init</code> command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># generate uv project with additional Dockerfile and .dockerignore
uv init --docker
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I would be curious what you think of this idea?</p>
<p>It would allow a project to be created and deployed with uv with basically zero lift from a user's perspective 😄</p>
<p>Happy to potentially work on it if there is interest</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm pretty interested, I think it's a good idea. I worry a little about maintaining it. Let me see what the rest of the team thinks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this kind of thing is really reasonable as long as it's indeed an <code>init</code> thing and not something we are expected to keep sync'd as your project changes. Hard to say how useful it would be, but I could imagine it is.</p>
<p>My experience with this kind of thing is that it's trivial to make <em>a</em> perfectly reasonable barebones Docker image, but that devs are gonna have a bunch of opinions or customizations they'll want to make, and anything but &quot;cool now go ahead and hand-edit this&quot; is a mess.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Gankra @zanieb Totally agree, I only thought of it for the <code>init</code> command, as it would be too hard to maintain otherwise like you mentioned.</p>

<p>Yes I guess this is the challenge, I was really just thinking we could pull from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example">uv-docker-example</a> but you are right that everyone has opinions on things and it could become a headache if its not properly documented as a barebones template 😆</p>
