            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<h3>Describe the bug</h3>
<p>When using <code>uv==0.7.17</code>, installing packages with a <code>requirements.txt</code> file that specifies a custom <code>--find-links</code> URL fails with a timeout error. This issue does <strong>not</strong> occur in <code>uv==0.7.16</code>.</p>
<p>It appears that uv 0.7.17 does not handle the trailing slash in the <code>--find-links</code> URL correctly, resulting in failed requests.</p>
<h3>To Reproduce</h3>
<p><strong>requirements.txt</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>--find-links https://example.com/fileserver/packages/
custom-package==1.0.4
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Command:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to read `--find-links` URL: https://example.com/fileserver/packages
  Caused by: Failed to fetch: `https://example.com/fileserver/packages`
  Caused by: Request failed after 3 retries
  Caused by: error sending request for url (http://example.com/fileserver/packages)
  Caused by: operation timed out
</code></pre>
<h3>Expected behavior</h3>
<p>Packages should be installed successfully using the custom find-links repository.</p>
<h3>Additional context</h3>
<ul>
<li>The same command and requirements file work correctly in <code>uv==0.7.16</code>.</li>
<li>The issue appears when the <code>--find-links</code> URL ends with a <code>/</code>.</li>
<li>The URL is a private package repository (URL replaced with <code>https://example.com/fileserver/packages/</code> for privacy).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Possible related</h3>
<ul>
<li>Change in URL normalization or handling between 0.7.16 and 0.7.17.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux 5.15.0-1079-azure x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.7.17</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.10</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you sure you don't encounter this problem in 0.7.16? Based on my testing, I think that it should have started with 0.7.16 (which introduced a change that normalized URLs by removing a trailing slash). If the problem you're seeing did start with 0.7.17, I'm not able to reproduce your scenario (in which case it would be helpful to know more about your private registry and to see the <code>-vv</code> logs).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the clarification. Let me provide more details about my setup and testing results.</p>
<h2>Setup Details</h2>
<p>My private registry is set up using nginx as a file server, with <code>.whl</code> files stored in directories that are accessed via folder links for installation.</p>
<h2>Detailed Testing Results</h2>
<p>After multiple tests, I've discovered the following behavior patterns:</p>
<h3>Test 1: uv 0.7.16 with command line <code>--find-links</code> (FAILS)</h3>

<pre><code class="language-bash">uv pip install redis-cache==1.0.3 --find-links=http://10.248.36.248:30024/shared/ -vv
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> This fails with the following error:</p>

</code></pre>
<h3>Test 2: uv 0.7.16 with requirements.txt (WORKS)</h3>
<p><strong>requirements.txt content:</strong></p>
<pre><code>--find-links http://10.248.36.248:30024/shared/
redis-cache==1.0.3
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Command:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv pip install -r requirements.txt -vv
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> This works successfully in uv 0.7.16.</p>
<h3>Test 3: uv 0.7.17 with requirements.txt (FAILS)</h3>
<p>Using the same requirements.txt file as Test 2:</p>
<p><strong>Command:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv pip install -r requirements.txt -vv
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> This fails in uv 0.7.17, whereas it worked in 0.7.16.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The key observation is that there's a difference in behavior between:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using <code>--find-links</code> as a command line argument vs. in requirements.txt</li>
<li>How uv 0.7.16 vs 0.7.17 handle the requirements.txt approach</li>
</ol>
<p>In 0.7.16, the requirements.txt method works while the command line method fails. In 0.7.17, both methods appear to fail.</p>
