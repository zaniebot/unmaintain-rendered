# `uv pip install --python <version>` doesn't perform automatic Python downloads with `--target`

_Issue opened by @kyluca on 2025-03-17 04:01_

### Summary

Hi,

Firstly, thank you for your incredible work and vision with `uv` and Astral as a whole.

I'm not entirely sure whether this is a bug or intended behaviour (if so, perhaps an extra note in the documentation would suffice). I've also tried to find existing issues that match the symptoms but haven't found any.

My use case is packaging dependencies into a zip archive for deployment to AWS Lambda via Terraform. Following the guide on https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/aws-lambda/ is very helpful, particularly with the `--target <target dir>` feature as we previously used it with `pip install` directly. However, when the desired Python version doesn't exist on the system, `uv` doesn't attempt to download it.

My expectation was for `uv` to automatically download the missing Python version as it does with the majority of other `uv` workflows. Although, I can see this might intentionally not be the case with the "pip compatibility" layer as managing Python versions is not something that `pip` concerns itself with.

Is this the intended behaviour? I can of course run something like `uv python install python3.13` before running the install command to make sure it's always present, or bake Python 3.13 into my Terraform agent itself. However, the way that `uv` usually manages to automatically download missing Python versions is a really great feature that I've come to rely on to as it removes the need to prepare system wide dependencies etc.

## Steps to reproduce the bug

With a fresh clone of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-aws-lambda-example, following the "Zip archive" steps at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-aws-lambda-example?tab=readme-ov-file#zip-archive works as written assuming you already have Python 3.13 installed.

If you remove it first, the commands fail:
```
$ uv python uninstall 3.13
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.13
Uninstalled Python 3.13.0 in 116ms

Hope that all makes sense and thanks again.

I believe #16694 addressed this?
