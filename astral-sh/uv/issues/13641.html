            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I asked about this here https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3682#issuecomment-2820120902 but it seems that wasn't seen so I'm making it's own issue.</p>
<p>When using the compiled .txt as a constraints file it can't find the name of the editable package when it has the #egg= in it (i.e. <code>-e file:some-package#egg=some-package</code> doesn't work with error: Unnamed requirements are not allowed as constraints) but if I manually change it to <code>-e some-package @ file:some-package</code> then it does work.</p>
<p>Can <code>uv pip compile</code> be given a flag to allow this kind of output please?</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you use the editable as regular dependency? Using editables in constraints file would mean the constraint doesn't limit the resolution, but overrides it. By default, using a URL dependency (which includes files and git) will coerce all other requirements of the dependency to the version behind the URL, and this would be more explicit.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin yeah, I agree it's a bit of a hack what I'm doing</p>
<p>Ultimately I'm kinda replicating a <code>workspace = true</code> uv source to make it so we don't need <code>PYTHONPATH</code> to have the code in the repo importable from the virtualenv we're in</p>
<p>(I'd love to switch to uv workspaces and also be using a uv.lock but that's much easier said than done in the repo I work on and we currently have our dependencies split across multiple <code>.in</code> files so that we don't have to install all of our 500+ dependencies for every job in CI)</p>
