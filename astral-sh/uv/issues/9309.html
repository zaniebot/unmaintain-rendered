Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Is there no way of seeing updates for tools?</p>
<p>I currently have ruff 0.7.3 installed.  I can successfully upgrade the tool using <code>uv tool upgrade ruff</code>, which updates it to 0.7.4, but would like to see what is available to upgrade first so that I can go and read the release notes (and put it in a script to show me when new versions are available).  I used <code>uv tool install ruff</code> rather than just running via uvx so that I can use generate-shell-completion for it (that does not work when running under uvx as starting a command with <code>uvx ruff ...</code> does not show shell completion for <code>ruff ...</code>)</p>
<p>I am using uv 0.5.3 on Windows, with Powershell 7.4.6</p>
<pre><code>&gt; uv tool list
ruff v0.7.3
- ruff.exe
</code></pre>
<p>My uv installed version of ruff is old, but I would have expected to be able to use --outdated like on uv pip list / uv tree</p>
<pre><code>&gt; uv tool list --outdated
error: unexpected argument '--outdated' found

Usage: uv.exe tool list [OPTIONS]
</code></pre>
<p>I was looking at if there was other ways of doing this, but it appears not.  Oddly, the shell completion for powershell gives --no-upgrade as an option on <code>uv tool upgrade</code> :</p>
<pre><code>&gt; uv tool upgrade --no-upgrade--allow-insecure-host

<p>But running it just gives an error:</p>

internal error: entered unreachable code: Clap should make this impossible
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>But that appears to be more an issue with the <code>uv generate-shell-completion powershell</code> as that option is not listed in the help/documentation?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh
In <code>uv tool upgrade</code>, <code>--upgrade</code> is enabled by default. However, why not remove both <code>--upgrade</code> and <code>--no-upgrade</code> from <code>uv tool upgrade</code>?
After all, it seems odd for an upgrade tool to have a flag that doesn't upgrade or to explicitly mention upgrading.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a little bit of a pain. We have a common <code>ResolverInstallerArgs</code> struct for arguments that are shared across commands, and <code>--upgrade</code> is inherited from that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just my $0.02, but I think -n/--dry-run is a better flag for it. It's more in line with how other tools handle it, plus it can be a common flag for other sub-commands as well (e.g. install, uninstall, etc).</p>
<p>Having an option to just list outdated packages would be very useful though, at least for my use-case. I have a script that uses ecosystem-specific tools for various platforms to check for and list all outdated packages. I like to see everything that can be upgraded before actually doing it, just in case it's not necessary or it might take a while and bog down resources.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also <strong>miss this!</strong></p>
<p>I have <em>many</em> packages in my <code>uv tool list</code>, but some are <em>very large</em> (coqui-tts, parllama, aider-chat) and I don't want to do a <strong>blind</strong> <strong>upgrade</strong> with <code>--all</code> (time consuming, slow connection, mobile), please <strong>do this</strong> in any way possible:</p>
<pre><code>--outdated
-n | --dry-run
--upgradable
--ignore &lt;package&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe, there is a package to do this?</p>
