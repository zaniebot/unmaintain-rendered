            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get the keyring feature working on my MacOS platform, based on the instructions provided in your user docs. After doing considerable digging, I found the root cause to be a bug in the <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/711">keyring tool</a> itself. This was not an easy problem to find, but I wanted to report it here upstream as well, so there is a record of it.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there is anything that can be done from the <code>uv</code> side, unless someone can come up with a workaround.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to provide some more details around the setup for keyring and how it interacts with <code>uv</code> to make it easier for users to set this up in the future. For example, if you could provide some example CLI commands that could be run, outside of <code>uv</code>, that mirror the underlying implementation so that users can more easily debug problems with their keyring setup, it might help avoid confusion in the future.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve only been using <code>uv</code> for a few days now, but I have to say, other than this one small hiccup, I am very impressed with your tool, the docs, community support, and everything. Keep up the great work!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you so much for the report!</p>
<p>In the long-term, we&#x27;ll probably try to phase out use of the <code>keyring</code> package entirely in favor of something we have more control over. Hopefully that solves the &quot;root cause&quot; of the problem. I&#x27;m hesitant to sink too much time into documenting its behaviors.</p>
<p>You could adopt our test keyring plugin for investigating issues https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/37c25f2a9da329a4870167c778f0403e9e12bbc9/scripts/packages/keyring_test_plugin</p>

<p>Can you provide the username? We&#x27;ll avoid the <code>--creds</code> endpoint then (that&#x27;s fairly new, see #12316)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will test out the keyring plugin as soon as I get some time.</p>
<p>In the interim, how exactly would I provide the username to the keyring query? It wasn&#x27;t exactly clear on how that interaction worked based on the docs.</p>
