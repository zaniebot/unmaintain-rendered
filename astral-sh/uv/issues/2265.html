            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I created a virtual environment with <code>uv</code>, activated it and then I used <code>pip list -u</code> without thinking: the results were unexpected. It took me a while to figure out what was going wrong.</p>
<p><em>Somehow</em> in my mind <code>uv pip != pip</code>, but the created virtual environment would work the same. As in, I could use <code>pip</code> in it. I can make a guess on why this makes sense, but it still took me off guard.</p>
<p>Other than that <code>uv</code> was <em>very nice</em> to work with.</p>
<h1>Reproduction</h1>
<p>Commands:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip list -u  # &lt;--- Checks global Python packages and not in the virtual env
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install numpy  # &lt;--- Installs in global Python, not in the virtual env
</code></pre>
<h1>Possible resolution</h1>
<p>Perhaps it's good to mention this in the readme? For example, in the getting started add a sentence about not mixing uv pip and pip, nor expect the virtual env to be exactly the same as the virtual environment created with <code>venv</code>.</p>
<p>In the virtual environment created by uv you could intercept pip commands and print a warning, but for me documentation would have been sufficient.</p>
<h1>Version &amp; OS</h1>
<p>Windows 11 on uv 0.1.14 (c525fdf2b 2024-03-04)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey! One additional note that might be helpful: if you run with <code>uv venv --seed</code>, we'll include <code>pip</code> in the virtualenv -- we just don't do it by default.</p>
