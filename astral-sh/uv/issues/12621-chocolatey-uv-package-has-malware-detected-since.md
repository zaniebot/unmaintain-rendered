Just try rescanning it in a few days. The UV doesn't have a digital signature. Once it's added to the database in a few days, it's less likely to be flagged as a virus

However, UV also passed the winget-pkgs scan, and coupled with the fact that only a very small number of virus scans detected it, it seems to be a false positive

Yeah unfortunately we can't do anything here, this happens every so often.

@FishAlchemist indeed most probably it is `false-positive`. How do you initiate the rescanning of the package and do you think this will be reflected on the chocolatey page?

@VOVELEE I just clicked **Reanalyze** on VirusTotal to rescan it. I'm not sure about the correct rescan process for Chocolatey, since I barely use it.

Even I run `uv help tool`, my antivirus application （Huorong Internet Security）show this behavior is dangerous, and report uv as an unknown trojan virus.
