# Platform marker for conditional source when in CI

_Issue opened by @baskrahmer on 2025-01-13 17:49_

Hi there! I was wondering if there is some [platform marker](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#platform-specific-dependencies) that only evaluates to `True` when in GitHub Actions, similarly to evaluating `os.getenv('GITHUB_ACTIONS')`. Or I guess more broadly; can environment variables be used as markers?

I don't think so. The platform markers are Python standards, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/
