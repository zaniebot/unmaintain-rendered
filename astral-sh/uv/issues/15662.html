            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think it could have been, or uv wouldn&#x27;t have complained it existed.</p>
<p>e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv tool install ty
Resolved 1 package in 205ms
Prepared 1 package in 695ms
Installed 1 package in 3ms
 + ty==0.0.1a20
Installed 1 executable: ty
❯ uv tool install ty
`ty` is already installed
❯ uv tool install ty@0.0.1a19
Resolved 1 package in 88ms
Prepared 1 package in 629ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 1ms
Installed 1 package in 3ms
 - ty==0.0.1a20
 + ty==0.0.1a19
Installed 1 executable: ty
</code></pre>
<p>The error you&#x27;re seeing happens if <code>ty</code> exists already</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv tool uninstall ty
Uninstalled 1 executable: ty
❯ touch ~/.local/bin/ty
❯ uv tool install ty
Resolved 1 package in 14ms
Installed 1 package in 5ms
 + ty==0.0.1a20
error: Executable already exists: ty (use `--force` to overwrite)
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it got there on your system.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes it existed I actively use ty on daily bases, I had version a19 and there was new version so I tried to update the same way as usual</p>
<p>Now I tried what you did and it&#x27;s even more confusing:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It won&#x27;t upgrade there because you&#x27;ve pinned a specific version at install time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I found the issue while trying now to update uv:</p>
<pre><code>The current executable is at `C:\Users\klo\.local\bin\uv.exe` but the standalone installer was used to install uv to `C:\Users\klo\AppData\Local\com.Langflow\uv`. Are multiple copies of uv installed?
</code></pre>
<p>So this program (Langflow) somehow managed to mess with my global uv</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That indeed sounds like they&#x27;re improperly installed uv such that it wasn&#x27;t isolated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>They added their folder in PATH. Didn&#x27;t cleanup by themselves even after uninstall</p>
