# `uv add` with source specified

---

_Issue opened by @jackrosenthal on 2025-06-05 19:28_

### Summary

It would be nice to specify which index a package should be installed from in `uv add`.  For example, suppose I have:

```
[project]
...

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "myindex"
url = "https://myindex.example.com/simple"
explicit = true
```

When adding a package, I'd like to be able to do something like `uv add --source myindex mypackage`, and get:

```
[project]
...
dependencies = [
    "mypackage>=1.0.0",
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "myindex"
url = "https://myindex.example.com/simple"
explicit = true

[[tool.uv.sources]]
mypackage = { index = "myindex" }
```

To compare with other tools, it appears `poetry` has this functionality with `poetry add --source myindex mypackage`.

We've discussed this as `uv add --index <name>`, but that doesn't work yet.

related to #13874 ?

I was checking if we'd added `--index <name>` support and found a bug, which is tracked in that issue.
