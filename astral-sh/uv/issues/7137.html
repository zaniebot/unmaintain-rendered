            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The base environment of conda is often not something that should be installed into as it can break conda.</p>
<p>It appears you can detect if the base environment is currently activated if <code>CONDA_PREFIX_1</code> is not set and/or <code>CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV</code> is equal to <code>base</code> (on very old versions of conda this was named <code>root</code>) : https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/dev-guide/deep-dives/activation.html#conda-activate</p>
<p>Perhaps worth requiring users to use <code>--system</code> to install into this base conda environment?</p>
