# UV Workspaces examples

---

_@kevinsimper_

Would it be possible to have examples of how to use UV?
Or will links to other examples be the preferred?

The workspaces doc is good, but an example that can be quickly tried would be really useful to better understand the concept.

Here I made one which is a small fastapi example
