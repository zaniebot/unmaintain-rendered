            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I would like to be able to:
<code>uv run enab[tab]</code> to get <code>uv run enable-warp-drive</code></p>
<p>When using <code>uv run command</code> instead of activating the virtual environment and using <code>command</code>, many issues with outdated dependencies are avoided, so this is the recommended work-flow. The main down-side I encounter, is that I cannot auto-complete commands that are defined in the <code>[project.scripts]</code> of my <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>I tried on both bash and zsh. I have the relevant <code>eval &quot;$(uv generate-shell-completion zsh)&quot;</code> line in my .zshrc, but still it doesn&#x27;t work for scripts. It works fine for paths, e.g. I can auto-complete <code>uv run src/spaceship/cli/enable_warp_drive.py</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this issue will become useful to even more people if #5903 is implemented, as that will add a second section where scripts can be defined. But it is already very useful now, in projects withere <code>project.scripts</code> is used.</p>
Example
<p>I have prepared a repo for reproduction:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/TurtleOrangina/spaceship.git
cd spaceship
uv run ena[tab] # does not autocomplete
uv run enable-warp-drive # works when typed out
uv run src/spaceship/cli/enable_warp_drive.py # auto-completes fine
uv run ena[tab] # still does not autocomplete
</code></pre>
<p>The ideal solution in my mind: The auto-completion code that is generated via <code>uv generate-shell-completion</code> could be extended to also auto-complete the defined scripts.</p>
<p>Currently I use a work-around for zsh from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8432">astral-sh/uv#8432</a>#issuecomment-2605216865 - this does allow binaries from <code>.venv/bin</code> to be auto-completed - but with the draw-back that it only works once those files are actually created - so with a fresh check-out, where .venv doesn&#x27;t even exist yet, the auto-complete will not work. In the above example code, the first <code>uv run ena[tab]</code> still fails with this work-around, but the second one <code>uv run ena[tab]</code> would work (because we successfully created the .venv with the commands in between).</p>
