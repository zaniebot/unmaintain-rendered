# How do you install dependencies of a particular group?

### Question

Basically the title. I've been using `uv` for the past 6 months and I've just come to realise I don't know how to manage a venv:

```shell
$ uv init foo
$ cd foo
$ uv add starlette
$ uv add --group production uvicorn
$ uv add --dev boto3
$ cat pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    "starlette>=0.47.0",
]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "boto3>=1.38.28",
]
production = [
    "uvicorn>=0.34.3",
]
$ ls -la .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/
boto3/
starlette/
uvicorn/
$ rm -rf .venv/
$ uv venv
$ ls -la .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/
[empty]
$ uv sync --group production
$ ls -la .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/
boto3/
starlette/
uvicorn/
```

What is `boto3` doing there if it was declared for the "dev" group?

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

`dev` is part of `default-groups`, which gets installed by default , see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#default-groups

So then the solution is:

```shell
$ uv sync --no-default-groups --group production
```

And that does the trick:

```shell
$ ls -l .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/
starlette/
uvicorn/
```

Thanks @blueraft
