            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Starting from a state where I don't have a managed copy of Python 3.14 installed. Installing works as expected</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv python install 3.14
Installed Python 3.14.0a5 in 15.92s
 + cpython-3.14.0a5-macos-aarch64-none
</code></pre>
<p>However, immediately running the same command doesn't produce any output</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv python install 3.14
</code></pre>
<p>this is surprising to me: I would expect a &quot;warning&quot; of some sort to tell me that I already have the requested version installed, which is why nothing was done.
Even in verbose mode, there doesn't seem to be a clear indication of that skip</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv python install 3.14 -v
DEBUG uv 0.6.0 (591f38c25 2025-02-14)
DEBUG Acquired lock for `/Users/clm/.local/share/uv/python`
DEBUG Found `cpython-3.14.0a5-macos-aarch64-none` for request `Python 3.14`
DEBUG Using request timeout of 30s
DEBUG Skipping installation of Python executables, use `--preview` to enable.
DEBUG Released lock at `/Users/clm/.local/share/uv/python/.lock`
</code></pre>
<p>Of course in the context of this minimal reprod it is pretty obvious what's happening, but it's a little bit more confusing when running a longer command such as, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv python install 3.14 3.13 3.12 3.11
</code></pre>
<p>and all versions I requested <em>but one</em> appear on the output.</p>
<p><em>update</em>: this second part was resolved in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12124
I'm putting it in quote mode to highlight this fact</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarily, if I try to re-install a version I <em>don't</em> already have, it is also silently skipped</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv python install 3.14t --reinstall
</code></pre>
<p>This time, in verbose mode, the version I asked for is not even mentioned</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv python install 3.14t --reinstall -v
DEBUG uv 0.6.0 (591f38c25 2025-02-14)
DEBUG Acquired lock for `/Users/clm/.local/share/uv/python`
DEBUG Using request timeout of 30s
DEBUG Released lock at `/Users/clm/.local/share/uv/python/.lock`
</code></pre>

<p>Ah ! I wasn't sure if this line was about the requested interpreter found on my system or on the host server !</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah the message for that is, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEBUG Found download <code>cpython-3.12.8-macos-aarch64-none</code> for request <code>Python 3.12.8</code></p>

<p>We can clear things up here though</p>
