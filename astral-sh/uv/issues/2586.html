<p>No, I try &quot;uv pip install ultralytics&quot; for three times but it comes out the same error. I install pandas with uv successfully:</p>
<pre><code> uv pip install pandas

<p>This is a new conda env, all I do was :</p>
<pre><code>conda create -n yolo python=3.10
uv pip install ultralytics
uv pip install ultralytics

<p>In my case, UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=1 solved the issue.
I think we can confidently say the slow downloading causes this error.
In my case, I guess my index server is not fast enough to handle many concurrent connections.</p>
