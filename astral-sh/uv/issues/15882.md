# `uv tool run` fails to use GitHub repo

---

_Issue opened by @Winand on 2025-09-15 20:57_

### Summary

I've tried to run a couple of projects from GitHub and I always get an error:
```
  × Failed to resolve `--with` requirement
  ╰─▶ Git operation failed
```

Then I've tried a command from uv [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#requesting-different-sources) `uvx --from git+https://github.com/httpie/cli httpie` with the same outcome:
```

Do `git clone` and `git fetch` work? (I've never seen this before, so maybe something is wrong with your `git` command)

I'm so sorry! I have TinyWall installed and it has been blocking connection.
