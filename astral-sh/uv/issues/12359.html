            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Recently in our CI we started to experience somewhat frequent failures due to <code>broken pipe</code>  errors when pulling big artifacts from PyPI. Particularly <code>pyspark==3.5.5</code> which is 320  MB to pull: https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/#files</p>
<p>While this is of course a problem of the infrastructure (either PyPI or GH actions), it should be relatively easy (I guess) to introduce a retry mechanism in case of broken pipe - which is very likely transient error.</p>

<p>Maybe adding a retry count information when it finally fails will be able to pin-down the problem better:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there is a bit more to the issue than just showing the retry. Let me explain a bit more context, maybe it will allow to find a better remedy or implement some workarounds.</p>
<p>I have just sped up the tests of Airflow to run &quot;slices&quot; of tests with lower-resolution tests and it seems that the issue started happening more frequently, and my guess it might have something to do with an &quot;aggressiveness&quot; of <code>uv</code> downloads, triggering errors on the PyPI side when too many requests for the same, big files to download are run nearly in parallel..</p>
<p>We have more than 90+ providers in Airlfow and we run a set of tests (massively parallel in GitHub actions) where for each provider we run <code>uv sync --resolution lowest</code> - to make sure that our provider's lower-bound dependencies are good. As mentioned - the https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/48696 split our 90+ sequentially (in up to 4 separate containers per runnr) parallell test runs of  essentially <code>uv sync --resolution lowest-direct &amp;&amp; uv run pytest</code>. The <code>uv sync</code> in each of those runs takes a lot of time - because each provider has it's own set of dependencies, and often it means that the lowest dependencies there have to be downloaded and built, because essentially only the &quot;highest&quot; dependencies are already in the cache/installed in the image. So caching can't help with speed-ups here too much.</p>
<p>The PR above added further split - the whole list of 90+ providers is split into 5 slices, and they are run in paralllel. Additionally, those jobs are multiplied by a number of Python versions (3.9 - 3.12 currently) - so we have essentially 20 parallel jobs like that each of them with 4 containers doing essentially <code>uv sync</code> on some providers of airlfow at the same time on 20 different machines. I <strong>think</strong> that is what triggers the issue, as it seem to start happening more frequently when I run it. Sometimes even it happen in bursts - i.e. multiple jobs running on separate Github runners get affected about the same time.</p>
<p>You can see it for example here (if you look at all the jobs - they all failed, and all of them failing on trying to retrieve <code>pyspark</code> or <code>pydruid</code>: https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/14232431820/job/39885872511</p>

</code></pre>
<p>So the question is - can we somehow increase the retry time, get more exponential back-off kick-in in those cases or maybe get some less &quot;aggressive&quot; behaviour in those specific jobs ?</p>
<p>I understand it's not likely <code>uv</code> fault - it just tries to do things as fast as possible (which is the whole point of <code>uv</code> :)) - but also we need to recognize the fact that maybe some scenarios like that can hammer pypi and fastly in front of it a bit &quot;too&quot; hard, and maybe there should be a way to tune it down (or maybe there already is?)</p>

<p>Of course, we just want to show the retry properly so we can easily tell if we're retrying as we should. I moved that to another issue https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12602</p>
<p>You could lower <code>UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That definitely works better now when we mounted host directory as a <code>~/.cache</code>  - I proposed to update the docs to mention the case in #12676 - so that others can discover it more easily, but other than that it can be closed (the #12602 is still nice to have anyway though)</p>
