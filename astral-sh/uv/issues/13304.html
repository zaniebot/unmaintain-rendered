            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am looking for options to archive my dependencies' distributions, primarily for bundling reproducible scientific workflows for archival and distribution.</p>
<p>I see some discussion about functionality like <code>venv-pack</code> or <code>conda-pack</code> (#8653, #6970), but they seem to be primarily about archiving the extracted virtual environment.</p>
<p>I think another solution could provide a lot of the same benefits, including supporting airgapped installs, without the need for solving the various arcane problems involved in bundling and relocating entire virtual environments: the ability to bundle the <em>distributions</em>, optionally also including the wheels built from sdists. The basic idea has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A command, maybe <code>uv download</code> or a new option for <code>uv export</code>, that copies the distributions from the cache into a specified directory, for either the current platform or all locked platforms.</li>
<li>An option to <code>uv sync</code> that uses the files from the exported directory (possibly just pre-seeding them into the cache).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Preparing the archive:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv download --all-platforms -o dist/dependencies/
248 distributions downloaded
</code></pre>
<p>Installing from archive:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv sync --dist-archive dist/dependencies
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the downloaded archive would be in structure the same as a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#flat-indexes">flat index</a>, so, all that's needed for installing it is a flat index pointing at that directory, right? Can a flat index be specified on the CLI?</p>
<p>Separately, as noted in the linked <code>pip downlaod</code> discussion, is it perhaps more appropriate to provide the equivalent of <code>pip wheel</code> (or at least a flag for it) since it builds wheels for packages which don't come with a pre-built one.</p>
