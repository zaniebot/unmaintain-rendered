            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>After a lot of painstaking tests, I can conclude that <code>uv lock</code> always loads the user&#x27;s personal <code>~/.config/uv/uv.toml</code>, which means that projects <code>uv.lock</code> can become poisoned with the user&#x27;s own custom PyPI mirror. Thereby generating a <code>uv.lock</code> with non-trusted URLs and package hashes.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~/.config/uv/uv.toml</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[[index]]
url = &quot;https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple&quot;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Project&#x27;s <code>pyproject.toml</code> cannot override this. <code>uv lock --show-settings</code> reveals that the custom mirror is always included.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting another <code>uv.toml</code> in the repo which forces the URL to be PyPI.</li>
<li>Forcing URLs with <code>uv lock --upgrade --index-url &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;</code> and <code>uv lock --upgrade --default-index &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;</code></li>
<li>Adding a <code>pyproject.toml</code> rule to default to PyPI (still doesn&#x27;t do it):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pypi&quot;
url = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;
default = true
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>only</strong> thing that seems to work is <code>uv lock --upgrade --no-config</code> but <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--no-config">according to the docs</a>, that also makes it ignore all custom config rules inside pyproject.toml, which is not what I want.</p>
<p>What we need for safety and consistency is a way to configure <code>pyproject.toml</code> to tell it &quot;always generate uv.lock based on PyPI, not the user&#x27;s local mirrors&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We&#x27;re planning to support the reverse feature: You can use PyPI URLs in the lockfile, but set a setting that instead resolves and installs with the base URL replaced on your machine. See <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6349">astral-sh/uv#6349</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11782">astral-sh/uv#11782</a>. I think this broadly a duplicate of #6349 and #9056.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Thank you so much for the analysis and links to related ideas. I had a look at the linked requests.</p>
<p>The most desirable outcome would be that <code>uv.lock</code> always uses PyPI URLs and hashes (configured via some <code>pyproject.toml</code> field to mark pypi as the &quot;ground truth&quot; that must be used for generating lockfiles), and then the user&#x27;s local-machine is free to use local mirrors on their own base machine.</p>
<p>It basically works like that already; users can currently override the index of the lockfile via <code>uv sync --default-index &quot;foo&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is the ability to force the <code>uv.lock</code> to ignore the user&#x27;s local repos and always use the repos defined in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. It could be added with a config setting. The only thing I am unsure about is whether users should then be forced to manually define PyPI&#x27;s repo in the pyproject.toml or if it should be auto-inherited via uv. I think people will want the ability to exclude PyPI entirely, so a design like this would make sense:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
strict-lockfile-indexes = true

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pypi&quot;
url = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;
default = true

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pytorch-cuda&quot;
url = &quot;https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128&quot;
explicit = true
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Second this, it would be great if we could explicitly force uv to disregard the user&#x27;s ~/.config/uv/uv.toml file, and exclusively use the indices defined in pyproject.toml when resolving dependencies.</p>
<p>Ideally, we&#x27;d be able to configure this by changing a setting in pyproject.toml (something like the example above), as opposed to adding an argument to &#x27;uv lock&#x27; on the command line every time.</p>

<p>To provide some context, we&#x27;re in a situation where uv keeps using an index that I don&#x27;t want it to use, to install transitive dependencies. We don&#x27;t want it to touch that index because it&#x27;s inaccessible to the environment we&#x27;re deploying to, and contains package versions that aren&#x27;t available elsewhere.  However, the index is commonly used outside of this project, so certain team members have the &#x27;forbidden&#x27; index listed in their uv.toml file. So whenever someone runs &#x27;uv lock&#x27; with that index in their uv.toml, we run into this problem.</p>
<p>The only way around this is to explicitly list out all transitive dependencies in pyproject.toml, and force them to the correct index under [tool.uv.sources]. Which works, but isn&#x27;t ideal, and will only &#x27;solve&#x27; the problem for as long as nobody adds another package and runs &#x27;uv lock&#x27;. Either that, or we tell all team members to forever remove the forbidden index from their uv.toml files, even though it&#x27;s a valid index for every other project.</p>
<p>It would be better if we could (optionally) exert more control over which sources uv can and cannot not use, when resolving dependencies for a particular project.</p>
