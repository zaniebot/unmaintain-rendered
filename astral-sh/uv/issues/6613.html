<pre><code>$ uv add &lt;any-package&gt;
warning: Failed to hardlink files; falling back to full copy. This may lead to degraded performance.
If the cache and target directories are on different filesystems, hardlinking may not be supported.
</code></pre>
<p>If uv only has cache in <code>C:\</code>, then I am unable to use uv in <code>D:\</code>, at least with “degraded performance”. This case might be common for Windows machines. For example, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6397">astral-sh/uv#6397</a>#issuecomment-2303368424:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is about the relationship between the cache directory and the drive you&#x27;re installing on. I&#x27;m guessing your cache is not on <code>file:///E:</code>? You can use <code>--cache-dir</code> or <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> to set a different cache directory on <code>file:///E:</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that hard links are not permitted across drives. However, <a href="https://pnpm.io/faq#does-pnpm-work-across-multiple-drives-or-filesystems">pnpm creates multiple stores (one per drive)</a>, solving the issue. Will it be possible for uv?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suppose we could do something like that. It could end up being <em>less</em> efficient sometimes, though, since you duplicate and re-cache any data that&#x27;s used across drives.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This arguably applies on linux too as you can have a mounted secondary drive under some arbitrary path as stated here <a href="https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/712">pnpm/pnpm#712</a>#issuecomment-363295013, I do think using <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> is a reasonable solution in the mean time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also on MacOS as well. I use a separate, case sensitive filesystem for all code project that is different form the fs backing <code>~/.cache</code>.</p>
<p>While this is not mentioned in the pnpm thread, I think users who hits this issue are storing all of their projects in a separate filesystem. Whether it is because of disk space, speed or want to use a different fs. The current behavior is actually less efficient for us because the setup basically disables hard-link dependency deduplication.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So I can simply create <code>uv.toml</code> in the root folder of a disk with contents <code>cache-dir = &quot;D:/.uv/cache&quot;</code>? Do i understand it correctly that uv searches for <code>uv.toml</code> in all parent folders of a project?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/#configuration-files">Configuration files</a>
Specifically, uv will search for a pyproject.toml or uv.toml file in the current directory, or in the nearest parent directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means that uv checks each parent folder until it finds the nearest uv.toml file?</p>

<p>But it won&#x27;t work if you put uv.tool section in pyproject.toml, because uv doesn&#x27;t merge these configuration sources and use pyproject.toml OR the nearest uv.toml file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @maphew, your workaround works perfectly!</p>
<p>May I suggest to add this solution (<code>setx UV_CACHE_DIR &quot;\.uv&quot;</code>) to the <strong>docs</strong> as another Note <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#cache-directory">here</a>?</p>
<p>Though, <strong>for the long term</strong>, I&#x27;d suggest a built-in solution (or maybe <code>\.uv</code> as default?), as this would greatly increase usability in my opinion.
I think it&#x27;s a trade-off between performance (see @charliermarsh&#x27;s concern above) and disk-space; disk-space isn&#x27;t the problem nowadays most of the time, but one of uv&#x27;s core features is performance. So I&#x27;d advocate for duplicate data on different drives in favor of higher performance.</p>
<p>I would imagine a mechanism, that knows the cache-dirs on all drives and first tries to &quot;download&quot; from another drive&#x27;s cache (which should be quite fast), before downloading from external resources if no cache provides the needed resource.
(Or maybe this isn&#x27;t needed at all and it&#x27;s just fine to have one cache per drive completely independent...? <em>+1 for simplicity...</em>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve learned of some related vars for tools and am testing a similar approach with them. It seems to work but I&#x27;m uncertain if this is a good idea  -- uv likely assumes all tools in one dir, so, for example, <code>uv tool list</code> might not be accurate.</p>
<pre><code>UV_CACHE_DIR=\.local\.uv
UV_LINK_MODE=hardlink
UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR=\.local\bin
UV_TOOL_DIR=\.local\uv\tools
</code></pre>
<p>There&#x27;s also UV_INSTALL_DIR which I&#x27;ve left alone as having multiple <code>uv.exe</code> will almost certainly be a problem if they&#x27;re of different versions, or run at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>UV_INSTALL_DIR=%USERPROFILE%/.local/bin
</code></pre>
<p><em>Edit:</em> A caveat with this convention is mapped network drives: uv will create the <code>.local</code> dirs on the server share, and that is definitely a performance hit. Also potentially over time leading to scattered .uv throughout the share tree if the mapped drive is not always using the same root. (If, for example,  <code>pushd \\server\share\path\place</code> is commonly used to map and change dir in one operation and new connections are set to not be remembered.)</p>
