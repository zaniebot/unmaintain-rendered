# Update badge logo SVG

---

_Issue opened by @Onyx-Nostalgia on 2025-08-05 05:58_

### Summary

I am using UV and would like to include a UV badge in my README. I found that the current logo does not match the one in your official docs (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

I have replaced the SVG logo you are using ([/docs/assets/logo-letter.svg](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/docs/assets/logo-letter.svg)).

This type of replacement will allow many users who call your official badge to not have to change anything.
