# maintain line ending in pyproject.toml

_Issue opened by @ghost on 2024-10-25 09:14_

uv --version
uv 0.4.26 (1b9b9d56b 2024-10-23)

Hello, 
when I try to modify pyproject.toml by adding or remove package by uv command, then uv will change the pyproject.toml line ending from CRLF to LF.

This happen to uv.lock too.

It is good to maintain file's line ending after uv has modify the file contents.

Thank you very much
