# Interaction with proxpi tar.gz headers

---

_Issue opened by @cgravill on 2025-03-31 11:04_

### Question

We're using [proxpi](https://github.com/EpicWink/proxpi) with self hosted temporary CI runners to cache pypi.org usage.

I ran into issue with tar.gz files which down to headers and presumably automatic processing in `uv`:
https://github.com/EpicWink/proxpi/issues/67

Poetry has a [similar issue](https://github.com/EpicWink/proxpi/issues/9#issuecomment-1164318555) and there's a workaround. I promised to report it here as it'd be great if it worked with defaults.

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS x86_64

### Version

uv 0.6.9

This is for me clearly a bug in proxpi, I have the same. I don't expect flask to perform any magic.
