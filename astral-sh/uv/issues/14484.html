            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>If a project specifies a dependency without any version bounds, the python version doesn&#x27;t seem to be checked and an invalid version is selected. If a bound (that includes the previously selected version) is added, resolution fails with a python version error.</p>
Minimal example
<p>Given the following <code>pyproject.toml</code></p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;demo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;numba&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>uv tree</code> gives</p>
<pre><code>Resolved 7 packages in 5ms
demo v0.1.0
└── numba v0.61.2
    ├── llvmlite v0.44.0
    └── numpy v2.2.6
</code></pre>
<p>Updating the pyproject.toml to include a bound on the <code>numba</code> dependency (note <code>&gt;=0.61</code> should include the 0.61.2 previously selected),</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;demo&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;numba&gt;=0.61&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p><code>uv tree</code> now fails with a conflict error</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv tree
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split
  │ (python_full_version == &#x27;3.9.*&#x27;):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (&gt;=3.9) does not satisfy
      Python&gt;=3.10 and numba&gt;=0.61.0 depends on Python&gt;=3.10, we can
      conclude that numba&gt;=0.61.0 cannot be used.
      And because only the following versions of numba are available:
          numba&lt;=0.61.0
          numba==0.61.2
      and your project depends on numba&gt;=0.61, we can conclude that your
      project&#x27;s requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: Pre-releases are available for `numba` in the requested
      range (e.g., 0.61.1rc1), but pre-releases weren&#x27;t enabled (try:
      `--prerelease=allow`)

      hint: The `requires-python` value (&gt;=3.9) includes Python versions
      that are not supported by your dependencies (e.g., numba&gt;=0.61.0 only
      supports &gt;=3.10). Consider using a more restrictive `requires-python`
      value (like &gt;=3.10).

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.12, the resolution failed
      for other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting
      your project&#x27;s supported Python versions using `requires-python`.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv realizes that the latest version of numba works on Python 3.12, while resolving an older version for Python 3.9. In <code>uv.lock</code>, you can see that uv has split the resolution for different Python versions:</p>
<pre><code>[[package]]
name = &quot;debug&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
source = { editable = &quot;.&quot; }
dependencies = [
    { name = &quot;numba&quot;, version = &quot;0.60.0&quot;, source = { registry = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot; }, marker = &quot;python_full_version &lt; &#x27;3.10&#x27;&quot; },
    { name = &quot;numba&quot;, version = &quot;0.61.2&quot;, source = { registry = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot; }, marker = &quot;python_full_version &gt;= &#x27;3.10&#x27;&quot; },
]
</code></pre>
<p>As the current Python version is 3.12, numba 0.61.2 can be used, while the older version will be installed on Python 3.9.</p>
<p>We recommend always adding lower bounds to dependencies, to avoid such problems.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, thank you for the quick response and explanation. I think I may have misdiagnosed the problem I&#x27;m actually getting.</p>
<p>In an empty directory</p>
<pre><code>uv init
uv add sparse
uv add numpy
</code></pre>
<p>works fine, whereas</p>
<pre><code>uv init
uv add sparse numpy # fails
</code></pre>
<p>fails with it selecting a version of <code>numba</code> that isn&#x27;t compatible with the python version.</p>
<p>Oddly it works again if you include <code>numba</code> explicitly</p>
<pre><code>uv init
uv add sparse numpy numba # works
</code></pre>
<p>I can open a new issue for that. Feels kind of similar to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6281#issuecomment-2316240724">this one</a> but in this case there <em>is</em> a way of distinguishing between the two resolutions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d suggest adding a constraint somewhere. This is likely just the resolver choosing a certain outcome that isn&#x27;t incorrect, but also isn&#x27;t what you want, so you can provide more information to guide it. (We don&#x27;t respect upper-bounds on <code>requires-python</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some projects, especially in ML, such as ChatTTS and funasr, aren&#x27;t set versions for some dependencies usually in both pypi and repo. I think uv could make it working like pip in such cases by installing/syncing dependencies with current python version or respecting <code>requires-python</code>.</p>
<p>I agree on &quot;always adding lower bounds to dependencies&quot;, but dependencies are from anywhere and other authors may not follow this.</p>
<p>At least, uv could add a warning if there is a dependency without lower bounds.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, adding a lower bound fixes it so I&#x27;m happy for this to be closed but I&#x27;d question &quot;the resolver choosing a certain outcome that isn&#x27;t incorrect&quot; as it&#x27;s selecting a combination that isn&#x27;t valid. It might be a consequence of ignoring python upper bounds. Is there a reason for that decision?</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also a little annoying having to add a lower bound to <code>numba</code> when we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise depend on it directly.</p>
<p>Might just be being picky though as <code>uv</code> has been a great improvement in every other respect so far.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Vonfry You can set constraints for transitive dependencies too (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#constraint-dependencies). uv already tries to determine a good resolution, but sometimes it&#x27;s not possible to tell the better choice algorithmically, where you need to add bounds manually.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s a complex story, the context is in and linked to in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4022">astral-sh/uv#4022</a>.</p>
