# Provide an way to provide Git authentication for `tool.uv.sources`

---

Right now, the credentials either need to be pre-populated in the git credential helper, or hard-coded into the `pyproject.toml`. We should provide a better way to do this.

Maybe https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5734 is the solution.

Hi @zanieb I'm currently experiencing this issue while authenticating with personal access tokens and I would rather not expose this token in source code. Is it possible to respect the [UV_GITHUB_TOKEN](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_github_token) environment variable if trying to access a private repository when credentials are not provided but this variable is set?

This would be greatly appreciated. I tried to use the git credential helper and failed so far. A solution as in [#5734](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5734) would be good, or something similar to the index could already be enough.

For example:
[tool.uv.sources]
httpx = { git = "https://gitlab.com/encode/httpx" , name="HTTPX"}.

UV_SOURCES_HTTPX_USERNAME="username"
UV_SOURCES_HTTPX_USERNAME="password"
or something similar, like:
UV_SOURCES_GIT_HTTPX_USERNAME="username"
UV_SOURCES_GIT_HTTPX_USERNAME="password"

creates:
https://username:password@gitlab.com/encode/httpx

I think Satge's suggestion is very reasonable and consistent with how usernames and passwords are configured for indexes (as per the documentation [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/#authentication)).

I'm not sure if it is not already implemented, but the keyring support would also be nice for the sources.
