# Enabling `--isolated` \ `UV_ISOLATED` as the default option for `uv run`, when testing different Python versions

---

_Issue opened by @pygarap on 2025-08-21 20:13_

### Summary

Enabling `--isolated` \ `UV_ISOLATED` as the default option for `uv run` when used with `UV_PYTHON` or `--python` and a different Python version than the one specified in the `.python-version` file.

I find it inconvenient that when I test my package on different Python versions without using `--isolated` \ `UV_ISOLATED`, it overrides my project's virtual environment with another Python version.

### Example

If my `.python-version` is set to Python 3.13, and I do: `uv run --python=3.12 -- pytest`, it will change my project's virtual environment to use Python 3.12 permanently, and not just for this single `uv run`.

Hi! I also think it's a good idea.

If we do that, though, would there still be a way for users to get the current behavior (switch their venv permanently to another python version, without changing the .python-version for everyone)?
I haven't found the opposite of "--isolated"...

I think that's important to keep this, because some users might always prefer to use "uv run" with a different python version that the one in .python-version.
