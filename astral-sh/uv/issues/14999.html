            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I brought this up in the Discord chat, so I'll put my thoughts here.</p>
<p>It would make it much simpler to manage build environments for packages that otherwise require <code>--no-build-isolation</code>. Rather than maintaining separate <code>requirements.txt</code> files for each package and managing the environments manually, the necessary deps can be listed in <code>uv.toml</code>, and then <code>uv</code> handles all of the environment management in the build process automatically.</p>
<p>My main reason for requesting this is because I use <code>uv</code> to pre-build several wheels for internal use, one of which is <code>flash-attn</code>. <code>flash-attn</code> has pretty steep hardware requirements for its build process, so avoiding on-the-fly builds is really beneficial. Likewise, and most importantly for me, I build <code>llama-cpp-python</code> using a package containing pre-built ggml libraries, and this is required in the build for <code>llama-cpp-python</code>, so I'm able to use the <code>extra-build-dependencies</code> table to inject the prebuilt libraries without modifying <code>llama-cpp-python</code> myself.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems setting <code>extra-build-dependencies</code> in <code>uv.toml</code> works for some build backends (<code>scikit-build-core</code>, <code>maturin</code>) and does not for others (<code>poetry-core</code>, <code>setuptools</code>)</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Another thought, but this would be helpful when using uv with cibuildwheel in GHA since linux wheels are typically built using containers</p>
