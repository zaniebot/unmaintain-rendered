# Wiki?

_Issue opened by @rosmur on 2024-10-20 15:50_

uv is great! But the documentation on astral.sh is insufficienct. A recent example: I was trying to figure out how to use uv to setup a venv in a repo that came with a pyproject.toml. I had to google it instead. Could we make a wiki here on the github page? And allow community contributions? I'd be happy to make & populate a wiki as I am starting off using and getting familiar with uv.

You're welcome to contribute to the documentation; its source is all here. We're not likely to have a wiki — I don't see what benefit we'd get from separating that from the official documentation.
