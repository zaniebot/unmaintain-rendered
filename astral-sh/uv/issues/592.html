            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's in some ways the only way to get editable installs for local dependencies going. It's also what PDM recommends: https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/advanced/#use-pdm-to-manage-a-monorepo</p>
<p>One hilarious challenge here is that this feeds into a URL usually, which actually causes issues very quickly (eg: backslashes vs slashes, spaces, drive letters etc.).</p>
<p>In Rye I hacked around this by special casing <code>PROJECT_ROOT</code>. Ideally none of this is needed. https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye/blob/92b571bfd42e5748d2e535174d78fc7311a889a3/rye/src/lock.rs#L413-L421</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Doing this today. The only hard part is ensuring that we preserve the environment variable when writing the lockfile. (I'm also going to limit this to URLs for now intentionally.)</p>
