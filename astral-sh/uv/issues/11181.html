            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi,
not a code/feature related, but support related on third party side.</p>
<p><a href="https://snyk.io/">SNYK</a> is a cloud native security platform, it can check the version of installed packages and report vulnerabilities. At the moment it has no support for <code>uv</code> which is understandable as its new.
Currently they <a href="https://docs.snyk.io/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks#package-managers-and-frameworks">support</a> poetry.lock and pipenv.lock. Adding  uv to the list might be beneficial for both, considering how fast uv gains on popularity.</p>
<p>Can you consider trying to reach out to them to support uv.lock files ?
Personally i wrote a question to their support, but a question from the authors might be a good motivation also.</p>
<p>For us at the moment is a blocker to migrate to <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>Edit: they confirmed not supporting it, forwarded to the product owner (so any support on the issue is welcome), either from community (express your need for it if you use their services) or from developer side.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since switching our dependency management from Poetry to uv last year, maintaining Snyk support in our project has become inconvenient. We currently rely on <code>uv export --format requirements-txt &gt; requirements.txt</code> to generate our requirements file. It would greatly improve our workflow if Snyk could support uv-exported files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>we have the same issue, using requirements.txt instead of lock file in snyk has disadvantage that it loses on the dependency tree, so i would like to see snyk work with the uv universal lock files</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have the same issue and i came uppon this thread while googling.
Would be great if uv and snyk would work together but isn't this a snyk related topic?</p>

<p>This one is just for reference so that snyk can track, whereas <code>pyproject.toml</code> is still used for majority of use cases.</p>

<p>Another option for those defining in <code>pyproject.toml</code>  is <code>uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt</code>
Also hoping snyk starts to support the <code>uv.lock</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know our account manager has added us to the list of paying customers wanting this, but I'm weighing in here to add to the crowd hoping Snyk add support for uv</p>
<p>We are a platform team maintaining a huge number of Python repositories and I've got us to accept we'll move from good 'ol pipenv (plus a few poetry) to uv</p>
<p>Renovate is doing a great job of updating dependencies since they added uv support so I'd much prefer a proper solution from Snyk than the workaround of creating a requirements file (and that's sort of ok in CICD pipelines but not when you want to use Snyk in your ide).</p>

If you're a paying customer of Snyk, you should definitely reach out to your contact/account manager there and advocate directly to them, because they almost certainly aren't monitoring this issue.</p>
