Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>When running
<code>python -m uv pip install --system --prerelease=allow -r pyproject.toml</code></p>
<p>I am hitting the error:</p>
<pre><code>error: Cannot uninstall package; 
RECORD file not found at: C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages\catboost-1.2.2.dist-info\RECORD
</code></pre>
<p>Which seems to be a common error in other installation systems (ie. not <code>uv</code> specific):</p>
<p>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68886239/cannot-uninstall-numpy-1-21-2-record-file-not-found</p>
<p>That said, if <code>uv</code> has any mitigation for this - that'd be great.</p>
<p>Using uv 0.1.16 on Windows 11</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure what caused it, It may be that I killed a process mid-way through a pip install (I'm cautiously moving from pip to uv these days).</p>
<p>I tried pip uninstalling catboost (which succeeded) but the issue remained when re running <code>uv pip install</code></p>
<p>The solution was to navigate to</p>
<p>C://Users/{USER}/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/Lib/site-packages/</p>
<p>and <code>rm -r catboost-1.2.2.dist-info/</code> which was empty</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, now the issue with catboost is solved, but I hit the same issue with matplotlib</p>
<p>error: Cannot uninstall package; RECORD file not found at: C:\Users\mkleinbort\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib\site-packages\matplotlib-3.8.2.dist-info\RECORD</p>
<p>(The matplotlib-3.8.2.dist-info/ folder is empty - even without running pip uninstall)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, mostly managed to reproduce the issue</p>
<ol>
<li>When running uv pip install to install a newer version of a package</li>
<li>and I hit the error described here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1491#issuecomment-1983615072</li>
<li>When I re-run the uv pip install I hit the error described here on the package on which the error (2) was hit</li>
<li>So I go and manually delete the {package}-dist-info/</li>
<li>now that package installation succeeds, but I hit the https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1491#issuecomment-1983615072 somewhere else and it continues so</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this will succeed once for all the packages and then become a quicker way to install new versions than pip</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, just FYI - it did work after 42 runs and re-runs of uv pip install</p>
<p>But it was worth it - now my &quot;update dependencies&quot; workflow has gone down from 4 minutes (via pip) to basically nothing</p>
