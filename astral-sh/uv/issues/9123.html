            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Today I was presented with a problem that <code>--exclude-newer</code> managed to resolve.  The package was unmaintained for two years, and entirely unpinned.  It was impossible to install without <code>--exclude-newer</code>.  However what also was needed is that an older Python version was required as some of the dependencies did not run on 3.12.</p>
<p>I was thinking at that moment that it would have been nice if <code>uv</code> would have warned me that I'm using a Python that did not exist at that timestamp yet.</p>
<p>(Also slightly related, the primary user of that problem was not me, but my wife and she was unaware of <code>--exclude-newer</code>.  I am also curious if when presented with build/install errors and largely unconstrained source dependencies and some inkling that the package is really old, could suggest to the user that <code>--exclude-newer</code> might be a way to make an old package installable)</p>
