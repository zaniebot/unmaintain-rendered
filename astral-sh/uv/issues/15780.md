# Allow enabling pre-releases per index

---

_Issue opened by @stretch4x4 on 2025-09-10 23:34_

### Feature Request

Ability to set prerelease behaviour per index.
Unsure if this should be on the command line, in a config or via pyproject.toml (possibly all 3) but any of those would be a great start.

### Original question / Use case

We wan to use `--prerelease=allow` when rebuilding a lockfile in our test runs to test our latest dev packages from our internal index.
However we don't want any pypi packages to use pre-releases unless necessary so that we reduce the number of build failures from external sources.

I can't currently see any method of doing this but I am not sure if I am just missing something or it's undocumented.

Thanks

### Platform

Windows 11 x86_64, Ubuntu 20.04 / 24.04 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.7.5

Currently, prereleases can't be activated in a per-index basis.

Thanks for confirming, I will have to convert this to a feature request at some stage 👍

Thank you @zanieb, I assume with that label and title change I should leave this open as a feature request rather than closing it?

Cheers :)
