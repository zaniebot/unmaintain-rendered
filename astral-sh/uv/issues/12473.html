            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>While trying to find a workaround for using uv with conditionally accessible git submodules, I discovered the following. If a workspace member is present in two locations, the latter is used. In the example below, <code>dir_b/foo</code> would be locked against.</p>
<pre><code>[project]
dependencies = ['foo']

[tool.uv.sources]
members = ['dir_a/*', 'dir_b/*']
</code></pre>
<pre><code>dir_a/
     foo/...
dir_b/
     foo/...
pyproject.toml
</code></pre>
<p>This actually works very well for my use case since I can introduce a fallback if the real package is not accessible to a user. Before adopting this approach, I wanted to confirm that this behavior is at least not considered a bug and is unlikely to change suddenly. I could see an argument that this edge case should instead raise an error.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I consider this behavior a bug, uv should error in this case. The order in which a workspace is discovered isn't fixed, and generally we error when we find a package twice with different URLs for the same platform (e.g. in <code>requirements.txt</code>).</p>
