            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a ML project repo that is created by uv. Now, I’m trying to merge an eval folder from <a href="https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME/tree/main/eval">another repo</a> to my main repo created by uv, so that other people can reproduce my numbers. However, I need to use separate virtual envs to run different benchmarks’ evaluation scripts because the math parsing dependencies are different (as stated in their repo).</p>
<p>Can I put multiple venv under the same project? Or is there better way to handle the situation where two different versions of a package are needed for different python scripts in the project?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.8.0</p>
