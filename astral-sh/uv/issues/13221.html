            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<pre><code>% uv self update
warning: Self-update is only available for uv binaries installed via the standalone installation scripts.

If you installed uv with pip, brew, or another package manager, update uv with `pip install --upgrade`, `brew upgrade`, or similar.
</code></pre>
<p>Labeling this message as a warning is misleading.   The command didn't update uv because I had not installed via the standalone installation, so this is actually an error.  A warning should mean, &quot;I did the thing, but you should be aware of....&quot;</p>
<p>TBH, I wouldn't be a fan of labeling it &quot;error&quot; exactly either, since that sounds like something bad happened.  Perhaps a message that indicates what happened:</p>
<pre><code>Self-update is only available for uv binaries installed via the standalone installation scripts.  Nothing updated.

If you installed ... etc.

<p>I do think &quot;error&quot; is appropriate for consistency with the rest of the CLI, because the intent of the user (to perform an update) was not achieved and we exit with a non-zero code.</p>
