# Add Option to Specify Disk or Server for python-build-standalone Download

---

_Issue opened by @darjeeling on 2025-01-10 05:48_

When acquiring python-build-standalone through uv, it would be beneficial to have an option that allows specifying a disk or particular server for downloads. This is crucial for environments with security or compliance requirements or when direct internet access is unavailable.

While PyPI packages can be installed using a PyPI proxy and uv can be installed via download, there currently isn't an option to direct python-build-standalone installations from a local disk or pre-downloaded web server location. This feature would be especially useful for simultaneous installations across many machines or in educational settings like classrooms.

Is it possible to implement such an option?

Is UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR?
