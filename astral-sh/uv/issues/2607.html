            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv venv</code> accepts  a <code>--python</code> flag that allows the user to specify a path to a particular Python interpreter or version if it is already installed on the machine. I would like for <code>uv</code> to install and manage Python for me, similar to <code>conda create --name env-name python=3.9</code>.</p>
<p>I am really enjoying using <code>uv</code> so far. Keep up the good work!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just want to chime in to say that I'm evaluating <code>uv</code> right now and my big question was whether and how it would handle installing Python itself. This is embarrassing, but I've been a Python developer for over a decade. I've used pip, virtualenvwrapper, Python 2 and 3, poetry, and more.</p>
<p>Whenever somebody tells me I have to use a specific version of Python, it sucks the life right out of me. I know there are tools for this. I know I use pip or poetry. I know I'm going to lose an hour figuring it all out, just like last time....</p>
<p>So, from my perspective, as a long-time Python dev, but an occasional installer of Python, I'd love to see this!</p>
<p>Thank you for the great tool. Impressive stuff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! There's now &quot;preview&quot; support for fetching and managing Python toolchains for you. I'll be working on documentation for the feature this week and there's quite a bit of work to be done before it's production-ready, but <code>uv venv --preview --python &lt;version&gt;</code> can now download missing versions for you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb It's awesome, I tried it out, and everything works fine.
But I found it required <code>py</code> launch while using <code>py --list-paths</code> to find Python installations.</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run -q -- venv --python 3.10.11 --preview -v
warning: `C:\Users\Test\.cargo\config` is deprecated in favor of `config.toml`
note: if you need to support cargo 1.38 or earlier, you can symlink `config` to `config.toml`
DEBUG Searching for Python 3.10.11 in search path, `py` launcher output, or managed toolchains
DEBUG Searching for managed toolchains at `C:\Users\Test\AppData\Roaming\uv\data\toolchains`
  x The `py` launcher could not be found.
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible to use a <code>--standalone</code> parameter to manage standalone Python downloads. And while using <code>--standalone</code> it won't using <code>py --list-paths</code> to find Python installtions. In this way, <code>uv</code> will create venv by using standalone Python without <code>py</code> launch.</p>

<p>I think this line is the best thing which has happened to the Python ecosystem in the last 10 years, please advertise it and put it in huge texts, it's amazing!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! There's https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/#viewing-python-installations maybe we could include it there. Ideally you just use <code>uv run</code> and don't even need to make a virtual environment yourself!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm always setting up a venv for every single one of my projects, and I think it's a best practice among Python devs. It's great to hear that I can get rid of pyenv + .python-version files with the new uv versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hyperknot uv creates venvs automatically. I don't think any of the higher-level commands (the stuff released in 0.3.0, i.e. everything except <code>uv pip</code> and <code>uv venv</code>) work without one.</p>
<p>You <strong>can</strong> make a venv manually before running <code>uv add</code>, <code>uv run</code>, etc, but you don't <strong>need to</strong> - it gets created automatically.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; uv init
Initialized project `uv-test`
&gt; uv add cowsay
Using Python 3.12.4
Creating virtualenv at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 213ms
Prepared 1 package in 25ms
Installed 1 package in 5ms
 + cowsay==6.1
&gt; uv run python -m cowsay -t hello
  _____

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But I'm not getting something. I don't want to init and add, that's the easy part. I want a reproducible dev environment, which cleans up and sets everything up for me.</p>
<p>Here is the file I'm using in all my projects, I call this file with <code>source</code> or <code>.</code>. Every time I modify the dependencies, I just run it, it runs super fast, thanks to uv.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

find . -name &quot;*.egg-info&quot; -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name .ipynb_checkpoints -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name .pytest_cache -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name .ruff_cache -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name .DS_Store -exec rm -rf {} +


rm -rf .venv

uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip -V
uv pip install -e .

cd js_tools
pnpm i
cd ..
</code></pre>
<p>+ I pair it with direnv so that it auto-activates when I'm inside the directory.</p>
<p>How would alternative <code>uv</code> commands help me in this?</p>
