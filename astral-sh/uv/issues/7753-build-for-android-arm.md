_Issue opened by @bolinocroustibat on 2024-09-28 05:06_

Is there a build or a planned build for Android/ARM type machines?

Thanks for the amazing work.

This is roughly a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2408

It's not a priority for us, it'd require someone from the community to invest in getting things working. I think it does _build_ fine, but things like managed Python versions aren't available yet.
