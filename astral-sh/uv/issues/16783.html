            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>uv python upgrade</code></p>
<p>Reports:</p>
<p><code>There are no installed versions to upgrade</code></p>
<p>The meaning of this message is somewhat ambiguous.  This message could mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>No installed versions of Python were found when trying to upgrade Python.</li>
<li>The Python versions that were found are up to date and don't need to be upgraded.</li>
</ol>
<p>The user should not be left confused about the outcome of the upgrade attempt.  Consider rephrasing this message so the meaning is clearer to a casual user.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Win11</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.9.10</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.11</p>
