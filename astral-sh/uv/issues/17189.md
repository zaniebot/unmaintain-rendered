# Support `--no-editable` in pip interface

---

_Issue opened by @pstrzelczak on 2025-12-19 13:02_

### Summary

`--no-editable` is great as it allows to define a tree of editable local projects in monorepo but make a non-editable install for production environment. It would be great to have it available in `uv pip` interface.

### Example

_No response_

What would this look like? e.g.,

```
uv pip install -e ./foo --no-editable
```

is pretty weird?

but I think that's the approximate expectation here?

@zanieb actually my intention is same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/17155 i.e. be able to install all path dependencies as editable in development mode and non-editable for production. It could be achieved either via (1) specifying all path dependencies as editable (`editable = true`) in pyproject.toml and have `--no-editable` in pip interface or (2) have path dependencies defined WITHOUT `editable = true` but have `--editable` option to make all (including transitive) path dependencies installed as editable. I slightly lean towards (2) alone or both options to be available in uv pip interface but I leave it to uv maintainers to decide.

@zanieb when do you plan to integrate attached commits to main branch?
