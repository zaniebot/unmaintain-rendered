# Installing UV on root

---

_Issue opened by @ErichMarx on 2025-04-22 09:05_

### Question

Hi,
Pardon my lack of Linux experience in advance...

I'm trying to get UV installed on my Linux machine to make it available to all other users.

The below command will install it on the correct dir, but fail to move files from tmp to the specified dir. (Even with sudo)
`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local/bin" sh` 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fac89f9-9bb1-4231-863d-cbf0c817e896)

As /usr/local/bin requires extra privileges, would uv ever be able to self-update if the installation succeeds?
Any idea how I could achieve this?

Thanks a lot :)

### Platform

Linux 5.14.0-503.22.1.el9_5.x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

0.6.16

The sudo needs to be after the pipe:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local/bin" sudo sh
```

To get this working, I needed to also tell sudo to use the specific environment:
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local/bin" sudo -E sh
```
