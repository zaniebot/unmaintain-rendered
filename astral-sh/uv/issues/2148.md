# uv doesn't read pip.ini on Windows

---

_Issue opened by @RichardDally on 2024-03-04 09:39_

Hello folks,

I would like to use `uv` in my company that is using an Artifactory private repository instead of official Pypi.
pip is properly configured (through pip.ini variant "user") and works well.

Steps :
- installed `uv` version `0.1.12` on `Windows` OS.
- created a venv using `uv venv`
- activated with `.venv\Scripts\activate` then tried to install a package `uv pip install pandas`.

`uv` keeps trying to download from official Pypi over internet rather than reading my configuration and terminates after a while (when all retries fail).
