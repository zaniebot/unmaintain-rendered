            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In the current state of uv, uv tool list shows the version of the tool that was installed , but I do not know which python was used to install that tool</p>
<p>Having the python version displayed along with the tool name and version would be helpful.</p>
<p>The issue I ran into was sys.path of a file called with the tool was using the python version that installed the tool (because I didnt specify it) and uv resolved it to using the highest python version maintained by it rather than using the system python.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
