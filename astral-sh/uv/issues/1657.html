            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Originally discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1331</p>
<p>The idea here is that <code>pip</code> is confusing to users who also use <code>pip</code>. We could rename <code>uv pip</code> e.g. <code>uvp</code> or <code>uv pkg</code> and make <code>uv pip</code> a hidden alias.</p>
<p>I'd really prefer not to do a lot of bike-shedding over names here. We'll probably make this decision internally. Instead, I'd love to hear if this would improve or degrade your experience as a user.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think using <code>pip</code> as a noun (...verb? both?) here will make people draw parallels which aren't necessarily wanted/helpful when learning the new tool.  Especially if the long term goal is for some of the functionality of <code>rye</code> to make its way over to <code>uv</code> (and the hierarchy of commands to be heavily influenced by <code>cargo</code>), it's probably better to stick to terms which don't require you to think &quot;Oh, pip...so it's something to do with installing packages into this environment...but it isn't pip?&quot;.</p>
<p>Possibly an overcorrection, but is there an argument that all the things currently living under <code>pip</code> could be under <code>venv</code>, in that they are commands which manipulate the local virtual environment. (<code>venv create</code> -&gt; make a virtual environment. <code>venv sync</code> -&gt; synchronise packages into the virtual environment. etc.)</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment. I don't like <code>uv pkg</code> personally, but it had been proposed elsewhere. Here, it's just a placeholder for the idea of continuing to using a subcommand instead of a new base command i.e. <code>uvp</code>.</p>

<p>We generally don't think of it as a verb here, we're thinking of it as &quot;this is our <code>pip</code>-compatible interface&quot;. We'll be populating the rest of the <code>uv</code> namespace with commands that are designed the way <em>we</em> think they should be rather than striving for compatibility with old interfaces.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like <code>uv pip</code>. To basically any Python user in 2024, it's clear how the subcommand is roughly expected to behave and how to start using it, which isn't as true of a subcommand like <code>uvp</code>. It's been easy for my muscle memory.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by mjclarke94's suggestion of moving commands under <code>uv venv</code> (for where the command &quot;should&quot; live in a blank slate design) and adding <code>uv venv create</code>. With the exception of <code>uv pip compile</code>, all the <code>uv pip</code> commands are all low-level mutation or description of a venv. When uv introduces high level workflow commands, users will hopefully not think much about specific venv and if they do <code>uv venv</code> is a reasonable place to start. You could maybe use <code>uv env</code> to work around the back compat issue (this is shorter and would be more accurate if it optionally lets you do global installs), <code>uv env freeze</code>, <code>uv env uninstall</code> all read quite nicely.</p>
<p>But yeah, a &quot;uvp&quot; that doesn't immediately say &quot;oh this is like pip&quot; and isn't the blank slate design you want, feels a little bit nowhere land to me</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For me the reasoning for keeping all the pip commands under the <code>uv pip</code> namespace was clear, and didn't really lead to any confusion. I might decide to alias it on my end to something like <code>uvp</code>, but making it clear that this subcommand is aiming at replicating (a subset of) the pip API is pretty good reasoning. If this were a poll I would vote for keeping things as-is.</p>
<p>EDIT: actually answering the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd love to hear if this would improve or degrade your experience as a user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wouldn't really have made a difference either way. It's true that if somebody wasn't reading the documentation <code>uv pip</code> could lead somebody to think that <code>uv</code> is &quot;calling&quot; <code>pip</code> under the hood or something. But the clarity introduced by the combination of the namespace with the reasoning explained in the documentation was enough for me to start working.</p>
<p>I don't think <code>uvp</code> would've degraded my experience though, as it's still showing that it's not a top-level API for uv, rather a subcommand.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just chiming as a new user (congrats a great tool by the way). I was a bit confused initially to read <code>uv pip install</code>, it made me wonder if <code>uv</code> was &quot;simply&quot; calling <code>pip</code> underneath, if I needed <code>pip</code> installed first... I guess I then understood because I had to create a venv with <code>uv venv</code> (though I didn't know if I needed to manually activate it or if <code>uv pip </code>would pick it up on its own). pdm feels like it has a more natural UX here.</p>
<p>In some respect, it comes down to the question &quot;do I need to know anything about virtual env?&quot;. The reason I'm interested in <code>uv</code> is that it's a self-contained binary. Python has a chicken and egg problem when it comes to let users install applications. Users of tools I write don't want to know about venv and pip. They just want to run &quot;COMMAND install TOOL&quot;. To me, more than speed, uv looks like a partial solution to this issue. I can think of asking my users to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>install <code>uv</code></li>
<li>run <code>uv install &lt;tool&gt;</code></li>
<li>run <code>&lt;tool&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. THey wouldn't know anything beyond this. Underneath, <code>uv</code> would take care of creating a shared (or dir-local?) venv and drop whatever I globally install into it.</p>
<p>This is for the use case of an application, not a developer environment of course so this may not align at all with your goals.</p>
<p>Also, it made me wonder about trademark/copyright of the <code>pip</code> name altogether.</p>
<p>Just minor comments in passing.</p>
<p>Cheers again.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey there. I like the <code>uv pip</code> naming. I think it was a good choice to release <code>uv</code> right now - even if it &quot;only&quot; does pip + pip-compile + virtualenv and is not a tool like PDM/cargo/Poetry. So I understand you don't want to create a <code>uv install</code> command that will change behaviour in a very breaking way in 6/9 months.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Something like &quot;uv pip-compat&quot; or &quot;uv pip-cli&quot; or &quot;uv compat&quot; would more clearly convey that the subcommands are there to provide some level of CLI compatibility with existing tools, without actually <em>being</em> those tools (the last example would also allow one subcommand to offer CLI compatibility for multiple tools as long as they had orthogonal command sets).</p>

<p>Someone said that you could think of pip operations as editions of a venv.
<code>uv env install something</code> or <code>uv env list</code> make sense! (if uv is (nearly) always working with a virtualenv of course).

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your work on uv and ruff! I would like to suggest changing the uv pip subcommand name. uv and pip are different tools. uv is not necessarily going to implement the same interface as pip. It feels a bit crummy to write a replacement to another tool and then take its name. I would suggest renaming the subcommand to pkg or something similar that's more descriptive and won't lead to unnecessary confusion. Leaving pip as an undocumented alias makes sense, but I don't think it should be the default name for the package management subcommand.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>-1 on having a second command. I like having everything under the one <code>uv</code> main command.</p>
<p>My concern about using <code>uv pip</code> is that you don't implement a fully pip-compatible interface, and that's a stumbling block for users. Whenever I try out <code>uv</code>[^1] I always get caught out by the lack of <code>uv pip list --outdated</code>, for example. Yes, this will improve over time, but the message here is <em>very</em> confused - if you want to match pip, then <code>uv pip</code> makes a certain amount of sense, but in that case, the <code>uv pip install --resolution</code> option (among others) is out of place as it's not &quot;matching pip&quot; but improving on it. Also <code>uv pip compile</code> and <code>uv pip sync</code> are <em>not</em> pip subcommands, which again causes confusion (in my mind). The <code>uv pkg</code> suggestion makes sense to me, but I can see that it doesn't fit with <code>uv pip sync</code> and <code>uv pip compile</code>. That's precisely because those <em>aren't</em> pip commands, though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We won't do this because we're reserving the root namespace for our own workflow e.g. uv install may be similar to cargo install and install a package into an isolated environment in the global namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's entirely fair, but I presume the implication is that <code>uv pip</code> will remain as the long-term interface to &quot;low level&quot; package management commands. Otherwise, <code>uv pip</code> becomes a particularly nasty &quot;bait and switch&quot;, as people get enthusiastic about using <code>uv</code> as a pip replacement, and then find that they are expected to migrate to the more opinionated workflow commands. So if we assume <code>uv pip</code> is intended to be around for the long term, then I think that's an even better reason to get the naming correct early on.</p>
<p>[^1]: As a pip maintainer, I feel like switching fully would be a bit &quot;off brand&quot;, but the speed <em>is</em> tempting 😉</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With #3272, I suppose <code>uv pip</code> is departing more and more from the original <code>pip</code> CLI. I welcome the addition of <code>uv pip tree</code> anyway 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At this point, I think it's fair to say that we won't be changing the name of this sub-command. I appreciate all of the feedback, but I don't think it ended up being confusing for most users and the breaking change hasn't felt worth it. Although we introduce a few new sub-commands that <code>pip</code> doesn't support, we've also generally been moving closer to compatibility to <code>pip</code> in this interface.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the lack of an alias (or a quick shortcut to make an alias like <code>uv alias pip</code>) provides extra confusion to users.
This is because creating virtual environments the normal way places a <code>pip</code> command in that virtual environment</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Make virtual environment native way
$ python -m venv native_venv
$ ls native_venv/bin
 activate   activate.csh   activate.fish   Activate.ps1   pip  
 pip3       pip3.12        python          python3        python3.12

# virtual environment with uv
$ uv venv uv_venv
$ ls uv_venv/bin
 activate      activate.bat   activate.csh       activate.fish  
 activate.nu   activate.ps1   activate_this.py   deactivate.bat  
 pydoc.bat     python         python3            python3.10
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sympathetic to users getting confused thinking it is &quot;real&quot; pip but the current answer seems to leave the user is a confusing position no matter what.</p>
<p>Could a compromise not be to place a similar <code>pip</code> file within that directory?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cat native_venv/bin/pip
#!/Users/steven/test/native_venv/bin/python3.12
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import re
import sys
from pip._internal.cli.main import main
if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(main())
</code></pre>
<p>All that needs to be changed is that shebang. While it wouldn't be the <code>uv pip</code> it could at least solve some issues like how users might run scripts that use <code>pip</code> in them (such as install scripts). I'd much prefer a way to alias <code>uv pip</code> to <code>pip</code> but this might be a way to at least make everyone (most?) happy.</p>
<p>For anyone that wants this functionality, <a href="https://github.com/stevenwalton/.dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/basic_functions.sh#L97-L112">here's something</a> you can put in your <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.zshrc</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">alias_pip() {
    if [[ $(command -v &quot;uv&quot;) ]]
    then
        PIP_LOC=&quot;$(dirname &quot;$(which python)&quot;)&quot;
        # If you want to only run from the root directory (which .venv) exists
        # in then check with this conditional (allows arbitrary name for .venv)
        #if [[ &quot;${PIP_LOC}&quot; == &quot;${PWD%/}/&quot;*&quot;/bin&quot; ]]
        echo -e &quot;#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\npip() {\n\tuv pip \&quot;\$@\&quot;\n}\n\npip \&quot;\$@\&quot;&quot; &gt; &quot;${PIP_LOC%/}/pip&quot;
        chmod +x &quot;${PIP_LOC%/}/pip&quot;
    fi
}

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Isn't your problem solved by <code>uv venv --seed</code>? This will install pip into your venv.</p>
<p>uv's venv doesn't install pip, so creating a script to point to pip without installing it will often produce an error, no?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. I missed that option.</p>
<p>Though I'll still keep my alias because it is aliasing <code>pip</code> to <code>uv pip</code> and for all cases I've faced that's been acceptable, so I'd rather get the <code>uv</code> benefits.</p>

<p>The issue is when I use someone else's project. Of course there are times where it doesn't work out.
(Though would probably work better by using <code>eval &quot;uv pip $@&quot;</code> or filtering out certain flags, and I have done this)</p>
