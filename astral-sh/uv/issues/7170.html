<pre><code>&gt; uv pip install futures
Resolved 1 package in 19ms
error: Failed to prepare distributions

--- stdout:

--- stderr:
This backport is meant only for Python 2.
It does not work on Python 3, and Python 3 users do not need it as the concurrent.futures package is available in the standard library.
For projects that work on both Python 2 and 3, the dependency needs to be conditional on the Python version, like so:
extras_require={':python_version == &quot;2.7&quot;': ['futures']}
</code></pre>
<p>with uv 0.4.2 the same command goes through without any issues. And regular <code>pip install</code> command succeeds as well.</p>
<p>I agree that the upstream package should specify the Python requirement as specified above but at least we should be able to install an earlier version of <code>futures</code> (3.1.1) that doesn't have the &quot;python&lt;3&quot; requirement.</p>

<p>Do you mean that this changed in newer versions?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems ok to me. You <em>can</em> install <code>uv pip install futures==3.1.1</code> or earlier versions (though the package warns you not to do this). But if you try to build the latest, we fail.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, thanks, did not realize the change in behavior for backtracking. We updated our setup.py, so all good here.</p>
