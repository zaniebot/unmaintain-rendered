Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Currently on <code>uv init</code> a project boilerplate created includes the file <code>.python-version</code>.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of this file, if there are constraints in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>uv.lock</code>?</p>
<p>Is it just for compatibility with tools like pyenv or is there more to it?</p>
<p>I really like how clean project directory became after moving a lot of stuff (like <code>requirements.*</code>) to <code>pyproject.toml</code>. So wonder, if <code>.python-version</code> is really required in two senses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it required for the projects now? I tested by deleting <code>.python-version</code>, and everything works as expected and this file is not recreated with commands like <code>uv run</code>, <code>uv sync</code> and <code>uv lock</code></li>
<li>Since a lot of constraints/pinned versions of things are now in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>uv.lock</code>, maybe if <code>.python-version</code> still plays some important role, its function can be moved to <code>pyproject.toml</code> or <code>uv.lock</code> in future?</li>
</ol>
<p>Asking as a 5-year user of <code>pyenv</code> and <code>.python-version</code>. They are great, but I don't really miss them.</p>
<p>Also, couldn't find peps related to this file.</p>

<p>A <code>.python-version</code> file is not strictly required, but it's useful to have it when developing a project as it allows you to specify the exact Python version you are using to do development. It's different to the <code>requires-python</code> field  - that is the range of Python versions supported by your project.</p>

<p>It matches my intuition and #8247 indeed provides useful context!</p>
