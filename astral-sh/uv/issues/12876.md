# Run script using full path with project venv

---

_Issue opened by @martinandrovich on 2025-04-14 09:18_

### Question

Is it possible to use `uv run /absolute/path/to/some/script.py` and have it use the script's project directory. For example, given a project like:

```text
my_project/
├── scripts/
│   └── foo.py
├── src/
│   └── ...
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
```

I would like to use `uv run /path/to/my_project/scripts/foo.py` virtual environment. I know this is possible with `--directory`.

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

uv 0.6.12 (e4e03833f 2025-04-02)

What is the reason you want to run the script with the absolute path? Is it possible to install the file as `[project.scripts]` and run the file from `.venv/bin/foo`?

It's part of a RPA workflow in Power Automate in which the user passes a path to a script, which is assumed to be part of a `uv` project. These projects are not meant to be installed per se, but are more dev projects.

Also, the scripts are located in `my_project/scripts/` directory and are not part of the package namespace; I tried the `file:///${PROJECT_ROOT}/"` workaround from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9495 to create a self-contained `uv` script, but that only works if the script is executed from the project directory it seems.

This came up recently in another issue. Let me find it...
