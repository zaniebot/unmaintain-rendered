            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First off, congrats on the 0.3.x Release!
I&#x27;ve already started migrating my projects to it!</p>
<p>Right now, if you have an existing project and want to migrate to uv, you have to add all settings an dependencies manually.
I assume adoption of uv could be increased if it was easier to get started.</p>
<p>Therefore it would be great if there was an <code>uv init --from &lt;source&gt;</code> command, e.g. <code>uv init --from poetry</code> or <code>uv init --from requirements</code>.
This option would import the dependencies and any other fields that can be converted from the corresponding configuration source. e.g. pyproject.toml for poetry.</p>
<p>Since poetry uses different version specifiers, this would also require a resolver to convert poetry version specifications into uv version specifications.</p>
<p>Whether it would be a good idea to automatically remove the original poetry definitions from pyproject.toml after conversion or not, I&#x27;m not sure. There are pros and cons.</p>
<p>Additionally, since there might already be a pypoject.toml e.g. when importing poetry dependencies, if the pyproject.toml already exists it would simply be updated instead of being created from scratch.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Totally agree... I actually have this working on a branch and it&#x27;s kind of magical. You can do <code>uv add -r /path/to/pyproject.toml</code> and it translates the Poetry dependency specifiers (but not the configuration, which would be harder). We&#x27;ve just been stuck on figuring out the right API to expose to users.</p>
