# Regarding Space taken my uv

---

_Issue opened by @harsha20032020 on 2025-05-15 20:18_

### Question

Hi, I just wanted to know if there are any commands, etc, to clean unused stuff in UV? right now uv folder takes up to 40 gigs in my .cache and its primarily in a folder called archive-v0, its looks to be a lot of gibberish files.

### Platform

Linux

### Version

0.6.17

There is `uv cache prune` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-cache-prune)

(`archive-v0` is actually, like, all the important stuff. That's where we store the unpacked package files, downloaded from the registry. When we install, we just create pointers (hardlinks) to those files, so that installing the same package in many environments doesn't take up any additional space.)

@charliermarsh that makes sense but i definitely do not have 40 gigs worth of packages across all of my libraries. But ill update this once after running uv cache prune as @konstin suggested.

Also, thanks for UV....probably the best package manager I've used after suffering through conda  and being wayyy faster than venv.

Yeah, the cache purge takes down the space to 25 gigs, I think that's normal. Thanks guys.
