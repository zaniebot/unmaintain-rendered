            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wanted to give a try to <code>uv</code> to see if I like it as a project and dependencies manager. I tried installing it on my Windows 11 PC using the command: <code>powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;</code>
However, I get an error stating that this script contains malicious content and has been blocked by my antivirus software:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5f17a0-b532-4137-8c30-5e194f41d5d9" alt="Image" />
My antivirus (BitDefender) indeed believes this script is malicious:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/813413a9-7585-4efd-aa06-d208242e9303" alt="Image" />
Why does this happen? How can I fix this and install <code>uv</code> on my Windows system?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I remember that the UV team actually couldn't do much about it, so you could try downloading the UV using other tools.</p>
<p>e.g. from PyPi

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Weird. Other tools like <code>pdm</code> and <code>rustup</code> also have installer scripts and I never had problems with them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ShaiAvr Perhaps the downloaded content triggered the virus detection? Since you're using a Windows 11 PC x86-64, this should be the correct link. Could you please scan this file?
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.5.11/uv-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip</p>
<p>Edit:
Since PDM installer is essentially a Python script, it's not typically flagged by virus scanners.
As for Rustup, given its widespread use, I assume many antivirus programs have already scanned and added it to their virus databases.</p>
