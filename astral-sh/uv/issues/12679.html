            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Is it possible astral could mirror the docker images for uv onto dockerhub?</p>
<p>This seems silly but we only have access to dockerhub through the corporate artifactory mirror.</p>
<p>I suspect this is the case at a few F500 places where the github docker repo is still winding through years long approval processes.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I could have sworn someone had asked for this before, but I can't find it.</p>
<p>I'm not particularly excited about mirroring the images, but if there are other requests where this is blocking usage I will consider it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For usage with Gitlab's built-in <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/dependency_proxy/">Dependency Proxy</a>, images currently need to be on dockerhub.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-db/issues/441#issuecomment-2406710186">Trivy opted</a> to start publishing there after Github started enforcing some heavy rate limiting on container image pulls; though we've seen less issues with Github since moving to self-hosted Gitlab Runners.</p>
