# UV exported requirements with editable can't be installed with `pip`

---

_Issue opened by @ion-elgreco on 2024-09-19 08:08_

When exporting the UV lockfile into a requirements.txt with `uv export > requirements.txt`, will not allow you to install it with pip due to this error:

```
ERROR: The editable requirement file:///home/<redacted>/<redacted> (from -r requirements.txt (line 3)) cannot be installed when requiring hashes, because there is no single file to hash.
```

Minimal exported UV requirements.txt:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv export
-e .
aiohappyeyeballs==2.4.0 \
    --hash=sha256:55a1714f084e63d49639800f95716da97a1f173d46a16dfcfda0016abb93b6b2 \

```
**- uv version: 0.4.12**

This is a pip limitation, that is tracked in https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4995. There is a also a related issue for VCS URLs: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6469.

I think you should use `--no-hashes` here (`uv export --no-hashes`).
