### Summary

When installing a version of a library that doesn't support a python version, uv should fail

Simple repro

`uv pip install -r requirements.txt --python-version=3.12`

~~It looks like the `pyproject.toml` in that package doesn't have a `requires-python` field. Instead it has this:~~

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.8,<3.12"
```

~~Could that be the issue here?~~

This package does have a wheel that's ABI compatible with any Python version, i.e., https://pypi.org/project/scale-sensor-fusion-io/0.3.0/#files includes `scale_sensor_fusion_io-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl`

What you're seeing here is that uv ignores upper bounds on Python requirements.
