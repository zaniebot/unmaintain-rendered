# uv 0.5.10 cannot install Polars from git

_Issue opened by @ritchie46 on 2024-12-18 08:52_

`$ uv pip install git+https://github.com/pola-rs/polars.git@00837b8ab9197e44fab9c398699e61e8d611c924#subdirectory=py-polars`

succeeds on `0.5.9`, but fails on `0.5.10`.

```
  × Failed to download and build `polars @
  │ git+https://github.com/pola-rs/polars.git@00837b8ab9197e44fab9c398699e61e8d611c924#subdirectory=py-polars`

        | ^^^^^^^^^
      `pyproject.toml` is using the `[project]` table, but the required `project.version` field is neither set nor present in the
      `project.dynamic` list

```

We don't have a version set,  as that is handled by maturin during build.
