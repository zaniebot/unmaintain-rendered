Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>I found out that when running bash script uv explicitly triggers a creation of a .venv in a project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv run echo &quot;Hello!&quot;
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
</code></pre>
<p>But when I run a python script with declarative dependency definitions it seems to ignore this step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># /// script
# requires-python = &quot;==3.10&quot;
# dependencies = [
#   &quot;click&quot;,
# ]
# ///

print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>the output of <code>uv run -vvv example.py</code> in this case produces some entries that seem relevant:</p>
<pre><code>...
uv_virtualenv::virtualenv Ignoring empty directory
...
        uv_install_wheel::linker::link_wheel_files
Installed 1 package in 1ms
 + click==8.1.7
...
Hello World!
</code></pre>
<p>I am assuming uv does create a temporary virtual environment in this case, however it's not totally evident from the logs.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it safe to have different scripts use different versions of Python and different versions of same packages?</li>
<li>Why does invoking a bash script create a &quot;.venv&quot;? Shouldn't those, basically, also only rely on a temporary venv (if that's the case for scripts)?</li>
<li>If I set require-python to a version of python not allowed by the <code>.python-version</code> file it seems to throw a warning about an unsupported version of python requested. Dropping <code>.python-version</code> file seems to resolve the issue and force uv into installing the necessary version for a script, would there be any downside in doing so?</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Invoking <code>uv run</code> in a project creates an environment for the project. Scripts with inline metadata are always run in an environment isolated from the project.</p>

<p>You can update the <code>.python-version</code> file with <code>uv python pin</code>. You can also drop the file. The downside is that now someone else working on the project may not use the same Python version by default — they'll use whatever the first version compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> specifier is on their system.</p>
