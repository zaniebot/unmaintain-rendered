<p>We need to allow prereleases when there are no stable releases (this used to be the case with black) or if explicitly requested. I think requiring that all requirements for a package must have a version as prerelease to opt-in to prereleases makes most sense, but that might be hard to in pubgrub. E.g. <code>a&gt;=2.0a1,!=3.0</code> and <code>a&gt;=2.0b1</code> would select <code>2.0</code> (and only that version) in prelease mode, while <code>a&gt;=2.0a1</code> and <code>a&gt;=1.0</code> wouldn't. <code>a&gt;=2.0a1</code> and <code>a&gt;=1.0a1</code> is an edge case, but arguably it shouldn't either.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I now understand why this is hard. And reading this Posy comment confirmed what I'm running into:</p>
<pre><code>### Prereleases in specifiers

According to PEP 440, specifiers like `&gt;= 2.0a1` are supposed to
change meaning depending on whether or not the literal version
contains a prerelease marker. So like, `&gt;= 2.0` *doesn't* match
`2.1a1`, because that's a prerelease, and regular specifiers never
match prereleases. But `&gt;= 2.0a1` *does* match `2.1a1`, because the
presence of a prerelease in the specifier makes it legal for
prerelease versions to match.
  
I don't think I can actually implement this using the `pubgrub`
system, since it collapses multiple specifiers for the same package
into a single set of valid ranges, and there's no way to preserve the
information about which ranges were derived from specifiers that
included prerelease suffixes, and which ranges weren't.
  
And if you think about it... that's actually because while this rule is
well-defined for a specifier in isolation, it doesn't really make sense when
you're talking about multiple packages with their own dependencies. E.g., if
package A depends on `foo == 2.0a1`, and package B depends on `foo &gt;= 1.0`, then
is it valid to install foo v2.0a1? It feels like it ought to match all the
requirements, but technically it doesn't... according to a strict reading of PEP
440, once any package says `foo &gt;= 1.0`, it becomes impossible to ever use a
`foo` pre-release anywhere in the dependency tree, no matter what other packages
say. Pre-release validity is just inherently a global property, not a property
of individual specifiers.
  
So I'm thinking we should use the rule:

- If all available versions are pre-releases, then pre-releases are valid
- If we're updating a set of pins that already contain a pre-release,
  then pre-releases are valid (or at least that specific pre-release
  is)
- Otherwise, to get pre-releases, you have to set some
  environment-level config like `allow-prerelease = [&quot;foo&quot;]`.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, we could also support <code>foo == 2.0.a1</code> if we want. Like, if a user explicitly asks for a pre-release, we <em>could</em> support that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I'm going to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If all available versions for a package are pre-releases, then accept pre-releases.</li>
<li>If a pre-release was already chosen in the lockfile, allow that pre-release.</li>
<li>If a package was specified as a <em>direct dependency</em> with a pre-release marker in its version specifier, allow pre-releases for that package. (I don't think we can really support this for transitive dependencies.)</li>
