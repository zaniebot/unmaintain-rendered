# How to change the `source` in uv.lock (like when a package repo goes offline)?

---

_Issue opened by @krupan on 2025-04-26 13:16_

### Question

I have the wheels for the packages my project needs in a flat directory on an nfs server that all machines in my lab can access.  I add this to my `pyproject.toml`:
```
[[tool.uv.index]]
url = "/path/to/wheels"
format = "flat"
```
I run `uv sync` and it installs the packages under `.venv` and creates `uv.lock`.  Inside `uv.lock` the source for each package is recorded as:
```
source = { registry = "/path/to/wheels" }
```
Now, for some reason or another `/path/to/wheels` is gone, like we stopped using that nfs server or something.  Now, if someone else clones my project and attempts to sync, either with `uv sync` or `uv run`, then uv will not install the packages because it can't find them at `/path/to/wheels`.  I was told in another question that [this is expected](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13094#issuecomment-2829188590).  My question is, is there a uv command/option that I can use in this scenario to download the packages from the default index (PyPI) instead of the `/path/to/wheels` index and then update the lockfile with a new source?

### Platform

linux

### Version

uv 0.6.16

UPDATE: I thought if I deleted `uv.lock` and then ran `uv sync` then it would work, but I still get this error:
```
 $ uv sync
⠙ pyproject==0.1.0
error: Failed to read `--find-links` directory: /path/to/wheels
  Caused by: No such file or directory (os error 2)
```
Shouldn't uv fall back to the default index if one isn't available?
