# Feature request: display the log output from a currently-running build backend.

If I understand correctly, then I think this `.output`:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/1e1f49bfe53b41ac313f2963359e2bf8df2b8e86/crates/uv-build/src/lib.rs#L1062

means that all the output from the build backend is collected whilst it is running, rather than being displayed to the user (during `uv pip compile --verbose`).

Would it be possible to display the output of the build backend to the user? In my case I have a custom build backend that I'd love to see some logs from during installation.

(This is just a nice-to-have, I can work around this by streaming the logs to a file.)

Thanks Patrick, I think this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1567 so merging in there.
