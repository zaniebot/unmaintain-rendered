# Allow using just the index name when the index is already defined in the pyproject.toml

_Issue opened by @ollz272 on 2025-07-11 10:14_

### Summary

When adding a package form a custom index, we have to do the following:

`uv add my_package --index custom_index=https://my_index.com/...`

When adding another package from that source, it would be nice if as a shorthand we could just do:
`uv add my_package_2 --index custom_index`

and uv gets the url from the pyproject.toml

### Example
