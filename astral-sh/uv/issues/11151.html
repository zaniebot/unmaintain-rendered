            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The error 'No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy')' is raised even though the marker <code>platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'</code> is used.</p>
<h3>Minimal Reproducible Example</h3>
<p>Following resolution failure <em>looks</em> like a bug to me:</p>
<p>Running <code>uv lock</code> (or <code>uv sync</code> or even <code>uv run python</code>) with following pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;pythonproject&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;==3.12.*&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;urllib3==2.3.0&quot;]
optional-dependencies.test = [
&quot;vcrpy==7.0.0 ; platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>yields:</p>
<pre><code>  x No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'):
  `-&gt; Because only the following versions of urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'} are available:
          urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}==0.3
          urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}==1.0
          urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}==1.0.1
          [...]
          urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}==1.26.20
          urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}&gt;2
      and urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}&gt;=1.25,&lt;=1.25.1 was yanked (reason: Broken release), we can conclude that urllib3{platform_python_implementation ==      
      'PyPy'}&gt;=1.25,&lt;=1.25.1 depends on urllib3&lt;=1.24.3.
      And because vcrpy==7.0.0 depends on urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}&lt;2 and pythonproject[test] depends on vcrpy{platform_python_implementation !=
      'PyPy'}==7.0.0, we can conclude that pythonproject[test] depends on one of:
          urllib3&lt;=1.24.3
          urllib3&gt;=1.25.2,&lt;=1.26.20

      And because your project depends on urllib3==2.3.0 and your project requires pythonproject[test], we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

<p>Note that especially <code>And because vcrpy==7.0.0 depends on urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}&lt;2 and pythonproject[test] depends on vcrpy{platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'}==7.0.0</code> seems a conflicting statement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, that works for me!</p>
<p>However, I have the feeling that this is merely a work-around. E.g., it wouldn't be a solution if one would really want to target PyPy for the application (excluding <code>vcrpy</code>).</p>
<p>I would expect that if a marker excludes a certain dependency for a certain implementation, that that would propagate to its dependencies. In particular, <code>vcrpy{platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'}==7.0.0</code> should never depend on <code>urllib3{platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'}&lt;2</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes it's a limitation in the resolver. If you had two dependencies, like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;pythonproject&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;==3.12.*&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;urllib3==2.3.0&quot;]
optional-dependencies.test = [
    &quot;vcrpy==7.0.0 ; platform_python_implementation != 'PyPy'&quot;,
    &quot;vcrpy==6.0.0 ; platform_python_implementation == 'PyPy'&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Then we would correctly &quot;fork&quot; the resolution and solve for both marker values. But if there's only one value, we attempt to solve without &quot;forking&quot;, since it's much more expensive to &quot;fork&quot; for every marker value that we see at any time during resolution. We've considered doing that kind of &quot;aggressive&quot; forking by default, but have deferred it.</p>
