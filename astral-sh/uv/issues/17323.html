            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>First off - huge fan of uv. It’s fast, predictable, and has quickly become my default tool for Python dependency management.</p>
<p>One small area where I think <code>uv lock --upgrade</code> could be even better is how upgrade results are presented.</p>
<p><strong>Current behavior</strong></p>
<p>When running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv lock --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>the output lists dependency changes in a mostly linear fashion. While this is accurate, it becomes harder to reason about in larger projects or when many dependencies change at once.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Improvement</strong></p>
<p>It would be incredibly helpful if the output were <em>grouped</em> and <em>categorized</em>, similar to the <em>grouped diagnostics view</em> that Ruff provides (which I really love).</p>
<p>Specifically, grouping changes into categories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major version upgrades</li>
<li>Minor / patch upgrades</li>
<li>Newly added dependencies</li>
<li>Removed dependencies</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><strong>Why this helps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Makes risk assessment much faster (major vs minor bumps)</li>
<li>Easier to review in CI logs</li>
<li>Improves human readability for large dependency graphs</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Haven't formed an opinion on this topic yet but regarding distinguishing between major/minor:</p>
<p>Not everything uses semver. So the concept of &quot;major minor&quot; has different levels of significance depending on the dependency. Some dependency might use calver or something and now everything is considered a minor/patch upgrade until you hit new year's day.</p>
