Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>So I'm planning to add lock file to my project and while comparing existing solutions I encountered a difference in <code>pip-compile</code> (from <code>pip-tools</code>) and <code>uv pip compile</code> results. The result makes me think it is the bug on uv's side.</p>
<p>Consider the following requirements file:
<code>requirements.in</code></p>
<pre><code>celery&lt;5
flower==0.9.2
</code></pre>
<p>After comparing <code>pip-compile</code> and <code>uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt</code>, there is one more entry in uv's output, namely:</p>
<pre><code>futures==3.4.0
    # via flower
</code></pre>
<p>If we check <code>flower</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/mher/flower/blob/v0.9.2/setup.py#L48">source code</a>, <code>futures</code> is required only for python 2, so it should not appear in uv's output, since it only works with python 3.7+.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If present, we read from the <code>requires.txt</code> in the shipped source distribution, and that file includes <code>futures</code>. We generally don't really support packages that have requirements that vary across builds (like, in newer releases, this should be expressed as <code>futures ; python_version &lt; &quot;3.0&quot;</code> or similar). So it's consistent with how we treat metadata. I'd suggest either upgrading your flower version (newer versions don't have this issue) or using <code>--no-emit-package futures</code>.</p>

<p>In case we are using <code>uv</code> as project manager (uv sync/add/remove). Is there an option to skip transient dependency on futures that got picked up although it's not needed? (Something similar to <code>uv pip-compile --no-emit-package futures</code>.)</p>
<p>Here is the error:</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to prepare distributions
  Caused by: Failed to fetch wheel: futures==3.4.0
  Caused by: Build backend failed to determine extra requires with `build_wheel()` with exit status: 1
--- stdout:

--- stderr:
This backport is meant only for Python 2.
It does not work on Python 3, and Python 3 users do not need it as the concurrent.futures package is available in the standard library.
For projects that work on both Python 2 and 3, the dependency needs to be conditional on the Python version, like so:
extras_require={':python_version == &quot;2.7&quot;': ['futures']}
---
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe something like <code>tool.uv.override-dependencies</code> or <code>[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]</code>? Although rewriting all transient deps without futures is cumbersome :(</p>
