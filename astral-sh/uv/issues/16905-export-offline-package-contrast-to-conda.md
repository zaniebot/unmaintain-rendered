# Export offline package contrast to conda

---

_@mytk2012_

### Question

Conda can directly export an existing environment as an offline package, which can then be loaded on offline machines. To achieve the same functionality with UV, you need to use it in conjunction with a cache directory and the pyproject.toml file. Is my understanding correct?

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

_No response_
