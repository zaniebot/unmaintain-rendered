            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello guys
This is a possible questioning/enhancement issue.</p>
<p>I come from the compliance tooling space, and among our usual scanning tools, we depend for direct python resolution dependency.
Today we do collection in two steps:
1 - Get requirements.txt out of pip/poetry/etc.
2 - Use a metadata extractor like https://github.com/nexB/python-inspector</p>
<p>The resulting metadata file from the transient dependencies is used towards the forward process to scan ( for licenses, vulnerabilites, etc. ).
Here's an example generated from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/files/14360230/requirements.txt">requirements.txt</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/files/14360221/inspector.json">inspector.json</a></p>
<p>Come to a question that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this functionality belongs to uv ?</li>
<li>Could be implemented ?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm up to get more details over it if you think is feasible and i'm looking in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great work btw.</p>

<p>I think this makes sense for us to do eventually.</p>
<p>Thanks for participating in the project!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi back.
Correct, almost like --report, except that python inspector dig in the transient dependencies as well.</p>

<p>Assuming this is build dependencies, that is something I would like to eventually add to the pip install report.</p>
<p>@charliermarsh @zanieb feel free to involve me in the design if you work on that at some point, or if you have questions about the install report spec.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm open to give any info needed and test results.</p>
<p>For reference where we use this information, i'm one dev over <a href="https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort">Oss Review Toolkit</a> and we use every single package manager possible to do parsing of multiple-languages and extract dependencies, in specific python case what is happening today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract the requirements over poetry/pip lock files to a requirements file if exists or if allowed dynamic version direct from pyproject</li>
<li>Use the mentioned tool, python-inspector to extract the full meta data info, and then from there we use it to download and scan the source files to generate Ort  meta model.</li>
<li>From there we go to the vulnerability analysis to license and copyright extraction and curation, etc., that's why this initial info is needed and valuable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, thanks for the quick answer</p>
