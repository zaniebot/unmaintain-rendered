Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hi, it would be quite useful for old projects which don't have locked requirements to be able to resolve specifically using dependencies up to some point in time.</p>
<p>This would be hugely helpful in making sure that selected deps are actually compatible with the code when they haven't been locked by the original authors. Reps could normally resolve, but may be incompatible and you need to manually find version numbers up to a certain date. Furthermore, original authors might not have locked deps properly e.g. specifying <code>numpy&gt;=1</code> instead of <code>numpy&gt;=1,&lt;2</code> -- If there was a lockfile for the project it would work fine, but if there isn't then it could easily resolve to v2 which might break things.</p>
<p>e.g. <code>uv pip compile -r requirements.txt --before=2018-02-30</code></p>
