            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to be able to support adding specific extras as dev dependencies.. For example, a project that is migrating to <code>uv</code> may have optional dependency groups that they'd like to keep separate but add as dev dependencies like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
    &quot;pytest~=8.0&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-cov~=5.0&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-time~=0.3&quot;,
]
lint = [
    &quot;ruff&gt;=0.6.0&quot;,
]
types = [
    &quot;pyright==1.1.377&quot;,
]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    &quot;.[test,lint,types]&quot;
]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I was playing around for unrelated reasons and discovered that <code>&quot;&lt;project-name&gt;[extra] @ /&quot;</code> works in the dev-dependencies resolver. Is this something we could expect to continue to work, or should that be considered a bug?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're migrating to uv just now and this is what would help us a lot 👍  And <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/">PEP-0735</a> is now accepted 🙌</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the PEP-0735 dependency-groups area, using <code>&lt;project-name&gt;[extra,other]</code> does work correctly. It's not quite as simple as using <code>.</code>, but it's a decent workaround and meets my use case. I'll leave this open for the Astral folks to decide whether they want to implement it with the shorthand, but I'm content as-is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 I think we can close this now that PEP 735 is accepted and implemented, since we wouldn't go beyond what's in the spec.</p>
