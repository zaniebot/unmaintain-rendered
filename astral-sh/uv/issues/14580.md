# uv tree --upgradable

_Issue opened by @ajslater on 2025-07-12 19:49_

### Summary

It is useful to me to have a uv command that answers the question:  "What python packages are outdated that I can do something about in pyproject.toml?" `uv tree --outdated` does this, but it also gives me a great deal more information than I need. If i depend on a package and one of it's sub-packages is out of date, this can be interesting and useful for diagnosing some issues, but not very often.

I currently answer this question with this kind of perverse command:
```sh
uv tree --outdated | grep "^├.*latest" || true
```

It shows me outdated packages, but only those packages which are top level on the tree and have a different latest version compared to the installed and specified version. Packages that I could update by editing my pyproject.toml dependancies.

Semantically this command might be best to have it’s own name like npm does:
`uv outdated`. It's not really outputting a tree, but we probably don’t need another top level command. 
How about `uv tree --upgradable`? I'm not especially attached to any name, just riffing here.

### Example

```sh
$ uv tree --outdated
codex v1.8.0a2
├── aioprocessing v2.0.1
├── ansicolors v1.0.0 (latest v1.1.8)
├── bidict v0.23.1
├── channels v4.2.2
│   ├── asgiref v3.9.1
│   └── django v5.2.4
│       ├── asgiref v3.9.1
│       └── sqlparse v0.4.0 (latest v0.5.3)
... (big project, 120 more lines of tree)
```

My workaround:
```sh
$ uv tree --outdated | grep "^├.*latest" || true
├── ansicolors v1.0.0 (latest v1.1.8)
```

The new feature:
```sh
$ uv tree --upgradeable
ansicolors v1.0.0 (latest v1.1.8)
```

Have you considered `uv lock --upgrade --dry-run`?

That looks like it might do what I want. Thank you. I'm gonna close this issue and test that for a few days. With any luck I won't re-open it.

`uv lock --upgrade` doesn't actually tell me which packages have newer versions outside the python.toml spec.

So in lieu of  `uv tree --all-groups --outdated-only` which does not exist, I'm doing this:

```sh
uv tree --all-groups –depth 1 --outdated | grep --color=always "(latest:.*)" || true
```
