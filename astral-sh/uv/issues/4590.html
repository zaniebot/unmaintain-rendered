            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv</code> is supposed to be a &quot;Drop-in replacement for common pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv commands.&quot;</p>
<p>Recently testing with some python scripts which used <code>--disable-pip-version-check</code> I found this to not be the case, along with a few other flags. Was this being tracked anywhere?</p>
