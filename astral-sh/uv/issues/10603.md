# `uv venv --python` allow specifying universal (arm64 + Rosetta2) architecture on macOS

_Issue opened by @danra on 2025-01-14 16:59_

I was only able to create a virtual environment with a universal Python this by specifying a path to one already installed on the system:

```
uv venv --python /usr/local/bin/python3
```

It should instead be possible to do out of the box.

Some proposed alternatives:

```
uv venv --python cpython-3.13.1-macos-universal2-none
uv venv --python 3.13.1 --universal
ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch arm64" uv venv --python 3.13.1
```

The first two options don't work, the third one ignores `ARCHFLAGS` and installs a thin `arm64` Python as usual.

I also tried
```
uv venv --python cpython-3.13.1-macos-x86_64-none
```

But that only installs a thin x86_64 Python (as expected).

We don't provide universal distributions (see https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/140)

Why do you need to create a virtual environment with a managed, universal Python build?

It does look like https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/140 already covers the same feature request; shall I close this issue as a dup?

My use case: I have an Xcode C++ project configured to build both x86_64 and arm64 architectures (configured via CMake Xcode multi-config generator). The project is run for each architecture in turn, generating results, which are then compared the results of a Python implementation, which in turn imports modules whose compiled (C++) backend architecture needs to match that of the C++ project results (because there are small differences in numeric results between different architectures).

At a higher level, I suppose this feature would be useful in cases where a universal-configured project requires integration with Python.

Interesting. Thank you for sharing your use-case! That makes sense to me. Let's track this in the upstream issue.
