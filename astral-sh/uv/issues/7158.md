# Why is install.sh (installers) not part of the repo? Where is that hosted?

The installers are also an important part of the user experience, e.g., currently lacking setting path op so installation is a bit tedious. 

Arend't the installers / shouldn't they be part of the project?

They're included in the GitHub Releases, but they're created with [`cargo-dist`](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist). You're welcome to file issues with the installers here or there.
