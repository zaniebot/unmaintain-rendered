Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>(Some?) sdists created with <code>flit</code> (e.g. <code>cloudpathlib</code>, <code>tomli</code>, <code>typer</code>) include a <code>PKG-INFO</code> file with a timestamp of Jan 1 1970, which raises an error when building from source. <code>pip</code> installs without errors.</p>
<p>Command, using <code>uv</code> 0.1.5:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv pip install cloudpathlib==0.17.0 --no-binary cloudpathlib --no-cache --reinstall
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-none">Resolved 2 packages in 392ms

<p>This looks like the same issue as #579, but it doesn't appear to be fixed by #634?</p>
