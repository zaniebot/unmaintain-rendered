            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>uv looks like an acronym, but apparently isn&#x27;t.
The readme and docs say nothing about the name. You have to dig a little to figure out.
I think it should be part of the documentation.</p>
Example
<p><em>uv looks like an acronym but it isn&#x27;t. It is just the name for this tool. Short and easy to remember.</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv doesn&#x27;t really mean anything special.</code> - exactly. If it stands for ultraviolet it stands for ultraviolet. if it doesn&#x27;t it doesnt.</p>
<p>Upon reading uv, you&#x27;d expect it to be an acronym or abbreviation.
I think having a single sentence explaining this in docs does more good than harm.
Why should you have to dig through issues to know what uv means?</p>

<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve already made the explanation from the prior remark, but i&#x27;ll be more specific:
I believe it would be a better practice to have a few words about what the name actually means (or absence of meaning fwiw),
especially one that looks so much like an acronym as this one. I, for one, wondered what uv stood for, if anyhting and I&#x27;m sure some percentage of the repo visitors also do. Yeah you&#x27;ll find it when digging through issues. Just inconvenient.</p>
<p>I take it my points aren&#x27;t very convincing, but at this point I&#x27;m just happy that it&#x27;s a conscious decision rather than something overlooked. Thought it would be nice to bring it to your attention.</p>
<p>So feel free to close the issue as wontfix if that&#x27;s the case.</p>
