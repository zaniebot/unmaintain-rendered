Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>UV tool does not look into the pyproject.toml for already specified indices.</p>
<p>pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
index-url = &quot;https://&lt;my-index-url.com&gt;/pypi/pypi/simple&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv tool install ruff
</code></pre>
<p>uv --version:</p>
<pre><code>uv 0.4.18
</code></pre>
<p>Specifying the index url with <code>--index-url</code> worked, but is annoying :)
Thanks for this great tool!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! This is actually intentional right now. We have a separate design for &quot;project-level tools&quot; (i.e., tools that would be versioned and installed as part of the project, but given their own independent virtual environments) that we want to implement to solve this specific use-case. It's part of #3560.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm also trying to configure <code>uv tool install</code> to adhere to a configuration provided in the pyproject.toml and not rely on the additional <code>--default-index</code> flag, preferably.</p>
<p>This issue was closed in favor of #3560, but that issue has also been resolved &amp; closed without any mention of tool installation index. I would like this to be a feature of uv, if possible.</p>
<p>Is it acceptable to reopen this issue?</p>
