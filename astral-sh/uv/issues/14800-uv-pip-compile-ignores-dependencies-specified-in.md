# `uv pip compile` ignores dependencies specified in `uv.toml`

---

_@jelle-openai_

### Summary

When `pip.dependency-metadata` is used in `uv.toml` to override a package's dependencies, `uv pip compile` treat the package as if it has no dependencies, instead of using the dependencies specified in `uv.toml`.

```
% cat requirements.in 
protovalidate==0.8.0
% cat my-uv.toml 
[pip]
dependency-metadata = [
    {name = "cel-python", version = "0.3.0", requires_dist = ["lark>=0.12", "jmespath>=1.0.1", "pendulum>=3.1", "pyyaml>=6"]},
]
% uv pip compile requirements.in

I think it's just that `requires_dist` needs to be `requires-dist`, so it's inferring an empty dependency list.

I can turn on `deny_unknown_fields` to make it a hard error.

Oh that's embarrassing, thanks! Yes it would be nice for uv to detect this case.

I'm on it:
```
error: Failed to parse: `my-uv.toml`
  Caused by: TOML parse error at line 3, column 46
