# why is `.python-version` a mandatory file?

---

_Issue opened by @YoniChechik on 2024-11-28 07:41_

Can we have a uv setting in pyproject.toml that declers the python version (`dev python version` perheps)? This way we can remove this almost empty file.

Thanks for uv! great effort!

Thanks @my1e5 

Note this file is not mandatory, it's just used for a consistent _default_ environment.
