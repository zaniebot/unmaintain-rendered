### Question

I want to use my own environment, but after executing UV sync -- locked, it will automatically create a virtual environment under the current project, and all packages will be in this environment. I want it to be installed in my own environment. How do I handle this。

Try set the `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to your environment.
