Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>I'm working on upgrading my project to use <code>uv</code> and ran into this error when I installed the <code>requirements.txt</code> file a second time. I've narrowed it down to exactly a particular dependency that gives the error.</p>
<p><strong>Reproduction steps</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">vscode ➜ /workspaces $ uv venv -p 3.12.3 test-venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtualenv at: test-venv
Activate with: source test-venv/bin/activate
vscode ➜ /workspaces $ source test-venv/bin/activate
(test-venv) vscode ➜ /workspaces $ uv pip install suds-community==0.8.5
Resolved 1 package in 99ms
Prepared 1 package in 65ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + suds-community==0.8.5
(test-venv) vscode ➜ /workspaces $ uv pip install suds-community==0.8.5
Resolved 1 package in 1ms
error: Cannot uninstall package; `top_level.txt` file not found at: test-venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/suds_community.egg-info/top_level.txt
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Expected</strong>
Don't throw an error when installing a package that was already installed properly</p>
<p>I've included a more detailed output with <code>RUST_LOG=TRACE</code> and <code>-v</code>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The structure of the wheel is slightly problematic... It seems to include a directory at the top-level that shouldn't be there. I'd recommend upgrading the version honestly, but we can also make uv robust to this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another way to explain it is that because there are two separate <code>suds_community</code> directories here, it appears to uv as if the package were installed twice:</p>

Yes, I did notice the latest version of that package doesn't have this issues (<code>1.2.0</code>) and I'm attempting to upgrade it but the dependency that uses it ALSO has a patch it applies to <code>suds-community</code> so it's becoming complicated. If <code>uv</code> would handle this, that would make my life easier.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah totally understand -- I generally don't like &quot;upgrade it&quot; as a solution for users (sometimes there's no choice). I think we can be more graceful here but you might be shown a warning or something when we reinstall (rather than failing).</p>
