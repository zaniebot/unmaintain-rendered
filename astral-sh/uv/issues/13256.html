            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi UV team,</p>
<p>Thanks for the great work on UV — it's shaping up to be a fantastic tool.</p>
<p>Before considering it for use in a enterprise/production setup, I wanted to ask if there are any plans to change the current MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing model or introduce any paid/commercial tiers in the future.</p>
<p>I understand that licensing can evolve, but having clarity on this would help me (and probably others/organisations) feel more confident using UV long-term at scale.</p>
<p>I've seen a few similar questions come up online, so I thought it might be helpful to raise it here for visibility.</p>
<p>Appreciate any info you can share!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, we don't plan to change the current MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing model or introduce a paid tier to uv. (We'll likely build complementary, hosted services with first-class uv support, but those would not be &quot;required&quot; nor would they affect uv's licensing.)</p>
