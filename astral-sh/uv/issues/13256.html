<p>Hi UV team,</p>
<p>Thanks for the great work on UV — it&#x27;s shaping up to be a fantastic tool.</p>
<p>Before considering it for use in a enterprise/production setup, I wanted to ask if there are any plans to change the current MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing model or introduce any paid/commercial tiers in the future.</p>
<p>I understand that licensing can evolve, but having clarity on this would help me (and probably others/organisations) feel more confident using UV long-term at scale.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen a few similar questions come up online, so I thought it might be helpful to raise it here for visibility.</p>
<p>Appreciate any info you can share!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, we don&#x27;t plan to change the current MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing model or introduce a paid tier to uv. (We&#x27;ll likely build complementary, hosted services with first-class uv support, but those would not be &quot;required&quot; nor would they affect uv&#x27;s licensing.)</p>
