            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am trying to use <code>uv publish</code> to publish a new python package to a private registry.</p>
<p>I believe the private registry is a nexus repository.</p>
<p>pyproject.toml configuration</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;my-example-package&quot;
...

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;pypi-publish-private&quot;
url = &quot;https:/mirrors.my-company.com/pypi/simple/&quot;
publish-url = &quot;https://pypi-publish.my-company.com/&quot;
default = true
</code></pre>
<p>Command I am running:</p>
<pre><code>uv publish -v --index pypi-publish-private
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG uv 0.5.10
warning: `uv publish` is experimental and may change without warning
DEBUG Publishing with index pypi-publish-private
DEBUG Not a distribution filename: `.gitignore`
Publishing 2 files https://pypi-publish.my-company.com/
DEBUG Using request timeout of 900s
DEBUG Checking for my-example-package-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl in the registry
DEBUG No cache entry for: https:/mirrors.my-company.com/pypi/simple/my-example-package/
DEBUG No netrc file found
error: Failed to query check URL
  Caused by: Package `my-example-package` was not found in the registry
</code></pre>
<p>I am a bit confused.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there something I am suppose to do before publishing the very first time?</li>
<li>Since the package has never been published before isn't it expected that the package is not found in the the registry?</li>
<li>Is my private registry not behaving as expected?</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to work around this by using <code>twine</code> to upload the package the very first time. Once the package has been uploaded once then <code>uv publish</code> appears to work as expected.</p>
