            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This is potentially PEBKAC or addressable with some documentation, but I figured I&#x27;d file it as a bug for visibility 🙂</p>
<p>TL;DR: I had a <code>[tool.uv.build-backend]</code> section like this:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.build-backend]
source-include = [&quot;tests/&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I <em>expected</em> this to include the <code>tests/</code> directory in the sdist produced by <code>uv build</code>, but it didn&#x27;t. This can be seen here (along with the <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<p>https://inspector.pypi.io/project/cachecontrol/0.14.4/packages/2d/f6/c972b32d80760fb79d6b9eeb0b3010a46b89c0b23cf6329417ff7886cd22/cachecontrol-0.14.4.tar.gz/</p>
<p>To fix this, I needed to add an explicit pattern:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.build-backend]
source-include = [&quot;tests/**&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>with that, the sdist contained the <code>tests/</code> directory (and all child files/directories) as expected.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/psf/cachecontrol/issues/396">psf/cachecontrol#396</a> and <a href="https://github.com/psf/cachecontrol/pull/397">psf/cachecontrol#397</a> for some more (but not much more) context.</p>
<p>In terms of expected behavior: I expected <code>source-include = [&quot;tests/&quot;]</code> to fully include the <code>tests/</code> directory, since my intuition is that &quot;including&quot; a directory means including it in full, even without a double-glob for &quot;collect everything.&quot; Alternatively/separately, I expected <code>uv build</code> to produce a warning that the <code>source-include</code> setting was a no-op/didn&#x27;t actually include anything.</p>
<p>On the docs side, this is sort of covered by <code>source-include</code> being described as a list of &quot;glob expressions.&quot; However, since <code>tests/</code> didn&#x27;t actually produce a warning/error about being an invalid glob expression, I expected it to work (for the reasons above about my intuitions with directories).</p>

<p>Picking the right glob semantics is hard, often choosing one thing that sounds like an improvement is a regression or a footgun in another case. I have to think some more about the file vs. directory case. Currently, the model is that we walk the source tree and include every path, including parents, that matches the glob, similar to git.</p>

<p>Sounds good!</p>

<p>This makes sense, although git (or at least <code>gitignore</code>) <em>does</em> have the directory matching semantics I&#x27;d expect here: <code>foo/</code> in <code>gitignore</code> means &quot;ignore everything under <code>foo/</code>&quot;. FWICT, in <code>gitignore</code> these are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>foo/
foo/**
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Noting: include and exclude globs are collected and then merged into <code>GlobDirFilter</code>s, which have both a fast-path DFA and a fallback <code>GlobSet</code> internally. So tracking &quot;hits&quot; for each glob is going to be a little interesting.)</p>
