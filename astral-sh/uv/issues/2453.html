Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Just discovered this code fails</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import uv
uv.__version__
</code></pre>
<p>With error</p>
<p><code>AttributeError: module 'uv' has no attribute '__version__'</code></p>
<p>I know it's rare for users to import <code>uv</code> as a module, but it was the &quot;obvious&quot; way to check the version when a jupyter notebook is open.</p>
<p>Note that running <code>uv --version</code> on the terminal works fine, so does running <code>!uv --version</code> on a notebook</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMHO (and this is just comment from a side - I've learned about it when I proposed to use <code>_version_</code> in another module), we should not continue this practice and where popular packages do not have them already, we should not add them - because that only increases the confusion about status of <code>__version__</code> attribute.</p>
<p>It's not only used inconsistently, but also while it's popular in some packages it's status as &quot;standard&quot; is clearly &quot;NO&quot;.</p>
<p>It's been proposed in https://peps.python.org/pep-0396/ and <strong>rejected</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead the standard (and simple and fast) way of retrieving version of the installed package is via importlib-metadata (https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.metadata.html#distribution-versions)  and this is the one I think we - as community should promote.</p>
<p>It's a bit hot topic - see https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/EY44EMZ2R4RUMUUIVEFFVOXM2H3L427Z/#R4A266556EN26KO7XOZLPQZFPRPH7QXB where the PEP-396 has been rejected - and of course it's up to maintainers to decide, but my personal opinion is - let's stop using it (or at least let's not add it to packages that don't use it already).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I thought it was standard but your argument is very clear.</p>
<p>I don't fully follow the rationale in the rejections of the PEPs, but so be it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, the way to do this, instead of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import uv
uv.__version__
</code></pre>
<p>Do this instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; from importlib.metadata import version
&gt;&gt;&gt; version(&quot;uv&quot;)
... 0.1.20
