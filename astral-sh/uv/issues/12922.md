# Simulating production environments

---

_Issue opened by @stefangstark on 2025-04-16 18:07_

### Question

I am working with production dependencies that cannot be installed locally, due to e.g. hardware constraints. I would like my local to access the source code of these dependencies so that I can use IDE language features (LSP) when developing. 

My current hack is to simply copy the `site-packages` from the remote into my local python env. This seems to work but ideally I have a solution in uv such that I can install, from a `requirements.txt`, a "read-only" production code base, with the understanding that this env will not be executable.

Two questions -- 
1. Is there a way achieve this using uv, i.e. install only the source code for packages that do not meet local?
2. Is this just a bad idea?

Have you tried `uv pip install --python-platform`? You can tell uv to install for a given platform (like Windows), ignoring the current platform.
