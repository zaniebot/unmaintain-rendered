# `uv tool` should support man pages

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-02 15:23_

pipx supports installation of man pages for documentation. We should do the same in the `uv tool` commands.

Agreed. This is the biggest feature that's still keeping me on pipx right now.

Before this feature is fully implemented, you can use the following workaround: `uv tool run --from package man package`.

e.g., `uv tool run --from pycowsay man pycowsay`.
