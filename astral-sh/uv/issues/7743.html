Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>If a machine with multiple projects pulls dependencies from multiple indexes, right now you would have to either <code>export</code> the index URL for each project before running command, or pass in the index URL via CLI arguments.</p>
<p>It would be nice if uv first tried to read from the <code>.env</code> file inside of a project, and then from the system environment variables, so if I had a file like this</p>
<p><code>.env</code></p>
<pre><code>UV_INDEX_URL=asdf.
</code></pre>
<p>Then running <code>uv add</code> or <code>uv sync</code> would read from that file in my project directory.</p>
