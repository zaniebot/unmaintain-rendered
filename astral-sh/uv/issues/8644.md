_Issue opened by @mackenziedott on 2024-10-28 19:30_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I'm able to install the python library dedupe in a conda environment, but am unable to succeed in uv.

Command: `uv add dedupe` (or `uv pip install dedupe`)

Log:
`error: Failed to prepare distributions
  Caused by: Failed to fetch wheel: dedupe-levenshtein-search==1.4.5
  Caused by: Build backend failed to build wheel through `build_wheel()` with exit status: 1

        ********************************************************************************
        With Python 2.7 end-of-life, support for building universal wheels
        (i.e., wheels that support both Python 2 and Python 3)

        Please discontinue using this option, or if you still need it,
        file an issue with pypa/setuptools describing your use case.

        By 2025-Aug-30, you need to update your project and remove deprecated calls
        or your builds will no longer be supported.

running regular `pip install dedupe` succeeds, but `uv sync` will of course erase the package.

uv version = 0.4.0

Does setting `CC=gcc CXX=g++` fix this?
