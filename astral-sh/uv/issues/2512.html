            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not quite sure on whether this is a <code>rye</code> or a <code>uv</code> issue, but it would be broadly useful to have dependabot understand rye/uv backed projects as a target for dependabot updates. The current known targets are <code>pip</code> and <code>poetry</code> (which you leave as pip, they just have support for a poetry-style pyproject file).</p>
<p>Whether there is some way of tricking dependabot using the <code>pip</code> compatibility layer, or if it's better to have bespoke handlers I'm not sure!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fair enough! As a secondary point, it might be useful to work with the dependabot maintainers to allow them to use uv for dependency resolution. We have some repositories which dependabot times out trying to solve, and uv solves pretty much instantaneously.</p>
<p>Given they explicitly support poetry (including generating a lock file), there's definitely precedent for it, and the goal of pip compatibility means that this could just be a straight swap in some repositories.</p>

<p>Do you have a concrete example?</p>
<p>Not uv related, but I have a significant improvement to Pip's resolution for complex backtracking cases (https://github.com/notatallshaw/pip/tree/prefer-conflicting-causes), and it would be good to know as many real world cases it solves or not.</p>

<p>One error appears to be easy to fix, there is a check to control that there is an error trying to install a dependency that should fail.</p>
<p>The other I have to look into but here is the message we get from uv when dependabot tries to use it as a direct replacement for <code>pip-compile</code></p>
<pre><code>&quot;error: invalid value 'pyyaml==6.0.1' for '--upgrade-package &lt;UPGRADE_PACKAGE&gt;': Not a valid package or extra name: \&quot;pyyaml==6.0.1\&quot;.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello from the GitHub Dependabot team 👋</p>
<p>I have made some updates to how we handle <code>uv.lock</code> files and <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/pull/11851">merged</a> today.</p>
<p>We have a generated bump <a href="https://github.com/dsp-testing/dependabot-uv/pull/8/files">PR</a> for the <code>httpx</code> dependency on our testing repo.</p>
<p>I generated the original <code>uv.lock</code> file on MacOS. The subsequent run of <code>uv lock --upgrade-package httpx</code> in the Dependabot action also removed some wheels for the unrelated dependency <code>charset-normalizer</code>.</p>
<p>Is this expected behaviour? Any feedback on this would be gratefully received. Thank you!</p>

<p>I took a look at that pull request (in Dependabot) and it looks better.</p>
<p>What uv version was the lockfile generated with originally? We may have added additional filtering of wheels that cannot be selected, e.g., as in #12299</p>

<p>I don't think this is a regular pattern, since that's the point of the <code>uv.lock</code> file. It'd be good to test with a constrained version too, e.g., <code>httpx&gt;=0.20</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For general semantics, <code>uv lock</code> will look at the <code>pyproject.toml</code> and at <code>uv.lock</code> and only make those change required to align the lockfile with <code>pyproject.toml</code>. This means if a <code>==</code>-pinned dependency is updated in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>uv lock</code> will make the relevant minimal change to <code>uv.lock</code>. <code>uv lock</code> does no change if it doesn't have to, so e.g. a plain <code>httpx</code> requirement won't be updated. <code>uv lock --upgrade-package httpx</code> otoh does update the lockfile entry for a plain <code>httpx</code> requirement to the latest version compatible with the rest of the <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>For the Python version, we use <code>project.requires-python</code> to determine which versions are allowed (their <code>Requires-Python</code> must start at least as low as the main project's one). Separately, we need a Python interpreter during locking for the case that we need to build a package. The default logic for discovering the Python interpreter is multi-layered (different sources for interpreters across platforms), but you can pass a specific one <code>--python</code>.</p>

<p>Can we do something similar to <code>uv lock --upgrade-package ...</code> that does not try to build or download the packages and only update the lock file or even just returning the updated lock file contents? This is an approach used for other package managers in Dependabot.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Technically, you can use <code>--no-build</code> to not build any packages. But this means that you won't be able to resolve any resolutions with packages that only have source distribution (with Metadata Version &lt;2.2, which is still common), so we highly recommend running the regular <code>uv lock --upgrade-package</code>. uv tries hard to just update the lockfile (it's what makes uv fast), but the historic lack of reliable metadata forces us to sometimes build just to extract dependency information.</p>
<p>Usually, we also don't download the entire wheels, given <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/">PEP 658</a> or Range Request support for metadata, but for the (rare) indexes that don't support either, we have no option but to download an entire wheel and read the METADATA from it.</p>
<p>Both of those caveats should be generally the same for pip/pip-tools and poetry (pip for example has <code>--only-binary :all:</code>). We expose those options more prominently, we're the only tool not written in Python, so for us, running Python code is an explicit extra step and not just a <code>subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, ...])</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We updated the section in the documentation about dependabot and added an example how to use it. We still see a number of issue blocking adoption in https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20uv, so we'll keep this open a bit longer.</p>

<p>Why doesn't dependabot also update the <code>pyproject.toml</code>? :)
Is that planned?</p>

<p>@phaabe, in an earlier <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6692#issuecomment-2312851977">discussion</a>, one of the member have mentioned that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don't support &quot;bumping&quot; the dependency constraints in your pyproject.toml yet. That's definitely something we're interested in, but we haven't done any design work for that yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I haven't been able to find any update on updating pinned versions in pyproject.toml since then.</p>
<p>Perhaps the dependabot is also waiting for official support to update the pyprojet.toml from uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, everyone!</p>
<p>Why doesn’t Dependabot upgrade my dependencies specified with extras (e.g., <code>pydantic[email]&gt;=2.12.3</code>)?</p>
<p>If I manually run <code>uv lock --upgrade-package pydantic</code>, the version bumps from <code>2.12.3</code> to <code>2.12.5</code> without any problem.</p>
<p>Or is this a question for the Dependabot team?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! 👋 I'm the Dependabot PM over at GitHub (I'm sorry I'm just seeing this thread) and wanted to chime in here to let y'all know we're planning to ship security updates for uv for Dependabot next week. Currently Dependabot only supports version updates (ie bumps to latest version), but starting next week, you'll be able to get Dependabot Security Alerts and prs for uv as well. I chatted with Charlie in the past about Dependabot but lost that thread so figured I'd drop a line here.</p>
<p>I believe in one forum or another the other uv x Dependabot questions posed in this issue have been answered, but if there's anything outstanding (or if you give security updates a try and have feedback) please reach out: carlincherry@github.com 🙏</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How can I explicitly pin Python's version to a certain one with <code>uv</code>?</p>
<p>The recommended way is <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/1455#issuecomment-545389290">creating .python-version</a>. I tried doing so and putting <code>3.12</code> in it, but dependabot seems to ignore it — is this because of <code>uv</code>?</p>
<p>I know that a variety of Python versions is actually supported — changing the global <code>requires-python &gt;=</code> statement in <code>pyproject.toml</code> results in dependabot using that version.</p>

<p>Re: this. I filed a <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/13858">bug</a> in the <code>dependabot-core</code> repo.</p>
