Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p><code>uv</code> version: (0.1.4 @ fef1956)
Platform: Ubuntu 20.04
Python version: 3.9.16 provided by <code>pyenv</code></p>
<h2>Reproduction</h2>
<pre><code>$ python3 -m uv venv test_venv
  x Neither `python` nor `python3` are in `PATH`. Is Python installed?
$ type -a python3  # uv is factually incorrect, there are *multiple* entries on PATH
python3 is /home/snoopjedi/.pyenv/shims/python3
python3 is /usr/bin/python3
python3 is /bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>The same result occurs if I take the <code>pyenv</code> shim out of the loop by pointing directly at the relevant interpreter. This invocation has no reason to depend on <code>PATH</code> as far as I can tell, the analogous <code>venv</code> behavior would use the invoking interpreter in both cases.</p>
<pre><code>$ pyenv which python3
/home/snoopjedi/.pyenv/versions/3.9.16/bin/python3
$ $(pyenv which python3) -m uv venv test_venv
  x Neither `python` nor `python3` are in `PATH`. Is Python installed?
</code></pre>
<p>If I point directly at the <code>uv</code> entrypoint, this invocation succeeds:</p>
<pre><code>$ $(pyenv which uv) venv test_venv
Using Python 3.9.16 interpreter at /home/snoopjedi/.pyenv/versions/3.9.16/bin/python3
Creating virtualenv at: test_venv
</code></pre>
<p>But it is inconvenient that the behavior between the two is not consistent.</p>

Can you share verbose logs for <code>$ python3 -m uv venv test_venv</code>? It'd also be useful to see the output of <code>which python3</code> and <code>which python</code>.</p>

<p>For the sake completeness, here's my <code>PATH</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $PATH
/home/snoopjedi/.local/bin:/home/snoopjedi/.cargo/bin:/home/snoopjedi/.pyenv/shims:/home/snoopjedi/.pyenv/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to me that in this case, there really shouldn't be any &quot;search&quot; at all, I would have expected <code>uv</code> to use exactly the invoking Python, although <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/c04f597fae7a04be6124d91a9b77f211941f3cd6/crates/uv-interpreter/src/python_query.rs#L141-L152">the relevant code</a> doesn't seem to offer much affordance for passing that information to the new process. If I add the following to <code>uv/__main__.py</code>, it does work as expected.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
     uv = os.fsdecode(find_uv_bin())

     env = {}
+    from pathlib import Path
+    env[&quot;UV_TEST_PYTHON_PATH&quot;] = str(Path(sys.executable).parent)
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out that running the command called by <code>execvpe()</code> in the entrypoint from my shell succeeds, which makes me suspect this is an environment problem. If I add just <code>PATH</code> back to the environment used in <code>execvpe()</code> (i.e. <code>env = {&quot;PATH&quot;: os.environ.get(&quot;PATH&quot;, &quot;&quot;)}</code>) then this invocation succeeds, which I tried on a hunch after looking at the <code>strace</code> output and noticing a surprising (to me) invocation of <code>ld.so</code> that spits out the help text:</p>

<p>If I understand the mechanism of this bug correctly as being about <code>PATH</code>, then I think this issue isn't specific to <code>pyenv</code> at all, but would fail all <code>python3 -m uv</code> usage.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I should add: I don't think passing <code>PATH</code> through is the &quot;right&quot; solution here, it just happens to work in my test-case. I can see it getting the wrong Python when the user did <code>/path/to/lower/priority/python3 -m uv venv test_venv</code> but gets a venv created for a <code>python3</code> that is located higher in the <code>PATH</code> listing.</p>
<p>To me, the &quot;right&quot; fix would be to use the Python that invoked <code>uv</code>, which probably means adding a mechanism for passing that information across the subprocess boundary and avoiding the search altogether since that resolution has already occurred before we entered Rust.</p>
<p>That said, it does seem like <code>PATH</code> would be important to preserve, particularly for things like <code>python3 -m uv pip install</code> which may themselves invoke subprocesses that are dependent on it. Naively I would actually expect the <em>entire</em> environment to come along for the ride, because who knows what environment variables will be important to the end result (e.g. what if the user has to twiddle <code>CFLAGS</code> or <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or [obscure library-specific flag] for their install command to succeed)</p>

<p>Yes if we support #1396 then we can pass this through to <code>uv</code> from <code>__main__.py</code>.</p>
