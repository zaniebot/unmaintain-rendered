            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm trying to install a package from a local repo via a redirector proxy, which authenticates to AWS Code Artifact (a local Python repository, which can only be used with authentication).
Here's how the proxy works (only the relevant parts):</p>
<ol>
<li>if it gets a <code>GET</code> request with the <code>{path}</code> ending in <code>/</code>, it does a <code>HEAD</code> to https://pypi.org/simple/{path}
1.1. if pypi returns 2xx, the proxy redirects uv to https://pypi.org/simple/{path}, so uv will get the package from pypi
1.2. otherwise it redirects uv to https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{path}, so uv should get the package from Code Artifact</li>
</ol>
<p>uv is instructed to use the proxy with <code>--extra-index-url {proxy_url</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Installing local packages through this proxy and pip works fine, but fails with uv.</strong>
Installing local packages with the authenticated Code Artifact URL ( https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/) in <code>--extra-index-url</code> with uv works.</p>
<p>So it seems when I return a HTTP 302 redirect to an authenticated URL, uv fails to fetch that. I've tried http:// and https:// as the proxy URL (the redirect URL is always https), both fail, so it doesn't seem to be a &quot;https redirect is not followed from a http site&quot; issue.
The domains are different though, but I can't see any errors related to that.</p>
<p>Running uv with <code>RUST_LOG=uv=trace uv pip install --extra-index-url http://{proxy_url}</code> gives:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Between <code>{}</code> the values are redacted and replaced with a sensible name.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be this line:</p>
<pre><code>TRACE Attempting to retry error: Error { kind: WrappedReqwestError(Url { scheme: &quot;http&quot;, cannot_be_a_base: false, username: &quot;&quot;, password: None, host: Some(Domain(&quot;localhost&quot;)), port: None, path: &quot;/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/{AWS_REGION}/{DOMAIN}/python/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/&quot;, query: None, fragment: None }, WrappedReqwestError(Reqwest(reqwest::Error { kind: Status(404), url: &quot;https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/&quot; }))) }
</code></pre>
<p>It says the URL https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/ is 404, although if I do a <code>curl</code> to it, it loads fine.
As it's a 404 and not a 403, basic auth seems to be passed, but the URL might be mangled internally (it must not be the same as the printed one, as it exists).</p>
<p>If I return the package's page directly (proxying it, instead of a redirect to the backend URL), uv gets through it, then fails when trying to download packages (with redirects).
This actually logs an error and the 404 is not just in the TRACE logs:</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to fetch: `http://localhost/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/{AWS_REGION}/{DOMAIN}/python/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/0.0.10/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}-0.0.10-py3-none-any.whl#sha256=d30cafa1864a752939ec5ad6a56245ed8f78f3f87827e3aa78e09ddeb9023ca4`
  Caused by: HTTP status client error (404 Not Found) for url (https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}//0.0.10/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}-0.0.10-py3-none-any.whl)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, if I try this URL with <code>curl</code>, it just loads fine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@bra-fsn Thanks for testing this case! It looks like the redirect fix doesn't handle this because the credentials are encoded in the redirect request URL and our auth middleware currently assumes these have been moved to a header. I'm going to re-open this issue and will work on a fix for this separately from #13754.</p>

<p>We use a product, which creates build environments with the pip command embedded. Because AWS Code Artifact (CA from now on) supports only authenticated access, with a short lived token, we would have to embed this token into the build environment.
While this works, the problem is that once the build environment is created, it sticks to its settings, so we can't change pip's extra-index-url parameter and upon an environment rebuild, it will fail as the token has already expired.
There are more limitations, but this is the main one.</p>
<p>The proxy provides unauthenticated access to CA by dynamically getting a token for it and redirecting the client to the proper place, so we can use the same, static extra-index-url, without embedding the auth token.</p>
<p>The approach you linked adds a public repo to the CA, so it doesn't solve our problem. We're not using CA to proxy public repos, we use that for storing our internal packages, so the auth problem is still there.
BTW, using CA for proxying is much-much slower than going out to the internet and fetch the package, so that's why we prefer to fetch publicly available packages from pypi.</p>
<p>The real proxy prefers CA for the internal packages and goes out to the internet only if it couldn't find one.</p>
<p>pip is working just fine, but we prefer to use uv, so it would be great if you could support this. (and in fact, you already did it for a single release if I recall correctly :))</p>

<p>Please do if you can. I admit that this might be considered as an edge case, but supporting it helps to achieve feature parity with pip, which is a good thing IMO.
Thanks for considering it!</p>
