            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I have executed the following commands:
uv python install 3.12
uv init --python 3.12
uv venv --python 3.12
uv python pin 3.12
..venv\Scripts\activate</p>
<p>Then I ran:
uv add numpy</p>
<p>After that, uv automatically started installing Python 3.11, and subsequently displayed the following prompt:
Using CPython 3.11.13
error: The requested interpreter resolved to Python 3.11.13, which is incompatible with the project&#x27;s Python requirement: &gt;=3.12 (from project.requires-python)</p>
<p>This is quite strange. Why does it always automatically switch to Python 3.11?</p>
Platform
<p>Windows11</p>
Version
<p>uv 0.8.16 (2de677b0d 2025-09-09)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can reproduce this if there is a <code>.python-version</code> file with <code>3.11</code> already present in the same folder when running those commands.</p>
<p>Same if the env var <code>UV_PYTHON</code> is set to <code>3.11</code>.</p>

<p>Hi, I have the issue. This is my logs, it really confuses me since I set all python version to be 3.12, and uv always switches to python 3.11.</p>

<p>Can you confirm that you don&#x27;t have the <code>.python-version</code> file set or the <code>UV_PYTHON</code> env var set by running <code>Get-Content .python-version</code> and <code>Get-ChildItem Env:UV_PYTHON</code> (assuming you&#x27;re running in powershell) before running the uv commands in the same directory?</p>

<p>Thank you for reply.
I&#x27;ve explicitly set .python-verison to be 3.12. For <code>UV_PYTHON</code>, I will try to run your command as soon as I get back to work. I already checked the user env variable and system env variable in windows setting and there was a UV_PYTHON= 3.11 in user env variable but the problem still exists after i manually deleted it or changed it to 3.12.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In addition to these steps @Yuli-yx , I also completely uninstalled UV and reinstalled it twice before resolving the issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a way to explicitly disable/prevent uv from messing with the currently installed python version? I had an application which uses tkinter (requiring <code>apt install python3-tk</code>). When I try to use uv in that project it silently replaces my desired python with something else and then I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>[xcb] Unknown sequence number while appending request
[xcb] You called XInitThreads, this is not your fault
[xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
python3: ../../src/xcb_io.c:157: append_pending_request: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_unknown_seq_number&#x27; failed.
</code></pre>
<p>It seems someone else <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/problem-using-uv-with-a-tkinter-application/181724">had a similar problem</a></p>
<p>I like the speed of uv but the above is kind of confusing and seems like a deal breaker.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your effort on uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@emin63 could you please open a new issue with a reproduction and verbose logs? It&#x27;s unclear what you&#x27;re doing that encountered that. If you&#x27;re using managed Python versions from uv, you&#x27;ll want to do <code>uv self upgrade &amp;&amp; uv python upgrade --reinstall</code> to ensure you have the latest version as we&#x27;ve fixed a similar looking bug in our Python distributions.</p>
