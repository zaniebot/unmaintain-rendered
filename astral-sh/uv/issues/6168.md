# uv misinterprets `python_version in "2.6 2.7 3.2 3.3"` marker

_Issue opened by @sbidoul on 2024-08-17 12:15_

It seems uv 0.2.37 misinterprets this marker:  `python_version in "2.6 2.7 3.2 3.3"`.

How to reproduce:

`uv pip install pickleshare` installs `pathlib2`, which is declared as `Requires-Dist: pathlib2; python_version in "2.6 2.7 3.2 3.3"` in the `pickleshare` wheel METADATA.

Yeah this is known. We should fix it. There’s another issue somewhere.
