            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;example&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;autogen-core==0.4.0dev0&quot;,
    &quot;autogen-agentchat==0.4.0dev0&quot;,
    &quot;autogen-ext==0.4.0dev0&quot;
]

[tool.uv.sources]
autogen-core = { git = &quot;https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git&quot;, branch = &quot;staging&quot;, subdirectory = &quot;python/packages/autogen-core&quot; }
autogen-agentchat = { git = &quot;https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git&quot;, branch = &quot;staging&quot;, subdirectory = &quot;python/packages/autogen-agentchat&quot; }
autogen-ext = { git = &quot;https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git&quot;, branch = &quot;staging&quot;, subdirectory = &quot;python/packages/autogen-ext&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>as I had the same issue while trying to load an un-published package from Git:</p>
<pre><code>error: Requirements contain conflicting URLs for package `autogen-core` in split `python_full_version == &#x27;3.12.*&#x27;`:
</code></pre>
<p>(note that you&#x27;ll need to run <code>GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 uv sync --verbose</code> to reproduce, as there&#x27;s a different and unrelated error about LFS when uv tries to use git to check the repo out, but that&#x27;s an issue for another ticket)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an interesting issue. The final error is like:</p>
<pre><code>error: Requirements contain conflicting URLs for package `autogen-core`:
- file:///Users/crmarsh/.cache/uv/git-v0/checkouts/2b1782d8bf4da9cf/4084a9f3/python/packages/autogen-core
- git+https://github.com/microsoft/autogen.git@staging#subdirectory=python/packages/autogen-core
</code></pre>
<p><code>autogen</code> actually uses uv workspaces itself, which is the source of the problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this ticket @charliermarsh . I realized after reporting in the other thread that there was an issue which I couldn&#x27;t figure out if it was user error (by me), an issue in the autogen repo, or an actual bug so I hesitated to report it further.</p>
<p>But I noticed in the autogen-core pyproject.toml the version is specified as 0.4.0dev0, and when I try to install that package alone it works. However, when I try to install one of its dependencies like autogen-ext or autogen-autochat, the failure appears to be because the uv resolver is trying to find autogen-core 0.4.0.dev0 - note the extra period before dev0.</p>
<p>Again, not sure if this is a uv bug or just I am doing it wrong, but it was odd that the version string was not matching up which appears to be causing this error.</p>
