            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do a lot of work in offline environments with an alternate package index. That index goes down sometimes (much more often than the public pypi repo would).</p>
<p>A lot of routine uv/uvx tasks will check against network locations before running unless the <code>--offline</code> flag is passed. When the index goes offline I can continue working with the <code>--offline</code> flag and <code>uv/uvx</code> will use its local cache. This is great!</p>
<p>The issue is when I start having scripts or other tooling that invoke <code>uvx</code>. When the index is up, I don&#x27;t want to run in <code>--offline</code> mode, because I want <code>uvx</code> to work normally. So I can write those scripts to not use <code>--offline</code>. However, when the index goes down, now I need to be running in <code>--offline</code> mode because a network failure doesn&#x27;t automatically fallback to the local cache. That means I have to go edit all the callsites to use <code>uvx --offline</code>  for that time period.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><code>uvx ruff check</code> fails when the package repo goes down and must be changed to <code>uvx --offline ruff check</code> to use the locally cached version of ruff. You have to have already run <code>uvx ruff ...</code> at least once with access to a package index to get it loaded into the cache for this to work but that&#x27;s not something <code>uv</code> can fix 😆.</p>
<p>There are plenty of workarounds (such as maintaining a parallel set of scripts or accepting an &quot;--offline&quot; flag into the scripts) but this does seem like it could be behavior that <code>uv/uvx</code> could subsume.</p>
<p>I think this comes down to the fact that there&#x27;s only two modes right now:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online</strong>: Default, <code>uvx</code> always tries to reach out to the package registry. e.g. <code>uv ruff format</code></li>
<li><strong>Offline</strong>: <code>--offline</code> passed, <code>uvx</code> will never reach out to the package registry. e.g. <code>uv --offline ruff format</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m finding in my circumstances it would be great to have a third mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Online with Fallback</strong>: Act like the default however, if a network request fails, fall back to <code>--offline</code> type behavior for that dependency and check if it exists in the local cache. If it doesn&#x27;t, then fail just like how <code>uvx --offline &lt;package not in cache&gt;</code> would fail. e.g. <code>uv --offline-fallback ruff format</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While my circumstances are probably fairly niche, the general idea is to let <code>uvx</code> have a &quot;best effort&quot; in case it can&#x27;t reach the package index and not just fail when there&#x27;s a valid local cached version.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there are any pitfalls you could end up in with what could be a mixed online/offline dependency resolution. You can think of some weird cases where a specific dependency has a <code>git</code> source defined and that&#x27;s accessible but transitive dependencies aren&#x27;t online  because the package index is offline so they fallback to previously local cached versions. My first though is so long as the versions can be resolved satisfactorily it wouldn&#x27;t be any different.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems reasonable to me. I think the problem might be that we can&#x27;t respect the registry&#x27;s cache options? I&#x27;m not sure though, @charliermarsh would know better.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb This would be really helpful for my workflow as well. I have a service that uses <code>uv</code> in a subprocess in order to allow running different versions of an internal package that is pulled from an internal pypi server. When the pypi server is inaccessible (not a frequent occurrence, but it has happened a couple of times now), it causes jobs that call the service to fail because <code>uv</code> must make a successful connection. Having a fallback would be extremely handy.</p>
<p>On a related note: when looking into this further, I also noticed some oddities with the way the <code>--offline</code> flag and cached packages seem to work, so I create another issue here: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13747">astral-sh/uv#13747</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I could see a <code>--never-refresh</code> [^1] option that skips over doing HTTP if there&#x27;s something in the cache. A trickier but even more effective implementation would prioritize versions in the resolver that are cached, falling back to uncached versions.</p>
<p>[^1]: <code>--no-refresh</code> would give the default behavior.</p>

<p>Together with #16108 , in short we&#x27;d need &quot;prefer cache&quot; and &quot;prefer latest&quot; modes added, while currently we only have &quot;strict cache&quot; (--offline) and &quot;strict latest&quot; (default, fails if offline).</p>
