            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When i try use: <code>uv add proxy-http-client --index https://wheels.compamyname.com/python3.10</code> i got error:</p>
<p>× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
╰─▶ Because there are no versions of proxy-http-client and your project depends on proxy-http-client, we can conclude that your project's requirements are
unsatisfiable.</p>
<pre><code>  hint: `proxy-http-client` was found on https://wheels.compamyname.com/python3.10, but not at the requested version (all versions of
  proxy-http-client). A compatible version may be available on a subsequent index (e.g., https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only consider versions
  that are published on the first index that contains a given package, to avoid dependency confusion attacks. If all indexes are equally trusted, use
  `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from all indexes, regardless of the order in which they were defined.</code></pre>
<p>help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the <code>--frozen</code> flag to skip locking and syncing.</p>
<p>When i use standart pip install --extra-index-url it works and lib downloads</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 22</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.5.26</p>

            &lt;/span&gt;
            
    &lt;p&gt;
                To specify a term which contains spaces, use single quotes like this:
                &lt;code&gt;'term with spaces'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                By using a search like &lt;code&gt;fieldname:term&lt;/code&gt;,
                you can search in the following fields:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;classifiers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
                The &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trove classifiers&lt;/a&gt; of a package.
                Use single quotes to specify a classifier, as they contain spaces:
                &lt;code&gt;classifiers:'Programming Language :: Python :: 3'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The name of the index. This is only the name part, without the user. For example: &lt;code&gt;index:pypi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The keywords of a package.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The package name. For example: &lt;code&gt;name:devpi-client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The path of the package in the form '/{user}/{index}/{name}'.  For example: &lt;code&gt;path:/root/pypi/devpi-server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;serial&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Undocumented&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
                The type of text.
                One of &lt;code&gt;project&lt;/code&gt; for the project name,
                &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; for the title of a documentation page,
                &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; for a documentation page,
                or one of the following project metadata fields:
                &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;author_email&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;type:page&lt;/code&gt;
                &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The user name.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                End a term with an asterisk to search by prefix like this: &lt;code&gt;path:/fschulze/*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                Group query clauses with parentheses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                Use the &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;ANDNOT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ANDMAYBE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                operators to further refine your search.&lt;br /&gt;
                Write them in all capital letters, otherwise they will be interpreted as search terms.&lt;br /&gt;
                An example search would be: &lt;code&gt;devpi ANDNOT client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                Boost a term by adding a circumflex followed by the boost value like this:
                &lt;code&gt;term^2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

                To specify a term which contains spaces, use single quotes like this:
                &lt;code&gt;'term with spaces'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                By using a search like &lt;code&gt;fieldname:term&lt;/code&gt;,
                you can search in the following fields:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;classifiers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
                The &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trove classifiers&lt;/a&gt; of a package.
                Use single quotes to specify a classifier, as they contain spaces:
                &lt;code&gt;classifiers:'Programming Language :: Python :: 3'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The name of the index. This is only the name part, without the user. For example: &lt;code&gt;index:pypi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The keywords of a package.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The package name. For example: &lt;code&gt;name:devpi-client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;path&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The path of the package in the form '/{user}/{index}/{name}'.  For example: &lt;code&gt;path:/root/pypi/devpi-server&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;serial&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Undocumented&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
                The type of text.
                One of &lt;code&gt;project&lt;/code&gt; for the project name,
                &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; for the title of a documentation page,
                &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; for a documentation page,
                or one of the following project metadata fields:
                &lt;code&gt;author&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;author_email&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;keywords&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;type:page&lt;/code&gt;
                &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;&lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The user name.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                End a term with an asterisk to search by prefix like this: &lt;code&gt;path:/fschulze/*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                Group query clauses with parentheses.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                Use the &lt;code&gt;AND&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;OR&lt;/code&gt;,
                &lt;code&gt;ANDNOT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ANDMAYBE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                operators to further refine your search.&lt;br /&gt;
                Write them in all capital letters, otherwise they will be interpreted as search terms.&lt;br /&gt;
                An example search would be: &lt;code&gt;devpi ANDNOT client&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
                Boost a term by adding a circumflex followed by the boost value like this:
                &lt;code&gt;term^2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
