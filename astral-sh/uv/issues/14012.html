            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I can do something like <code>uv sync --all-packages</code> to build all the packages in a monorepo, but on a certain hardware platform (<code>aarch64</code>), I want to skip the building of just one of the packages in the monorepo. I've tried to simply iterate over all the package names and then build each with <code>--package</code>, but it looks like building one package will uninstall/remove a previously built package, resulting in a fragile environment.</p>
<p>Is there some flag to add where I can exclude a package (or a few) from the --all-packages flag? I've also tried adding <code>--no-install-package &lt;NAME&gt;</code>, but it looks like <code>--all-packages</code> overrides this.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux 5.15.148-tegra aarch64 GNU/Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.3</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't currently support this feature directly, but there could be a workaround: You can have a root package that depends on all workspace members (e.g. in <code>project.dependencies</code>, but <code>dependency-groups.dev</code> should also work), but for that one member it uses an <code>platform_machine != 'aarch64'</code> marker.</p>
