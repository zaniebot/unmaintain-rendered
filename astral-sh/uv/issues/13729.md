# `uv tool` should support icons

---

_Issue opened by @callegar on 2025-05-30 10:28_

### Summary

This goes hand in hand with issue #4731.

`uv tool` symlinks programs to `~/.local/bin`, but tools are often more than the individual commands that can be invoked. There are manpages and, for GUI tools, there are those artifacts that make the tools well integrated with the desktop environment. Unless icons are linked into `~\.local/share/icons`, GUI tool typically remain with no icon in the taskbar. 

### Example

_No response_

Does `pipx` do this?
