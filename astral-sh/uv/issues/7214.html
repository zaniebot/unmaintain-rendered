<p>I would like to see the <code>--excluded</code> flag in the <code>uv add</code> command, and <code>excluded-dependencies</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>This functionality is in rye, but not in uv for some reason. Is there any reason why it&#x27;s not there, or are there other ways to avoid installing sub-dependencies? Let me know.</p>
<p>I have seen the <code>uv sync --no-install-package</code> parameter, but this solution only affects the virtual environment, and is not locked in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the use case is to prevent installing transitive dependencies. My use case for this is very similar. I need to use torch, which I&#x27;ve added to my <code>project.dependencies</code>. Since I&#x27;m not using GPU-acceleration, I would like to exclude its <code>nvidia</code> dependency to shave off 2.6 GiB of the resulting venv size.</p>

<p>The example given by @elohmeier perfectly illustrates one of the scenarios where this functionality would be useful. In my case, I primarily need this feature to reduce the size of Docker images. It&#x27;s unnecessary to download and store libraries that will never be used in the project.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Regarding whether this is a duplicate of #4422, I&#x27;m not certain it is, as this issue proposes a different approach to excluding dependencies.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve come across one solution that currently works:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    &quot;polyfactory ; sys_platform == &#x27;never&#x27;&quot;,
    &quot;jinja2 ; sys_platform == &#x27;never&#x27;&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>However, this solution is not currently documented, and I find it not very intuitive. Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t provide a convenient CLI solution for adding or removing items from this list.</p>
<p>When I first saw the <code>sys_platform == &#x27;never&#x27;</code> construct, I was quite confused about its purpose. Without additional explanation, this construction is not obvious. It would be much clearer to have a list like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
excluded-dependencies = [
    &quot;polyfactory&quot;,
    &quot;typing-extensions&quot;,
    &quot;faker&quot;,
    &quot;jinja2&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>This format is more straightforward and easier to understand at a glance. It would also be beneficial to have corresponding CLI commands to manage this list easily.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This doesn&#x27;t appear to work when running <code>uv lock</code> or <code>uv sync</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    &quot;futures; sys_platform == &#x27;never&#x27;&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ uv sync

      [stderr]
      This backport is meant only for Python 2.
      It does not work on Python 3, and Python 3 users do not need it as the concurrent.futures package is available in the standard library.
      For projects that work on both Python 2 and 3, the dependency needs to be conditional on the Python version, like so:
      extras_require={&#x27;:python_version == &quot;2.7&quot;&#x27;: [&#x27;futures&#x27;]}
</code></pre>
<p>What&#x27;s the right work around here? Thanks</p>

<p>That said, we&#x27;re not currently using pip (or uv pip) to install dependencies in our target environments: local and docker. I&#x27;d like to avoid doing so if possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I don&#x27;t think this solved the issue.</p>
<p>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t emphasize this enough in my messages, but I still wanted to see a way to specify a list of excluded dependencies in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p>
<p>One of the possible designs for implementing this feature already exists in rye, which suits me perfectly. It&#x27;s this specific design that I would like to see in uv.</p>
