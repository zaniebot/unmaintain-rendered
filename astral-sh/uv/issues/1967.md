# `pip sync` command as an option for `pip install`

_Issue opened by @T-256 on 2024-02-25 18:20_

We can consider `uv pip install -r <LOCKFILE>` instad of `uv pip sync <LOCKFILE>`:

```shell
uvtest> uv venv
Using Python 3.7.9 interpreter at C:\Python37\python.exe
Creating virtualenv at: .venv
Activate with: .venv\Scripts\activate

uvtest> uv pip install -r requirements.txt

I just checked that all command options of `pip sync` are available at `pip install` and nothing more provided from `pip sync`.

Syncing is different, it will remove packages in the virtualenv not present in the requirements.

Yeah, there are two keys differences:

1. As Zanie mentioned, syncing ensures that your environment exactly matches the requirements (and so will remove extraneous packages).
2. `uv pip sync` doesn't do any dependency resolution -- it only installs the exact packages in the lockfile (i.e., it assumes the input lockfile is the `uv pip compile` output).

Correct, what about use it as an option for `pip install` instead of making it separated command:
- `pip install --sync -r req.txt`

> 2\. `uv pip sync` doesn't do any dependency resolution -- it only installs the exact packages in the lockfile (i.e., it assumes the input lockfile is the `uv pip compile` output).

same as what's `--no-deps` currently doing? then we could specify `--sync` auto invokes `--no-deps`.
