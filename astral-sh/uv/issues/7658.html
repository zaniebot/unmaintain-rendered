<p>First of all - thanks for this amazing tool! I've only been using it for a few weeks and it's already making my workflow so much faster and simpler!</p>
<p>I ran into this error trying to install some old version on <code>numpy</code> with <code>uv pip install</code>:<br />
<code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils.msvccompiler'</code></p>
<p>Full example:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv --version
uv 0.4.15 (0d81bfbc6 2024-09-21)

$ uv pip install numpy==1.17.3

<p>I believe this is related to these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7606</li>
<li>https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4620</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I don't know how to resolve this.</p>
<p>To elaborate, my full use-case is that I'm building a wheel for my project and I want to test it with the lowest and highest possible dependency versions.<br />
In order to test the lowest dependency versions, I set up my test env with <code>uv sync --resolution lowest-direct</code>.<br />
Since one of my dependencies has a transient dependency on <code>numpy==1.17.3</code> in its lowest version range, I am faced with this error. I can add the latest numpy version to my project dependencies which would fix this error, but that will be too constricting for my package, since there is nothing preventing my code from working with lower numpy versions, it's just that's I'm unable to build them properly...</p>
<p>Would very much appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I think the direct problem you are facing is that numpy 1.17.3 doesn't work with Python 3.10 (it has wheels for 3.5 to 3.8); on this Python version, you likely need to use are higher numpy version (or conversely, test on an older Python version).</p>
<p>I'm surprised that <code>lowest-direct</code> doesn't select a higher numpy, is one of your dependencies putting an upper bound on numpy? One option you could try is adding a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#constraint-dependencies">constraint</a> such <code>numpy&gt;=x.y.z; python_version &gt;= &quot;3.9&quot;</code> instead of a dependency, this way you're forcing a higher version that is compatible with Python 3.10 without constraining your dependents.</p>

<p>Yep, that was it, thanks!</p>

<p>In my haste to submit this issue I may not have been accurate enough. Here is a more detailed representation of my issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>My project depends on a package <code>foo</code> directly (real name is irrelevant since this is a package from an internal repository).</li>
<li>The package <code>foo</code> requires <code>numpy&lt;2.0.0</code> directly, but doesn't specify any lower version bound.</li>
<li>In my test environment, I want to check that a user that meets the very lowest dependency requirements could still use my package, so I run <code>uv sync --resolution lowest-direct</code>.</li>
<li>However, this causes the resolver to bring the <strong>latest</strong> version of <code>numpy</code> that satisfies <code>numpy&lt;2</code>, which doesn't help me check a wide range of versions.</li>
<li>I could change my setup process to use <code>--resolution lowest</code>, but <code>foo</code> requires more packages than just <code>numpy</code> with unbound version constraints, so I add some select number of packages to my project's dependencies, for which I want to check the lower bound. Specifically: <code>numpy&gt;1</code>.</li>
<li>Now when I run <code>uv sync --resolution lowest-direct</code> I expect to get the lowest possible version of <code>numpy</code> available for my python version (3.10) that satisfies <code>numpy&gt;1</code>, but instead I get the aforementioned error.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I understand correctly, the problem stems from the fact that these older versions of <code>numpy</code> did not have any lower bound on the required python version, and so the resolver chose them as possible candidates, but then failed to build the <code>setup.py</code> because, well, they <strong>are</strong> incompatible.<br />
So that's not not an issue with a resolver but with the specification of the package being built. Still, I wonder if maybe at this point the resolver could &quot;infer&quot; that this version is not compatible and try the next possible version?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This a common problem, one that's about how the pypi-ecosystem handles metadata: When numpy 1.17.3 was released, the devs didn't know yet with which future Python version it may or may not be compatible, they could only say they know they need at least a certain version. Python 3.x makes only careful changes in each release, so a lot of packages that used to work on Python 3.x keep working on 3.(x+n). Since we projects append metadata for existing releases to specify the real compatibility after the original release, the most reasonable thing for us is to assume a packages works with all future python versions. This generally works, but sometimes we get those build failures.</p>
