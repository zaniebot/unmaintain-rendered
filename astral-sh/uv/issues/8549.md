# Installer requiring glibc 2.31 (even though wheels work with 2.28)

---

_Issue opened by @gaborbernat on 2024-10-24 22:41_

When installing on a system with <glibc 2.31 the installer fallbacks to the MUSL installer which is not a thing so install fails.

Fallbacks to MUSL because on RHEL 8:

```

 This is even though the installer works with older glibc:

```bash
❯ docker run --rm -it artprod.dev.x.com/rhel8:latest
[root@2888284085b0 /]# curl https://py-uv.s3.dev.bcs.x.com/uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz

uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/uvx
uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/uv

[root@2888284085b0 /]# ./uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/uv --help

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:

```

After chatting with the axodotdev team, seems this is because astral is using ubuntu 20 to build the release image, which has glibc 2.31 which then gets embeded into the installer script.

They have smarter glibc tracking, see https://blog.axo.dev/2024/08/glibc, but this system is not yet used by astral:

> because they use a particular "hidden feature" to enable some customization we haven't built in yet (around cross compilation, which we are currently working on!

The cargo-dist team is working on solving this cross compilation gap, but that might take a bit, but we are looking at alternatives.

It seems like what we need here is a way to specify the glibc version ourselves, since we know it.

Thanks for catching this. My guess is that this has been a problem ~forever, but it's never been noticed because we just fallback to musl. But in your case, you're not mirroring the musl builds, and so it ends up as a failed install.

I believe this is now fixed by manually setting our glibc versions per-target.
