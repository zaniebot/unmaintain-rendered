<p>A Python interpreter that is found successfully for a given version string passed with the <code>--python</code> flag is not found when the same version is mandated by <code>requires-python</code> in a <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah so the difference here is that unless you <em>request</em> Python 3.12 we won't look for an interpreter with the <code>3.12</code> suffix. The key difference is</p>
<pre><code>TRACE Searching PATH for executables: python3.12, python3, python
</code></pre>
<p>vs</p>
<pre><code>TRACE Searching PATH for executables: python3, python
</code></pre>
<p>If you were to pass the flag <code>--python '&gt;=3.12'</code> you'd get the same result. We <em>could</em> consider searching for executables with suffixes for Python range requests (i.e. &gt;=3.12), it just gets kind of complicated since that range is technically unbounded.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think at minimum the lowest possible matching version should be checked for, as that can be pretty much guaranteed to be a released version. I.e. <code>--python '&gt;=3.12'</code>should check <code>python3.12, python3, python</code> and <code>--python '&gt;3.9'</code> should check <code>python3.10, python3, python</code> (I assume using &gt; is possible there but I don't actually know).</p>
<p>When it comes to scanning across many possible version numbers, shouldn't it be possible to come up with a reasonable upper bound based on the current date? The Python release schedule is fairly predictable after all, so in the event of no upper bound being given for the Python version, can't an upper bound be set to <code>YY - 11 + x</code>, where <code>x</code> is a buffer, something like 3, for safety?</p>
