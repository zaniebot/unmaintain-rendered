            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I set up a virtual workspace to run MkDocs as discussed <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/discussions/1342#discussioncomment-10401062">here</a>; the config is the same is in #6288 (which I worked around by not running <code>uv lock</code>).</p>
<p>A minor annoyance is that <code>uv lock</code> sets <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;</code> in <code>uv.lock</code>, and there is no way to decrease this requirement AFAICT. <code>uv</code> seems to only accept a field for the minimum Python version in <em>packages</em>, and there are none in my config.</p>
<p>Perhaps the <code>[tool.uv.workspace]</code> section in <code>pyproject.toml</code> should support setting a minimum python version, or there should be a way to have a &quot;virtual project&quot; that has dev-dependencies and sets a minimum Python version instead of having to create a weird empty workspace to put dev-dependencies in its root.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ah, looking at #6285, maybe I&#x27;m supposed to have a <code>.python-version</code>... OTOH, judging by that bug, it may or may not work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this is an awkward spot right now. The best you can do at present is a <code>.python-version</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is now solved by using a virtual package. You can add <code>[project]</code> with a Python version to what was previously a virtual workspace root.</p>
