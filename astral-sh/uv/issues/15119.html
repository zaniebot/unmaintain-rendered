            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When using <code>uv tool install</code> with the <code>--with-executables-from</code> flag, an error occurs if the executable already exists from a previous <code>uv tool install</code>.</p>
<p>This can cause unexpected behavior in environments where tools and their executables are installed in overlapping ways.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
<p>Install yamllint as a standalone CLI tool:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv tool install yamllint
</code></pre>
<p>Later, attempt to install ansible while also requesting the yamllint executable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv tool install --with-executables-from yamllint ansible
</code></pre>
<p>Which fails with:</p>
<pre><code>error: Executable already exists: yamllint (use `--force` to overwrite)
</code></pre>
<p>This breaks idempotency: a colleague using the same command might fail depending on whether yamllint was previously installed.</p>
<p>It makes it so you can’t safely layer toolchains or reuse install commands across scripts or projects and risks destructive behavior since uninstalling a tool may remove a binary used by another.</p>
<p>I realize the <code>--force</code> flag exists but would this remove the link to the original tool?</p>
<hr />
<h3>Example scenario</h3>
<ul>
<li>Install ansible using <code>--with-executables-from yamllint</code>.</li>
<li>Later, you would like to install yamllint by itself or with another tool but you omit <code>--with-executables-from yamllint</code> to avoid the failure.</li>
<li>Some time later you decide to <code>uv tool uninstall ansible</code>.</li>
<li>After uninstalling ansible, the second toolchain will be incomplete because the executable it could have requested was removed.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<p>Would it be possible to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow multiple tools to co-own a binary installed via <code>--with-executables-from</code>, tracked internally?</li>
<li>Only remove shared executables when no tool still depends on them?</li>
<li>Provide a <code>--skip-existing-executables</code> flag to downgrade the overwrite error to a warning?</li>
<li>Log executable ownership metadata so users (or uv) can make smarter decisions on uninstall?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>MacOS, Debian, Ubuntu</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.8.5</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>

<p>I wasn't exactly sure how to tag it, I just wanted to bring it to someone's attention. When I was testing it to use in my install scripts I hit the error and figured I better mention it.</p>
