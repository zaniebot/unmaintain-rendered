            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Use case: I finally get a working environment with many dependencies and Python v3.9. Then, I need to install some new package X which has a <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;</code> and some of its sub-dependencies such as Y also have  <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;</code>, despite still working fine with v3.9. I need to create a whole new environment with a different python v3.10 version now, just to add this dependency.</p>
<p>While it may be the case that the packages X and Y actually do <em>require</em> v3.10, I have noticed that in other cases package authors seem to use <code>requires-python</code> to reduce testing surface area or encourage downstream users to avoid end-of-life versions, rather than strictly requiring a particular python version.</p>
<p>I tried</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;X&quot;
version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;

[[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]]
name = &quot;Y&quot;
version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>but this fails as only the X metadata is considered (not Y metadata as it is an indirect dependency via X).</p>
<p>A different approach would be to allow for an environment variable such as <code>UV_OVERRIDE_REQUIRES_PYTHON=&quot;&gt;=3.9&quot;</code> if I believe that <code>requires-python</code> for dependencies and subdependencies are too strict.</p>
