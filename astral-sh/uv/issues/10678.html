            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I want to keep a lock file that represents a reproducible single-source truth for a tested and validated environment, so we can use it during deployment. For this, we have several CI jobs that use it in tests and publish (via <code>uv sync --locked</code>), with a cron job that updates the environment periodically (via <code>uv lock --upgrade</code>).</p>
<p>On top of this, we have general dev workflows using uv that may lead to changes in the lock file, which is undesired.</p>
<p>Ideally, we'd have a lock file called <code>production.lock</code> and one regular <code>uv.lock</code> (which may or may not be gitignored) for dev work. Is there support for this use case? I couldn't find an option to specify a different name for the lock file.</p>
