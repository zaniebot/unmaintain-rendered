# [Installer] Missing `commit_id` in direct_url.json

---

_Issue opened by @frostming on 2025-01-22 08:50_

### Summary

To reproduce:

```
uv pip install git+https://github.com/pallets/click.git@main
```

View the result `direct_url.json` under `path/to/site-packages/click-<version>.dist-info/direct_url.json`, the `commit_id` is missing. However, this field is marked as MUST in the specification: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/direct-url-data-structure/#vcs-urls . Also, the `requested_revision` should be `main` instead of the precise commit id.

I can confirm this is broken by 0.5.22, possibly #10800

### Platform

macOS 15

### Version

uv 0.5.22 (4574ced37 2025-01-21)

### Python version

Python 3.11
