            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I found it surprising that removing dependencies from a script with inline metadata does not affect the auto-created virtual environment for that script when the script is run.</p>
<p>After opening #16241 and quite a bit of digging and trial and error, I discovered that <code>uv sync</code> supports a <code>--script</code> argument and that running sync is <em>different</em> from the automatic sync that happens with <code>uv run</code>. I now understand that this is by design and than <code>uv run --exact</code> can be used to perform exact syncing during a run. None of this is currently mentioned <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/">in the documentation page on running scripts</a>.</p>
<p>I have been using uv for managing scripts for many months but I am newer to using uv for projects. The default inexact nature of <code>uv run</code> makes sense within a project, but I don't think it makes as much sense for a script, since, as a script user I don't even know where the virtual environment for my script is and I didn't even know about <code>uv sync</code> until I saw it used in the context of a project.</p>
<p>I propose the documentation for running scripts be updated to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Note <code>uv run --exact --script &lt;path&gt;</code> and <code>uv sync --script &lt;path&gt;</code></li>
<li>Recommend a shebang line of <code>#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --exact --script</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I <em>really</em> enjoy uv scripts and how easy they are to use. There are only a few sharp edges I've noticed and this seems like one of them to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also see the option of making <code>uv run</code> exact by default for isolated environments, where it isn't destructive wrt to manually installed extras or packages in the project environment.</p>
