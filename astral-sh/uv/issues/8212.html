<p><code>uv 0.4.18</code>
Running <code>uv build --package my-project</code> in a project (within a workspace, though I suspect a more minimal repro is possible) where the workspace member package is laid out in a typical style:</p>
<pre><code>pyproject.toml
src/
    my_project/
        &lt; distinct lack of __init__.py &gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen this error a few times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it can be a confusing and frustrating error when there <em>is</em> a directory with that name.</p>
<p>The actual problem is that python doesn&#x27;t recognise the directory as a module/package due to the lack of <code>__init__.py</code>.</p>
<p>Forgetting/losing your <code>__init__.py</code> is a silly error to make but I think it&#x27;s common enough that it is worth mentioning in uv&#x27;s error that your directory also needs an <code>__init__.py</code>. You&#x27;ve done the hard part in naming the directory that is problematic.</p>
<p>I might suggest the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project) or that directory does not contain an __init__.py file.</p>
</blockquote>
Before

<pre><code>ValueError: Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel using the following heuristics: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#default-file-selection

The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project).

At least one file selection option must be defined in the `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel` table, see: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/

As an example, if you intend to ship a directory named `foo` that resides within a `src` directory located at the root of your project, you can define the following:

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = [&quot;src/foo&quot;]
</code></pre>


After

<pre><code>ValueError: Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel using the following heuristics: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#default-file-selection

The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project) or that directory does not contain an __init__.py file.

At least one file selection option must be defined in the `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel` table, see: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/

As an example, if you intend to ship a directory named `foo` that resides within a `src` directory located at the root of your project, you can define the following:

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = [&quot;src/foo&quot;]
</code></pre>


<p>Bonus points if uv actually checks and works out what is missing: __init__.py or the directory</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately those errors come from the build backend, which we don&#x27;t control. (In your case, it&#x27;s coming from <code>hatchling</code>.) I think this is something we can improve once we&#x27;ve shipped our own build backend (see #3957), but I&#x27;m hesitant to add our own error handling heuristics around this stuff since different build backends may treat these cases differently, they may rely on build backend-specific configuration, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I see, thanks for the clarification. I can go ask the same question at the hatchling repo.</p>
<p>Absolutely fine to close this, I agree it&#x27;s not your issue. Thank you for your excellent work with uv, it&#x27;s been a joy to use!</p>
