Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p><code>uv 0.4.18</code>
Running <code>uv build --package my-project</code> in a project (within a workspace, though I suspect a more minimal repro is possible) where the workspace member package is laid out in a typical style:</p>
<pre><code>pyproject.toml
src/
    my_project/
        &lt; distinct lack of __init__.py &gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I've seen this error a few times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it can be a confusing and frustrating error when there <em>is</em> a directory with that name.</p>
<p>The actual problem is that python doesn't recognise the directory as a module/package due to the lack of <code>__init__.py</code>.</p>
<p>Forgetting/losing your <code>__init__.py</code> is a silly error to make but I think it's common enough that it is worth mentioning in uv's error that your directory also needs an <code>__init__.py</code>. You've done the hard part in naming the directory that is problematic.</p>
<p>I might suggest the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project) or that directory does not contain an __init__.py file.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>ValueError: Unable to determine which files to ship inside the wheel using the following heuristics: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/wheel/#default-file-selection

The most likely cause of this is that there is no directory that matches the name of your project (my_project).

At least one file selection option must be defined in the `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel` table, see: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/

As an example, if you intend to ship a directory named `foo` that resides within a `src` directory located at the root of your project, you can define the following:

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = [&quot;src/foo&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>Bonus points if uv actually checks and works out what is missing: __init__.py or the directory</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately those errors come from the build backend, which we don't control. (In your case, it's coming from <code>hatchling</code>.) I think this is something we can improve once we've shipped our own build backend (see #3957), but I'm hesitant to add our own error handling heuristics around this stuff since different build backends may treat these cases differently, they may rely on build backend-specific configuration, etc.</p>

<p>Absolutely fine to close this, I agree it's not your issue. Thank you for your excellent work with uv, it's been a joy to use!</p>
