# Install non-build-isolation packages in a second phase

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-08-15 10:18_

This is a nice idea discussed in #15248. I think it's better to _discourage_ build isolation with `extra-build-dependencies`, but this will "do the right thing" in some common cases, like `flash-attn`.
