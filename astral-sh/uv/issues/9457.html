            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm on uv 0.5.4 (Homebrew 2024-11-20) and it doesn't appear there's a way to install dependency groups with <code>uv pip install</code> nor include it in compilation with <code>uv pip compile</code>.</p>
<p>Based on the PEP (cf. https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/#installing-dependency-groups), pip should eventually be able to do this with something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ pip install --dependency-groups=tests .
</code></pre>
<p>I wasn't able to find any evidence that an implementation has made it into pip's recent October v24.3.1 release nor mention on its changelog (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/).</p>
<p>Q: Is uv waiting for pip to establish an interface, then it will adopt it? I can see how implementing something that is different from pip might be problematic for maintaining compatibility.</p>
<p>For context, <code>uv sync</code> already does implement dependency groups with <code>--group</code> and related flags.</p>

<p>We're waiting for an upstream implementation. I'm engaging a lot on the design.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>sorry about that, I did in fact search the issue tracker, but didn't find those. Maybe you could also add the text &quot;dependency group&quot; / &quot;dependency groups&quot; without dashes to make it more findable!</p>
