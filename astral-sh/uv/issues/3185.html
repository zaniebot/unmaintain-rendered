Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Suggestion to remove the &quot;pip&quot; command from uv and just move all its subcommands to top level (install, freeze, list, sync, compile...). Instead of <code>uv pip install foo</code> we would be writing <code>uv install foo</code>.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easier to select executable uv/pip when writing scripts that could support both options in a transition period</li>
<li>Pip is the name of another project and the interface is not identical</li>
<li>Commands become shorter and direct to the point.</li>
<li>In a couple years no one will even remember what pip is.</li>
<li>It is still early in the uv life so that such a big change is still possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with the pip name, maybe</li>
<li>uv plans to have several other tools (like <code>uv run</code>), so a command like <code>uv check</code> could not be obvious that it is related to installed packages.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! Please see #1899.</p>
<p><code>uv install</code> will not be the same interface of <code>uv pip install</code> — we don't want to support all of the complexity of pip in our new workflow.</p>
