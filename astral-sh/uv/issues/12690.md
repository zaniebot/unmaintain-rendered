# Completely removing a package from cache

### Question

Let's say that I want to completely uninstall a package I got with uv from my PC - maybe I found out the installation was broken or compromised, maybe I just want to clean up disk space, or any other reason, really - how can I completely wipe a given package off of my computer?

here's what I tried:
```sh
$ uv init test
Initialized project `test` at `C:\code\python\test`
$ cd test
$ uv add numpy
Using CPython 3.12.8
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 2 packages in 331ms
Prepared 1 package in 9.20s                  # Note the 9.2 seconds it takes to download the package
Installed 1 package in 934ms
 + numpy==2.2.4

$ uv remove numpy
Resolved 1 package in 9ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 157ms
 - numpy==2.2.4
$ uv add numpy
Resolved 2 packages in 17ms
Installed 1 package in 958ms                 # Cached installation
 + numpy==2.2.4

$ uv pip uninstall numpy
Uninstalled 1 package in 320ms
 - numpy==2.2.4
$ uv add numpy
Resolved 2 packages in 1ms
Installed 1 package in 924ms                 # Cached installation
 + numpy==2.2.4

$ uv pip uninstall numpy --system
Using Python 3.12.8 environment at: C:\Users\Arseniy\AppData\Roaming\uv\python\cpython-3.12.8-windows-x86_64-none
error: The interpreter at C:\Users\Arseniy\AppData\Roaming\uv\python\cpython-3.12.8-windows-x86_64-none is externally managed, and indicates the following:

  This Python installation is managed by uv and should not be modified.

Consider creating a virtual environment with `uv venv`.

$ uv remove numpy --system
error: unexpected argument '--system' found

  tip: to pass '--system' as a value, use '-- --system'

Usage: uv.exe remove <PACKAGES>...

For more information, try '--help'.

$ uv --version
uv 0.6.12 (e4e03833f 2025-04-02)
```

### Platform

Windows 10 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.6.12 (e4e03833f 2025-04-02)

Okay, it turns out I needed to run both `uv cache clean numpy` AND `uv remove numpy` for it to work.
