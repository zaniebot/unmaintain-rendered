            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I know documentation states that <code>uv also makes the assumption that non-URL dependencies won't introduce URL dependencies</code>, but as we are taking care of around a hundred modules (some of which depends on external URL dependencies) it seems to be a blocker for us as we're not able to install package from registry, which introduces URL dependencies.
I was not able to find more information about this UV assumption - is such support planned to be implemented?
As we have a lot of dependencies between our modules it's impossible for us to add transitive URL dependencies as direct dependencies whenever it's needed.
Is there any way we can use UV in such situation?
Thank you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @mchromin. We're not actively working on lifting this assumption right now and I don't think it will be prioritized in the near future -- it breaks some assumptions in our resolver and isn't super common. Sorry about that. We can keep the issue open though -- perhaps we'll see more demand and can reconsider.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This also affects almost all of our internal packages and blocks us from using <code>uv</code>. Lots of internal packages depend on a core package and the core package depends on a URL dependency.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That one seems a bit easier: couldn't you just add that URL dependency as a direct dependency? But point taken!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could... but lots of packages would have to be updated and managed rather than the core dependency :)</p>
