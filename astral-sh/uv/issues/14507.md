# misleading docs for uv pip sync pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @Winand on 2025-07-08 14:12_

### Summary

According to #12644 and #12680 `uv pip sync` keeps only the dependencies from the input file.

But when I read in [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/#syncing-an-environment):

> To sync an environment with a requirements.txt file:
> 
>     uv pip sync requirements.txt
> 
> To sync an environment with a pyproject.toml file:
> 
>     uv pip sync pyproject.toml

I expect that `uv pip sync pyproject.toml` keeps transitive dependencies because usually _pyproject.toml_ includes only direct dependencies. Maybe it is worth noting that only the dependencies explicitly listed in _pyproject.toml_ will be kept?

### Platform

Windows 10

### Version

0.7.19

### Python version

Python 3.12

I honestly think we should remove that from the docs. It's almost always a mistake to use `pyproject.toml` with `uv pip sync`.

I agree.

My use case is to install project dependencies from an alternative index in an environment without internet access. So I export them and pass to pip sync via stdin: `uv export --frozen | uv pip sync -` 

At first I've thought that pip sync pyproject.toml does the same thing.
