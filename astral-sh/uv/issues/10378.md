# Documentation is not precise for conflicting groups

---

_Issue opened by @vmgustavo on 2025-01-07 21:21_

Here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#conflicts

The example usage is:

```toml
[tool.uv]
# Require that `package[test1]` and `package[test2]`
# requirements are resolved in different forks so that they
# cannot conflict with one another.
conflicts = [
    [
        { extra = "test1" },
        { extra = "test2" },
    ]
]

# Or, to declare conflicting groups:
conflicts = [
    [
        { group = "test1" },
        { group = "test2" },
    ]
]
```

The `{ group = "test1" }` is referring to a package extra or to a uv dependecy group?

Because the comments have `package[test1]` it seems that it is referring to a package extra, but there are two identical examples using the key `extra` and `group` so it should be referring to a group.
