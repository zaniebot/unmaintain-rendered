            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am currently writing a TOML Language Server called <a href="https://github.com/tombi-toml/tombi">Tombi</a>, and developing features for uv that make it easier to develop workspaces in Python (such as moving definitions between workspaces).</p>
<p>Tombi has an auto-sort feature, but <a href="https://tombi-toml.github.io/tombi/docs/json-schema">it needs additional information in the JSON Schema</a>.</p>
<p>Would you be interested in adding <code>x-tombi-*</code> for Tombi to uv's JSON Schema?</p>
<p>I am willing to submit a PR.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This is Cargo.toml, but it is an example of automatic sorting.</p>
<p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15abc0a5-b3dd-4da1-a2d3-8fff7932f834</p>
<p>Tombi uses Schemars to add extends.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why do you need the order in the schema itself, instead of using the existing one (as <code>uv add</code> does) or defining one that works for your plugin?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because Tombi targets more general TOML.</p>
<p>There are tools that do not offer features such as <code>uv add</code>,
and tools that simply append to the end of the table without auto-sorting.</p>
<p>In addition, even for normal properties rather than additionalProperties, there are requests for the order, such as wanting the name to come first.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-vocabularies/issues/7">Similar discussions are taking place in JSON Schema</a>, and I think the order of properties is within the scope of the Schema's role.</p>
<p>Also, Tombi doesn't provide any third-party extensions right now.
Auto-sorting should be easy to provide, and JSON Schema Store was picked as a place to get info without reading the docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At the current time, I don't think we want to add <code>x-tombi-*</code> metadata to the uv schema.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see.  I think the implementation should follow the decision of the project side.</p>
<p>Simply curious, what are some of the reasons why you are not looking for automatic sorting?</p>
<p>I met a user on the forum who said that he has disabled auto sorting because he has created a group with roles in dependencies.</p>
<p>Is there the same or another reason ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorting keys in an external tool is fine, it's just that we're always hesitant to add output that only applies for a specific tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That is a plausible reason!</p>
<p>I think we are done discussing here, so I will close this Issue.</p>
