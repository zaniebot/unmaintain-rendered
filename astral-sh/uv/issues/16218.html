<p>With Docker Compose I use an anonymous mount of .venv to prevent the host .venv from being used within the Docker container.</p>
<p>The container is used as a dev container, we don't even install dependencies or load until runtime.</p>
<p>However, if I do this, and I try and change the Python version, it seems UV tries to delete the .venv and since it is a mount, it errors out.</p>
<p>Minimal Reproduction example:</p>
<pre><code>% docker run --rm -it -v /app/.venv  ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:debian   /bin/bash
root@a0fc72adbd92:/# cd app
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# uv init
Initialized project `app`
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# rm .python-version
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# grep &quot;requires&quot;  pyproject.toml
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.13&quot;
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# uv sync
Using CPython 3.13.5 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 1 package in 3ms
Audited in 0.03ms
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# sed -i 's/^\(.*requires-python.*\)&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot;/\1&quot;==3.10.*&quot;/' pyproject.toml  #change the python version
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# uv sync
Using CPython 3.10.18
error: failed to remove directory `/app/.venv`: Resource busy (os error 16)
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# uv --version
uv 0.9.1
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app# ls .venv
root@a0fc72adbd92:/app#
</code></pre>
<p>The amusing thing is that in the process .venv actually gets cleared out.</p>
<p>Arguably this isn't a bug, I almost made it a feature request. It does fall a bit into the bug category since it said that removing .venv failed, despite emptying the contents.</p>
<p>When I found https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14815 I thought I was in luck, but it seems maybe that was a slightly different issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the work. I'm in the midst of moving the team to UV and we're pretty excited :) I might use the env var for switching the .venv folder as a workaround.</p>
