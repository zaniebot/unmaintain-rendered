            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When I specify a particular version of PyTorch (prior to 2.0), downloading with <code>uv</code> is very fast. However, when I use <code>uv pip install torch</code> to install the latest PyTorch (2.7.0), it takes an extremely long time to download and even encounters IO timeouts. I have to repeat the operation several times before it succeeds. Why is this happening? Is it due to my own network issues, or does the latest PyTorch include too many related libraries, or is there another problem? The error message is as follows: “ × Failed to download <code>nvidia-cudnn-cu12==9.10.2.21</code>
├─▶ Failed to extract archive: nvidia_cudnn_cu12-9.10.2.21-py3-none-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.whl
├─▶ I/O operation failed during extraction
╰─▶ Failed to download distribution due to network timeout. Try increasing UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT (current value: 30s).
help: <code>nvidia-cudnn-cu12</code> (v9.10.2.21) was included because <code>torch</code> (v2.8.0) depends on <code>nvidia-cudnn-cu12</code>”，However, when running multiple times, even when only the torch (2.7.0) package remains, it still takes a very long time to download, with the download speed being quite slow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you using any specific index settings? Otherwise there should be no major different between the torch versions, it does sound like a network problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. If no one else has encountered the same issue, it might indeed be a network problem. When I install torch's dependencies (such as nvidia_cudnn_cu12-9.10.2.21) independently, the download speed remains fast. However, when I attempt to install torch and its dependencies again directly, the network speed slows down significantly. This is genuinely perplexing.</p>
