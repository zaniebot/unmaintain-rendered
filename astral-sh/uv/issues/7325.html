            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My apologies if this has been asked and answered before, but I have searched these issues as well as the docs.</p>
<p>I have Python 3.12.5 installed from the following command: <code>uv python install 3.12</code>. Now that 3.12.6 is released, how do I upgrade to this version? I thought that perhaps re-running <code>uv python install 3.12</code> might install the newest minor version, but that didn't work. What is the correct workflow to upgrade to the newest version? Should I just uninstall <code>3.12</code> and then reinstall <code>3.12</code>? This doesn't appear to be addressed in the docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Docs here https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-install currently state (in the description of <code>--reinstall</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, uv will exit successfully if the version is already installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I think you want to add <code>--reinstall</code> to get what you want - that new new latest version 👌🏻 :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">uv python install --resinstall 3.12
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @jamescooke - that kinda achieves what I want, but I don't think it's great. The <code>--reinstall</code> option appears to always download and reinstall the latest version, even if the latest version is already installed. This makes sense because I'm telling <code>uv</code> to specifically reinstall it. Perhaps what is missing is an <code>--upgrade</code> option that will check if a new version is available first, and then only reinstall if needed - similar to the pip resolver.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @Odud - I think your problem warrants its own Issue.</p>
<p>I would pause now and create a new Issue with a description of the problem you're experiencing with not being able to upgrade to Python 3.13.</p>
<p>When you create that new issue by the way - sharing the output you received like from &quot;uv seems to know that the local version is available&quot; is helpful - however, it would be even more helpful to show the invocation / process to get that output. For example, are you running <code>uv python list</code> or similar? And what were the invocations before that? Is the virtualenv active? This will help people reading the issue to recreate it 🙏🏻</p>

Can we update the python version with <code>uv</code> without removing and remaking the entire venv?</p>
