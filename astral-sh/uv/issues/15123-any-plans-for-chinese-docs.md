# Any plans for Chinese docs?

---

_Issue opened by @yumeminami on 2025-08-07 07:58_

### Summary

Hi UV team,

First of all, thank you for creating such an excellent tool — it has significantly improved the experience of managing Python environments. 🙏

I’m wondering if there’s any plan to support Chinese documentation in the future? This would be incredibly helpful for many users in the Chinese-speaking community and could further promote adoption of the tool.

Thanks again for your great work!
