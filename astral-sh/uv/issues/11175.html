            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>my project is not intended to be built as a wheel or published, but i would like to be able to import other modules like so:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── foo/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── a.py
└── bar/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── b.py
</code></pre>
<pre><code># ./bar/b.py
from foo import a
</code></pre>
<p>however this is not possible unless i add and configure a build backend, which adds a lot of complexity to my project for functionality i don&#x27;t actually need.</p>
<p>all i want is to be able to add the project root directory to the python path. it would be nice if uv had an option to do this</p>
Example
<p>maybe something like this</p>
<pre><code># pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
python-paths = [&quot;.&quot;]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another similar use for this would be for &#x27;development&#x27; modules that live alongside a package that is built in a standard way.</p>
<p>For some internal packages we have a structure like:</p>
<pre><code>pyproject.toml
src/
   moo/
      __init__.py
      stuff.py
laboratory/
   __init__.py
   common/
      ...
   stuff/
      ...
tests/
   __init__.py
   ...
</code></pre>
<p>The code under <code>src/moo</code> is a module that we treat in a fairly standard way, and is depended upon by other internal packages, should have a build-backend, etc. etc.</p>
<p>But <code>laboratory</code> is intended to be a module too; but one that is only available when locally developing a package. (It contains a combination of extended documentation / prototyping of new algorithms / records of computational experiments.) The main point is that it has internal dependencies, and we write <code>import laboratory.common....</code> from within other places in <code>laboratory</code>.</p>
<p>Having the ability to specify an additional <code>python-path-extends</code> or similar field could be a neat solution to this I think. (Especially if it worked nicely with workspaces, and only modified the python path with the context from the active project -- when we have two modules, each with their own &#x27;laboratory&#x27; modules, we want to make sure only the one on the currently-in-use project is active)</p>

<pre><code>[tool.uv]

<p>to your <code>pyproject.toml</code> and run <code>uv sync</code>, then uv will install a minimal package to your environment that simply points to the modules at the root of your repository by their file path, making them importable without building them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>that just means use a build backend. specifying <code>package = true</code> without specifying a build system makes it default to using setuptools (<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#build-systems">this behavior is mentioned in the docs here</a>).</p>
<p>in my case, setuptools refuses to build my project because there are multiple top-level packages which means i have to figure out how to configure it to build a package that i don&#x27;t even want to build in the first place, which is what i&#x27;m trying to avoid</p>

      To avoid accidental inclusion of unwanted files or directories,
      setuptools will not proceed with this build.

      If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
      on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
      Instead, consider the following options:

      1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
      2. use a `src-layout`
      3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names

      To find more information, look for &quot;package discovery&quot; on setuptools docs.

      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
</code></pre>
<p>relying on setuptools doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea especially since it&#x27;s got <code>__legacy__</code> in the name. for now as a workaround i&#x27;m just using uv&#x27;s work-in-progress build backend (#8779) with an empty package matching the name of the project.</p>
<p>honestly now that i&#x27;m using uv i don&#x27;t want to have to touch any of these legacy tools ever again. they are just too painful to deal with</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We&#x27;re experiencing a problem which seems related to this: there seems to be no way of including a top-level module outside of the <code>src</code>  tree in a (editable) install. In our case, we have a Flask app configured with a <code>config.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>├── config.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── app
├── settings.toml
└── uv.lock
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the app, we import settings with</p>
<pre><code>from config import settings
</code></pre>
<p>This used to work fine with Poetry, but with uv we get <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#x27;config&#x27;</code>. It would be really useful if this could be solved somehow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a solution that allows importing .py files from the top-level like @oelhammouchi asked about? I&#x27;m also running into this.</p>
<p>@trim21 &#x27;s solution of <code>echo $(pwd) &gt; .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/_project.pth</code> works but doesn&#x27;t feel like something I can check-in to Git (it hardcodes the Python version). Running <code>PYTHONPATH=&quot;$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)&quot; uv ...</code> also works but is ugly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that the <code>[tool.setuptools]</code> solution relies on configuring a build backend implicitly, though the PEP 517 legacy fallback. I recommend configuring a build backend explicitly (it&#x27;s 3 lines for the <code>[build-system]</code> table), and configuring it to include the modules you want to import. Both hatchling and uv-build can be configured to include multiple top-level modules.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The best way to achieve this is to move <code>laboratory</code> a directory down and give it it&#x27;s own minimal <code>pyproject.toml</code>. I generally recommend trying to build a native python package structure with a <code>pyproject.toml</code> and one top level module name. It&#x27;s more boilerplate than having the project root in <code>sys.path</code>, but it avoids some common problems later and it&#x27;s better accessible to tools and IDEs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>looks like i can use uv&#x27;s build backend and specify no module names:</p>
<pre><code># pyproject.toml

[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-root = &quot;.&quot;
module-name = []
</code></pre>
<p>this is pretty much exactly what i need, since i don&#x27;t want to have to maintain a separate list of top-level module names in my project since it never gets built as a wheel.</p>
