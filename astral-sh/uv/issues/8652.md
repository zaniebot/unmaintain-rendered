# Create venv from script metadata

---

_Issue opened by @satwell on 2024-10-29 01:54_

Being able to `uv run` a script with PEP 723 metadata is really cool.

But it seems like uv is missing a way to create a venv for the script.  Having a venv with script dependencies is useful for development, so that my editor can provide auto-completion, type checking, etc.

My workaround is to maintain the same dependency list in a separate `pyproject.toml` file, which lets me easily sync to a venv.  But that means I need to maintain the same dependency list in two places, which is not ideal.

#8609 would be a step towards this

May be duplicate of #6637

This would be a hugely helpful feature.
