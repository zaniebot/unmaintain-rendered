# Add copies of activations scripts in standard location for windows

---

_@elupus_

### Summary

It would be nice if  `uv` could add activation script copies at the same locations as the linux builds for windows builds. To avoid the silly difference in paths. That is .venv/Scripts/activate on windows and .venv/bin/activate on all other platforms. 



### Example
