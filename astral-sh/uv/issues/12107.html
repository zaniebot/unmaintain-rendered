            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The --all-packages was added in 0.4 but took me a while to figure out that it was available because it has not yet made it to the documentation so had to trawl the issues and eventually found it in this very long issue:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7143</p>
<p>Is a doxcumentation update currently in the pipeline for this feature or should I raise a PR with an initial attempt  to provide documentation on this feature so that others using the workspace feature won't need to go the same route as I did?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Did you consider looking in the CLI help? I think we could put something for <code>--package</code> and <code>--all-packages</code> in <code>sync.md</code> thoiugh @zanieb.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is --all-packages supposed to do when there are no workspace members specified? It seems to be installing the current project, even with</p>
<p><code>uv sync --no-install-workspace --no-dev --no-editable --all-packages --frozen</code></p>
<p>which is suprising.</p>
<p>Apologies for piling on, but the sync options are really need better documentation (in CLI, on the web). It's really hard to tell what each does with all the possible permutations.</p>
