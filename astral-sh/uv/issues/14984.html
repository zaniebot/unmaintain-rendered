            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: <code>#(ve3)/ve3: uv run --offline --project /script/ /script/script.py &lt;params&gt;</code> ?</p>
<p>I'm developing a script <code>/script/script.py</code> that has its own dedicated project venv under <code>/script/.venv</code>. I don't want:</p>
<p>a. <code>uv</code> to create either implicit or temporary venvs for <code>script.py</code> because I already have exactly what I need under <code>/script/.venv</code>.
b. to install the script globally/systemwide. (<code>uv</code> itself however, is installed globally/systemwide.)</p>
<p>This script is used to operate on <em>other</em> python projects that might have their own project venv under <code>$PWD/.venv</code> but I don't want <code>uv</code> to even read or attempt to load those orthogonal venvs during those invocations.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>: Given that I'm at <code>/ve3/</code> which is a Python project with it's own, active venv under <code>/ve3/.venv</code>, I would like to launch <code>/script/script.py</code> while passing it some parameters <code>&lt;params&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Is this the best and correct way:</p>
<p><code>#(ve3)/ve3: uv run --offline --project /script/ /script/script.py &lt;params&gt;</code></p>
<p>I realize <code>--offline</code> could be redundant but I put that in as a &quot;paranoid option&quot; in case <code>uv</code>, for some reason decided to update packages for <code>script.py</code> or the project at CWD as I only want <code>uv</code> to invoke the script without <code>uv</code> affecting any changes. If this fear is completely misplaced, let me know so I can remove this flag.</p>
<p>Further questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the command <code>uv run --python /script/.venv /script/script.py &lt;params&gt;</code> literally use the specific python executable under /script/.venv without also activating the venv available to <code>script.py</code>? This would mean <code>--python</code> isn't the behavior I need for my use-case?</li>
<li>When using this command, <code>uv</code> shows this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv` does not match the project environment path `/ve3/.venv` and will be ignored; use `--active` to target the active environment instead
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to suppress only this specific message? I would like to view any and all other messages
3. If <code>/script/script.py</code> was my own personal fork of <a href="https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider">aider</a>, would you recommend a different way of running it?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>LINUX</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
