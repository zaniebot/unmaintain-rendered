            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue is similar but not quite the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7911.</p>
<p>I make use of <code>hatch-protobuf</code> for building protobufs. This package in turn depends on <code>grpcio-tools</code>, but since <code>uv</code> doesn't track plugin dependencies in its lockfile, my CI pipeline just broke due to a version mismatch between <code>grpcio-tools</code> codegen and <code>grpcio</code> runtime.</p>
<p>Working around this directly in <code>pyproject.toml</code> by specifying all dependencies would be annoying as <code>grpcio-tools</code> has its own set of dependencies.</p>
<p>I believe it makes sense for build dependencies to be properly locked to prevent CI pipelines from breaking.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this can probably be merged into https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7052 which is the general issue we're using to track build dependency locking.</p>
