# Error message when running uv venv and having a .python-version file

---

_Issue opened by @TheUncharted on 2024-10-22 10:05_

In my project i have a .python-version file 
I want to create a virtual env with the commands 

```bash
uv venv

or

uv venv myvenv
```

But I got this error message "No interpreter found for executable name `myproject` in managed installations or system path"
Is there a way to force the creation of the virtual env ?

What's in your `.python-version` file? Sounds like it's `"myproject"` which tells us to look for an executable with that name.

Maybe you want `uv venv --no-config` to avoid reading the file?
