            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps this is possible already, but I tried both looking in the documentation and in the code but was not able to figure out a  way, if it is already possible, sorry for the extra work…</p>
<p>In the section of the docs regarding <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">script dependencies</a> (which is a GREAT feature!), it shows example output which does not have the &quot;Reading inline script metadata from: example.py&quot; line at the top.</p>
<p>I can't seem to replicate the behaviour though, and it looked to my inexperienced Rust eyes that it is in fact always printed to stderr if it is a script being run.</p>
<p>Would love to have a config setting possibility to not print this line, and only the output (if any) from the script.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb nope! thanks! i should have found that one, i was mainly looking in the scripts part (as the run command doesn't give output generally while running in projects), but I should have checked the <code>--help</code> as well (or the corresponding page).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I did put it in my alias now, so for my workflow it works out nicely :) Sorry for the extra ticket and thanks for all your great work!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is this output necessary to have by default? I've just tried out <code>uv run</code> for the first time with a script that has the inline metadata specified. My expectation was that it does not print that, only if I call it with <code>--verbose</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems generally helpful to understand that your invocation is going to run in an entirely different environment than other <code>uv run</code> requests. What's the problem with the output?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Apologies, that was my bad. I realized after using it more that there is more output that can be shown besides the one line that I saw &quot;Reading inline script metadata from: ...&quot;.</p>

<p>why should the output of &quot;uv run hello.py&quot;  be different than python hello.py?</p>
<pre><code>uv run -q hello.py

Hello world!
</code></pre>
<p>This still prints a newline, which can be annoying/breaking if you need to pipe the output for further processing.</p>
