# Optimize binary size approaches

---

_Issue opened by @kristi-balla on 2025-05-08 13:40_

I am a fan of uv and came across [this](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/145fe4e7e3a941a7396703a00c357b1455204c12/Dockerfile#L45) TODO. I was wondering if there is any progress in this regard. I've been playing around with `upx` for statically linked java binaries and think it could bring something here as well. 

That being said, I don't want to take work away from someone, but am willing to support/work on this if needed

Hi! I'm the one who originally wrote that comment; I'm not actually sure whether it applies anymore, we've since changed our stripping strategy to make better use of Cargo's stripping. I haven't tested this since, so if find ways to do better (cross platform) stripping in docker, I'd be very interested. If we can show that the binaries are currently already completely stripped, we can remove the comment.

Re binary size in general, we put performance over (reasonable) binary size, so e.g. opt-level "z" wouldn't be the right choice for uv.

Hey, thanks for the fast reply! I understand, then I'll invest a weekend or two on this. I am aware of the performance focus of uv, but it'd be nice to see how far it can go. In the end, even a 0-result would be enough to remove the TODO ;)
