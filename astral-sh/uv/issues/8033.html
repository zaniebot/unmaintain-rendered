            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if this expected but I noticed <code>uv publish</code> uploaded every single file it found in <code>/dist</code> to (our private) pypi. On the plus side this surfaced a build script bug (post-build clean step not running) - but it was a little suprising.</p>
<p>The behaviour of <code>poetry publish</code> is to only publish the <code>the package, previously built with the build command</code> - i.e. (I&#x27;m assuming) it uses the version from pyproject.toml to ensure the correct sdist / wheel is uploaded.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think this is a duplicate, though this is sort of discussed there.</p>
<p>I think this behavior is pretty reasonable, though maybe we can improve it or have different modes? I think we&#x27;d need to read the package from the <code>pyproject.toml</code> if we wanted to limit the scope.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also wheel/sdist filenames contain a version string that&#x27;s &quot;canonicalised&quot; and doens&#x27;t necesarily match the version string in <code>pyproject.toml</code> - in order to get the filename of the wheel in my ci process (in which the version is generated by <code>python-semantic-release</code> I had to use the <code>packaging</code> package, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>from packaging.version import Version

def canonicalise(version: str):
    return str(Version(version))

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah but that’s just the {version} in the package filename though right? The actual package version doesn’t have to be canonical as far as I’m aware?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The spec says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version numbers should be normalised according to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers">Version specifier specification</a>. Normalised version numbers cannot contain -.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The critical part is that we can&#x27;t have the <code>-</code> in a version because then you can&#x27;t tell whether it&#x27;s part of the version or starting the next section in the wheel filename.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&#x27;d recommend cleaning the dist directory before doing a new publish and then relying on globs to find your files, basically the workflow below:</p>
<pre><code>rm -r dist/
uv build
[other uv build command if you publish a workspace]
[smoke test commands, such as installing the `mypkg-*.tar.gz`/`mypkg-*.whl` in a fresh venv and running `python -c &quot;import mypkg&quot;`]
uv publish
</code></pre>
<p>Would a workflow like that work for your use case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/david-waterworth">@david-waterworth</a> on 2024-10-12 21:29</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I understand that - &quot;The canonical public version identifiers MUST comply with the following scheme:&quot; <code>[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]</code> and the filename needs to contain the canonicalized version for the reason you mention.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t think the package version needs to - i.e. later in the same document</p>
<pre><code>Post releases allow a .,-, or _ separator as well as omitting the separator all together. The normal form of this is with the . separator. This allows versions such as 1.2-post2 or 1.2post2 which normalize to 1.2.post2.
</code></pre>
<p>So it&#x27;s allowed to have the version in the project.toml to contain <code>1.2-post2</code> but the build backend must canonicalise this - so the point I was trying to make is given a valid version, in order to find the corresponding wheel you need to canonicalise it - but you also must not enfore that the version string is canonical in the first place as far as I understand. So you should expect that that matching a wheel to a valid version isn&#x27;t trivial.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s no big deal though, I&#x27;ve already updated our build process to ensure that the dist folder was cleaned out (along with ensuring it doesn&#x27;t publish the same version twice) to ensure uv behaves in the same manner as poetry. So I&#x27;m fine if you want to close this as not doing.</p>
