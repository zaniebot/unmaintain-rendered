<p>Hi, thanks for the amazing tool <code>uv</code>. I am making a python package <a href="https://github.com/IISc-Software-iGEM/bept">bept</a> for some project.
I am new to python packages and I wanted to know that in my <a href="https://github.com/IISc-Software-iGEM/bept/blob/main/src/bept/main.py">src/bept/main.py</a>, I am using <code>bept.something.somefile</code>, but is there a way i can do <code>src.bept.something</code>, that way I would be able to access some files outside of <code>src</code>. (or is there any other way for it? main goal: have test directory use codes in src.)
I know its a bit case specific, but some help would be really appreciated!</p>
<p>Current version of uv = 0.4.15</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @AnirudhG07,</p>
<p>I think this is usually done by installing your package in a virtual environment in an <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/#editable-packages">editable mode</a> (so that any changes that you make are immediately reflected), and then you can refer to your package and modules from your tests as you normally would (e.g. <code>bept.something</code>).</p>
<p>For example if you use pytest</p>
<pre><code>uv venv
uv pip install --editable .
. .venv/bin/activate
pytest
</code></pre>
<p>If you use the more modern workflow that <code>uv</code> shipped in version 0.4, I think simply running your test command via <code>uv run</code> should take care of all that automatically. (but I don&#x27;t have that much experience here)</p>
