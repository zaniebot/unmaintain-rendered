_Issue opened by @zzm-note on 2024-03-21 09:23_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
platform：windows 10
uv version：0.1.23

I have a standalone installation scripts, so there shouldn't be this warning, right? 
If there is no latest version, should the latest version be prompted?

Can confirm, the self updater doesn't work on windows:
```console
> powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
Downloading uv 0.1.23 (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)
Installing to C:\Users\Konstantin\.cargo\bin
  uv.exe
Everything's installed!
> uv self update -v
DEBUG receipt is not for this executable; assuming `uv` was installed via a package manager
warning: Self-update is only available for `uv` binaries installed via the standalone installation scripts.

If you installed `uv` with `pip`, `brew`, or another package manager, update `uv` with `pip install --upgrade`, `brew upgrade`, or similar.
> where.exe uv
C:\Users\Konstantin\.cargo\bin\uv.exe
```
