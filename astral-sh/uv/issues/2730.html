            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Historically, pip has had a <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2361">hard time</a> with multiple instances running concurrently. Pip's cache could get corrupted, the venv could get corrupted, etc.</p>
<p>Is it safe to run multiple instances of <code>uv pip install ...</code> against the same venv at the same time? I don't see this documented on the markdown landing page. It would be great if <code>uv</code> could be run concurrently, even if the strategy is just &quot;lock the entire venv&quot; and have the other <code>uv</code> instance(s) block.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we designed uv with this in mind. There are two components to it: (1) we do lock the venv when installing, and (2) the cache is designed to be append-only (so installing into separate venvs concurrently should also be fine).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's great to hear! Could I ask that this be part of the documentation? It would help people with pip scars  :)</p>
