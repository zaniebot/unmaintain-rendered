            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>It would be nice if uv provided a way to &quot;re-initialize&quot; a project, e.g. as a different kind of project (application vs library, package vs no-package) than the one originally selected.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>uv's default of initializing projects as applications without a build backend defined in <code>pyproject.toml</code> (or source distributions subsequently built using <code>uv build</code>) may be confusing for people coming from other Python packaging tools (see also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7181). Once they've figured out what's going on, many will want to change their project to a different kind, e.g. to a library.</p>
<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>People can re-initialize their project from scratch at any time by just deleting <code>pyproject.toml</code> and re-running <code>uv init</code> (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7198 will make this more obvious). So I guess this feature is very low-priority, but might be nice to have.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another use-case for allowing re-init (aside from eg switching a uv project from &quot;app&quot; to &quot;lib&quot; etc): A project that has a <code>pyproject.toml</code> already (eg to hold various <code>[tool.*]</code> config) that then wants to migrate to uv from say pip/requirements files. Such a project will have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> that is likely missing the <code>[project]</code> table.</p>
<p>Although supporting this will require the ability to merge in the template <code>pyproject.toml</code> to the existing content, rather than replacing it outright.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(The context for this for us at Heroku is to make it easier for us to write future guides/blog posts along the lines of &quot;Heroku now supports uv; here's how you can try it out with your new/existing/... project&quot; whilst having to cover as few of the permutations as possible via explicit steps. ie: If we can tell end users to run <code>uv init</code> and it interactively prompts appropriately for an existing vs new project etc, then it takes a lot of the boilerplate away from our guide.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@edmorley I guess that would be a mixture between this feature and</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6277,</li>
</ul>
<p>which, I think, would do most/all of what you want, except it wouldn't modify <code>pyproject.toml</code> in-place and would require a separate CLI flag instead of being an interactively selectable option of <code>uv init</code>.</p>
<p>In my mind, the re-initialization feature requested in this issue here was going to be triggered by a CLI flag as well, something like <code>uv init --reinit</code>. But I agree that prompting the user interactively in a simple <code>uv init</code> invocation might be cool, too.</p>
