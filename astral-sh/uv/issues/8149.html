            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When I introduce <code>uv</code> to my colleagues, a surprising number of them ask me &quot;what does <code>uv</code> stand for?&quot; or &quot;where did that name come from?&quot;.</p>
<p>Some come up with their own interpretations such as &quot;ultraviolet light = fast&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>Is there anything documented about the origin of the name &quot;uv&quot;, if only so I can point the extra curious folks at? Was it simply chosen as a short CLI name that didn't conflict with other Linux utilities? Is there a deeper meaning known only to Charlie? 😄</p>

<p>We considered a ton of names — it's really hard to pick a name without collisions this day so every name was a balance of tradeoffs.</p>
<p>uv was given to us on PyPI, is Astral-themed (i.e. <strong>ultraviolet</strong> or <strong>universal</strong>), and is short and easy to type.</p>
<p>🤷‍♀️</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah for me it's short for &quot;ultraviolet&quot; though we liked that there were a few different possible interpretations. We wanted something that was (1) available on PyPI and elsewhere, (2) had minimal conflicts with other software projects, and (3) was easy to type!</p>
