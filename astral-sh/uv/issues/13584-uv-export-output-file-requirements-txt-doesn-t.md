# `uv export --output-file=../requirements.txt` doesn't resolve package paths to output file

---

_Issue opened by @manzt on 2025-05-21 20:17_

### Question

Not totally sure if this is a bug or something that could be resolved, but:

```sh
uv init --lib my_package
uv init --script foo.py
uv add ./my_package
uv export --script foo.py --output-file ../requirements.txt
cat ../requirements.txt
# # This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
# #    uv export --script foo.py --output-file ../requirements.txt
# # ./my_package
```

I expected `./my_package` to be rewritten as a path valid from the output file’s location, like `./folder/my_package` or an absolute path.

### Platform

Darwin 24.4.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.7.6 (7f3e94a09 2025-05-19)

I could see arguments either way, though I think `uv pip install -r ../requirements.txt` will interpret paths as relative to the CWD, which matches pip? In which case, writing _these_ paths relative to the CWD ensures that `uv pip install -r ../requirements.txt` works after exporting.

Thanks for the response. Sure that makes sense to me, I could see an argument both ways as well and hadn't considered the `pip` compatibility. Thanks for the clarification!

I would honestly prefer that both are relative to the file, but alas.

Agreed. One idea would be a flag to canonicalize relative paths, which would make the `requirements.txt` more portable on a single machine. e.g.,

```sh
uv export --script foo.py --canonicalize-paths > requirements.txt
```

of course, doesn't change the behavior of relative paths but might help for some use cases.
