            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <code>pip compile</code>, we take special care to write out editables and relative paths as unnamed URLs. But uv supports PEP 508 requirements for editables, and allows relative URLs too. Should we just write them out in full form? The output <code>requirements.txt</code> won't work with pip, since pip does not yet support PEP 508 for editables, so we'd need to have a <code>--pip-compat</code> flag or similar to allow that behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Concretely, see <code>RequirementsTxtDist::to_requirements_txt</code>. In theory, we shouldn't need that special-casing. We can write <code>-e</code> for an editable, then write a PEP 508 requirement in either case.</p>
