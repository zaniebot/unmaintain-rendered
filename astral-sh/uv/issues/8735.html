            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We are trying to centralise all of our libraries in a mono-repo, some of which are interdependent.</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;test&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python=&quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
&quot;c&quot;,
&quot;d&quot;
]

[tool.uv.sources]
c = { git = &quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/workspace-virtual-root-test&quot;, subdirectory = &quot;packages/c&quot; }
d = { git = &quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/workspace-virtual-root-test&quot;, subdirectory = &quot;packages/d&quot; }

[build-system]
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Rather than needing to add each subdirectory as a source, it would be nice to be able to add all the modules belonging to a virtual workspace as one source which exposes multiple packages.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.sources]
{ git_workspace = &quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/workspace-virtual-root-test&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: Realised that 0.42.9 fixed my original issue so turning it from a two parter into a more targeted request!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ran into this need aswell. Was trying to move away from hatch relative packages. But the resolver did not like just pointing to a workspace package in a git repo with sub directory packages as workspace members.</p>
<p>You really just want to specify the git path and revision once for the full workspace set.</p>
