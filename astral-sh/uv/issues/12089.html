            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm hoping this is an easy one, and technically it is perhaps not related to uv but rather virtual environments. However, I figured there might be some nice tricks that uv provides that could help ...</p>
<p>I have an awkward situation where a package is not installable by pip (or, uv, rather). Instead, the package comes with a Debian package installation and is located here:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
</code></pre>
<p>However, I would like the package to be accessible from within a virtual environment.</p>
<p>I'm thinking to try this:</p>
<pre><code>export PYTHONPATH=&quot;/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages:$PYTHONPATH&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>However, I'm not confident that this will work at this stage. I will try this, but I was wondering if uv could help manage this out of the box, in someway ...</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Darwin 23.5.0 arm64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.0</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can try using the system interpreter and system site packages with <code>uv venv -p &lt;path to system python&gt; --system-site-packages</code>. The latter option should allow you to use the package (even though <code>uv pip list</code> currently doesn't see the package).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Thanks for this Konstin.</p>
<p>So, just to be sure, the command to run here is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv venv -p /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages --system-site-packages
</code></pre>
<p>🙏</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's <code>uv venv -p /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages</code>, but it depends on your distro. Try it out - with venvs, you can't break much, <code>rm -rf .venv</code> cleans it all up again.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Hi Konstin, unfortunately, this did not work. I want to install the package into the venv ... the global python interpreter is a different version that required, I need to pull the library located in <code>/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages</code> into the venv ...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately, I don't think we can support this across Python versions, packages often contain version-specific modules.</p>
