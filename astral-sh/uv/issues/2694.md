# Replace custom `Finder` with `Resolver` in `pip sync`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-03-27 16:20_

We see bug from time-to-time that only manifest themselves in `pip sync`. The issue is that `pip sync` uses a custom mini-resolver to take advantage of the fact that we expect versions to be pinned.

I think the resolver is now optimized enough that this shouldn't really matter. Let's try removing the `Finder` and doing some basic benchmarking.
