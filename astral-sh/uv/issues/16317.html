            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I maintain a codebase that uses bazel (and rules_python) to manage running and testing a mix of Python and C++. I’d like to migrate to using
pyproject.toml to be the source of truth for python deps, so that devs can do <code>uv run</code> and invoke pytest directly. The problem is I still need to invoke bazel to build some C++ Python extension modules, which is easy enough to do in setup.py, but in factoring out the bazel-specific bits into a reusable module, I find uv will often copy the sources into a temp directory in order to build, which makes it hard/impossible to get back to the original source tree in order to invoke bazel. I don’t want to have setup.py cloning my large repo, I want to use the existing checkout as there will often be local changes, but how do I safely/reliably pass file system paths needed for bazel through pyproject.toml/setup.py?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's two ways to build a wheel for a package: Build the from the source tree (your repository) directly, or build a source distribution first, unpack that source distribution in a temporary directory and build the wheel from that source distribution. This is independent of whether a <code>pyproject.toml</code> exists, it depends on which PEP 517 mechanism the build tool (in a package manager) uses. You can do a direct build with uv with <code>uv build --wheel</code>.</p>
