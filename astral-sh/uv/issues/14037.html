            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>It would be helpful if <code>uv</code> build-backend supported Git-based versioning out of the box, similar to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm"><code>setuptools-scm</code></a> – <a href="https://github.com/search?q=tool.setuptools_scm++path%3A**%2Fpyproject.toml&amp;type=code&amp;p=3">20k+ references</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs"><code>hatch-vcs</code></a> – <a href="https://github.com/search?q=hatch-vcs++path%3A**%2Fpyproject.toml&amp;type=code">6k+ references</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning"><code>poetry-dynamic-versioning</code></a> – <a href="https://github.com/search?q=tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning++path%3A**%2Fpyproject.toml&amp;type=code">2k+ references</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These tools infer versions from Git tags/commits and are widely used in Python packaging workflows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IIRC <code>pdm-backend</code> allows for dynamic versions to be wired using a <a href="https://backend.pdm-project.org/metadata/#get-with-a-specific-function">fairly simple entrypoint-like <code>package.module:function</code> syntax</a>.</p>
<p>I think such a solution would work very nicely as a MVP (if not even a final solution), as the community can easily come up with a whole host of build system plugins. In fact I reckon a lot of pre-existing plugins could be upcycled with no extra work.</p>

<p>Is this feature on the roadmap? This is our last hurdle in ditching setuptools_scm and completely moving to uv build backend</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would be great to see this supported, it would simplify build&amp;deploy pipelines. Calling <code>uv version</code> is an extra step which causes changes to the codebase and just unnecessary extra complexity.
It is blocking us from migrating our libraries to <code>uv_build</code>. I have also seen OSS projects which are migrating to <code>uv</code> but in the process need to use <code>setuptools</code> or <code>hatchling</code> instead of <code>uv_build</code> because of this missing feature, seems like a missed opportunity for uv [build] :)</p>

<p>You can switch to uv and keep hatchling around as the build backend.</p>

<p>I have made that switch, but wonder what niche uv_build is meant to fill if hatchling provides a decent backend for uv?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The first niche it&#x27;s intended to fill is good out of the box user experience for basic project workflows, i.e., not even necessarily cases where you&#x27;re publishing packages or worrying about version management techniques. The initial goal was to build something that integrates well with uv and addresses early pain points for users who aren&#x27;t used to having a build system. We&#x27;ll be exploring expanding the use cases it serves — it already has most of the common settings you&#x27;d need, but there are more advanced stories we haven&#x27;t solved yet. This particular feature is hard because it introduces dynamic project metadata, which is broadly problematic in the packaging ecosystem and not something we want to casually embrace.</p>
