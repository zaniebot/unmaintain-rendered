            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There have been previous issues discussing conda, but given the current support for it, I don't see it as a priority in the near future.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>It seems that uv doesn't support conda packages yet, so it might be too early to completely replace it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for your reply. Judging from the description of uv, it appears that some C++ shared object (.so) library dependencies cannot be properly handled in uv. This is a significant strength of conda. Literally, some Python libraries such as torch, librosa, and sox-python, etc., require their own.sos. Some even need a more appropriate libstdc++ ABI. In this regard, what is the current support status of uv?</p>
<p>If this can be supported, wouldn't conda can move into trash?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be awesome if uv could install a <code>.conda</code> package into a venv.</p>
<p>On Windows, and likely other platforms, Anaconda bundles hundreds of these <code>.conda</code> packages in the <code>anaconda3/pkgs</code> directory. If one could use this directory as a package source (index) for uv, that would be sweet. uv makes environments way faster than conda.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it looks like <code>conda convert</code> could be used to turn the conda packages into wheels, which <code>uv</code> knows how to work with.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the exact sequence of commands should look like.</p>
