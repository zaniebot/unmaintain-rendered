# `uv run` fails on centos 7

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-05-04 08:11_

We need to exit early if the python version is lower than 3.7.

```
$ uv run
warning: `uv run` is experimental and may change without warning.

Not really sure what the right behavior is here -- just a better error message?

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-05-04 18:56_

Yeah I think interpreter queries should fail with a better error message.

Note Centos 7 will be EOL soon (June 2024)
To install modern versions of python on it I've had resort to building from source.
