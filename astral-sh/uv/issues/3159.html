            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By default, <code>pip --upgrade</code> only upgrades packages specified on pip’s command line. Ideally, at least dependencies would also be considered. This can be fixed with <code>--upgrade-strategy eager</code>.</p>
<p>What is the default behavior of <code>uv</code>? If dependencies are not considered, could <code>--upgrade-strategy eager</code> be added as an option?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By default, we don't try to upgrade installed packages. But if you run with <code>--upgrade</code>, we attempt to upgrade all packages. You can also pass <code>--upgrade-package flask</code> to only upgrade a single package.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What do you mean by &quot;we attempt to upgrade all packages&quot;?</p>
<p>If you run <code>pip install --upgrade flask</code> it will only upgrade flask. However, if you run <code>pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager flask</code> it will upgrade flask and its requirements.</p>
<p>So what does <code>uv pip install --upgrade flask</code> do? Does it upgrade dependencies as well then?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did a quick test and <code>uv pip install --upgrade</code> upgrades indeed dependencies as well. That's great. Maybe it should be noted though in <a href="../blob/main/PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md">PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md</a>?</p>
