            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Incompatibility: If pip-compile is invoked for a file requirements/dev.in and this file includes <code>-r common.in</code>, the included file will be searched in the same directory (requirements/) where the including file is located. <code>uv pip compile requirements/dev.in</code> obviously tries (and fails) to resolve the include from the caller's working directory.</p>
