            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! First and foremost, thank you for this fantastic tool!</p>
<p>I am trying to use uv in a library that uses such syntax in the requirements.txt file:</p>
<pre><code>file:./libs/path_where_pyprojecttoml
</code></pre>
<p>When using pip, all works fine, but uv fails with the following exception:</p>
<pre><code>error: Error parsing included file in `build/pip/dev_requirements.txt` at position 0
  Caused by: Unsupported requirement in build/pip/base_requirements.txt at position 467
  Caused by: URL requirement must be preceded by a package name. Add the name of the package before the URL (e.g., `package_name @ https://...`).
file:./libs/path_where_pyprojecttoml
</code></pre>
<p>Is this a feature defined by the PEP but not supported by the uv? I couldn't find any references to such a functionality; perhaps pip decided to include it without any specification.</p>
<p>Simple repro (you have already installed uv):</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">git clone https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp

uv pip install &quot;file:./ruff-lsp&quot;  # fails
pip install &quot;file:./ruff-lsp&quot; # ok
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is supported as of <code>v0.1.24</code>. You can <code>uv pip install file:./libs/path_where_pyprojecttoml</code> directly, without including a package name.</p>
