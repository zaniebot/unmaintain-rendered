            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I recently learned that PyPI will reject package uploads if the package metadata has one or more classifiers starting with <code>Private ::</code>. I got interested because some of my projects have private version that should never end up on PyPI. But I was left wondering if I could really use this classifier, because my users must be able to upload the private packages to their own private registries, if they want to, and I was afraid the classifier would cause rejection in these alternate registries too. This is not addressed in official docs, but in <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/publish/">your own docs</a> you do say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not affect security or privacy settings on alternative registries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x27;s interesting! I am now curious to know if you actually checked common alternate registries (Google Cloud Platform Artifact Registry, JFrog&#x27;s Artifactory, pypiserver, devpi, others?) to confirm whether they actually don&#x27;t care about such classifiers 🙂</p>
<p>I have found <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8214">astral-sh/uv#8214</a>, in which I also posted my use-case, though didn&#x27;t want to derail the conversation for this specific question.</p>
<p>You have great documentation, thank you for it!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Private repository servers do NOT restrict the permitted trove classifiers (if they offer a classifier filtering capability at all, it&#x27;s an opt-in feature when setting up a specific repository).</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why the <code>Private :: ...</code> classifier convention emerged: PyPI checks it, nobody else does. The lack of documentation in the other repository server implementations is because not checking is the assumed default - PyPI checking them is the exceptional case (and hence the documented one).</p>
<p>For the docs reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#x27;s no mention of filtering uploads based on classifier values in the field specification: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#classifier-multiple-use</li>
<li>PyPI docs explicitly mention the rejection of all <code>Private :: ...</code> classifiers: https://pypi.org/classifiers/</li>

<p>I have not personally checked other registries, but yeah from what I understand they will ignore the classifier. Of course, some registry can do whatever it wants because the specification doesn&#x27;t cover this topic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you @ncoghlan, @zanieb! The point of view of &quot;it&#x27;s not standard, so alternate registries should not implement that&quot; is reassuring, but at the same time, yeah they can do whatever they want 😅</p>
<p>OK I think we won&#x27;t get further than this, closing! Thank you again ❤</p>
