# Running tests without older version of python induces error

---

_Issue opened by @jimmy312495 on 2025-11-30 14:37_

### Summary

Running the integration test suite on my computer that does **not** have older Python versions (e.g. 3.8 and 3.10) installed causes multiple tests to **panic** with `Could not find Python 3.X for test`, instead of skipping or failing more gracefully.

I'm new here, not sure if this is a bug, or just something can be ignored.

### Run to reproduce
Run
```
cargo test -p uv --test it pip_sync::install_numpy_py38 -- --nocapture
```
or 
```
cargo test --workspace
```

### std output
```
> cargo test -p uv --test it pip_sync::install_numpy_py38 -- --nocapture

Yeah we require these Python versions for the test suite, see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#python

Thank you! After installing other version of Python, all related tests passed.
