            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p><code>uv pip install -r requirements.txt</code> should always reinstall packages which have a specified path. Currently it apparently doesn&#x27;t, which is different from the behavior for packages with a path specified on the command-line, which do always reinstall (following #12038). That&#x27;s unexpected.</p>
<p>Verbosely:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install ./package
</code></pre>
<p>always re-installs the package.</p>
<p>In contrast, given requirements.txt with the content:</p>
<pre><code> ./package
</code></pre>
<p>running</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>does not always reinstall the package.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Candidly this is pretty unlikely to change and has been talked about in a few other issues -- you can read about the caching behavior here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#dependency-caching</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Indeed, that doc describes a path <em>on the command-line</em> as an explicit special case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a special case, uv will always rebuild and reinstall any local directory dependencies passed explicitly on the command-line (e.g., uv pip install .).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why? The same rationale of #12038 holds regardless of whether the dependency is specified on the command-line or requirements file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When dealin with local packages, uv is also caching the installation parameter making it very dificult when I work on package to run my tox or nox session with a uv backend as everytime I make a modification my local package in the venv are not updated. I fail to see a configuration where people would install a local package without wanting to update it as usually when the package is locally installed it means that you are currently working on it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I&#x27;d suggest editables in this case (or <code>cache-keys</code> to mark sources as invalidating the package).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s likely others would stumble into this unexpected inconsistency as well, regardless of alternatives. That&#x27;s why I suggest it might be a bug, though that depends on the trade-offs.</p>
<p>@charliermarsh you&#x27;d mentioned those trade-offs were discussed in other issues in addition to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12038">astral-sh/uv#12038</a>. Would you mind attaching the references to those?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I actually see the main problem myself - one wouldn&#x27;t want <code>uv run ...</code> to unconditionally re-build local paths specified in the project.</p>
