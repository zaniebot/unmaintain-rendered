# Install fails with Failed to download: fastapi==0.10.1

_Issue opened by @emsi on 2024-02-15 21:47_

When installing using following [requirements.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emsi/docker-ML/py3.11/requirements.txt) file it "counts down" fastapi versions and then fails with:
```
error: Failed to download: fastapi==0.10.1
  Caused by: Couldn't parse metadata of fastapi-0.10.1-py3-none-any.whl from https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/6d/b8/97ac91cb7c8f661a810334bde310ed2b2885cce6d2baab1a50b0c7a17d83/fastapi-0.10.1-py3-none-any.whl
  Caused by: Not a valid package or extra name: ".none". Names must start and end with a letter or digit and may only contain -, _, ., and alphanumeric characters.
```
even though there is to be no reason for trying version so low.
Seems like it tries to cache information about some really old (probably broken) package version.

Notably there is no `fastapi` directly in requirements.txt and `uv pip install fastapi` just works.
