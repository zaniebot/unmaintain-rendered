# `requires-python` is being handled too strictly w/ extras

_Issue opened by @KTibow on 2025-08-21 00:34_

### Summary

I'm working with [PufferLib](github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib), although I was able to distill this down to [this repro](https://github.com/KTibow/uv-repro), which has this error:
```
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (>=3.9) does not satisfy Python==3.11.7 and metta-common==0.1.0 depends on
      Python==3.11.7, we can conclude that metta-common==0.1.0 cannot be used.
      And because only metta-common==0.1.0 is available, we can conclude that all versions of metta-common cannot be used.
      And because uv-repro[metta] depends on metta-common and your project requires uv-repro[metta], we can conclude that
      your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: The `requires-python` value (>=3.9) includes Python versions that are not supported by your dependencies (e.g.,
      metta-common==0.1.0 only supports ==3.11.7). Consider using a more restrictive `requires-python` value (like ==3.11.7).
```
This error is fine for greenfield projects, where you probably want to make sure that everything works all of the time, but it's problematic when working with existing projects. I have no plans to use `metta-common`, but I don't want to remove it for my pip-using friends either. Ideally:
- if `metta-common` wasn't actually being used, uv would (or could, perhaps through `conflicts`) pay no mind to this.
- if it was being used, uv would keep the current error or maybe just warn and automatically make `requires-python` more specific.

Unfortunately they've made the peculiar choice to pin their package to a specific Python version https://github.com/Metta-AI/metta/blob/c576d3d95c2c278236a17c862d7032873ef5e1d4/common/pyproject.toml#L10

This means the package cannot be used with other Python versions.

We generate a lockfile that includes all your extras. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#universal-resolution for more details on the resolution process.

You can do something like

`metta-common @ git+https://github.com/metta-ai/metta.git@main#subdirectory=common; python_version == '3.11.7'` to only include that package on the compatible Python version. Really, they should fix this upstream though.
