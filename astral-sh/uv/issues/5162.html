            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whenever we have incomplete marker expressions that provoke a fork, we create an extra fork that spans the negation of the union of those marker expressions. I believe the way we are creating that fork today is not quite correct:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/af66f75980ad06ac5801ae4ed2417a2ef1dd209b/crates/uv-resolver/src/resolver/mod.rs#L2557-L2563</p>
<p>Namely, it has no dependencies in it, but I believe it should have all dependencies <em>except</em> for the dependencies that provoked the fork in the first place. That is, it should have every &quot;non fork package&quot; in it:</p>

<p>I believe this is the cause of one aspect of the problem reported in #5161.</p>
