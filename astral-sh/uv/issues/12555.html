            <div class="timeline-body"><h1>Question</h1>
<p>I need uv to work alongside poetry using pyproject configuration
Also to manage installations, meaning making venv use either uv or poetry when necessary
What's the best way to do that</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have a lot of projects in my organization that are using poetry
To introduce uv I want to keep poetry dependencies in pyproject and gradually introduce uv as a new tool without breaking anything
It has to keep poetry working, I need both to function for the docker image to build until I change it everywhere
Then once they are onboard I'll need the switch to uv to happen seamlessly and then remove all references to poetry</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>macos 14</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.10</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From what I remember, UVs don't usually specifically accommodate settings from third-party tools unless it's a standard.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's going to be challenging to use both at once, but at minimum you would need to upgrade to the latest Poetry and move all of your dependency definitions and metadata into <code>[project.dependencies]</code> rather than <code>[tool.uv.poetry]</code> so that they can read from the same source.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In other words, you want to migrate your Poetry setup such that you're using the standardized <code>[project]</code> section rather than anything Poetry-specific. Then <code>uv sync</code> would be able to do the same thing as <code>poetry install</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, you can do that! Just put the configuration in a single <code>pyproject.toml</code> and you can use uv and Poetry interchangeably. I suggested migrating from <code>[tool.poetry]</code> to the standardized <code>[project]</code> table so that you don't have to duplicate your configuration, but it's not a requirement.</p>
