            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just tried upgrading all my tools with the following command (which worked great !), and was curious to see what happened if I ran it twice in a row. I was pleasantly surprised that it correctly figured out nothing needed to be done instead of re-doing it, but also (very) mildly disappointed by the second message in the output:</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv tool upgrade -p 3.13 --all
... # output not relevant here
❯ uv tool upgrade -p 3.13 --all
Nothing to upgrade
Upgraded tool environment for  to Python 3.13
</code></pre>
<p>This is an extremely minor annoyance which I hope is not blocking to anyone (and certainly isn't to me !), though when the user experience is consistently excellent, this level of detail still gets noticed. I also thought it might also be relatively easy to fix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>wow, this must be the single swiftest response I ever got for a bug report. I almost regret not timing it but I'd be surprised if it took you more than 10s. Thanks, if anything, just for that ! (but obviously thanks for much more too)</p>
