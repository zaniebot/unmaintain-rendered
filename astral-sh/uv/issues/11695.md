# Get information about environment

---

_Issue opened by @ri-ch on 2025-02-21 11:41_

### Question

Is there a UV command to get information about the current .venv environment?

Looking for something roughly equivalent to `poetry env info`

I'd imagine it would be somewhere under `uv venv` but there doesn't seem to be a way to get this info.

### Platform

macOS arm64

### Version

0.6.2

What sort of information do you need/want about the venv?

Previous discussion of this petered out when it seems the user only wanted the path (it's at `.venv/`):

You can also look at `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment var after activating it and do something like `cat $VIRTUAL_ENV/pyvenv.cfg` to get closer to `poetry env info` 😄 or if it's not activated just `cat .venv/pyvenv.cfg`
