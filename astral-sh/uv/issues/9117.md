# workspace / confusing uv sync behavior when a package depended on is an application

---

_Issue opened by @tnielens on 2024-11-14 12:11_

Repro:
- create a uv workspace
- create two packages, a and b
- remove the `[build-system]` section in the pyproject.toml files of package b, effectively making it an "application" package
- make a depend on b
- run `uv build --package a`. The dependency on b is correctly present in the wheel metadata
- run `uv sync --package a`. The venv is not created as expected. Package b is not present in the venv, in either plain or editable form.

Observed result:
`uv sync` does not install dependencies if they don't include a `[build-system]` section in their pyproject.toml

Expected result:
Fail when a workspace dependency between package targets a package that is not a library.
