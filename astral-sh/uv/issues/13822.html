            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm currently working on a project that uses <code>uv</code>, and I was wondering if there is a way to cite this repository in <a href="https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/">BibTeX</a> format. I've seen that some GitHub repositories include a &quot;Cite this repository&quot; option, but that doesn't seem to be available here.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to add support for this feature, or could you provide a recommended citation format for referencing <code>uv</code> in academic or technical work?</p>

<p>Yep, that's what I'm talking about.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv doesn't have a publication, so you can cite it like an other website or <code>@misc</code>. In your journal's citation guidelines, there may be specific notes on software or GitHub that you need to follow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb  As a suggestion, <code>uv</code> could be archived with <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> like any other scientific software. That would generate a DOI and a corresponding citation. The source code would also be preserved as well.</p>
<p>For example, Conda is archived on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10055409.</p>
<p>edit: it looks like even <a href="https://conda-forge.org/news/2021/05/22/conda-forge-is-now-citable/">conda-forge</a> created a <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/4774217">Zenodo entry</a> to be citable as well. This is what their <a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/blob/main/CITATION.cff"><code>CITATION.cff</code> looks like on their repository</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For posterity, I looked into this briefly...</p>
<ul>
<li>I am supportive of publishing each release to Zenodo</li>
<li>It turns out they have a GitHub Integration that just &quot;does this&quot; using a webhook on release</li>
<li>However, they require admin permissions to webhooks, which is unacceptable for us for security reasons</li>
<li>There's not a way to set up a GitHub Integration with a manually added webhook, maybe that's a feature request</li>
<li>We can add a job that manually performs the upload to our CI</li>
<li>I futzed with some AI to generate a GitHub Action / bash script we could use on release, but it doesn't seem entirely trivial</li>
<li>We can't prioritize adding something like that to our release process, though I would review a contribution if it is high quality and tested on a fork with the Zenodo sandbox</li>
