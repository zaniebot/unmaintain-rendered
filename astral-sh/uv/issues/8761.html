Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>uv version: uv 0.4.23 (83f835b0d 2024-10-17)</p>
<p>When using uv to run a containerized gunicorn app, it will not pass along SIGTERM to children.</p>
<p>If I install a flask app with pip and run it with gunicorn as the ENTRYPOINT or CMD, it will handle SIGTERM as expected. However, if I use 'uv run', it will hang.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two run command is this:
CMD [&quot;gunicorn&quot;, &quot;--config&quot;, ...]
vs.
CMD[&quot;uv&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;gunicorn&quot;, &quot;--config&quot;, ...]</p>
