            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hi guys! I´ve been using and really love UV! I am using it on Databricks according to the suggestions on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8671">this issue</a>, but now I need to use it on a internal corporative Jupiter notebook environment.</p>
<p>I am trying to understand how to setup it to use the system python/env file at the same time, I need to set a custom place for libs as the &quot;default&quot; libs are read-only.</p>
<p>Really lost where to start!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @frbelotto, can you share more about your what you're trying to accomplish? What package are you trying to install, and hopefully some example code, set of steps, and/or screenshots that show how to reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>Please also make sure to check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/">Jupyter docs for uv</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!
I know its not easy because I am talking about a custom enterprise environment.</p>
<p>I can ran. Straight on command interface or inside the Jupiter notebook.
<code>pip install uv</code>
And it runs normally</p>
<p><code>uv init</code>
Ok! and the pyprojetct.toml is created!</p>
<p>But if I use</p>
<pre><code>uv add pydantic
imediataly UV try to create a Venv, but I shoulnt do that. I must use the current virtual envirioment python. 
uv pip install pydantic --system
Using Python 3.11.0 environment at: /usr/local
Resolved 5 packages in 187ms
error: failed to remove file `/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/__pycache__/typing_extensions.cpython-311.pyc`: Permission denied (os error 13)
</code></pre>
<p>This does not work, and, anyway, as far as I know, this does not add the lib to toml file (so, does not keep controle of libs and dependencies)</p>
<p>On databricks all I needed is to run this before adding/sync my libs</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.environ[&quot;UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT&quot;] = os.environ[&quot;VIRTUAL_ENV&quot;]

# reproduce `uv` environment on Databricks.
%sh uv sync --locked --no-editable
</code></pre>
<p>But this does not work on my environment. os.environ[&quot;VIRTUAL_ENV&quot;] is not recognized. I am trying to understand how to configure my uv to use here. I am able to use poetry, but I prefer UV.</p>
<p>The docs you suggested talks about starting the Jupiter server, but my company environment is already &quot;on&quot; when I can access it.</p>

<p>Can you share more about why you must use the current virtual environment Python? Is <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> set? e.g., what is <code>echo $VIRTUAL_ENV</code>? Maybe you want <code>uv add --active pydantic</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using echo $VIRTUAL_ENV prints nothing.</p>
<p>Using uv add --active immediately triggered a new venv install.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What would be the solution for a google colab? I might try. Would be like the databricks solution?</p>
