# Is there a setting to disable lowercase package names on init?

_Issue opened by @kybouw on 2025-08-04 23:59_

### Question

I recently migrated my repo of multiple uv projects to a uv workspace. However, I noticed that new packages created with `uv init` have some normalization applied to them that I wasn't expecting.

To illustrate, let's say I have a folder `stuff/` where I keep multiple projects with multiple workspace members. To make a new package, I'd call `uv init --package stuff/garden/lilyOfTheValley`. This will create a package like so:

```text
stuff/garden/lilyOfTheValley
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── src
    └── lilyofthevalley
        └── __init__.py
```

And the pyproject.toml will name the package all lowercase `lilyofthevalley`.

I know [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/#package-and-module-names) kind of standardized the lowercase thing, but is there any way to tell uv to preserve the case that I give it instead?

### Platform

macOS arm

### Version

0.8.4

There's not a way to configure this, we use the canonicalized package names, and, yeah,  following conventions `uv init` will lowercase the module name.

Why do you want to do this?

Just so that the new packages in the workspace can be consistent with the ones that already exist. I could `git mv` them all to lowercase. I was just curious if there was a setting or flag I couldn't find in the docs.

Makes sense. We could probably add an option to preserve casing, but I'm generally hesitant to do so.

That's alright. This at least answers my question. Thanks!
