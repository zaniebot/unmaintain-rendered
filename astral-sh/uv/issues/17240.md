I believe this is because we only synchronize PBS versions with each new uv release, and we haven't done a release since that alpha. 

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17165 merged that alpha's metadata, so it should be present with the next uv release.

It would be great to do a release when possible, the current 3.15 build can't build Numpy due to https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/142163.
