# uv build in workspaces setup builds subpackage in root

---

_Issue opened by @ion-elgreco on 2025-07-30 14:46_

### Question

I have a workspace with some member packages, then each member package I individually build by doing:

```sh
cd workspace/package_foo
uv build .
```

This however outputs the files in the root of the workspace instead of in `package_foo`, this caught me
 by surprise. It was easily solvable with `uv build --out-dir dist` to get actually in `workspace/package_foo/dist` but I was wondering whether this is the expected behavior and what the reasoning is?

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

0.8.3

uv invocations in workspaces often function relative to the workspace root — I think this is expected.
