            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I need to figure out if this desirable and/or what makes it difficult, but it&#x27;s plausible that <code>--package</code> could accept any package, not just workspace members.</p>
<p>I seem to recall that there&#x27;s some code that relies on entrypoints being unique in the lockfile. It might have to do with conflict markers (if you have multiple <code>[[package]]</code> entries for a non-root package, you need to choose between them; and doing so could depend on which parent package would / wouldn&#x27;t have been included).</p>
