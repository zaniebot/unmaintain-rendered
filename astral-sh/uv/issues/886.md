# Flaky test

_Issue opened by @bojanserafimov on 2024-01-11 14:41_

`dependency_excludes_range_of_compatible_versions` fails [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/actions/runs/7490137853/job/20388292564) but after re-running tests with no changes it passes. cc @zanieb

Duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/issues/863
