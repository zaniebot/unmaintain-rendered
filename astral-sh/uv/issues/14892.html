            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Not sure if this is against some specification, but sometimes you want to define a dev-time only entry point, which isn't included in the generated package:</p>
<p>In this case, if you customize <a href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/">commitizen</a> usage, you need to <a href="https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/customization/#migrating-from-legacy-plugin-format">define an entry point for your override</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is, with <code>pyproject.toml</code> having:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project.entry-points.'commitizen.plugin']
cz_something = ...
</code></pre>
<p>The packaged artifact (<code>uv build --wheel</code>) has this declared in metadata. But the definition is intended only for local use, I don't want to include it in the generated package.</p>
<p>Maybe there's a workaround?</p>
