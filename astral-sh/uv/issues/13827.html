            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>uv version —bump</code>  currently supports updating project version in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>uv.lock</code>.</p>
<p>In many projects other files need to be bumped (like a <code>Chart.yaml</code> file).</p>
<p>Currently my team uses tools like bump-my-version or changie. Those allow to configure search/replace patterns to update the version string in any file.</p>
<p>They also provide configuration parameters to add a git commit and/or a git tag with the version bump changes.</p>
<p>It would be interesting for uv to support that. To avoid introducing other tools and wrapper scripts around uv in release workflows.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would also be interested in the git commit/tag functionality. We've used <a href="https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version">bump2version</a> for many years in our python (and other) projects, but I have just learned that this tool is no longer maintained, and I am having a hard time getting it to work with the uv lockfile.</p>
<p>I don't know if this makes a good argument for adding this responsibility to uv or not, but JS projects get commits/tags (but not search/replace) natively using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-version#description"><code>npm version</code></a>.</p>
<p>Another (less opinionated) idea would be some kind of hook that gets called with the current and new versions, then people could write their own scripts to search/replace, commit, tag, whatever.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can reverse the wrapping to by  <code>uv version</code> wrapped in a script which also uses git and bump-my-version (which is still maintained and replaces bump2version).</p>
<p>But having uv doing it all would greatly help standardizing stuffs and IMO that's the role of a project management tool.</p>
<p>It can probably be done step by step, by first allowing simple patterns (like files just containing the version) and allowing more complex implementations in later versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some implementation suggestions, at least for my own use-case. Feel free to take from it the things that make sense to you 😄:</p>
<h1><code>uv version</code> needed capabilities</h1>
<p>When using <code>uv version --bump &lt;something&gt;</code>, there should be a possibility to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commit the changed files (currently this is only <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>uv.lock</code>)</li>
<li>Create a new git tag with the new version in the format &quot;vX.X.X&quot;. When choosing to use tagging, it automatically means to commit the updated</li>
<li>Support changing the version in other files as well (<code>.version</code>, <code>Chart.yaml</code>, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All capabilities should be optional and support opt-out.</p>
<h1>Setting via <code>pyproject.toml</code></h1>
<p>One should be able to opt in/out for the above capabilities using the following configuration in <code>pyproject.toml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.versioning]
commit = true/false
tag = true/false
version_files = [
    &quot;.version&quot;,
    &quot;Chart.yaml&quot;,
    &quot;src/my_package/__version__.py&quot;,
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>As states above, when <code>tag = true</code> it means that <code>commit = true</code> automatically, even if not stated in the config.
If we set both <code>tag = true</code> and <code>commit = false</code>, an error message should be shown.</p>
<h1>Support via command line</h1>
<p>In addition to the setting of these flags via the config file, we should also be able to override the config definitions by adding flags to the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv version --bump &lt;something&gt; --commit/--no-commit</code></li>
<li><code>uv version --bump &lt;something&gt; --tag/--no-tag</code></li>
<li><code>uv version --bump &lt;something&gt; &quot;--version-files=src/my_package/__init__.py,Chart.yaml&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Please let me know if this all make sense.
I can try to implement some of it, if approved by maintainers 😃</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will probably develop later on but looks like integrating the whole bump-my-version logic into uv including similar configuration formats would be my expectation.</p>
<p>I am not sure wether there are legal issues with that but uv already replaces a few Python ecosystem products, hence I assume it is fine and expected.</p>
<p>The goals is to allow search/replace patterns (not just listing version files) and also to provide patterns for the tag and commit messages (and opt-in/out for the tag/commit)</p>
<p>It could even go a bit farther with changelog and GitLab/Hub etc.  releases but looks a bit too much for uv scope though.</p>

<p>Are they any improvements planned for the version commands?</p>
<p>A small path forward could be to support updating a file (or files) containing just the version string like a VERSION file.</p>
<p>This allows easy reuse for other CI steps which do not embed uv</p>
<p><code>$(cat VERSION)</code> becomes them a handy way to get the version</p>
<p>This is really small as it just saves:
<code>uv version --short &gt; VERSION</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Gankra is there any chance that this feature could be considered?</p>
<p>Alternatively, having a way to hook some script or command on version bumps could be helpful.</p>
