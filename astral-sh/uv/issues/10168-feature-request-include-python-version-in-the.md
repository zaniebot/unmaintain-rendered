# Feature Request: Include Python version in the requirements.txt header when using uv pip compile

---

_@rohanbalkondekar_

### Description
When running `pip-compile` directly (e.g., `pip-compile --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in`), the generated `requirements.txt` includes metadata about the Python version in a comment at the top (e.g., “This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with Python 3.10”). This detail is useful for reproducibility and troubleshooting because it lets developers immediately see which Python environment was used to produce the lockfile.

However, when using the `uv pip compile` command (e.g., `uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt`), that Python version comment is omitted from the output, leaving out a key piece of metadata that helps keep environments consistent across different systems and for future maintainers.

**Proposed Enhancement**
- Update `uv pip compile` so that it also includes the Python version in the generated `requirements.txt` header.
- Make this behavior consistent with `pip-compile`'s default output, ensuring both the command used and the Python version are shown.

**Benefit**
- Improves clarity and traceability of the lockfile’s origin.
- Streamlines troubleshooting and ensures a more consistent experience between `uv pip compile` and the native `pip-compile`.

Are you asking for the same function as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3588, if I understand correctly?

Yes, that is correct. Thanks for highlighting.
