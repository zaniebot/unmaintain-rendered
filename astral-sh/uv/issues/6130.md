# (🎁) option to automatically cleanup dangling temporary directories

---

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2024-08-16 00:19_

```py
uv pip install basedmypy
warning: Ignoring dangling temporary directory: `C:\Users\AMONGUS\projects\test\.venv\Lib\site-packages\~asedpyright-1.15.0.dist-info`
```

i always run into these stupid folders because language servers lock files etc and stuff fails to install. it would be very based if `uv` could clean them up for me
