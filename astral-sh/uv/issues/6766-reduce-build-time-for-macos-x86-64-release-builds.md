# Reduce build time for `macos-x86_64` release builds

---

_@zanieb_

In the [latest run](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/10601592199/job/29381733615), the `macos-x86_64` release build took 25 minutes while the other release jobs finished in <15 minutes.

This is not critical, but it'd be nice for everything to be roughly on the same scale.
