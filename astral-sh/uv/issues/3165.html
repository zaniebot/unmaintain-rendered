            <div class="timeline-body"><pre><code>uv 0.1.35
platform: linux (x86_64)
</code></pre>
<p>Problem: uv run always creates a new environment even if current should be compatible, in certain projects.</p>
<p>Hi, trying out <code>uv run</code> for https://github.com/bluss/pyproject-local-kernel purposes (it is a thing that uses &quot;rye run python&quot;, &quot;poetry run python&quot;, &quot;pdm run python&quot; etc as appropriate depending on configuration).</p>
<p>I know that <code>uv run</code> is not an official feature yet, still it's fun to try to see how it works.</p>
<h3>How to Reproduce</h3>
<ol>
<li>git clone -b 0.5.5 https://github.com/bluss/pyproject-local-kernel</li>
<li>cd pyproject-local-kernel/tests/server-client/client</li>
<li>Inspect <a href="https://github.com/bluss/pyproject-local-kernel/blob/main/tests/server-client/client/pyproject.toml">pyproject.toml</a> and requirements files to see they only depend on ipykernel and jinja2.</li>
<li>uv venv --python 3.11.7    # it's the python I happened to use</li>
<li>uv pip install -r requirements.lock</li>
<li>uv run -v python</li>
</ol>
<p>Expected: It uses the environment ./.venv in the current directory
Actual behaviour: <code>DEBUG Using Python 3.11.7 environment at .uv/.tmpvVFPMZ/bin/python</code></p>
<p>Note: Using python 3.12.2 instead has the same result.
Note: Using uv pip install -r pyproject.toml instead of the requirements.lock file has the same result.
Note: If I remove the dependencies in the pyproject.toml and reinstall, it still fails. So it might be about the client &quot;package&quot; defined by the pyproject.toml itself?  That might be the cause, according to rye this is not a package at all, because it's marked virtual and should not be installed. (I don't know how uv is supposed to know that or if there's a rye agnostic way to configure this..)</p>
<p>In general I wanted here that if there was a complete &quot;rye sync&quot;'ed environment, it should be used as is by uv run if possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems to be fixed. Uv has developed a lot since then, anyway. In this particular case it doesn't use an emphemeral venv anymore, so that's good.</p>
