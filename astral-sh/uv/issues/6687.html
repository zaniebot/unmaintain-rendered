Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>As required by Fedora’s <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#bundling">guidelines for bundling</a> – do you anticipate being able to go back to using the released <code>tl</code> crate at some point? It looks like all that’s needed is for https://github.com/y21/tl/pull/69 to be merged and released – is that correct? Thanks!</p>
