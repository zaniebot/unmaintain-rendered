            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello everyone :) Unsure if this is the right place to ask, but to me it seems like creating virtual environments with <code>uv</code> always puts the system wide packages into the environment. Is this actually the case or did I mess something up locally and hence get this behavior? Thanks in advance?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv venv</code> does not add system wide package to the environment by default. Can you share the commands you used, your operating system and the uv version you're using?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wasn't able to recreate this behavior. I guess that I messed up with other stuff (conda environments) and that it was not a real <code>uv</code>issue. Since I cannot reproduce, I'll close this for now and re-open if I encounter this again.</p>
