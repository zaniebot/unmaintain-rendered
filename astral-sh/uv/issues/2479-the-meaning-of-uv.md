# The meaning of UV

---

_@wssf812_


Sorry, I have a rather childish question. Why is this new generation pyhton package management tool called UV?

Does it mean "use venv"?

Also, as a fast linter, does Ruff mean "rust formatted"?

What is the source of your naming, otherwise it feels a bit confusing

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1349#issuecomment-1986451785

Names are hard, we considered hundreds of names. They don't need to have a specific meaning. Ruff doesn't really stand for anything either, it's just a name.

I assumed ruff was 'RUst Faster Flake'.     But uv being 'Use Venv' sends the opposite message.

Late to the party here, I know, but [two possible interpretations](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8149) I came across were:

- **U**ltra**V**iolet with reference to how fast this tool is

and/or

- **U**ni**V**ersal as in a universal packaging tool for Python
