            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently these env vars must be absolute paths, and if not they silently fall back to the default path.</p>
<p>This is inconsistent with other path overrides, such as UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR, which may be relpaths.</p>
<p>Fixing this is a matter of changing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/29285db48e1917db8d93081f7008484aceab8543/crates/uv-dirs/src/lib.rs#L87">parse_path()</a> to accept relpaths. As far as I can tell there is no further blast radius, as that helper function is only used by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/29285db48e1917db8d93081f7008484aceab8543/crates/uv-dirs/src/lib.rs#L24">user_executable_directory()</a></p>
<p>I am happy to make this change, but wanted to check first that this is acceptable, and that there is no subtle reason why it would be a bad idea.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>All paths set in these environment variables must be absolute. If an implementation encounters a relative path in any of these variables it should consider the path invalid and ignore it.</p>

Thanks for the quick response!</p>

<p>For context: I'm writing a <a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/20897">new Python backend</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants">Pants build system</a>, and it executes uv for various effects, such as installing pythons. Pants executes processes in sandboxes, and the sandbox directory path is not yet known when setting up the process inputs, so it is not possible to locate abspaths in the sandbox up front (it can be done by wrapping the process in a shell script, but that is more complex, and means locating a shell, which we prefer not to do if we don't have to).</p>
