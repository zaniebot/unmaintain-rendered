# Remember enabled groups for `uv sync`

---

_Issue opened by @noamraph on 2025-02-03 14:39_

### Summary

Currently, I need to specify the enabled groups for each `uv sync` run. If I run `uv sync` without specifying the groups, the groups reset to the default groups. This is especially strange if I add a package to a group and then run `uv sync`. When I add the package, by running `uv add --group mygroup package`, then it gets installed, but then if I run `uv sync`, it gets removed!

I know that it's possible to specify default groups. However, this is committed to the repository, and might not be what I want. In my use case, I added a dependency group called `jupyter` which adds `ipykernel`, `pandas` and a few others like that, so I could use the venv with Jupyter. If I make it a default group, then whenever someone runs `uv sync` he'll get all of that, even though he's not using Jupyter at all. OTOH, if I don't add it as a default group, then I have to type `uv sync --group jupyter` each time.

I suggest to keep the list of enabled groups somewhere in the directory or venv, so running `uv sync` without mentioning groups will keep the currently active groups.

Thanks for UV!

Perhaps you're just looking for `uv sync --inexact`?

I don't think it's great for the synced groups to become a stateful, additive operation by default — it sounds confusing.

I don't think we'll do this for now.
