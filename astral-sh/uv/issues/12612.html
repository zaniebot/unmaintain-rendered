            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Rust 1.83+, which we started using in uv 0.5.9, cannot be used on Windows systems with <a href="https://www.li-tech.co.kr/s_products_spp.php">SecuPrint</a>. The aforementioned security software injects a module into (all?) processes and causes a silent runtime crash (presumably due to a bug in their injected code).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems to be related to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/143078, the security software is performing an out of bounds read.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If anybody knows of a way to contact Li-Tech, please reach out and report that bug since it is a pretty severe vulnerability on their part. I attempted to send something to their email listed at https://www.li-tech.co.kr/s_support_sup.php but it bounced back.</p>
<p>Cc @abstracted1 @ChoSeoHwan since it seems from the other issues that you may be using the software</p>
<p>It looks like Rust will be landing a hack to keep users from running into this bug for now. But we have no way of being certain it fixes all possible instances of the issue, and we definitely do not want to encourage the incorrect behavior, so this hack will eventually go away.</p>
