Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Since <code>uv</code> conveniently works in place of <code>venv</code> and <code>virtualenv</code>, I just wanted to propose a really handy development feature that many users of <code>pdm</code> and <code>poetry</code> are enjoying.</p>
<p>When invoking <code>pdm install</code> from the project root, the default behavior (unless configured otherwise) is to create a <code>.venv</code> folder in the root of the project which installs all the dependencies annotated in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. This behavior is <a href="https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/venv/#virtualenv-auto-creation">described here</a>. I think <code>pdm install</code> implicitly performs <code>pdm init</code> and generates a lockfile if no existing lockfile is detected.</p>
<p><code>poetry</code> takes a slightly different approach and defaults to installing the virtualenvs in a separate location, and requires the user to set <code>virtualenv.in-project</code> to true (although not in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, it is in another config file used by <code>poetry</code>).  This behavior is <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-your-virtual-environment">described here</a>. Most users have <code>.venv</code> added to their <code>.gitignore</code> and in general I think it's nice to keep the <code>.venv</code> close to where it is being consumed.</p>
<p>I think this would be a great and important capability if and when <code>uv</code> builds out a <code>uv install</code> command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>We considered doing this for <code>uv pip install</code> in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2665 but opted not after significant feedback from users. <code>uv sync</code> (which is our equivalent to the pdm or Poetry install commands) does this already.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess this is a semi-related question: will <code>pdm sync</code> work if the lockfile has been generated on another platform? I am not sure where <code>uv</code> stands right now when it comes to cross-platform lockfile generation/dependency resolution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Incredible!! You guys are working on this at lightspeed. Eager to start using these features... might be worth updating the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#limitations">README</a> to highlight the capabilities?</p>
<p>Also, is there any plan to install the current project as editable into the <code>.venv</code> by default (or a configuration option to do so) similar to <code>pdm</code>?</p>
