            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just had a really weird bug where <code>uv</code> failed to install a package because of a wheel whose metadata didn't have a name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv add --dev lgpio
Resolved 1 package in 1ms
error: Failed to install: lgpio-0.2.2.0-cp313-cp313-linux_aarch64.whl (lgpio==0.2.2.0)
  Caused by: The wheel is invalid: Metadata field Name not found
</code></pre>
<p>This was weird because I don't see any wheels for 3.13 published on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/lgpio/#files</p>
<p>Note that I had successfully installed this many times before with uv, on the same python version and platform. I tried multiple different commands like: <code>uv add --dev lgpio --no-binary</code>, and <code>uv add --dev lgpio --reinstall</code>. Neither of them fixed it.</p>
<p>Finally, I did a <code>uv cache clean</code>, and then the package installed just fine. It sucks that I cannot reproduce this bug though.</p>
<p>Here's my current <code>pyproject.toml</code> if that helps. Note that I had a setuptools backend, and a hatchling backend, and they both had also failed.</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]
