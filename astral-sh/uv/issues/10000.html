            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a project that requires a different version of a library based on the infrastructure we are testing against. I defined those dependencies in 2 different dependency groups and told <code>uv</code> that they conflict:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;tls-certificates-interface&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;

dependencies = [
    &quot;cryptography&quot;,
    &quot;jsonschema&quot;,
    &quot;ops&quot;,
    &quot;pydantic&quot;,
    &quot;rpds-py==0.18.1&quot;
]

[dependency-groups]
test = [
    &quot;coverage[toml]&quot;,
    &quot;pytest&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-operator&quot;,
    &quot;pytest-asyncio==0.21.2&quot;,
    &quot;ops[testing]&quot;,
]
dev = [
    &quot;codespell&quot;,
    &quot;pyright&quot;,
    &quot;ruff&quot;,
]
test-juju-2 = [
    &quot;juju==2.9.49.0&quot;
]
test-juju-3 = [
    &quot;juju&gt;3&quot;
]

[tool.uv]
conflicts = [
    [
        { group = &quot;test-juju-2&quot; },
        { group = &quot;test-juju-3&quot; },
    ],
]
</code></pre>
<p>It works well for most of our workflows, but it fails when trying to run <code>uv export</code> to generate a <code>requirements.txt</code> file for another tool, with the error:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv export --no-group test-juju-2 --no-group test-juju-3
Resolved 83 packages in 1ms
error: Cannot represent `uv.lock` with conflicting extras or groups as `requirements.txt`
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried many different switches to get uv to ignore those groups, as I do not need them in the requirements file, but found no way of making <code>uv export</code> work with those conflicts.</p>
<p>A workaround I found was to use this instead:</p>
<pre><code>uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>I manually validated the output against the <code>uv.lock</code> file and everything seemed to match, but I am not certain this is guaranteed when using the pip interface.</p>
