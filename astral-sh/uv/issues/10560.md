# platform_system changes on uv sync

---

_Issue opened by @bheemaguli on 2025-01-13 10:06_

On running `uv sync`, the `platform_system` gets changed between `win32` and `Windows` when run on different linux systems. Our devlopment team uses few different flavours of linux but all are on linux systems. What can be the reason for this issue?

```lock

version = "8.1.8"

dependencies = [
    { name = "colorama", marker = "platform_system == 'Windows'" },

]
```

Here is the `uv.lock` file that is getting changed.

I assume you’re running different versions of uv on those different systems.

We started rewriting `platform_system` to `sys_platform` in later versions.

Does it apply for users as well when specifying indexes in `tool.uv.sources`. For example: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/#configuring-accelerators-with-environment-markers

@charliermarsh different uv version was indeed the reason for the issue. I have migrated my team to latest uv version and now no issue is occuring. 
Closing this issue.
