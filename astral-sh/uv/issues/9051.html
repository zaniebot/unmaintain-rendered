            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you've got it wrong. This is because uv run by default checks if the lock file is up-to-date. The lock file is used to find cross-platform compatible dependencies that meet your requirements.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If your project does only support linux, you can set <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#environments"><code>tool.uv.environments</code></a> to e.g. exclude windows.</p>
<p>On uv's side, we shouldn't try resolving <code>(python_full_version == '3.11.*' and platform_system == 'Windows' and sys_platform == 'darwin')</code>: <code>platform_system == 'Windows' and sys_platform == 'darwin'</code> doesn't exist, and we shouldn't consider it.</p>
