# [DOC]: Clarification Request: `pip`/`brew`/etc installed `uv` takes precedence over standalone installer

---

_Issue opened by @adam-grant-hendry on 2024-12-13 01:48_

### System Info
`OS`: Windows 10 22H2
`Terminal`: PowerShell Core 7.4.6
`uv`: 0.5.8

### The Problem
After installing `uv` with the [standalone installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```
> powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

`uv` did not perform `self update` because it was also installed under `python 3.11` on my system with `pip`:

```
> uv self update
warning: Self-update is only available for uv binaries installed via the standalone installation scripts.

If you installed uv with pip, brew, or another package manager, update uv with `pip install --upgrade`, `brew upgrade`, or similar.
```

### Request
Can the docs be updated slightly only to clarify that `pip`/`brew`/etc. installs take precedence over the standalone installer? I think this was implied, but in my case having `uv` installed with my `python 3.11` using `pip` was an accident.

Alternatively, it would be helpful if the error message could state whether multiple installations of `uv` were found.

This isn't necessarily true, it depends on how your `PATH` is setup.

We should definitely warn on install though if the just-installed uv isn't the first in the `PATH`. I recently improved the warning for `uv self update` in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9487 but the warning on install will need to be implemented upstream in `cargo-dist`.

Oh interesting, okay, it's path based. That makes sense. My python install was higher in my PATH than my `.local/bin`.
