            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When removing the <code>.venv</code> folder goes wrong, the remnants prevent uv from recreating it.</p>
<p>This happens fairly frequently when switching Python interpreter versions on Windows, where a file cannot be removed if it's still being open by a running process.</p>
<h2>Repro</h2>
<p>In a powershell session:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell"># make a new temporary directory and cd into it
New-TemporaryFile | %{ rm $_; mkdir $_; cd $_ }
# create a new project and `.venv`
uv init -p 3.10
uv sync -p 3.10
</code></pre>
<p>The way I typically run into this is by running vscode in the project, which picks up <code>.venv</code> and spawns a few LSP servers in the background using <code>.venv/Scripts/python.exe</code>. For the sake of an easy repro, let's emulate that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell"># launch a background process
uv run python -c 'input()' &amp;

# try to switch python versions
uv sync -p 3.11
</code></pre>
<p>This will output an error like</p>
<pre><code>error: failed to remove directory `C:\Users\zsol\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp1tdyak.tmp\.venv`: Access is denied. (os error 5)
</code></pre>
<p>At which point I normally realize I need to shut down vscode, so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">stop-job 1
</code></pre>
<p>But it's too late:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">uv sync -p 3.11
</code></pre>
<p>Fails with:</p>
<pre><code>error: Project virtual environment directory `C:\Users\zsol\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp1tdyak.tmp\.venv` cannot be used because it is not a compatible environment but cannot be recreated because it is not a virtual environment
</code></pre>
<h2>Mitigation</h2>
<p>It's not the end of the world, I can go and manually remove the venv:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">rm -r .venv -force
uv sync -p 3.11
</code></pre>
<p>But until I do that, the project is in an unusable state. It would be nice if <code>uv sync</code> would never leave the project in a broken state that uv itself can't fix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The cause here is that Windows doesn't allow removing currently used binaries.</p>
<p>I think the solution is to remove the binaries first, as they may be blocked by running process, and remove the <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> last, so we still recognize it as a venv even though half way through the deletion. The other option is to add a deletion-in-progress marker first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect (but don't <em>really</em> know) the fundamental problem is that uv can't be sure if that <code>.venv</code> folder is actually OK to be managed (in this case deleted), or not. Setting down a marker (on creation) would let uv be not <em>this</em> careful when trying to decide if it's OK to remove <code>.venv</code> or not. Then the marker could be cleaned up last, and uv would only need to check if <code>.venv</code> is completely empty or if it has a marker file</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Today, <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> tells uv that a folder is a venv and can be removed, we're just removing the <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> too early.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As per #11134, if it is acceptable, you could use the symlink link mode which has been effective in my experience:</p>
<pre><code class="language-TOML">[tool.uv]
link-mode = &quot;symlink&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It also happens every time with VS.Code, which keeps the Python binary locked when the workspace is open. So when a Python upgrade is needed I have to remember that I must switch to another workspace then switch back. Of course, I typically don't know when a Python upgrade or downgrade is needed, so almost every time a manual cleanup step is inevitable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To be fair the VS Code issue isn't unique to uv, I often need to test across multiple versions of Python and my usual workflow is to delete and recreate the venv, except on Windows with VS Code which makes it a real pain to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another strategy I've seen to deal with this is to rename the folder first, and then attempt deletion. That way, a failure during deletion will not cause further <code>uv</code> invocations to fail.
Of course, we then run the risk of leaving garbage on the system.</p>
