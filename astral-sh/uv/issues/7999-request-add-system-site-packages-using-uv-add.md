# Request: Add system-site-packages using uv add --script

---

_@Eloitor_

First I installed sage using the package manager of my linux distribution.

## This works

main.py
```py
from sage.all import ZZ
print(ZZ)
```

```sh
uv run main.py
```

Output is `Integer Ring`.

## This does not work
```by
uv add --script main.py datasheet
uv run main.py
```
I get:
```
Reading inline script metadata from: main.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/eloi/main.py", line 7, in <module>
    from sage.all import ZZ
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sage'
```

## Request

It would be nice if it was possible to add system-site-packages using `uv add --script`

* The current uv platform.
I'm in void linux
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
uv 0.4.17

More generally, uv will dynamically make a venv if one is needed for certain commands - is it possible to set an environment variable or something so that whenever `uv` needs a venv, it will use `--system-site-packages`?
