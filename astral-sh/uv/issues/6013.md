# `uv lock` rejects wheels from `--find-links`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-12 00:14_

```
❯ uv lock --no-index --find-links ../scripts/links
warning: `uv lock` is experimental and may change without warning
Using Python 3.12.1
Resolved 2 packages in 15ms
error: since the package `tqdm==1000.0.0 @ path+/Users/crmarsh/workspace/puffin/scripts/links` comes from a path dependency, a hash was expected but one was not found for wheel
```
