            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv currently supports specifying the Python version via either a <code>.python-version</code> or <code>.python-versions</code> file.</p>
<p>The plural filename form is not supported by pyenv and other tooling, and appears to be a uv creation?</p>
<p>The plural filename form is also not necessary since pyenv has supported multiple versions within the <code>.python-version</code> file since 2012:
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/commit/8187bc84e3f42d41ebd70537b55f1a1b753b5619#diff-5aa90772bd0a391bd523f92a07cdb2d64e414e9e6ee7b2cfd0e606b310726270</p>
<p>My concern is that this uv-specific filename:</p>
<ol>
<li>Goes against the spirit of <code>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</code></li>
<li>Means all tooling downstream of uv has to either (a) add support for a redundant filename, (b) has to add a specific error case for it (since users will get confused why our tooling isn't using the Python version they requested - and even if we warn that they &quot;don't have a <code>.python-version</code> file&quot;, I guarantee many won't notice the &quot;s&quot; difference, given from our metrics we already see a lot of file naming related <a href="https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-python/blob/3183e18c99a06f576b70f2041cbd9ae9599e1eed/src/detect.rs#L27-L33">confusion</a> for things even less subtle than that)</li>
</ol>
<p>Would it be possible to deprecate the uv-specific <code>.python-versions</code> filename?</p>
<p>eg: Emit a warning saying its deprecated and to use <code>.python-version</code> instead.</p>
