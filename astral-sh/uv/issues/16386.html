            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
Description
<p>Updating from torch 2.8 and torchvision 0.23 to torch 2.9 and torchvision 0.24 and following <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/#configuring-accelerators-with-optional-dependencies">uv&#x27;s documentation on how to configure accelerators with optional dependencies</a>, I ran into the error below when trying to install a project for CPU:</p>
<pre><code>Distribution `torchvision==0.24.0 @ registry+https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` can&#x27;t be installed because it doesn&#x27;t have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You&#x27;re on Linux (`manylinux_2_42_x86_64`), but `torchvision` (v0.24.0) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux_2_28_aarch64`, `macosx_11_0_arm64`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels
</code></pre>
<p>The message seems clear that wheels are not available for my platform (manylinux x86_64), but manually inspecting <a href="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torchvision/">PyTorch&#x27;s index of torchvision packages</a> reveals that a compatible wheel should be available: <a href="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torchvision-0.24.0%2Bcpu-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl#sha256=baa37f80155a3b055911d5c2418be1e16b95bb69f671dbb0d07d67504093e23d"><code>torchvision-0.24.0+cpu-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl</code></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suspect there is an issue with how uv resolves the package (e.g. handling of markers?) which incorrectly leads it to believe there are no wheels available for this platform. I didn&#x27;t have time to follow uv&#x27;s resolution mechanism further to identify a more precise root cause.</p>
How to Reproduce
<p>I first ran into the issue in a more complex project, but I managed to reproduce it in the following simple setup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new project by running <code>uv init PROJECT_NAME</code>, with managed Python <code>cpython-3.12.9-linux-x86_64-gnu</code> already installed</li>
<li>Copy the following content into the <code>pyproject.toml</code> (following <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/#configuring-accelerators-with-optional-dependencies">uv&#x27;s documentation on how to configure accelerators with optional dependencies</a>):</li>

<li>Try to install the cpu version with <code>uv sync --extra cpu</code> and you should see the error above</li>
</ol>
More Context
<ul>
<li>As mentioned at the beginning, the issue appeared when updating torch 2.8-&gt;2.9 and torchvision 0.23-&gt;0.24 (and adapting the <code>pyproject.toml</code> to drop <code>cu129</code> and add <code>cu130</code>). The same configuration for dependencies (minus the differences in CUDA target versions) was working fine before.</li>
<li>As far as I could tell, I did not see any changes in the availability of wheels published to PyTorch&#x27;s index with this update that could explain the lack of support for my platform.</li>
<li>The error only happens when installing to target CPU, and the project installs fine when targeting GPU (e.g. <code>uv sync --extra cu126</code>)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @konstin for taking care of this. I&#x27;ve looked at the issue you opened with pytorch/vision, and I just want to point out some things I&#x27;ve observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are indeed no local (no <code>+</code>) versions of torchvision in the index for torchvision 0.24.0. Howevere, there are no such versions for torchvision&lt;0.24 either, but uv was still able to resolve the environment for both cpu/gpu;</li>
<li>I am not seeing the duplicate versions of the <code>manylinux_2_28_aarch64</code> wheels. The different versions of the wheels I&#x27;m seeing are for different python versions (3.10-3.14, with 3.13 and 3.14 also having free-threaded versions);</li>
<li>Some torchvision wheels seem to have a hash after the <code>+</code>, and I&#x27;ve got no ideas what platform these wheels are supposed to target. Maybe that&#x27;s an indicator of a bug on torch&#x27;s side?</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, thanks again for picking this up, as it goes beyond my abilities to diagnose environment setup issues 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are now +cpu versions for torchvision 0.24.0 , but also +e437e35 versions of torchvision 0.24.0 only for Windows. When uv resolves torchvision 0.24.0, it selects the &quot;latest&quot; version (+e437e35) instead of the +cpu suffix version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a <code>torchvision</code> wheel issue, not a <code>uv</code> issue.</p>
<p>Here is my fix by adding local version specifier <code>+cpu</code>. <a href="https://github.com/appleparan/copier-modern-ml/blob/main/project/pyproject.toml.jinja">It works!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/9330#issuecomment-3737792836">PyTorch do not plan to release fixed wheels for torchvision 0.24</a>, so trying to install version 0.24 specifically will still fail with the same error. However, users are unlikely to be stuck on torchvision 0.24 exclusively, since the fixed 0.25 release supports the exact same CUDA versions (12.6, 12.8, and 13.0).</p>
<p>Since the latest release of torchvision now fixes the issue, and users should be able to update to the latest torchvision, I&#x27;ll mark this as closed.</p>
