# How to find the virtual environment path for a project in uv and other ENV in general?

---

_Issue opened by @edoardozucchelli on 2025-10-09 09:19_

### Question

How uv keeps track of virtual environments for a project? I already know how to set a venv, but I want to know where uv stores all the information about environments, paths, and related configuration.

Specifically:

Is there a central place (file or command) where uv records which virtual environment is associated with a project?

Where can I see all environment variables (local and global) that uv uses internally?

I’d like to be able to inspect all the information in one place.

EDIT:

I've found this thead: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1495

Is there a new workaround for that?

Thanks!

### Platform

Ubuntu 20 (WSL)

### Version

0.9.0

You can find documentation in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/, and we're extending the uv paths documentation in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/15954. For a project, uv always uses `.venv` in a directory of either the workspace root, or of the project if there is not workspace. There's no command that shows this location currently.

There is a command that shows the location

```
❯ uv sync --dry-run --output-format json -q
{
  "schema": {
    "version": "preview"
  },
  "target": "project",
  "project": {
    "path": "/Users/zb/workspace/.worktrees/uv/zb-python-pre/example",
    "workspace": {
      "path": "/Users/zb/workspace/.worktrees/uv/zb-python-pre/example"
    }
  },
  "sync": {
    "environment": {
      "path": "/Users/zb/workspace/.worktrees/uv/zb-python-pre/example/.venv",
      "python": {
        "path": "/Users/zb/workspace/.worktrees/uv/zb-python-pre/example/.venv/bin/python",
        "version": "3.14.0rc3",
        "implementation": "cpython"
      }
    },
    "action": "create"
  },
  "lock": {
    "path": "/Users/zb/workspace/.worktrees/uv/zb-python-pre/example/uv.lock",
    "action": "create"
  },
  "dry_run": true
}
```

You can use `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` and something like `direnv` if you want a workaround for storing the environment somewhere else for now.
