#  uv generate-shell-completion powershell script error in uv 0.4.11.

**UV Version:** uv 0.4.11 (e5dd67f58 2024-09-17)
**Error:** A 'using' statement must appear before any other statements in a script.
(Error message. Since my computer's language is not English, I'm just translating it.)
I think it's because the new version added uvx completion (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7388), but it didn't consistently place "using" statements at the beginning.

Ok, not good, that means not all shells can handle having this output in one stream. I think uv and uvx completions then need to be in separate commands, like `uvx --generate-shell-completion`
