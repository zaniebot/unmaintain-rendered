# `uv pip compile` should exclude `--upgrade-package` in the header

---

_@skshetry_

`uv pip compile` does not seem to ignore `--upgrade-package` command, whereas `pip-compile` seems to exclude it in the header.

See https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/blob/53309647980e2a4981db54c0033f98c61142de0b/piptools/utils.py#L56.


```console
uv pip compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in -P package
```

```plaintext
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile --output-file requirements.txt requirements.in -P package
```


`--upgrade` is excluded by default, so `--upgrade-package` should do the same.

```console
