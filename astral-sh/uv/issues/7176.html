<ul>
<li>To many python users, accustomed to <code>pip</code>, the option <code>--upgrade-strategy</code> is strongly associated to the <code>only-if-needed</code> and <code>eager</code> options. Having an <code>--upgrade-strategy</code> option with a different semantic or different option values may end up confusing.</li>
<li>As <code>uv tool</code> is meant to substitute for <code>pipx</code>, it may be valuable to provide options to get behaviors that don't surprise users coming from <code>pipx</code>. Specifically, <code>pipx upgrade</code> when updating a tool does not update its dependencies unless there is a strict need to do so (under the hood, it works like <code>pip</code>, where the update strategy defaults to <code>only-if-needed</code>). Apparently, the experience of <code>pip</code> and <code>pipx</code> developers was that blindly updating dependencies could sometimes lead to breakage that would be avoided with a more conservative approach. I am getting the feeling (please correct me if I am wrong) that <code>uv tool upgrade</code> does the opposite (namely works like <code>pip install -U</code> with the <code>--update-strategy</code> set to <code>eager</code>). Having an easy way to get the <code>pipx</code> behavior would be great. Apparently <code>--strategy</code> and <code>UV_STRATEGY</code> don't let you do it. Is there anything I am missing?</li>
