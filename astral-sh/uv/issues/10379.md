# How do I compile dev requirements from dependency-groups.dev in pyproject.toml?

---

_Issue opened by @MattTheCuber on 2025-01-07 21:46_

I can't seem to figure out how to generate a `requirements-dev.txt` from the dev requirements in my `pyproject.toml`

I expected an argument like `--group` or `--only-dev` in `uv pip compile`, but I can't seem to find it.
