Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>There is a Dockerfile available in the repo but it is not (yet) published to the package registry.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to use it in a slim docker image like shown below, this way docker will cache the latest uv binary but does not include it into the final image.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv as uv
FROM python:alpine
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
        --mount=from=uv,source=/uv,target=./uv \
        ./uv pip install .....

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, much easier and efficient installation method when working with containers!</p>
<p>I'm currently doing a <code>pip install</code> and pulling that binary in multi-stage, just to avoid installing curl for the install script. That mostly just tries to figure the current OS and arch, but with a multi-platformat container images that's handled automatically already. Also, pulling from uv and python base image can be done in parallel here, while doing the install in a RUN doesn't.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use multi stage to copy uv into any image. That'll keep the uv image as small as possible for faster download.</p>

<p>Can you tag the image with the release version though? That would help with pinning.</p>
