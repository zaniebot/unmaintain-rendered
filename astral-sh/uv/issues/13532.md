# Allow `--build-constraints` in `uv sync`

---

_Issue opened by @vmarkovtsev on 2025-05-19 09:44_

### Summary

We've got a project that must build for several platforms and depends on Torch at build time for native extensions. One platform needs `torch==2.6.0+cu126` and another platform needs `torch==2.6.0+cpu` and are in direct conflict with each other (not compatible at build time).

If we build a wheel package, we set `ub build --build-constraints=torch.txt` that points at the correct version. However, `uv sync` doesn't support `--build-constraints` and we have to resort to `--no-build-isolation` with a preinstalled build environment.

### Example

`uv sync --build-constraints=/path/to/constraints.txt`
