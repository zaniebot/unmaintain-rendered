# Possibility of a `uv bundle` command

---

_@Mstr0A_

### Summary

### Idea:
Would there be a possibility for a built in `uv bundle` command to bundle command your code into one standalone executable almost like `deno compile`

It can have all its configurations in a little section in `pyproject.toml` to save the hassle of writing long commands over and over

### Example

It would help make the transition from development to deployment much smoother and easier to have all you need in one place instead of having to use tools like nuitka or pyinstaller

It's plausible, but we're not pursuing this in the short-term.
