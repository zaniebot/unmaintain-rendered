# Streaming metadata fallback should cache wheel

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-16 01:32_

See: `wheel_metadata_no_pep658`. If we can't do a range request, we stream the wheel searching for the `METADATA` file. Because we stream, we stop as soon as we read the `METADATA` file... but that also means we don't cache the wheel, which seems like the wrong tradeoff (for large wheels).
