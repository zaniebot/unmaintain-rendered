# Refer to user instead of "root" when no package name is available

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-01-09 18:53_

e.g. in https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/blob/ee3a6431c75b932674cf350266b575f97a43e119/crates/puffin-cli/tests/pip_install_scenarios.rs#L1275

the user requested a package via `pip-install` but we say "root depends on" instead of "you requested".

Note sometimes a root package name is available e.g. when we infer the project name from a pyproject.toml file during `pip-compile`
