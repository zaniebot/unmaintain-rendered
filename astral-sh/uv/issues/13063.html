            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello, I would like to find which packages were installed from a sdist and which from a wheel. Or alternately, given a Python version (and OS, etc.), which packages are available as wheels on a given index URL.</p>
<h3>Context illustration</h3>
<p>For example, I'm building an application using Python 3.12. I have set up CI building the application etc.</p>
<p>Now I want to upgrade to Python 3.13. Some dependencies don't have a wheel uploaded on PyPi for Python 3.13 (some of them because I need to upgrade them beforehand).</p>
<p>I would like to have a way to know, when upgrading to Python 3.13, which dependencies will break on the CI side because they cannot be installed from a wheel (e.g. I don't have the build toolchain on the CI to build C extensions).</p>

<p>I can see that with <code>uv pip list --outdated</code>, a column <code>Type</code> (<code>latest_filetype</code> in JSON format) seems to give the info:</p>
<pre><code># uv --version
uv 0.6.16
# uv venv
Using CPython 3.13.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
# uv pip install ruff==0.9.0
Resolved 1 package in 620ms
Prepared 1 package in 379ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.9.0
# uv pip list --outdated    
Package Version Latest Type
------- ------- ------ -----
ruff    0.9.0   0.11.6 wheel
</code></pre>
<p>However, if the package is in its last version, I cannot find how to display the info:</p>
<pre><code># uv --version
uv 0.6.16
# uv venv
Using CPython 3.13.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
# uv pip install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 101ms
Prepared 1 package in 402ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.11.6
# uv pip list --outdated
# uv pip list
Package Version
------- -------
ruff    0.11.6
</code></pre>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.16</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One option to test this is installing the packages with <code>--no-build</code>, which errors instead of building source distributions, showing the offending package.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we can display this with <code>uv pip list</code> in general, because I don't <em>think</em> we can tell if a package was installed from source or from a wheel -- since all source distributions are first built into wheels?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I was under the impression that you could, because of the output of <code>uv pip list --outdated</code>, but maybe I'm completely wrong here? In which case, do you know what does the <code>Type</code> column refers to?</p>
<pre><code># uv pip list --outdated    
Package Version Latest Type
------- ------- ------ -----
ruff    0.9.0   0.11.6 wheel

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It works for <code>--outdated</code> because in that case, we hit the server to fetch the list of available versions / files, and the <code>Type</code> refers to the type that would be used when installing the <code>Latest</code> version. So <code>Type</code> refers to <code>Latest</code>, not the installed distribution.</p>
