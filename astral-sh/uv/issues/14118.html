            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases">Git aliases</a>, one should be able to define a project-specific command alias in <em>pyproject.toml</em> that UV can use.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's say that I have a project with a few tests that I want to run &quot;pytest&quot;. Moreover, let's say that I want to be able to run just tests marked with &quot;webtest&quot;.</p>
<p>Currently the way to do this with UV is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Run tests using pytest with UV
uv run pytest my_app.py

# Run all tests with marker &quot;webtest&quot; using pytest with UV
uv run pytest -m webtest my_app.py 
</code></pre>
<p>It could be nice if I could define in <em>pyproject.toml</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.alias]
test = &quot;run pytest&quot;
webtest  = &quot;run pytest -m webtest&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and then I could simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Run tests using pytest with UV
uv test my_app.py

# Run all tests with marker &quot;webtest&quot; using pytest with UV
uv webtest my_app.py 
</code></pre>
<p>In the same way I could define aliases such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.alias]
upgrade = &quot;sync --upgrade&quot;
stree = &quot;tree -d 2 --no-dev&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and then I could simply run:
and then I could simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv upgrade  # Same as &quot;uv sync --upgrade&quot;

uv stree  # Same as &quot;uv tree -d 2 --no-dev&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @nathanjmcdougall and @zanieb, thank you for the prompt response!</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is a big difference between this suggestion and the other suggestion you linked.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv alias</code> is referring to aliasing <strong>UV specific commands</strong> such as <code>uv run</code>, <code>uv sync</code>, etc.</li>
<li><code>uv task</code> is referring to running <strong>non-pythonic commands from within a UV environment</strong>, things like <code>echo</code>, <code>cat</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there is a similarity, they are not the same and I think it would be beneficial to support both.</p>
<hr />
<p>I think it will be clearer if I share my own use-case.</p>
<p>I have a python project that I'm managing with UV, let's call it &quot;bambi&quot;. In this project, I need to run a server using <code>gunicorn</code>. Unfortunately, gunicorn only support running the server via a command-line and not via code, so in order to run my server within the uv-created environment, I need to run something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv run --no-sync gunicorn -w 8 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --timeout 86400 'bambi.app:web_app'
</code></pre>
<p>I think it could be nice if I could just add this to the config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.alias]
serve = &quot;run --no-sync gunicorn -w 8 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --timeout 86400 'bambi.app:web_app'&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and then simply run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">uv serve
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure that #5903 really refers to this use-case.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we're unlikely to introduce both this <em>and</em> #5903, as I think it'd be confusing to have multiple overlapping interfaces and #5903 would encompass the use-cases here.</p>
