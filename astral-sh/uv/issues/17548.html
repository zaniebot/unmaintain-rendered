<hr />
<p>I use global <code>ruff</code> and <code>ty</code> tools, and update when I see new version
If I have editor opened that registers LSP, I had issue with updating <code>ty</code> but never <code>ruff</code></p>
<pre><code>❯ uv tool update ruff
Updated ruff v0.14.11 -&gt; v0.14.13
 - ruff==0.14.11
 + ruff==0.14.13
error: Failed to upgrade ruff
  Caused by: Failed to install entrypoint
  Caused by: failed to copy file from C:\Users\klo\AppData\Roaming\uv\tools\ruff\Scripts\ruff.exe to C:\Users\klo\.local\bin\ruff.exe: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (os error 32)
</code></pre>
<p>I closed processes that were using ruff, and tried again. And what happens is what I noticed with <code>ty</code> too in such scenario:</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv tool update ruff
Nothing to upgrade
~
❯ ruff --version
ruff 0.14.11
</code></pre>
<p>What happens that <code>uv</code> can't see that there is update in this case?</p>
