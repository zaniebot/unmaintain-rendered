            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What kind of perf improvement do you think we'll have here? Is msgpack showing up on profiles?</p>
<p>I think there are definitely reasons to continue using msgpack, or, really, any other format that isn't tied to our in-memory representation of various data types. One of the costs associated with rkyv is that any change to a relevant data type, even just to its data layout, also invalidates all associated cached artifacts.</p>
<p>We also still currently don't have a good way of validating that we've bumped our rkyv-based cache versions when it's necessary to do so. Using rkyv in more places would exacerbate this.</p>
<p>If we're using msgpack in places where the types we are caching change very infrequently, then probably the downside of rkyv isn't as emphasized.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, it shows up for me in warm cache traces! We spend a lot of time deserializing the project metadata (as opposed to the list of files, for which we already use rkyv). That's the path I want to migrate. I don't think it's that different, honestly, that the cache gets invalidated on data layout. It already gets invalidated whenever we change the struct structures themselves.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah interesting. Might be worth it then. It would be great to have something that validates version bumps though. The failure modes there if we forget a version bump are pretty abysmal sadly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I got this to compile: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/tree/charlie/rkyv. It ended up not making a difference. I think that implementation is still spending a lot of time serializing and deserializing as strings, since <code>Url</code> and <code>MarkerTree</code> still go through strings. Plus, I end up having to deserialize everything upfront to cast from <code>ResolutionMetadata</code> to <code>ArchivedMetadata</code>.</p>
