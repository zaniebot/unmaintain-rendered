# Show the source of conflicting dependencies

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-22 04:20_

When dependencies directly conflict, we should show which file we loaded them from.

e.g.

```
× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
╰─▶ Because you require filelock==1.0.0 and you require filelock==3.8.0, we
    can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

from `compile_constraints_incompatible_version` could say

```
× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
╰─▶ Because you require filelock==1.0.0 (from requirements.txt) and you require filelock==3.8.0 (from constraints.txt), we
    can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

@zanieb I need this functionality for for an app installer tool that I'm writing. If you're willing to point out the files and rough line numbers that need to change, I would be happy to contribute a fix for this.
