            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have color help screens. The main screen is colored, but the help screens are not. I use bat to add color to man pages and find it to be very ergonomic. I run fish and created the following function which works great:</p>
<p>function man -d 'color man pages'
command man $argv | bat -l man -p
end</p>
<p>The uv help screens are not shipped as man pages, At least not yet. Therefore, this hack cannot be used.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Bat is a very capable tool and can be used to colorize the uv help screens.</p>
<p>If I were a programmer, I would implement it myself.</p>
<p>To get around that, I created the following fish function:</p>
<p>function uvh -d 'color uv help screens'
command uv help $argv | bat -l man -p
end</p>

Gnome 49.2
Ghostty 1.2.3
Fish 4.2.1
Uv 0.9.13
Rustup 1.28.2</p>
<p>If I run ‘uv’ or ‘uv help’ I get color, but ‘uv help run’ is not colored.
I have since found that ‘rustup default stable’  is no longer colored.
Maybe the issue lies with rust?</p>

Where would I create a config file to set the variable(s) in question?
I can create a uv.toml file if I know what to include.</p>

<p>Both are colored for me on Ubuntu 24.04 with bash in the gnome terminal,
and we haven't received other reports of this problem, did you maybe set
a setting such as |NO_COLOR|?</p>

<code>uv help</code> and <code>uv run --help</code> produce colored outputs but <code>uv help run</code> isn't colored.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Did some more testing and <code>uv help run --no-pager</code> does produce colored output, so it might be a paging related issue.</p>
