            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>uv currently ships two different binaries with each release, <code>uv</code> and <code>uvx</code>. According to the documentation, <code>uvx</code> is an alias for <code>uv tool run</code> and the two commands are exactly equivalent. The <code>uvx</code> binary appears to be implemented as an executable shim.</p>
<p>I would like to propose that <code>uv x</code> be provided in place of (or in addition to) <code>uvx</code>.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Precedence for this has been set with <code>uv v</code> which is an alias for <code>uv venv</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">C:\Users\Chris&gt;uv
error: 'uv' requires a subcommand but one was not provided
  [subcommands: run, init, add, remove, sync, lock, export, tree, tool, python, pip, venv, virtualenv, v, build, publish, build-backend, cache, self, clean, version, generate-shell-completion, --generate-shell-completion, help]

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] &lt;COMMAND&gt;

For more information, try '--help'.
</code></pre>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Removal of the shim would simplify the build and installation of uv and marginally reduce the size of the release assets (~150 KB for the x64 Windows archive).</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>A single <kbd>Space</kbd></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-console">C:\Users\Chris&gt;uv x
Provide a command to run with `uv x &lt;command&gt;`.

See `uv x --help` for more information.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems very unlikely that we would remove the <code>uvx</code> binary as it would be a disruptive breaking change — I don't see a compelling reason. It seems fine to provide <code>uv x</code> as another alias, but it's just more for people to get confused about.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a fair point... although I would be surprised if many users have opted for <code>uvx</code> over the more explicit <code>uv tool run</code> in scripted workflows. Users preferring the <code>uvx</code> alias could just add it to their <code>.bashrc</code> or make their own <code>uvx.cmd</code> shim in <code>.local\bin</code></p>
<p>(Also, the change would only be breaking if the installation script explicitly removed the shim from the previous uv release. The shim should theoretically work forever right?)</p>

<p>I don't think I've seen much evidence of this. I see <code>uvx</code> used pretty widely.</p>

<p>It'd be breaking for people using uv in ephemeral environments, like CI or containers.</p>

<p>You guys have been very good about not having many breaking changes. I would hate to see an influx of issues and bad PR as a result of something silly like this.</p>

<p>Windows exists. And in a professional environment is the most used OS.</p>
<p>UV is there to make the life of people easier. Not to make them create their own <code>uvx.cmd</code> command. You can create your own command and implement your way of work if you want.</p>
<p>Your assumptions on how people use <code>uvx</code> give me the impression that you do not use it or have explained someone else, that is not a techie, how to use it.</p>
<p>Not to mention that I would stop using it if a subcommand called <code>x</code> gets such a preferente treatment. I boycott everything named <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>I explicitly list tools as development dependencies in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and install them in the virtual environment of my project.</p>
<p><code>uvx</code> seems like an homage to <code>pipx</code> and <code>npx</code>. But I would argue that the intent of <code>uvx</code> is less clear. From the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools">Running tools</a></h3>
<p>The <code>uvx</code> command invokes a tool <strong>without installing it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then just a few lines down, it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tools are installed</strong> into temporary, isolated environments when using <code>uvx</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either a tool is installed or it is not. Which is it?</p>
<p>Clearly, tools are installed somewhere, but where? Will this abstract location just grow in size forever with tools that I tried out a single time? Why would I want this?</p>
<p>To me, this seems like a package management anti-pattern. But it is here to stay, since removing it would be a breaking change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uvx</code> is mainly for non technical people.</p>
<p>This will revolutionize how people consume Python programs. It is for &quot;the mass&quot;, not for developers.</p>
<p>Where packages are installed is clear. And how to handle the cache is clear too. Have a look to the documentation.</p>

<p>It isn't. Tools are installed in <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\uv\tools</code>, but I'm not talking about <code>uv tool install</code>, I'm talking about <code>uvx</code>.</p>
<p>The documentation clearly says that <code>uvx</code> invokes a tool without installing it. Yet the output of the <code>uvx</code> command clearly signifies that a package was installed. The installation location is <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\uv\cache\archive-v0\R5Go42aFFFox0OFmAOrJ_\</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">C:\Users\Chris&gt;uvx ruff
Installed 1 package in 80ms
</code></pre>
<p>Files were installed—copied to the file system—which is contrary to what the documentation says. I don't have a problem with it, but other users could see this as a violation of trust.</p>
<p>I would suggest at least updating the documentation to state that the files are installed to a cache. In-memory execution is a real thing and that isn't what's happening here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Even something like <code>uv pip compile &lt;(echo bottle)</code> writes files to the cache. I think it's OK to say nothing is installed if the &quot;installation&quot; is just into the cache, especially since in certain environments (e.g. Dockerfile) the cache directory is often on ephemeral storage.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why not have <code>uvx</code> be a symlink to <code>uv</code> and uv detects that it has been invoked as <code>uvx</code> (args[0]) and so use <code>uv tool run</code> ? It is for instance what busybox is doing, or vim with view/vimdiff/rvim/…</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uvx</code> is basically a symlink, it just needs to work cross-platform.</p>
<p>I took a look at the documentation to see if we should clarify that <code>uvx</code> installs into a temporary instance and immediately found &gt;3 instances of us saying that's what happens. If someone has a specific spot the language should change, please open a pull request.</p>
