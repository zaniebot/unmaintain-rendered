            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When adding a package from a private GitLab registry using uv add with a PAT embedded in the index URL (and storing credentials in the keyring), the package is initially installed successfully. However, running uv sync later results in a dependency resolution error due to missing authentication credentials.</p>
<h2>Reproduction Steps</h2>
<h3>Adding the Package</h3>
<p>The following command was used to add the package. It includes the PAT (<code>__token__</code> in the URL) and stores the credentials in the keyring.</p>
<pre><code>$ uv add private-package --keyring-provider &quot;subprocess&quot; --index gitlab=https://__token__@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/xxxxxxxx/packages/pypi/simple
</code></pre>
<h3>Syncing the Environment</h3>
<p>After the package was added, executing the command below to update the environment resulted in the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv sync -U --keyring-provider &quot;subprocess&quot;
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because private-package was not found in the package registry and your project depends on private-package, we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.
      hint: An index URL (https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/xxxxxxxx/packages/pypi/simple) could not be queried due to a lack of valid authentication credentials (401 Unauthorized).
</code></pre>
<h3>Identifying the Cause</h3>
<p>Upon examining the generated pyproject.toml, it was found that the authentication token (<code>__token__</code>) was removed from the index URL, which prevents the keyring from providing the necessary credentials:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;app&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;private-package&quot;,
]

[tool.uv.sources]
private-package = { index = &quot;gitlab&quot; }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = &quot;gitlab&quot;
url = &quot;https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/xxxxxxxx/packages/pypi/simple&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Is this behavior intended?
If so, it would be helpful to display a warning message indicating that the credentials have been removed, so that users are aware of the change.
(Apologies if this is already documented or has been reported in another issue.)</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Darwin 23.5.0 arm64</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.2 (6d3614eec 2025-02-19)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, it's correct. We never write plaintext credentials to a <code>pyproject.toml</code> or <code>uv.lock</code>. You can provide them via environment variables or similar. See: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/#providing-credentials.</p>
