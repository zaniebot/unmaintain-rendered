# Feature request: Generate `.gitignore` with uv init

_Issue opened by @DataEnggNerd on 2024-09-26 15:04_

It would be great if a standard .gitignore file also gets generated with `uv init`

It looks like this was added in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5476 and was tracked by https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7016. It should be in the next release via `uv init --vcs git`.
