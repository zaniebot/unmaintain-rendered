<p>Certainly: https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/1.4.52/#files</p>
<p>I think best if you  trim+ add hash if the file name exceeds a certain length. That would be probably best solution (it would be a pity to loose the name from cache and replace it with a meaningless hash - though many similar solutions do it exactly this way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we just need some kind of deterministic encoding since it&#x27;s content-addressed. (I.e., when we <em>have</em> that wheel name from PyPI, we need to know where to look in the cache.) Definitely doable!</p>

<p>Yeah. Note though that, AIUI, the manifest is only 1 of 2 things that are required. The user also needs to apply a registry edit: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello @charliermarsh @zanieb  - would it be possible to prioritise that one a bit now?</p>
<p>To add a bit of context - we are now discussing Airlfow 3 approach of managing our complex dependencies and providers, and one of the options considered is to use <code>uv workspace</code> feature for that (as discussed before - I looked at it recently and I <strong>think</strong> it has all we need now, and I will make a POC to show to other PMC members and development community how uv workspaces might be useful to simplify and standardise our setup for providers.</p>
<p>Now - this one makes my life really hard ... Either I have to remove cache or move the cache somewhere aside of my home directory to another filesystem (but then hard-links don&#x27;t work) etc. etc.  Also for me - this is quite a blocker to propose it - with our number of contributors (we <strong>just</strong> passed 3000!) - surely there will be some like me who have they home dir encrypted - especially that it&#x27;s an option in multiple distros that you can select (For me - that came out-of-the box with my Linux mint installation and as a security freak I obviously enabled it).</p>
<p>Maybe a good solution will be to check if the filesystem is encrypted or simply react to &quot;too long filename&quot; and use a hash instead - there is no need to change it in bulk - simply handling the exception when it occurs should be good-enough and have very little effect on debuggability.</p>
<p>Looking forward to having this one solved (I&#x27;d do it myself - but I have far too many things on my plate  now to learn rust and all the internals of <code>uv</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi everyone, the issue with long cache names also displays some cryptic error messages such as <code>Caused by: stream did not contain valid UTF-8</code>, but it has no relation to UTF-8 or string encoding.</p>
<pre><code>Resolved 203 packages in 2ms
error: Failed to prepare distributions
  Caused by: Failed to fetch wheel: django-async-messages==0.3.1
  Caused by: Failed to run C:\Users\JoaoBernardo\Documents\Projects\myproject-main\.uv_cache\builds-v0\.tmp8EzDKf\Scripts\python.exe
  Caused by: stream did not contain valid UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If you shorten the the cache dir to e.g. <code>c:\cache\</code> it will work fine.</strong></p>
<p>There is sometimes a second very long error message such as <code>Build backend failed to build wheel through build_wheel() with exit code: 1</code> and a large stderr after.</p>
<p>These messages are all irrelevant IMO as they just show where in time UV crashed due to a long file name, but the solution will to shorten the path somehow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just a small ping on that one.. We already started to move to uv for workspaces, and I got my Linux PC with encryption back from cooling system replacement.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI. We&#x27;ve switched Airflow (and I also did it) to use <code>uv</code> for recommended workflows and while I have been using uv heavily for syncing and installing things on the regular, encrypted volume I had, I stopped seeing the issue in recent uv version and airflow development environments.</p>
<p>I have also not heard anyone else having similar issue.</p>
<p>Not sure what caused it though. W have not changed our requirements for sqlalchemy, but maybe either the algorithm that decides which packages to install or other &quot;generic&quot; error handling in <code>uv</code> made the error disappear.</p>
<p>From my perspective - this issue can be closed, I think I&#x27;d have seen it again with the heavy usage of <code>uv</code> for a number of cases and switching to older versions of airflow for backporting if it was still a problem. It used to occur <strong>every time</strong> when I reported it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There were some recent but minor improvements on some file names (according to the changelog on 0.5.x line), but for us, on Windows we still get inexplicable issues that goes away by changing the cache path via pyproject.toml that cause other issues still.</p>
<p>And the issue with Windows docker containers that get an even smaller limit for file names. We were able to partially overcome that on our specific user case, but the whole thing is too buggy for my taste.</p>

<p>I can be still subscribed :) no worries. I have no plans from my side to close it - not my decision, I think it&#x27;s far more important to see if there is - like @charliermarsh mentioned - more users affected and clear reproduction/evidence that it disrupts more users.</p>
<p>From Airflow at least (and our 700+deps + the <code>uv workflow</code> that we implemented) - we see the problem is generally gone. I just know - being an OSS maintainer myself - how cool it is to see a &quot;fresh&quot; status on some old &quot;low-priority&quot; issues and feedback from those who raised them.</p>
<p>BTW. I&#x27;d personally agree with @charliermarsh  - and even more - qualify that issue as a &quot;fix it if you need&quot; kind of thing. Since this seems like a very low/rare impact issue - I&#x27;d say to anyone who wants to get it fixed - &quot;Yeah we know it, and we know how loe impact it has. If you really want to have it solved, feel free to provide a complete PR that we can review and merge, that will not disrupt the <code>9x%</code> of cases. We are ok with loosing the 100-9x%&quot;.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s just me - with side comment and assessment.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just the question of what else (more important) will not be done if that one is prioritized (i.e. &quot;missed opportunities&quot;).</p>
