# does uv support python 3.7?

_Issue opened by @robert8138 on 2025-01-10 02:52_

Hi all,

First of all, thank you for your hard work in developing and maintaining uv. Its impressive speed has made us eager to adopt it for our team’s projects. However, I have a question regarding its compatibility with Python 3.7.

Our project depends on a specific version of Airflow that requires Python 3.7. Based on [this pull request](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1105) and discussions [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1221) and [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1239/files#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711R9), it seems that uv officially requires Python 3.8 or higher.

That said, I ran some tests with uv in a Python 3.7 environment using CircleCI, and surprisingly, everything worked without any issues. I confirmed that my tests used a Python 3.7 image:

```
Status: Downloaded newer image for cimg/python:3.7  
cimg/python:3.7:  
  pull stats: download 349.5MiB in 3.553s (98.35MiB/s), extract 349.4MiB in 11.454s (30.51MiB/s)  
  time to create container: 3.242s  
```

I also verified that UV was installed successfully:

```
downloading uv 0.5.16 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu  
no checksums to verify  
installing to /home/circleci/.local/bin  
  uv  
  uvx  
everything's installed!  
Using CPython 3.7.17 interpreter at: /home/circleci/.pyenv/versions/3.7.17/bin/python  
Creating virtual environment at: .venv  
```

For the remainder of the CI job, I was able to useuv to activate a venv to download all dependencies and successfully run Ruff for formatting and linting.

Given that UV appears to function with Python 3.7 in my tests, I want to understand the risks of using UV in this unsupported environment. It seems that Python 3.7 is no longer part of UV’s testing infrastructure, as noted in the PR above, which raises concerns about potential edge cases or regressions.

Thank you for taking the time to answer this rudimentary question, and I appreciate your help in clarifying this!

We don't "officially" support it (see [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/policies/platforms/)), but I would expect it to work. I obviously can't promise anything, but I would be somewhat surprised if 3.7 broke any time soon. There just aren't very many meaningful changes (from uv's perspective) between 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, etc.

So, yes, there's a risk that it stops working at some point, though I personally would be comfortable using uv with a 3.7 project.
