# Avoid showing resolution spinner in `uvx` with fully-cached resolution

I think `uvx ruff check` will briefly show the spinner even if all the data is cached.

I can think of a few things to do here... (1) only start the spinner when we realize we have to make a network request, or do a build, or whatever; (2) always hide this spinner for `uvx`; (3) put a separate caching layer into `uvx` (or `CachedEnvironment`) that skips the resolver entirely based on a 10-minute timer.
