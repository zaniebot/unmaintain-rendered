            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have a script in my repo which generates uv scripts. Notice that it has a shebang, but not a shebang with <code>--script</code>. It also has some script templates defined as multi-line string inside.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env uv run

my_script = '''
# /// script
# requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11&quot;
# dependencies = [&quot;requests&quot;]
# ///
...

import project_dependency
...
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>project_dependency</code> is any dependency other than 'requests'.</p>
<p>We get an import error, even though <code>project_dependency</code> is listed in the pyproject.toml of my project (and since I'm calling uv run without the --script tag it should get it from there)</p>
<p>When I remove the multi-line string it works!</p>
<p>I think uv might be parsing the PEP723-style comments from anywhere in the file, even inside multi-line strings.</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>macos</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.9.2</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.12.10</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is, unfortunately for your use case, intentional on the part of the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a> specification, which specifically does not require Python parsing to determine whether a block is actually a PEP 723 comment or not: &quot;Furthermore, Python’s syntax changes in every release. If extracting dependency data needs a Python parser, the parser will need to know which version of Python the script is written for, and the overhead for a generic tool of having a parser that can handle <em>multiple</em> versions of Python is unsustainable.&quot; See also the reference implementation and reference regular expression, which do not do anything special to avoid finding these comment blocks inside multi-line string literals.</p>
<p>There was an extended previous discussion in #12303 with some input from the author of the PEP. uv's behavior here is consistent with other tools that implement PEP 723 (with one exception I know of, pex-tool/pex#2722), and if nothing else, I think it would be more confusing if we deviated from the spec / the consensus reading of it.</p>
<p>See if you can figure out some way to make that inline block not match the spec, e.g. indenting it and wrapping it with <code>textwrap.dedent</code> or something.</p>
