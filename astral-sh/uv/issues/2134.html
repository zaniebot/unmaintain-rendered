            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When testing against a local <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/"><code>pypiserver</code></a>, <code>uv</code> errors with</p>
<pre><code>error: error sending request for url (http://localhost:3141/simple/albatross/): channel closed
    Caused by: channel closed
</code></pre>
<p>This is resolved by limiting parallelism of the test threads. There are no errors in the server logs.</p>
<p>Looks like this may be an upstream issue:</p>

<p>What is the appropriate way to limit the number of threads here please? :) I'd be happy to make things a bit slower to resolve this issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry you're hitting it. I kind of think it's a pypiserver bug, I haven't seen this elsehwere.</p>
<p>For limiting concurrency, see #3493 — we're about to release <code>UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS</code> for this purpose.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, thank you! Indeed that seems to resolve things for me.</p>
<p>For the sake of any future readers: in my case the local server is an implementation I control. For reasons that are a little beyond my ken, switching the implementation from <code>http.server</code> to <code>flask</code> also seems to have resolved this issue (without needing to restrict <code>uv</code>'s concurrency).</p>
