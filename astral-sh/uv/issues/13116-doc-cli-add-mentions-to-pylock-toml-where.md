# [Doc, CLI] Add mentions to `pylock.toml` where appropriate

---

_Issue opened by @ReinforcedKnowledge on 2025-04-26 03:59_

### Summary

Hi!

I just noticed a couple of places here and there where `pylock.toml` can be added to indicate its support.

I did a small PR (#13115) for that, feel free to decline it if it doesn't correspond to your style of writing. 

I tried to say "PEP-751 compatible lock files" when appropriate to also include the case `r"^pylock\.([^.]+)\.toml$"`. Feel free to change that if you think it's cluttery.

I also tried to include the "single-use" wording when it made sense.
