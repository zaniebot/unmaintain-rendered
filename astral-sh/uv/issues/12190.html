            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I have to ask this as it's so hard to find this in the docs. How does one upgrade a Python package (defined in <code>pyproject.toml</code>) using uv?</p>
<p>In pip it used to be:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U &lt;package_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The following do the same in uv:</p>
<pre><code>uv add -U &lt;package_name&gt;
uv lock -U
uv sync -U
</code></pre>
<p>In all cases, <code>uv.lock</code> gets updated, <strong>but the <code>pyproject.toml</code> is unchanged.</strong>
How can I get my <code>pyproject.toml</code> to also update its version using the above commands?</p>
<h3>Use case</h3>
<p>I want the version of the package that's in the <code>uv.lock</code> to be the same as my <code>pyproject.toml</code>. With the current behaviour, say I start a project with a set of packages of a particular version. Package xxx gets a new version, but package yyy doesn't change. When I run <code>uv add -U xxx</code>, the contents of <code>pyproject.toml</code> remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Why is this? It's useful to inspect the contents of <code>pyproject.toml</code> to see what package a project depends on, but if it's not kept up to date with <code>uv.lock</code> over time, doesn't it sort of defeat the purpose of having a <code>pyproject.toml</code>?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>MacOS Sequoia 15.3.1</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.6 (Homebrew 2025-03-12)</p>
