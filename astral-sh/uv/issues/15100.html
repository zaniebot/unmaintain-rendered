            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the specific reason /usr/bin shows up here is that Gentoo's Python is set up such that <code>sudo pip install</code> something, the commands go into /usr/bin (i.e., that <code>sysconfig.get_path('scripts') == '/usr/bin'</code>). On e.g. Debian/Ubuntu, it's set up to use /usr/local/bin even though Python itself is in /usr/bin. So you can reproduce this bug on Debian/Ubuntu with e.g.</p>
<pre><code>sudo truncate -s 1000 /usr/local/bin/unreadable
sudo chmod 000 /usr/local/bin/unreadable
uv run --no-managed-python --with attrs python
</code></pre>
<p>This fails in the same way on uv 0.8.4, and is indeed fixed on 0.8.5.</p>
