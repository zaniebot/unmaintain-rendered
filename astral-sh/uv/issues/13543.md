# How to allow users to simply `pip install` when I use uv workspaces?

### Question

Hi! Thanks for this awesome tool, I really like how fast it is and that it can replace multiple CLI tools for managing my Python development setup. I have been experimenting with moving to UV from setuptools for a project, and I'm a little stumped by an issue I'm having.

Trying to follow [this page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/), I have a project that looks like this:

```
> tree uv-test
uv-test
├── packages
│   └── uv-helper
│       ├── pyproject.toml
│       └── src
│           └── uv_helper
│               └── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── uv_test
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── py.typed
└── uv.lock

7 directories, 7 files
```

In `uv-test/pyproject.toml` I have:

```
[project]
name = "uv-test"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
authors = [
    { name = "Adam", email = "73994535+adamtuft@users.noreply.github.com" }
]
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = ["uv-helper"]

[tool.uv.sources]
uv-helper = { workspace = true }

[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["packages/*"]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["packages/uv-helper/src/uv_helper"]
```

In `uv-test/packages/uv-helper/pyproject.toml` I have:

```
[project]
name = "uv-helper"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
authors = [
    { name = "Adam", email = "73994535+adamtuft@users.noreply.github.com" }
]
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = []

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

When I run `uv pip install git/uv-test` with a fresh venv active, all works as expected:

```
> uv pip install git/uv-test
Using Python 3.13.3 environment at: .venv/uv-test
Resolved 2 packages in 2ms
      Built uv-test @ file:///home/adam/git/uv-test
      Built uv-helper @ file:///home/adam/git/uv-test/packages/uv-helper
Prepared 2 packages in 288ms
Installed 2 packages in 0.56ms
 + uv-helper==0.1.0 (from file:///home/adam/git/uv-test/packages/uv-helper)
 + uv-test==0.1.0 (from file:///home/adam/git/uv-test)
```

However, if I simply try to run `pip install git/uv-test` then the installation fails:

```
> pip install git/uv-test
Processing ./git/uv-test
  Installing build dependencies ... done
  Getting requirements to build wheel ... done
  Preparing metadata (pyproject.toml) ... done
INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of uv-test to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement uv-helper (from uv-test) (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for uv-helper
```

What am I getting wrong here? I would have expected to be able to `pip install` the package if I have correctly structured the project and given the dependencies. I'd like to allow my end-users to `pip install <path-or-git-repo>` without requiring that they use uv - I would have thought that uv is part of my development workflow, and shouldn't be required for users to install my package.

Thanks!

### Platform

Linux

### Version


```
uv 0.7.5
Python 3.13.3

If I'm reading correctly: anything that relies on `[tool.uv.sources]` won't work with pip, because pip doesn't know how to resolve those.

I see, is there a `pip`-compatible way that I can declare the `uv-helper` dependency is part of the project? Should I avoid using uv's workspaces in this case?

EDIT: Having thought some more about my problem, I realise that my project's structure is confused. In my case the `uv_helper` package makes more sense as an internal sub-package rather than a standalone dependency. That will solve all my packaging problems.
