# Add torch-tensorrt support to uv-torch crate

---

_Issue opened by @vient on 2025-12-09 17:55_

### Summary

On my Ubuntu 20.04 with CUDA 12.8 (latest available on this OS version) this command
```sh
uv pip install --no-index --torch-backend cu128 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch-tensorrt torch-tensorrt
```
installs packages built for CUDA 13.0 so importing torch_tensorrt fails. Specifying version further to `torch-tensorrt==2.9.0+cu128` fixes the issue. As I understand, uv-torch crate already performs automatic flavor choosing for some torch packages but torch-tensorrt is not handled.

Oh yeah, agreed. Not sure how we missed that.
