            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For URL- and path-based source distributions, we're going to assume they are always up-to-date once built. This greatly simplifies the caching and at least leads to predictable behavior. (In the future, we will likely implement smarter behavior around invalidation.) However, we need to provide users with a way to force a rebuild of specific packages (or all packages) that match these descriptions. This proposes uses a <code>--rebuild</code> flag which could optionally accept the names of packages. When we run with <code>--rebuild</code>, we'll (1) purge the cache of any built wheels for those packages, and then (2) mark any installed versions as extraneous in the install plan.</p>
