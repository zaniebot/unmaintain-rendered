# minor formatting: dependency grouping not preserved if there's an empty line between

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.3.5 (6c62d9fbf 2024-08-27)
```

starting with
```
$ cat pyproject.toml 
[project]
name = "uv-empty-space"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    # first block
    "requests",

    # second block
    "pydantic",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
running `uv add pandas` yields the below:
```
$ cat pyproject.toml 
[project]
name = "uv-empty-space"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    # first block
    "requests",
    # second block
    "pydantic",
    "pandas>=2.2.2",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
i wonder if the empty line between `requests` and `pydantic` should be preserved?
