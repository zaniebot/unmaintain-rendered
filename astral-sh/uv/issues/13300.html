            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>When I'm creating a lock file with <code>uv lock</code>, it will always lock the newest available versions. Is it possible to create a lock file which matches the versions installed in the venv? I have not been able to find a combination of options which would achieve this.
Alternatively, can I create a lock file from requirements.txt file?</p>
<p>I would need this for the process of migrating to uv: I would like to keep the pinned versions the same as before to keep the change minimal.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In practice, for the first option I would install the packages based on the <code>requirements.txt</code> file and then lock.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">rm -rf .venv
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv lock --something?
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use <code>uv pip freeze</code> to record the installed versions and use them as constraint dependencies for the first locking (you might need some manual editing for the transition from one environment to universal locking)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That is not what I'm going for - I already have the dependencies I want to keep available as <code>requirements.txt</code> files. I am trying to figure out how to make a <code>uv.lock</code> file with the same versions as those in the requirements files. One way I thought would be doable is to first install those versions into a virtualenv and then somehow create a <code>uv.lock</code> file which would reflect the <em>installed</em> versions instead of the newest ones available.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can pass the <code>requirements.txt</code> as a constraint:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;anyio&quot; &gt; requirements.in
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
uv add -r requirements.in -c requirements.txt
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, @charliermarsh, that is an interesting approach but gets me forward, thanks!</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Create a backup of pyproject.toml
cp pyproject.toml pyproject.backup

# Set the pinned requirements to be the constraints in pyproject.toml
uv add -r requirements.txt -c requirements.txt

# uv.lock is now created

# Now that we have a lock file, let's revert the original config file
mv pyproject.backup pyproject.toml
