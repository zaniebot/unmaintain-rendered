            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Many tools in the python development process could benefit from a consistent way of resolving the current project&#x27;s python executable and virtual env. Since uv already has <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#python-discovery">documented logic for python discovery</a> it would be nice if we could just build off of this mechanism.</p>
<p>One example is how pyright tries to do its own python discovery but in many cases doesn&#x27;t work properly. The way pyright actually works when it&#x27;s invoked via pylance in vscode is closer to the following invocation <code>pyright --pythonpath $ABS_PATH_TO_PYTHON --project $ABS_PATH_TO_PROJECT_ROOT</code> see <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/7296#issuecomment-2013158802">this discussion on how to improve the python experience in Zed</a>.</p>
<p>VSCode and PyCharm have similar issues where the user usually has to go hunt for the path to the python interpreter. Poetry does a similar python discovery, if you&#x27;ve installed poetry via <code>pipx</code> this means you already have an active venv so you find yourself needed to do <code>pyenv ... &amp;&amp; poetry env use $(which python)</code> to make sure it doesn&#x27;t pick the pipx base python install (often either system python or homebrew managed python rather than the pyenv managed version you actually want).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure there are details to think through, but a first proposal might be something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>uv which python [PATH(default=PWD)]
</code></pre>
<p>where the path could be a PROJECT_ROOT (containing a pyproject.toml or some other marker) or any child path of the project root. I&#x27;m assuming ruff could also share some of this project root and python language version inference logic</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting idea! I&#x27;m not sure how we&#x27;d want to expose this but I feel the pain of finding versions.</p>
<p>See also #2386 which defines robust logic we want to implement for interpreter discovery.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I came across this issue when wondering how to figure out, in a script, how <code>uv</code> was installed on a system: specifically, I would like to know if the user installed <code>uv</code> via pip (in which case I should not uninstall <code>uv</code> during <code>uv pip sync</code>) or if it&#x27;s a system-wide binary (in which case I do not need to special-case a <code>uv</code> pip package). Maybe figuring out <code>uv</code> kind of installation fits into this issue.</p>
<p>(If there are other ways to achieve what I describe above, I&#x27;m all ears, too.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@bersbersbers I guess I&#x27;d just <code>which uv</code> and see if&#x27;s in the Python environment&#x27;s bin directory or not? You could also see if it&#x27;s in the site-packages which won&#x27;t be the case for non-pip installs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb yes, that was my idea, too. It&#x27;s not straightforward, given symlinks, the various Python distributions, system installations vs. virtual environments (various ones), etc. But I assume <code>uv</code> itself may not know better, so maybe I&#x27;ll just try myself :)</p>
