            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a project with dynamic dependencies.</p>
<p>With uv 0.2.29 <code>uv pip install -e .</code> does not install new dynamic dependencies when I add some to my project, while it did reinstall with uv &lt; 0.2.28.</p>
<p>This is likely due to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5206.</p>
<p>I understand the rationale for <code>uv run</code>, but for the scenario of reinstalling a project in editable mode, this behavior is surprising. Was this change intended?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It was an intentional change. The decision was that if you want your editable project to &quot;always reinstall&quot;, you should set <code>reinstall-package = [&quot;foo&quot;]</code> in your persistent configuration.</p>
<p>We could consider changing the behavior for explicit cases like <code>pip install -e .</code> though, and always reinstall those (as opposed to in <code>uv run</code> where it's sort of implicit). I don't love have separate semantics which is why I avoided it, and instead made it opt-in...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, thanks.</p>
<p>And if I have a git dependency <code>foo @ git+https://github.com/org/foo@shaX</code> that I change to <code>foo @ git+https://github.com/org/project@shaY</code> and the <code>pyproject.toml</code> of <code>foo</code> over there has not changed between <code>shaX</code> and <code>shaY</code> but the dynamic dependencies of foo have changed, will it recompute the dependencies ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, in that case it should recompute dependencies.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries. The rules only changed for source trees (i.e., directories), and they're the same regardless of whether it's editable or not, and regardless of whether it's dynamic or not: we recompute and reinstall if (1) a metadata file changes (<code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>setup.py</code>, or <code>setup.cfg</code> -- this is a heuristic) or (2) the user passes <code>--reinstall</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the explanation. So it's not only about metadata, but the whole local directory, correct?</p>
<p>If I do a non-editable install of a local directory, then modify it, I have to use <code>--reinstall</code> (which reinstalls everything) or <code>--reinstall-package myprojectname</code> (for which I have to remember the project name).</p>
<p>When used from the command line this feels slightly awkward to me. When used from uv run or for a multi project workspace the new default may be better. I don't know if it's my own habits influencing my perception here or if there is something else.</p>
<p>BTW, in the example above it should be <code>--reinstall-package black</code> instead of <code>--reinstall black</code>, right? Perhaps this is indicative of a UX intuitiveness issue?</p>
