# `uv pip compile` doesn't seem to support emitting its results to stdout

---

When running `uv pip compile requirements.in --output-file=-` I expected to have the ouptut printed in stdout like it does with `pip-compile`. Instead, it gets written to a file called `-` on the filesystem.

pip-compile (and uv) defaults to writing to stdout if no `--output-file` is specified. Does that not work for your use case?

When I run locally, with `pip-compile requirements.in --output-file=-`, I get a double output in stdout:
```python
#
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with Python 3.12
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile with Python 3.12
# by the following command:
# by the following command:
#
#
#    pip-compile --output-file=- requirements.in
#    pip-compile --output-file=- requirements.in
#
#
blinker==1.7.0
    # via flask
blinker==1.7.0
    # via flask
click==8.1.7
    # via flask
click==8.1.7
    # via flask
```

**Edit:** pip-compile seems to write to both stdout and stderr when you specify `--output-file=-`

Silly me, with no `--output-file` it prints to stdout just fine!

I wonder if it should print to `stdout` in either case.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-02-19 19:25_

I feel like it should.

You mean if it should write to stdout if `--output-file=-` is specified? I think I generally agree, it would behave same as `pip-compile` in that scenario. I'll leave potential reopening to you/other maintainers however - my specific issue (issue of skill as it turns out!) is solved, and I can't specifically ask the team for near-duplicate work, I'm sure you all have worthwhile things to do anyway.
