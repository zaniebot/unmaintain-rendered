            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I got this error when building and uploading my wheel with 0.5.5 to pypi.org.:</p>
<pre><code>Upload failed with status code 400 Bad Request. Server says: 400 license-file introduced in metadata version 2.4, not 2.1. See https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>But it does work for me with 0.5.4.</p>
<p>Accoridng to the release notes, with 0.5.5 uv started to use license-file, however I did not see a mention of moving the metadata version...</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,
Franz</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is probably #9442: It's correct that you can only use <code>license-file</code> with metadata of at least version 2.4, but we were missing that field in the upload payload previously so pypi's validation didn't work. What build backend are you using?</p>

There is is a setuptools bug, but there's also something funky going on with uv.
I removed all mentions of license from my pyproject.toml and <code>rm -rf build dist; uv build; uv publish</code> gave me the same error. I then did <code>rm -rf build dist; python -m build . ; python -m twine upload dist/*</code> and everything works just fine. What gives?</p>

<p>Use hatchling instead of setuptools should solve this problem, you can find guide about this in uv documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hauntsaninja:</p>
<p>PEP 639 adds two new fields to the wheel metadata, <code>License-Expression</code> and <code>License-File</code>, with the corresponding <code>pyproject.toml</code> fields <code>license = &quot;...&quot;</code> and <code>license-files = [...]</code>. These fields are added in the new metadata version 2.4.</p>
<p>When uploading a wheel, the uploader reads the <code>METADATA</code> file from the wheel and transforms it to formdata. PyPI has recently started validating the two new metadata fields from PEP 639 in the formdata, thought PyPI does not validate the <code>METADATA</code>. Twine hasn't implemented that PEP yet (https://github.com/pypa/twine/pull/1180), so it does not set the new license fields in the formdata, and PyPI does not catch the invalid metadata (declaring metadata version 2.1 while using version 2.4 fields).</p>

<p>The twine PR was just merged. It also added a carveout for setuptools to exclude <code>License-File</code> from the metadata if the version is <code>&lt;2.4</code> as to not break all projects which use setuptools. Maybe this is something which could be added to <code>uv</code> as well? https://github.com/pypa/twine/blob/main/twine/package.py#L225-L234</p>
<p>The setuptools behavior has been in place for so long at this point that it's probably not worth changing until PEP 639 is fully implemented. I've PRs open for that but those depend on some other work which need to happen first and will likely still need some time.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is a workaround. However, I'd advise against it. It will not only remove the <code>License-File</code> metadata but also the license files from the distribution. You can include them manually via <code>MANIFEST.in</code> but they will still be excluded from the wheel (unless placed inside the project package itself).</p>
<p>The ideal case would really be a workaround added to <code>uv</code> just like in <code>twine</code>.</p>
