            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Searched the docs/issues and found many similar-sounding things but not quite exactly this:</p>
<p>I just want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>upgrade a dependency <code>blah</code> to the latest version from PyPi subject to any constraints in the
<code>pyproject.toml</code>,</li>
<li>update <code>uv.lock</code></li>
<li>update other pkgs as needed (also subject to their constraints of course)</li>
<li>failout if a consistent upgrade is not possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found these commands but they don't do it:</p>
<pre><code>uv sync --help | grep upgrade
  -U, --upgrade                            Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies `--refresh`
  -P, --upgrade-package &lt;UPGRADE_PACKAGE&gt;  Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe this is documented somewhere but I'm finding it easier to ask here (apologies in advance!)</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>MacOS</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.5.8</p>

<p>Actually it does work (there was some other issue in my env), and thanks for clarifying, and sorry about the distraction</p>
