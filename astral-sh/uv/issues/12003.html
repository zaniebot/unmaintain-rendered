            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We used uv 0.5 previously and this problem did not occur there, so we had a <code>uv cache prune</code> at the end of the docker script to save some space (but we still wanted a small cache so we could sync the env on run later).</p>
<p>Now we have upgraded to uv 0.6.4 and cache prune is much more aggressive. We run with UV_LINK_MODE=symlink (also to save some space), which might be of interest.</p>
<p>The result is that the imports that point to .so binaries no longer resolve in python.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for this great piece of software!</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.4</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.12.3</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately using <code>uv cache prune</code> (and <code>uv cache clean</code>) with <code>UV_LINK_MODE=symlink</code> is effectively unsupported. We should probably warn about this. They're sort of just inherently incompatible... If you're symlinking into the cache, we have no way of knowing what's in-use, and removing the source files breaks the symlinks (as you'd expect).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should at least warn about this (and possibly do a more limited prune).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, have you seen this issue by any chance? #11694</p>
<p>It's a bit unrelated but it's also about <code>uv cache prune</code> removing things it shouldn't :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did try both with and without the --ci flag, but it does not seem to matter much.</p>
<p>It seems like the files that it can't find are mostly .so files, the binary modules. So if you try something like numpy this would happen. If I reainstall the package from which it fails to import, it will start working and move on to the next one.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think that if I must choose, it makes more sense to do that pruning (with --ci) than the symlinking, so I should try that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you give me a concrete example of the commands to run (and which package to use), and the error message you see? It's hard for me to help without being able to reproduce.</p>
