<p>There's a similar regression with <code>--universal</code>. Spotted in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5962.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given that a small change in dependencies could lead to exploring a large part of the resolution graph that doesn't lead to a direct solution, is there a reason you would expect benchmarks to remain stable across dates?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't necessarily expect it to remain stable, but it's worth investigating if we can do better. As a hint, Poetry actually outperforms us on this benchmark now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, in that case,  I see the min time between 2024-07-19 and 2024-07-20 jump by 35%.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The metadata in the openai wheel is almost identical, but the metadata in the pyOpenSSL has a change in an upper bound, which in my experience upper bounds are hard for resolvers and uv's main weakness in resolution.</p>
<pre><code>$ diff pyOpenSSL-24.1.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata pyOpenSSL-24.2.1-py3-none-any.whl.metadata

&lt;&lt;&lt; A bunch of changelog notes &gt;&gt;&gt;

<p>In both versions of resolution cryptography gets resolved to 42.0.8 but on PyPi it is at 43.0.0: https://pypi.org/project/cryptography, so since pyOpenSSL-24.2.1 it appears uv is spending a bunch of time exploring a solution with cryptography  43.0.0 and it eventually leads to a backtrack.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I investigated this a little further by pinning apache-airflow (which is far more realistic of its use) and cryptography:</p>
<pre><code>apache-airflow[all]==2.9.3
apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam&gt;3.0.0
cryptography==43.0.0
</code></pre>
<p>It resolves as impossible, and ends with:</p>
<pre><code>And because apache-airflow[all]==2.9.3 depends on apache-airflow-providers-snowflake, we can conclude that apache-airflow[all]==2.9.3 depends on cryptography&gt;=2.5.0,&lt;43.0.0.
  	And because you require apache-airflow[all]==2.9.3 and cryptography==43.0.0, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>I <em>suspect</em> what you will find is that while uv pins <code>cryptography==43.0.0</code> it tries to exhaust all versions of <code>apache-airflow-providers-snowflake</code> because of <code>apache-airflow-providers-snowflake</code>s upper bound on cryptography.</p>
<p>I will again stand by my idea that when resolution hits an upper bound that is below the current pinned version of that upper bound, it is worth going back to an earlier state in the resolution and prioritise the package that is applying the upper bound over the package constrained by the upper bound (rather than exhausting the package that applying the upper bound): https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1398#issuecomment-2013504447 (although a lot of details need to be worked out, I haven’t had a chance recently to work on this).</p>
<p>There may be low hanging heuristics here though that uv could apply before something so complex.</p>

<p>A variation over time in this range is expected, because there's new versions in the set over times, but sometimes it also gets faster as conflicts are resolved in new versions.</p>
