<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

```
❯ uv venv -p 3.13      
  × No interpreter found for Python 3.13 in managed installations or system path

❯ uv --version
uv 0.3.4 (39f3cd2a9 2024-08-26)
```

Also, 3.13 doesn't seem to be in the list:

```
❯ uv python list --all-versions

Woohoo! Yay! Thank you!

You're welcome! It's released in 0.4.9 already.

I can't seem to be able to install 3.13 on macOs. Any idea why?

```
% uv python install 3.13
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.13
error: No download found for request: cpython-3.13-macos-aarch64-none
```

It's not available yet, only `uv python install 3.13rc3` is. We're working on it, but it takes a bit to build and publish all the distributions.

Actually sorry that was incorrect, since we only have release candidates available it should "just work" still

```
❯ uv python install 3.13
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.13
Installed Python 3.13.0rc2 in 1.63s
 + cpython-3.13.0rc2-macos-aarch64-none
```

Are you on the latest uv version?

_Comment by @simonsanvil on 2024-10-08 13:21_

I just checked, and indeed, the issue was that I wasn't on the latest version. Thank you for the quick reply

```
❯ uv self update
info: Checking for updates...
success: Upgraded uv to v0.4.19! https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.4.19
❯ uv python install 3.13

uv v0.6.5 installs 3.13.2 for me:
```
$ uv python install 3.13
Installed Python 3.13.2 in 2.85s
 + cpython-3.13.2-linux-x86_64-gnu
```

after uninstalling it worked, nice
