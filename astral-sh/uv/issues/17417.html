<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I followed the instructions for uv's standalone installer:</p>
<p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer</p>
<p>The version I have installed is <code>uv 0.9.24 (0fda1525e 2026-01-09)</code> after that step. When I run <code>uv self update</code>, I get the following errors:</p>
<pre><code>error: Self-update is only available for uv binaries installed via the standalone installation scripts.

If you installed uv with pip, brew, or another package manager, update uv with `pip install --upgrade`, `brew upgrade`, or similar.
</code></pre>
<p>I have previously installed uv, but have uninstalled it for the purpose of testing internal guidelines. We also have fresh PC installs that replicate this issue.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it's related, but a coworker also had uvw
.exe quarantined by Windows Defender:</p>

<p>The issue with Windows Defender is no longer happening today, so this more or less produces no relevant output.</p>
<p>I suppose the issue could be closed now and/or lumped into #17403 for future consideration.</p>

<p>When I attempted to update through winget(specifically &quot;winget upgrade --all --include-unknown&quot;) from 0.9.24-&gt;0.9.26 I receive an error:
&quot;An unexpected error occurred while executing the command:
0x8a150040 : Error reading from the stream
Installer failed with exit code: 0x8a150040 : Error reading from the stream&quot;</p>
<p>Also Windows Defender detects the same threat as op, I'm sure it's a false positive but I've provided a screenshot.</p>
