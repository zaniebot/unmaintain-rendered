            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I am a heavy user of IPython and typically have a REPL running all the time. My <code>profile_default/startup/start.py</code> looks like this, so that I don&#x27;t have to import anything manually on a new session:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</code></pre>
<p>Up until now I have manually taken care of dependencies and installed them globally with <code>pip</code>, but I would like to convert this to <code>uv</code>. My first attempt was to simply use a <code>--with</code> statement. This works but quickly gets cumbersome as more dependencies are added:</p>
<pre><code>$ uvx --with numpy,matplotlib ipython
</code></pre>
<p>I could use <code>--with-requirements</code> and have a <code>requirements.txt</code> for my IPython:</p>
<pre><code>$ uvx --with-requirements ~/Developer/system/ipython/requirements.txt ipython
</code></pre>
<p>My ideal solution would, however, be to declare all dependencies inside <code>start.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code># /// script
# requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12&quot;
# dependencies = [
#     &quot;numpy&quot;,
#     &quot;matplotlib&quot;,
# ]
# ///

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
</code></pre>
<p>It does not seem to work and assume that is because IPython is the one who calls <code>start.py</code> and not <code>uv</code>. Is there another way to do this that I have not mentioned?</p>
<p>I suppose the same could come up if you invoke a script in a regular Python REPL that declares it dependencies using the inline syntax. Ideally, there would be a way to tell <code>uv</code> that the script has dependencies, but since this cannot be determined before script runtime, it seems impossible.</p>
