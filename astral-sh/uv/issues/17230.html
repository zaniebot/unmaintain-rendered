            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>While <code>uv sync</code> generally respects <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code>, <code>uv sync --script</code> ignores it.</p>
<p>I recognize this is a weird request and I'm ok with the workaround I currently implement (i.e. fetch the venv path after the fact ala https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16171#issuecomment-3379501787).</p>
<p>My use case is <a href="https://github.com/metaist/cosmofy"><code>cosmofy</code></a> which uses uv to build a temporary venv and bundles everything up into a Cosmopolitan Python file. When bundling the project, I can force the venv to be built in a temp directory of my choosing, but I cannot do the same for individual <code>--script</code> files.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=path_of_my_own uv sync --script myscript.py
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I <em>think</em> the reason we don't do this by default is because <code>--script</code> generally implies a per-script ephemeral virtual environment, whereas <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> (typically <code>.venv</code>) generally corresponds to an entire project (= <code>pyproject.toml</code>'s) resolution set.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, is there a reason you can't use project-level dependencies for this, since you're already using a project environment? To do that you can remove the PEP 723 dependencies/script metadata and use <code>uv sync</code> without <code>--script</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># 'myscript' would be a dependency group for 'myscript.py'
# you could also omit this and use the default dependencies, depending on your use case
uv sync --group myscript  
</code></pre>
<p>And then, to run <code>myscript</code>, you'd do <code>uv run</code> without <code>--script</code> too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># could omit --group here if you omit it above
uv run --group myscript myscript.py
</code></pre>
<p>...and that would honor both the default project venv and any environment you configure via <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code>, I believe.</p>

<p>Yes, I understood that to be the case, which is why I don't consider this a bug, but more of a feature request (or pointing out a slight inconsistency).</p>

<p>To clarify: <a href="https://github.com/metaist/cosmofy">the tool I built</a> bundles up people's projects (with their dependencies) into a <a href="https://ahgamut.github.io/2021/07/13/ape-python/">cosmopolitan python executable</a>, so I don't want to mess up their current venv. To do that, I perform a <a href="https://github.com/metaist/cosmofy/blob/815ee899788b3e062a014960c35901b9181d1ea1/src/cosmofy/bundle.py#L227">very specific <code>uv sync</code></a> which I then bundle up.</p>
<p>I wanted to support a <code>--script</code> mode (like <code>uv</code> does), in which case I definitely don't want to use anything other than the inline PEP 723 dependencies. My current approach just reads the &quot;ephemeral&quot; (it's actually persistent per script) venv after-the-fact from the JSON output of <code>uv sync</code>, so everything works, but it feels like if there's a mechanism to force <code>uv</code> to use a certain directory for the venv, that there should be some comparable system for <code>--script</code> (if not literally <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code>), but my use case may be too weird for that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for following up on this. I tested my code with <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> + <code>--script</code> + <code>--active</code> and it works just fine. Not sure why I didn't think of this despite reading the docs carefully.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree that there's not really a reason for <code>UV_SCRIPT_ENVIRONMENT</code> right now. Currently, I can think of real reasons why you might want to control the <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> and <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> directories separately. But scripts are otherwise self-contained, so only the <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> override really makes any sense.</p>
