Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>Hi! I don't know if I'm doing anything wrong but when i try to install tiktoken==0.8.0, uv fails to grab the proper wheels.
I am running python 3.13t.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">uv python pin 3.13t
uv add tiktoken==0.8.0
</code></pre>
<p>I believe it should be grabbing the same wheel the comparable pip command does. <code>uv pip install</code> also fails similarly, while <code>pip install tiktoken</code> works well enough outside of uv.</p>
<p>uv version:
uv 0.4.25 (97eb6ab4a 2024-10-21)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It doesn't look like they've published free-threading compatible wheels: https://pypi.org/project/tiktoken/#files. They would need to include <code>cp313t</code>. I assume it's building from source?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, it's building from sources but not building completely.</p>

<p>I'll check titkoken to see if there's a way to solve this issue</p>
