# Consider putting the string "@generated" inside uv.lock

---

_@jackrosenthal_

### Summary

Putting the string `@generated` inside machine-generated files is a relatively standard way to mark files as such.  For example, `Cargo.lock` [has this string in a comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6180), as are generated protobuf bindings, etc.

Would you consider adding this to `uv.lock`?  Something like:
```
# This file is @generated by uv.  Run `uv lock` to update.
```
