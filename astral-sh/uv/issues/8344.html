<p>That seems to work. And it is necessary because of the pytorch bug? Because in theory pip should be able to find that version itself automatically, right?
Can uv deal with the incorrectly returned 403 anyway?</p>

<p>There are actually differences between uv and pip in terms of index resolution. I think the problem here. It's not a bug, but they're just not exactly the same.

It doesn't seem to work, it's not very stable.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Related to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8341 I think. Probably the CLI tools need a little bit more work and then UV could have some special documentation for torch. I know that torch always is a great source of confusion, because getting it right with cuda is not easy (and probably also not possible right now in the most generic way).
I have not yet tested how well this approach works in transitive setups though (where a dependency specifies torch, but we need to overwrite it with a specific cuda version) or in a more generic way (where different people need different cuda versions).</p>

<p>Note that both hints are confusing and don't help debugging the problem.

<p>Using <code>uv 0.2.25</code> encounters the same error, but only prints the first part of the error message, not the 2 additional sections.</p>
<p>Up until 3 weeks ago, the uv commands were successful. Since then, nothing in our code change. Thus the reason for the error occurring is probably a change in the way pytorch provides its wheel files, uncovering a differing behaviour between pip and uv.</p>

<p>This helped find out the error: When creating the <code>.venv</code> with uv, it did not take the python version installed by the GitHub action (3.10), but a newer version found on the system (3.11).
I fixed this by not installing python via GitHub action at all, but by specifying the version when calling <code>uv venv .venv</code>. See the update:</p>

<p>If this is in GitHub Actions, it'd also be really helpful to share the code / a run in a public repository so we can debug what's going on.</p>

<p>This is a GitHub action on a custom self-hosted GitHub runner that is inside a docker container.</p>
