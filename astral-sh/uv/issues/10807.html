            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv venv</code> takes the location as first argument, but it might makes sense to support <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> as override for the default branch for consistency.</p>

<pre><code>❯ uv init example
Initialized project `example` at `/Users/zb/workspace/uv/example`
❯ cd example
❯ UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=foo uv venv
Using CPython 3.13.0
Creating virtual environment at: foo
Activate with: source foo/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>We just only use this logic if you&#x27;re in the root of a project — not for arbitrary virtual environment creation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_project_environment">UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</a></p>
<p>Specifies the path to the directory to use for a project virtual environment.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#project-environment-path">project documentation</a> for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BUT it turns out that without a project there is no way to configure virtual environment default path</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll change that. Perhaps we&#x27;d add a option to the config file, but we&#x27;d need to see more demand and justification.</p>
<p>Going to close this, as the described issue is addressed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @zanieb, I&#x27;ve just got here after following a trail of Github threads, trying to figure out why one of my terminals is respecting <code>${UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT}</code> and one isn&#x27;t. Mystery solved: Different working directories.</p>
<p>However, this kind of inconsistency leads to a confusing user experience. I would say that is a form of justification, if not to change it then at least to document it, ideally <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_project_environment">here</a> and/or <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#project-environment-path">here</a>. Especially since the former says &quot;uv defines and <em>respects</em> the following environment variables:&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m happy to raise a PR to the docs if there&#x27;s interest. At a minimum it will make it clear that not every uv command respects <code>${UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT}</code> all the time. There&#x27;s this thread, there&#x27;s also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7380"><code>uv pip install</code></a> and presumably other examples (?).</p>
<p>I would also be happy to include a more general statement that uv, as a project, has a very strong preference regarding the venv location (<code>&lt;working directory&gt;/.venv</code>) and doesn&#x27;t recommend changing it. That&#x27;s the impression I&#x27;ve got from my trail, if correct I think this is also worth documenting as it will save someone like me a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Finally, sorry if there are docs for all of this and I&#x27;ve just missed them, which is entirely possible!</p>
