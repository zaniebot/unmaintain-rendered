<p>I found one issue that mentioned using <code>&quot;^3.12&quot;</code> but that does not work:</p>

<p>I also found an issue mentioning <code>==3.12.*</code> but that does not work. It still just uses <code>3.12.0</code>.</p>
<p>I finally found this construction: <code>~=3.12</code> and that does seem to pick the latest version.</p>
<p>This is a fairly complicated thing that doesn't seem to have any documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you share the commands you can and the their verbose (<code>-v</code>) output? It is not expected that 3.12.0 would be installed, we're generally installing the latest version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe I need more coffee? I have no idea why but I just retried the <code>&quot;&gt;=3.12,&lt;3.13&quot;</code> construction and that seems to have used 3.12.8 (the latest version I have installed on my machine).</p>
<p>I then tried <code>==3.12.*</code> and that too now seems to use 3.12.8. I can't seem to make it use <code>3.12.0</code> like it was before any longer.</p>

<p>Apologies, I meant for you to look at the section header &quot;What information to include&quot;. In order to help or fix the issue, typically they have to re-create the issue on their machines so they need more information.</p>
