            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We started using the <code>default-groups</code> setting in <code>[tool.uv]</code> recently, and it's great to help simplify our Dockerfile. But because we also use semgrep, we need a <code>requirements.txt</code> file, and thus have to do <code>uv pip compile</code> whenever we make changes to our pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>I recently realized that taking out the <code>--group=test --group=docs</code> part of our <code>make compile</code> command actually made it stop including the test and docs groups' dependencies in <code>requirements.txt</code>. That was susprising, given that I assumed <code>uv pip compile</code> should work the same way as <code>uv sync</code> in regards to <code>default-groups</code>.</p>
<p>Is this a bug report, rather than a feature request? I'm not sure.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this is a bug.</p>
<p>I'm pretty hesitant to read <code>default-groups</code> from the <code>uv pip compile</code> interface, e.g., <code>uv pip install -r pyproject.toml</code> won't respect those either and probably shouldn't because <code>pip</code> will not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That looks like it might work, but what are all these dozens of &quot;hash&quot; lines that I'm seeing?</p>

<p>Most packages seem to have 2, but some have like a dozen of them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Those would be the hashes of the distributions (i.e., wheels). You can use <code>--no-hashes</code> if you want, but they're better for security.</p>
