            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>It seems impossible to install some packages with uv. E.g., <code>pandasgui</code> does not seem possible to install with uv but works fine using <code>pip</code>. I get this error on Windows (10) -see below. Have I misunderstood something? And if now, how do you handle packages in a project that uv cannot handle?</p>
<pre><code>uv add pandasgui

error: Distribution `pyqt5-qt5==5.15.17 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on Windows (`win_amd64`), but `pyqt5-qt5` (v5.15.17) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux2014_x86_64`, `macosx_10_13_x86_64`, `macosx_11_0_arm64`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was able to solve it by adding the following lines to my pyproject file:</p>
<p>[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
&quot;sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'x86_64'&quot;,

<p>Maybe you should try adding:</p>
<p>[tool.uv]
required-environments = [
&quot;sys_platform == 'win32' and platform_machine == 'amd64'&quot;,

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The reason this fails is fairly nuanced but there's an extensive write-up here (and the hint points you to this setting): https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/resolution/#required-environments. I suggest adding:</p>
