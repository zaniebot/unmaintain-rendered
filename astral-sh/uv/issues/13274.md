# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_distutils_hack'

_Issue opened by @kdheepak on 2025-05-03 14:29_

### Question

I get this error whenever I run a python script in a conda environment:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3de5ecb7-59e8-4cda-8af7-dfac9f8da1ad)

This happens after using `uv` to install into a conda environment using the following:

```
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$CONDA_PREFIX
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

Interestingly the python code continues to run after this error.

This is possibly related to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11671

But I wanted to open a separate issue because this only occurs for me in a conda environment.

### Platform

Darwin 24.4.0 arm64 (but also occurs on Windows)

### Version

uv 0.7.2 (481d05d8d 2025-04-30)

That's odd, can you share commands to reproduce this, including the creation of the conda env?
