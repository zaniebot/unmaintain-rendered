            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When attempting to update uv using itself (i.e., by running a command like  uv self update), the update process causes uv to uninstall itself. After this, attempting to run uv results in a &quot;command not found&quot; error.</p>
<p>Further attempts to reinstall uv using a method like  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot; will only download the package but will not actually install it, leading to a broken state that requires manual intervention to fix.</p>

<ul>
<li>How did you originally install the package?</li>
<li>Did you use any special environment variables or manually relocate the binary?</li>
<li>If you download the .ps1 script and run it with <code>-Verbose</code> does it display any additional information?</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Initially, I installed it directly via PowerShell with:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c &quot;irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex&quot;
Later, I found that uv self update failed. Then I installed it via pip:
pip install uv
This worked, but the binaries uv.exe and uvx.exe were not installed under C:\Users\tremble.local\bin. The earlier version was placed there, but after using pip install uv, the binaries ended up in C:\Users\tremble\miniconda3\Scripts or C:\Users\tremble\miniconda3\Lib\site-packages. I found this odd, so I manually moved uv.exe and uvx.exe to C:\Users\tremble.local\bin, and they worked normally. However, uv self update still fails—executing it causes the binaries to be deleted.</p>
<p>There was no additional manual path configuration. I just checked my environment variables, and there are no extra settings.</p>
<p>Now, when installing with -Verbose, I cannot find the detailed log files in the specified path.</p>
