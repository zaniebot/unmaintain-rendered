            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was hoping you could help solve my problem please.</p>
<p>At work I am often developing in a situation where I have a persistent storage directory (let's say at <code>/persist/code</code>) as well as ephemeral user directories (say at <code>/home/me</code>). I want to develop in <code>/persist/code</code> (including uv projects!), but I cannot hardlink in that folder, which drastically slows down uv pip installs etc.</p>
<p>For other workflows (e.g. using hatch) I can work around this by defaulting to ephemeral virtual environments in a path in <code>/home/me</code>, which my projects reference. But uv appears to strongly push for virtualenv living alongside code (in <code>.venv</code>). I can understand why that choice is usually very nice, especially when you don't have to activate environments, but is there a way to tell uv &quot;I would like you to create all my virtual environments in this folder somewhere else, by default&quot; please? (It looks like I could set UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT, but unless I wanted environments to overwrite each other, I would need to vary that setting per project/workspace.)</p>
<p>I am wondering what the best way to achieve this might be - what might you suggest?</p>
<p>Thanks,
Tom</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd recommend setting <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code> with <code>direnv</code> or something for now. We haven't designed a solution to this yet.</p>
