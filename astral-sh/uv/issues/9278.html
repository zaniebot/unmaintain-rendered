Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>I have a workspace setup with two subdirectories. The <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in the workspace root contains a dependency, which is then available for all projects in the workspace. In fact, if I run <code>uv run --package package1 pacakge1/hello.py</code>, it runs correctly when importing said dependency.
The problem is that, if I run <code>uv export --package package1</code>, I get an empty result, because the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in package1 is actually empty, but in reality package1 can use the dependencies declared in <code>pyproject.toml</code> in the workspace root.
Shouldn't <code>uv export</code> include all dependencies from the project root plus the dependencies for the project inside the workspace, if the <code>--package</code> flag is used?</p>
<p>uv version: 0.5.3 (using on macOS)
command invoked: <code>uv export --no-hashes --package package1</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is working as intended. <code>uv export --package package1</code> exports the dependency tree starting at <code>package1</code>. <code>package1</code> shouldn't be importing dependencies that are defined in the workspace root, but not declared as dependencies of <code>package1</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand. To solve this, I've explicitly added to package1 a dependency on the workspace root: <code>uv add . --package package1</code>. Does this approach have any drawbacks?</p>
