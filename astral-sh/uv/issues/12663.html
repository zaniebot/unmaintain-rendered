<p>Hello. Sorry if this request has already done but i did not find my request in my search on the issue tracker.</p>
<p>What I want is:</p>
<ul>
<li>when I am in a folder A, I want ‘uv run’ to take tool T in version v1 (+ locked dependencies)</li>
<li>when I am in folder (or project) B, T is in v2
i need a lockfile but not for the virtualenv, for the tools used in this env. this is a production use case (not a development use case). With poetry I would use a package-mode=false but this is not the most elegant nor efficient solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potentially I need two tools T1 and T2 that have incompatible dependencies so that I cannot install in the same venv.</p>
<p>This is more or less what you can have with nix, but I find it over complicated just to select a special version of a tool.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
