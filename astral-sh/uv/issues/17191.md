# `uv self update` fails when /tmp is mounted noexec

---

_Issue opened by @dotysan on 2025-12-19 20:49_

Not really sure if this is a uv bug or if uv can do anything about this. But here goes...
 $ `uv self update`
```
info: Checking for updates...
error: failed to execute installer
  Caused by: Permission denied (os error 13)
```

Workaround is fairly straightforward...
 $ `export TMPDIR="$HOME/.tmp" && mkdir -p "$TMPDIR" && uv self update`
```
info: Checking for updates...
success: Upgraded uv from v0.7.19 to v0.9.18! https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.9.18
```

Thanks for the report!

@zanieb I think this is primarily an external issue with axoupdater, not uv itself?

Often problems here require changes in axoupdater, yeah. We're maintainers there though.

Oh jee, I didn't know that!

Thx! Should I open ticket here? https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater

Possibly (hopefully) fixed by https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/pull/327 but I'm just learning Rust...so it could start WW3 instead. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
