            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It'd be nice to reduce the footprint of our decompression stack to only the decompression schemes Python packaging (widely) uses. One that we could potentially eliminate is xz/lzma, since only a tiny minority of Python wheel distributions (should) be using it.</p>
<p>This would technically be a breaking change. However, it should be a marginal one, since PyPI itself doesn't allow any ZIP compression schemes other than DEFLATE and STORE (and eventually zstd):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could also <em>probably</em> drop <code>.tar.xz</code> support, since the sdist spec only allows sdists named <code>.tar.gz</code>. That one might cause some real-world breakage due to incidentally supported formats, e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2187</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would drop xz/lzma support for both zips and tar archives so we can remove the dependency. PEP 625 requires <code>.tar.gz</code> for source distributions, and with warehouse enforcing DEFLATE or stored for wheels, other cases should be rare. We should start with a deprecation message to give users a chance to report user cases and/or migrate.</p>
