<p>You can get the sha256 by using e.g. <code>docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.3.3</code>. What would exactly be the ask here? Keeping the docs up to date with specific docker hashes?</p>

<p>I believe this can be made easier to discover by enabling <code>packages</code> view in the repo settings, and/or putting a link in the docs like you said.</p>

<p>I'm just asking the docs to talk about pinning by hashes, which is the recommended practice over pinning with tags (which is already covered in docs)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fine with mentioning this in a tip or something. Pinning to a version is already more than most people do — if you're in a serious production environment you should already have internal best practices around using SHA pins. As noted, we shouldn't try to keep this synced to the latest SHA — we should use something that's clearly a dummy example.</p>
