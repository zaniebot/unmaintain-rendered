# Progress bar style might induce bad memories and mental health issues

_@minusf_

First off let me say this is a very cool project! Finally true offline cache (bye bye devpi)

This is only a half-joke feature request:

Would it be possible to not associate the progress bar this much with `npm`'s?

Having this huge smile watching `uv` in action, the speed, the convenience, the sane default of picking up a `venv` in the working directory, then turning into a frown seeing the progress bar bringing back so many bad memories and scars...

Please reconsider 😭
