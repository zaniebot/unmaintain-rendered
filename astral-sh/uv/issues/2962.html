            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since #2532 uv &quot;preserves&quot; hashes for pinned packages. This is correct, but if no hash is present for a pinned package, a hash should still be generated.</p>
<p>When &quot;turning on --generate-hashes&quot; for a project, I don't want to run with --update, but I do want to generate hashes for pinned versions. Because pip will expect all hashes to be present:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR: Hashes are required in --require-hashes mode, but they are missing from some requirements. Here is a list of those requirements along with the hashes their downloaded archives actually had. Add lines like these to your requirements files to prevent tampering. (If you did not enable --require-hashes manually, note that it turns on automatically when any package has a hash.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Workaround: rollback to uv 0.1.22 when preservation of hashes wasn't implemented yet.</p>
