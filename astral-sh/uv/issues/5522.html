Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>So this should be an easy one. I remember that I have installed <code>uv</code> using <code>pipx</code> in my arch linux which will install <code>uv</code> in <code>~/.local/bin</code> and then used the bash script to install the latest version but because of the placement of <code>~/.local/bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> env variable I still got the old one when I executed <code>uv --version</code> and I had to remove it manually. One of the things you might do is to search for <code>uv</code> using the <code>which</code> command and the equivalent for other platforms as well and remove the binary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a little dubious for an installer to remove binaries that it didn't install. But maybe there's a world where we warn if we find a <code>uv</code> earlier in PATH after installing via the <code>curl</code> installers?</p>
