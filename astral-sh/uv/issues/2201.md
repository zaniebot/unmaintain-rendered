# Add `uv pip list --format json`

---

_Issue opened by @Daverball on 2024-03-05 12:20_

This is very helpful for interpreting the output of `pip list` in e.g. shell scripts using `jq` and then further process it to generate follow-up commands.

This in combination with https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2150 is the last remaining blocker for me to be able to replace `pip` with `uv` in one of my projects (this also happens to be where I'm experiencing the most slowdowns).
