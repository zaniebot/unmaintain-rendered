# Documentation: Add upgrade instructions to README

_Issue opened by @hanpham32 on 2024-10-02 07:02_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

Hi there,
I noticed that the current README doesn't include instructions for upgrading `uv`. I think it would be helpful to have a small section below the "[Installation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)" section that explains how to upgrade the tool. I had some trouble finding the correct upgrade command and had to search through the documentation pages. 

Would it be possible to include this in the README? I'd be happy to contribute by submitting a small PR if needed :^)

Thanks!

Like `uv self update`? Or something else?
