Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>A  dependency defined using a subdirectory fails to generate the lockfile in <code>0.1.26</code>.</p>
<p>An example dependency is: <code>&quot;mersal @ git+ssh://git@github.com/mersal-org/mersal.git@trunk#subdirectory=core&quot;</code></p>
<p>The error message is:</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to download and build: mersal @ git+ssh://git@github.com/mersal-org/mersal.git@trunk#subdirectory=core
  Caused by: Package metadata name `mersal-virtual-workspace` does not match given name `mersal`
error: could not write production lockfile for project
</code></pre>
<p>The error was originally obtained using <code>rye sync</code> but then I switched to using <code>uv</code> directly via <code>uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>What is happening: The process is finding a <code>pyproject.toml</code> at the root directory which has a package metadata name <code>mersal-virtual-workspace</code>. This didn't happen in version <code>0.1.24</code> or before (I tested from <code>01.20</code>).</p>
<p>With <code>0.1.25</code>, I get a different error which I believe is now resolved in <code>0.1.26</code> (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2712):</p>
<pre><code> Caused by: Failed to deserialize cache entry
  Caused by: expected version to start with a number, but no leading ASCII digits were found
</code></pre>
<p>However, looking at the changelog, the original error was probably caused by a change in <code>0.1.25</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I had to guess, it's probably not the subdirectory handling itself being broken but the existence of a <code>pyproject.toml</code> in the root directory is throwing the resolver.</p>

<p>Note for us, we should add test coverage for this in a new <a href="https://github.com/orgs/astral-test/repositories"><code>astral-test</code></a> repository (e.g. <code>uv-pypackage-workspace</code>).</p>
