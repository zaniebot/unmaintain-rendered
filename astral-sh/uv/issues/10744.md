# uv fails to install apache airflow

_Issue opened by @gmolau on 2025-01-18 22:09_

Fresh uv install, fresh venv, trying to add the first dependency, fails:

```
❯ which uv
/opt/homebrew/bin/uv

❯ uv version
uv 0.5.21 (Homebrew 2025-01-17)

❯ uv python find
<project-dir>/.venv/bin/python3

❯ uv add apache-airflow

      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
  help: `google-re2` (v1.1.20240702) was included because `<project>` (v0.1.0) depends on `apache-airflow` (v2.10.4) which depends on `google-re2`

This isn't a uv error -- this is an error on your machine, in trying to build `google-re2` from scratch. That project likely doesn't ship wheels for Python 3.13. I'd suggest using Python 3.12.

Thanks, with 3.12 it works. I guess the relevant upstream issue is https://github.com/google/re2/issues/516
