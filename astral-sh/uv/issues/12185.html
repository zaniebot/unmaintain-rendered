            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here is an interesting turn of things... in the past days I had to work with Win11 box... as unusable as Windows-box is, it made me install virtual Ubuntu shell via WSL...</p>
<p>Long story short, when installing uv under virtual shell, that by default runs bash changed to zsh, some strange reference base python thing happens that instead of seeing *nix python versions, it sees the underlying Win11 pythons that clearly make it unusable or with some gimmicks will allow Win11 layer pythons usage which is super inefficient.</p>
<p>The core issue was, whenever I tried to instantiate uv venv, uv would not find  the right python references, uv simply could not see and recognize the *nix layer pythons!</p>
<p>What did came with a rescue was pyenv, that carries correct local zsh references. So running pyenv and then uv for pip sync etc works just fine.</p>
<p>This also shows the inner-works of core uv for python env instantiation.. such as it runs on diff python references than follow up commands, which makes sense. However, relying only on uv under WSL-ubuntu for venv was not finalizing with success, by ingesting windows python references ¯_(ツ)_/¯ or rather unable to even correctly ingest those producing an error, which also makes sense.</p>
<p>This just shows uv runs better natively. And yes I did reinstall uv under WSL, it would still find win11 references.</p>
<p>Also, atm, I just want to give context why combination of pyenv with uv might be better in such scenario, where pyenv-venv yields some more env stability. Also this is not the first time pyenv-venv comes to the rescue, I am mostly mac and *nix user, and whatever hurdles I was dealing with in those systems in local development, the virtual env layer with pyenv-venv came each time to the rescue - if you prefer blame it on early uv releases or just my user error, whichever suits better; atm I am unable to reference the issues from the past I had, but there were some.</p>
<p>Thank you for working on such wonderful tool as uv! It really makes our lives easier. o7</p>
