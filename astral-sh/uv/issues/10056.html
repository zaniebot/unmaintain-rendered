            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At the time of writing this, the latest version of <code>PySide6</code> is <code>6.8.1.1</code>. I assume this is a patch release only for macos, as there is only one wheel for macos in it.</p>
<p>When I try to install <code>PySide6</code> on Windows, I get an error that no source or wheel is available:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv add pyside6
Resolved 5 packages in 6ms
error: Distribution `pyside6==6.8.1.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed 
because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
</code></pre>
<p>However, the older release <code>6.8.1</code> contains wheels for many other platforms. If I blacklist the <code>6.8.1.1</code> version, then installing on Windows works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv add &quot;pyside6&gt;=6.8.1,!=6.8.1.1&quot;
Resolved 5 packages in 257ms
Installed 4 packages in 1.05s
 + pyside6==6.8.1
 + pyside6-addons==6.8.1
 + pyside6-essentials==6.8.1
 + shiboken6==6.8.1
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible to automatically detect such a case and install from the older version without having to explicitly blacklist the latest version that only contains wheels for other platform(s)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9711 (though this is really a package issue -- they should be uploading a consistent set of wheels, the system isn't designed to be used this way).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that this is really a packaging issue, and the list of packages that misuse the system is kind of shocking! Is there any workaround for this particular case that we could use in the meantime?</p>
