<p>This is beneficial because (1) we can safely reuse state across the resolver and installer, and then (2) we're more likely to (e.g.) download wheels that we'll end up installing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, I was wondering if there was any resolution for this issue. I’ve been having a weird behavior for installing mediapipe as a dependency. Seems like people also tried tool.uv.sources and pointing directly to universal version and it still wants to reinstall after every run command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hiromon0125 This is a separate probolem, because mediapipe produces invalid wheels where the wheel tag and the entry in <code>WHEEL</code> are different: https://inspector.pypi.io/project/mediapipe/0.10.21/packages/66/85/5be11ee221b04cd1496131222199ad6469bd49e377157b84b0895325afb2/mediapipe-0.10.21-cp310-cp310-macosx_11_0_universal2.whl/mediapipe-0.10.21.dist-info/WHEEL#line.4 . This needs to be fixed upstream by the mediapipe developers (https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/issues/6112), this is not a bug in uv.</p>
<p>Re this bug, I don't think we'll change the behavior (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7381), the determinism is more important and the overhead is small with METADATA-in-index and range requests.</p>
