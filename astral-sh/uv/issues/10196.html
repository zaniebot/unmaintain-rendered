            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello everyone. The inability to use <code>self-update</code> in version 0.5.12 is a known bug. Actually, it was mentioned and fixed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10191.
The issues you(@lamteteeow @jdmartin  @anotherbugmaster ) mentioned should have been fixed in version 0.5.13.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 This was a known issue in v0.5.12 due to a <code>reqwests</code> update. Sorry about that. I suggest re-installing with cURL (e.g., <code>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh</code>). Subsequent self-updates should work without issue.</p>
