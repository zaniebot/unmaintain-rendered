            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Thanks for making uv! I use it all the time for my personal projects, and I'd love to use it for work too.</p>
<p>Right now, when I try to install uv using the command, I get an error that says: <code>irm: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send</code>. I found out this happens because of my company's security rules.</p>
<p>I can get the newest version by downloading it from GitHub, but then I can't use the <code>uv self update</code> feature to easily update it later.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to add a way for the uv program to update itself even when I download it from GitHub? Or maybe you could offer an installer file (like an .msi file)?</p>
<p>I also use <a href="https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/">Pixi</a> from time to time and it provides both the options.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're generally interested in replacing cargo-dist with our own implementation which would support self update as you've described, but it's a not on the short-term roadmap.</p>
