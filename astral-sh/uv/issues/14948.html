            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have 2 projects. They are both on my system, both in (their own) .venv with Python 3.13.5. uv is 0.7.20 for both. Both have the same dependecies in their pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code>dependencies = [
    &quot;brng-config&gt;=1.0.1&quot;,
    &quot;wb-core-brng&gt;=3.3.15&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>... actually, pyproject.toml is a copy, the projects are copies, they are the same minimal backend importing a core package and running two different frontends.</p>
<p>Their uv.lock files are identical.</p>
<p>But when I do <code>uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt --universal</code>, I get different versions on a whole list of packages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-limits:">h11: 0.16.0 vs 0.14.0
propcache: 0.3.2 vs 0.3.0
cryptography: 45.0.5 vs 44.0.2
certifi: 2025.7.14 vs 2025.1.31
packaging: 25.0 vs 24.2
lxml: 6.0.0 vs 5.3.1
charset-normalizer: 3.4.2 vs 3.4.1
redis: 6.2.0 vs 5.2.1
pypika-tortoise: 0.6.1 vs 0.5.0
yarl: 1.20.1 vs 1.18.3
requests: 2.32.4 vs 2.32.3
uvicorn: 0.35.0 vs 0.34.0
pytz: 2025.2 vs 2025.1
click: 8.2.1 vs 8.1.8
typing-extensions: 4.14.1 vs 4.12.2
anyio: 4.9.0 vs 4.8.0
urllib3: 2.5.0 vs 2.3.0
tortoise-orm: 0.25.1 vs 0.24.2
pillow: 11.3.0 vs 11.1.0
tomlkit: 0.13.3 vs 0.13.2
multidict: 6.6.3 vs 6.1.0
fastapi: 0.116.1 vs 0.115.11
starlette: 0.47.2 vs 0.46.1
setuptools: 80.9.0 vs 76.0.0
aerich: 0.9.1 vs 0.8.2
httpcore: 1.0.9 vs 1.0.7
</code></pre>
<p>Note that these are all dependencies of my wb-core-brng 3.3.15 package, which I also created myself on this system, on the same day.</p>
<p>EDIT: I should add that I re-created their .venvs from scratch and deleted all python caches and egg folders as well.</p>
<p>Can someone explain to me how this works?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>MacOS 15.5</p>
