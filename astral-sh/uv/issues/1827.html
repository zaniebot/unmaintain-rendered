            <div class="timeline-body"><pre><code class="language-sh">$ uv pip install '.'
error: Failed to parse `.`
  Caused by: Expected package name starting with an alphanumeric character, found '.'
.

# whereas pip allows this
$ pip install '.'  # works as expected
</code></pre>
<p>I saw #1000 - if I do <code>uv pip install 'package-name @ .'</code> then it works, but pip doesn't like that syntax. Ideally there'd be something that works uniformly across both.</p>
<pre><code>$ uv --version
0.1.6
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is supported as of <code>v0.1.24</code>. You can <code>uv pip install .</code> directly, without including a package name.</p>
