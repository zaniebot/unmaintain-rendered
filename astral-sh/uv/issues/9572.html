<p>We are using big numbers to put readable date + a numeric representation of the commit hash in the dev version identifier. We can reduce the size of hash or sacrifice something to forcefully make it smaller than the limit, but I think things would be easier for people if we can get rid of this limit as the combination of this limit and the limits in PyPI avoiding free use of package versioning makes it hard to publish development builds in CD jobs.</p>
