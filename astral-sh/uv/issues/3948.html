            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. I am thinking of switching to uv from poetry. I never used virtualenv. What is the benefit of providing <code>uv venv</code> compared to <code>python -m venv .venv</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main benefit is that it's much faster than <code>python -m venv .venv</code>, and you can just use uv for creating the environment as well as installing into it without having to learn multiple tools:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">uv venv
uv pip install flask
...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But if you use <code>python -m venv .venv</code>, <code>uv</code> will still cooperate with it just fine -- it can install into <code>python -m venv</code> environments without an issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another benefit is that <code>uv venv</code> seems to produce a virtual environment that is compatible with <code>virtualenv</code>.</p>
<p>I use a piece of software that only works with virtual environments created by <code>virtualenv</code>, and the one produced by <code>uv venv</code> seems to work with it as well. This tool is not compatible with virtual environments produced with <code>python -m venv</code>. I think in general, many more tools support <code>virtualenv</code> over <code>venv</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the answers!</p>
<p>The reason I am asking is because we are debating switching to uv from poetry in our production but my reservation is in the scope of uv. Currently, we have <code>venv|conda</code> + <code>pyenv</code> + <code>poetry</code> with preference for <code>venv</code>.</p>
<p>I want to have this situation: <code>venv</code> + <code>pyenv</code> + <code>uv</code>. Would such a scenario continue to be supported?</p>
<p>This is what I want to avoid.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, you can certainly use <code>uv</code> with virtual environments created by <code>python -m venv</code> or <code>virtualenv</code>. In each case, the environment itself follows the same standardized structure, so there's no issue with it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! Looking forward to testing and hopefully replacing poetry. :)</p>
