            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This might be out of scope for this package manager, but I noticed that uv won&#x27;t use the global packages with pip when installing something. For example, I installed my own package (from PyPI) in a virtual environment, both with pip and uv to see the difference. Pip noticed that the package, along with all its dependencies, were already present in the global packages (pip installed outside venv), and thus used those to only need to install them, but not download anymore. Uv did not use them, it downloaded everything from the internet.</p>
<p>This could be a nice improvement, but I understand if this is not something you&#x27;d want.</p>
<p>(btw, nice work, this is already a nice tool that&#x27;s a bit faster then pip on uncached packages!)</p>

<p>Interesting idea. I&#x27;m not sure how challenging it would be to support reading other <code>site-packages</code>.</p>
