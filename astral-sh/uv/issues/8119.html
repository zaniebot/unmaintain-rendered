Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#discovery-of-python-environments</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When running a command that mutates an environment such as uv pip sync or uv pip install, uv will search for a virtual environment in the following order:
An activated virtual environment based on the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable.
An activated Conda environment based on the CONDA_PREFIX environment variable.
A virtual environment at .venv in the current directory, or in the nearest parent directory.</p>
<p>If no virtual environment is found, uv will prompt the user to create one in the current directory via uv venv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the docs, this is the current flow of environment discovery. Instead of prompting user to create a venv, it would automatically create venv in order to skip some steps and save developer time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do automatically create it for the &quot;project&quot; APIs (<code>uv run</code>, <code>uv sync</code>, etc.), but not for the &quot;pip&quot; APIs (<code>uv pip install</code>, etc.). I think that's the right call -- it would be too surprising to users to automatically create it in the &quot;pip&quot; API commands which are intended to be closer to existing <code>pip</code> workflows.</p>
