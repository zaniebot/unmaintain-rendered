            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I installed and uninstalled <code>uv</code> via <code>brew</code> on my Mac. I am now seeing a Rust-related error message when running a project via a separate toolchain (<code>conda</code> with <code>hatch</code>). I am not sure if <code>uv</code> is the cause of the issue, but I'd like to ensure I successfully uninstalled <code>uv</code> from my system for the sake of debugging. Are there any locations I should check to ensure the uninstallation was successful?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>hatch</code> uses Rust these days so I would look there.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what steps <code>brew</code> takes to install <code>uv</code> — we generally just download a single binary into <code>~/.cargo/uv</code> and nothing else.</p>
