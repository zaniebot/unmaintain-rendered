            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have two packages in my project. However, they need to be deployed separately during actual deployment.
I am using them as shown below for debugging during development.
Is there a way to integrate them together at once?</p>
<p>when run build (for debugging)</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.sources]
asdf = { workspace = true }
</code></pre>
<p>when build</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.sources]
asdf = {path = &quot;/tmp/asdf-0.1-py3-none-any.whl&quot; }
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is roughly the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7945. Unfortunately there isn't a great way to do it today. I'm going to expand that issue.</p>
