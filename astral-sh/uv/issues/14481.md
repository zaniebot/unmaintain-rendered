# The `==3.10` warning does not show the source and might be misleading in case of invalid spec

_Issue opened by @potiuk on 2025-07-07 08:48_

### Summary

This is related to #14422 - but this is a different issue.

In order to make lives of our contributors easier with the warning reported by `uv  0.7.19` that produces huge number of warnings, I attempted to temporarily apply the "recommendations" and get rid of all the `~=` and `==X.Y`. https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/52967 - hoping that it will be eventually reverted.

However when I attempted to do so, I got a misterious warning that came literally out of the blue - because I did not have `==3.10` defined anywhere in the project, and that warning was not telling which project in the workspace caused it:

After a bit of guessing - it turned out that I made a mistake when I applied the >=, < pattern and by mistake in `dev/breeze/pyproject.toml` I put `<=3.10,<4`.

For whatever reason that (invalid of course) python-requires, produced misleading and non-actionable warning:

# How to reproduce

1. Check-out my PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/52967
2. Modify `dev/breeze/pyproject.toml` so that requires-python looks like that:
```
requires-python = "<=3.10,<4"
```
3. Run `uv sync`

You will see the misleading warning generated.

Sure

Yeah. It will be gret to get the warning more informative and actionable in the right way - following the wider community understanding of the problem.

I've personally learned a lot from the whole discussion. and happy to provide a feedback on  propoosed improvements :)
