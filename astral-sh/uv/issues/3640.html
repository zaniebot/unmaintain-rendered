            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The documentation says to download <code>astral.sh/uv/install.sh</code>.
Where is <code>install.sh</code> in the repo?
I would feel safer linking to fixed versions of this script in a specific commit, rather than a dynamic version on your personal webpage.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The link in the readme is a redirect to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest/download/uv-installer.sh. You can find a fixed <code>uv-installer.sh</code> asset on each release in the releases page.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Coincidentally I was wondering exactly the same at roughly the same time :wink:</p>
<p>I still don't really understand where it is coming from though, i.e., how does the release pull it out of thin air / where is it actually coming from originally?</p>
<p>EDIT: I have a guess: It looks like it is actually coming from <code>cargo-dist</code> resulting from <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/blob/e95f7b3d18b89633c5e6942782b7e278595442e0/cargo-dist/templates/installer/installer.sh.j2">this template</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that's right -- we use <code>cargo-dist</code> to create our installers. They're generated as part of the release pipeline.</p>
