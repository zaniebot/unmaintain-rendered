# `uv add --script` does not display anything

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-19 17:11_

e.g.

```
❯ touch example.py
❯ uv add --script example.py 'requests<3' 'rich'
warning: `uv add` is experimental and may change without warning
```

I'd like to see that this succeeded in some way!
