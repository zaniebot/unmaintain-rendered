# Add option `uv export --exclude-editable`

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I use [`pip-audit`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) in my projects for scanning packages with known vulnerabilities. It can be given a `requirements.txt` file to audit. This could play nice with the new `uv export` feature, but fails because of the editable entry for the project package:

```console
$ uv export --format requirements-txt
# This file was autogenerated via `uv export`.
-e .
[...]

$ pip-audit --disable-pip --requirement <(uv export --format requirements-txt)
ERROR:pip_audit._cli:requirement --editable . does not contain a hash

$ pip-audit --skip-editable --disable-pip --requirement <(uv export --format requirements-txt)
ERROR:pip_audit._cli:requirement --editable . does not contain a hash
```

The `uv pip freeze` command has an `--exclude-editable` option to remove editable packages from output. A similar option for `uv export` would help here :)

```console
$ pip-audit --disable-pip --requirement <(uv export --format requirements-txt --exclude-editable)
```

For the moment, my workaround is to exclude editable packages with grep, but this is cumbersome:

```console
$ pip-audit --disable-pip --requirement <(uv export --format requirements-txt | grep -v '^-e ')
```
