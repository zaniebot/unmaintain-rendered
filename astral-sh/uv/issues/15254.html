            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0792/">PEP 792</a> is now final and has a <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/project-status-markers/#project-status-markers">living PyPA spec</a>.</p>
<p>TL;DR: PEP 792 defines &quot;project status markers,&quot; which are project-wide states that get presented in the standard JSON and HTML indices.</p>
<p>For example, here's a project that's been marked as <code>archived</code>, meaning that it won't receive new releases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">% curl -s -H &quot;Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json&quot; https://pypi.org/simple/pepy/ |  jq '.&quot;project-status&quot;'
{
  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;archived&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>These markers are optional in the index API v1.4 and above; in earlier (&lt;= 1.3) responses, the client should assume that all projects have the <code>active</code> status. Any 1.4+ response that doesn't have a status also defaults to <code>active</code>.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>PEP 792 suggests that installers produce appropriate warnings on the following statuses:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>archived</code>: the installer should warn that the project does not expect to be updated in the future</li>
<li><code>deprecated</code>: the installer should warn that the project is considered obsolete by its maintainers</li>
<li><code>quarantined</code>: the installer should warn that the project is considered unsafe for any use (e.g. malicious). the index will prevent resolution of quarantined projects anyways, but the warning will help users understand why the resolution subsequently fails 🙂</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of <em>where</em> this should happen: I <em>think</em> it probably makes the most sense for these to be propagated on any environment-changing command, e.g. <code>uv add</code>, <code>uv sync</code>, <code>uv pip install</code>.</p>
<p>Subtasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Data modeling + extract status markers from the detail responses (#17311)</li>
<li>[ ] Plumb status markers into the internal representation</li>
<li>[ ] Propagate relevant statuses as warnings (e.g. warn users when they request a quarantined / archived / deprecated project)</li>
</ul>
