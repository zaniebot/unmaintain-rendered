# There should be a comment in `.profile` when modifying it to add uv to `$PATH`

---

_Issue opened by @Logan-Pageler on 2025-08-23 00:11_

### Summary

I think it'd be beneficial to have a comment in `.profile` where uv is added to `$PATH` explaining where that section of code came from.

I hit the same issue as #14849 and it took me a good while to figure out it was uv that inserted the line into my `.profile` that was creating the issue. I think having a comment would also help people when they are cleaning up `.profile`.

### Example

Maybe something like
```sh
# Add uv to PATH
```
Or even just
```sh
# From uv-installer.sh
```
