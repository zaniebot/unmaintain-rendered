# `uv python upgrade` output message is ambiguous

---

_Issue opened by @nehfan on 2025-11-19 23:39_

### Summary

`uv python upgrade`

Reports:

`There are no installed versions to upgrade`

The meaning of this message is somewhat ambiguous.  This message could mean:

1. No installed versions of Python were found when trying to upgrade Python.
2. The Python versions that were found are up to date and don't need to be upgraded.

The user should not be left confused about the outcome of the upgrade attempt.  Consider rephrasing this message so the meaning is clearer to a casual user.

### Platform

Win11

### Version

0.9.10

### Python version

3.11

If no one is working on this, I'd be happy to work on this.

I'm interested in working on this issue. Could you provide more context about what you're looking for? Any additional details about requirements or constraints would be helpful.

@tysoncung There's already a PR for this in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16815, so this isn't a good task anymore.
