            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The documentation (and maybe also refs in README.md and/or installer spew) should include a privacy statement and disclosure.</p>
<p>It would be good practice to be explicit about what <em>isn't</em> collected. Also would be handy to head off questions about things like linehaul that might be surprising to some people or prone to trigger audit questions or IDS alerts. (eg #8474)</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It'd be great to open an upstream issue in pip requesting this too. We're following them here, and afaik there is no such documentation on their end.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would have expected that pip would have had that already, but doesn't seem to. There were a few requests around features for limiting or modifying the linehaul data, but no docs.</p>
<p>I opened a similar https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/13559</p>
<p>That aside I do still believe it would be beneficial (even if just repeating what upstream says) to also have it within uv.</p>
