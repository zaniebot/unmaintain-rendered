            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi</p>
<p>In Termux, I had an issue installing: <code>pip install uv</code>, due to not being able to build a wheel. My python-pip is up to date with Termux repository, but Termux may be behind in packaging a new python-pip release.  All my Termux packages are up to date.</p>

            error: can't find Rust compiler

            If you are using an outdated pip version, it is possible a prebuilt wheel is available for this package but pip is not able to install from it. Installing from the wheel would avoid the need for a Rust compiler.

            To update pip, run:

                pip install --upgrade pip

            and then retry package installation.

            If you did intend to build this package from source, try installing a Rust compiler from your system package manager and ensure it is on the PATH during installation. Alternatively, rustup (available at https://rustup.rs) is the recommended way to download and update the Rust compiler toolchain.

<p>So, I navagated to the uv GitHub repository, and tried to install it with curl, and the shell installation script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">❯ mkdir uv
mkdir: created directory 'uv'
❯ zz uv
/data/data/com.termux/files/home/uv
❯ l
❯ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
sh: 604: ldd: not found
System glibc version (`') is too old; using musl
ERROR: there isn't a package for aarch64-linux-android
</code></pre>
<p>I note that, there was no warning as to required dependencies in README.md, such as: lld.</p>
<p>So, I then checked for glibc ( aka ldd):</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">❯ ldd --version
zsh: correct 'ldd' to 'ld' [nyae]? n
The program ldd is not installed. Install it by executing:
 pkg install ldd
❯ pkg install ldd
</code></pre>
<p>The lld package installed correctly. So, I re-tried curl:</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">❯ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

<p>I just want to successfully install uv in my host environment in Termux on Android. How should I proceed?</p>
<p>Any assistance is greatly apprecisted.</p>

<p>use <code>pkg install uv</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This installs uv as a binary not as a python module and works only in CLI, <strong>NOT</strong> in a python script.</p>
<p>Any other modules that has uv as requirement still breaks, because wheel can't be built for uv.</p>
<p>A good example will be <code>prefect</code> module.</p>
<p>I have included the output of the command <code>pip install --verbose uv</code> <a href="https://pastebin.com/W3suwrQQ">here</a>.</p>
