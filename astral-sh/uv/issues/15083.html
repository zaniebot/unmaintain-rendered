            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As an example when I make a new project</p>
<pre><code>uv init
error: No interpreter found at path `.venv/bin/python`
</code></pre>
<p>I get no interpreter found at path, which I get that i need to do <code>uv venv --python 3.13</code>
But I was expecting it to make this automatically
This is similar to uv sync and any other command
Also, when moving between projects, it might use the .venv located at my other project</p>
<p>On another topic, when making the virtualenv, I always have to do <code>source .venv/bin/python</code>
Doesn't it make sense for the uv venv to automatically activate it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please share verbose logs. I don't see why <code>uv init</code> would fail with that message.</p>

<p>We cannot do this without writing an integration for each shell. This is an intentional limitation in the design of shells. See #1910</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, uv does not provide a built-in command to activate a project's Python virtual environment. This functionality would enhance the user experience by allowing developers to quickly enter the virtual environment associated with their project.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Introduce a command such as <code>uv activate</code> that activates the project's Python virtual environment. This command would serve as a shorthand for sourcing the appropriate activation script, depending on the operating system:</p>
