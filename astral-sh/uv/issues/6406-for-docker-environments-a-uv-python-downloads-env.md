# For Docker environments, a UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS env variable would be useful

---

_Issue opened by @hynek on 2024-08-22 04:33_

I'm aware of the [python-downloads option](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#disabling-automatic-python-downloads), but in Docker builds, it's not always 100% clear what user runs what and when when, so it would be really nice if I could set `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=only-system` or `UV_NO_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=1` once in my base image and not think about it anymore.

If any of this exists, I haven't found it neither by searching the docs nor by searching the code. 😬
