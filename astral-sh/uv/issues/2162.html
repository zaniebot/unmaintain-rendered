Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<h1>Expected Behavior</h1>
<p><code>pip-compile</code> signifies which dependencies come directly from the current project itself, by putting <code>&lt;project-name&gt; (pyproject.toml)</code> in the <code>via</code> comment. This is very helpful in differentiating between transitive and direct dependencies.</p>
<h1>Bug</h1>
<p><code>uv</code> completely skips this output, making transitive and direct dependencies look the same.</p>
<h1>Platform</h1>
<ul>
<li>Linux AMD64</li>
<li><code>uv</code> version: <code>0.1.13</code></li>
</ul>
