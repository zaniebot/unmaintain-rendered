# coverage testing under uv markedly slower than in traditional venv

---

_Issue opened by @jepler on 2025-12-09 02:02_

### Summary

In a particular project & configuration, `uv run` takes over 4.5x as long to run specific tests as `venv`+`pip`. Subprocesses & the `sys.monitoring` interface are implicated.

Steps to reproduce:
1. `git clone https://codeberg.org/jepler/wwvbpy.git`
1. `cd wwvbpy`
1. `git checkout 97bb1601e8ea9e246df698547f8c845156ddb1e6`
1. `docker run --rm -it -v=.:/work -w /work python:3.14-trixie bash`
1. Run the following shell script in docker:
    ```python
    coverage=coverage==7.11.2
    core=sysmon

    rm -rf .venv
    echo "venv+pip: coveragepy $coverage core $core"
    python3.14 -m venv .venv
    .venv/bin/python -m pip install -q $coverage 
    .venv/bin/python -m pip install -q .
    env PYTHONPATH=src COVERAGE_CORE=$core .venv/bin/python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s test 2>&1 | grep 'Ran'
    rm -rf .venv

    echo "uv run: coveragepy $coverage core $core"
    env PYTHONPATH=src COVERAGE_CORE=$core uv run --python=3.14 --reinstall --refresh --no-cache --with $coverage python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s test 2>&1 | grep 'Ran'
    rm -rf .venv
    ```

Typical result on my laptop:
```
venv+pip: coveragepy coverage==7.11.2 core sysmon
Ran 43 tests in 2.758s
uv run: coveragepy coverage==7.11.2 core sysmon
Ran 43 tests in 8.724s
```

Using `unittest ... --durations 10` and removing the grep it can be seen that the tests in `testcli` have most greatly increased in runtime. Locally, test_gen takes 0.949s with `venv`+`pip` and 4.413s with `uv`, over 4x as long. On the other hand, the 10th slowest test was `test_onset`, and took 0.092s and 0.099s under each environment, essentially unchanged.

Notable things:
 * This performance difference mostly or entirely disappears if the `ctrace` core of coveragepy is used instead
 * Likewise if coverage testing is not used at all
 * The tests that become much slower all create subprocesses of sys.executable. coveragepy ensures coverage runs in the sub-program through a .pth file.
 * Some change in coverage between 7.11.0 and 7.11.2 made the performance penalty become much larger. This is being discussed at https://github.com/coveragepy/coveragepy/issues/2082#issuecomment-3627450249 but at this point I don't think the exact relevant change is known.

The problem is related to the temporary environment uv creates. If it uses the current venv, it's fast:

* fast (uv see the installed coverage and doesn't create a layered venv): `uv venv -c -p 3.14 && uv pip install $coverage && uv run --with $coverage -v python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s test`
* slow: `uv venv -c -p 3.14 && run --with $coverage -v python -m coverage run -m unittest discover -s test`

OK so I actually _looked_ at the coverage output.

In the "uv slow" case, coverage gathers data on files within `.venv/lib/python3.14/site-packages/` while in the "uv fast" case it does not.

This is likely because coverage is using a heuristic that excludes items under `platlib`, but when the uv environment is layered this does not include the site-packages that are in the base venv.

Typical sysconfig in a layered venv:
```python
>>> import sysconfig
>>> for x in sysconfig.get_path_names(): print(f"{x:<20} {sysconfig.get_path(x)}")
... 
stdlib               /usr/local/lib/python3.14
platstdlib           /root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmp1R7Z57/lib/python3.14
purelib              /root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmp1R7Z57/lib/python3.14/site-packages
platlib              /root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmp1R7Z57/lib/python3.14/site-packages
include              /usr/local/include/python3.14
scripts              /root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmp1R7Z57/bin
data                 /root/.cache/uv/builds-v0/.tmp1R7Z57
```

```

so coverage during the "run" phase has done a lot of extra work on 30 files in each subprocess, adding a lot of runtime.

This perhaps means it's not a uv bug, though it certainly still feels like a uv gotcha.
Is there a different/better heuristic that coveragepy should be using to exclude the files from uv layers? This is how coverage describes what it intends its default measurement set to be:
> When running your code, the coverage run command will by default measure all code, unless it is part of the Python standard library.
