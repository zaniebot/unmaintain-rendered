# Check all tools for possible upgrades

---

_@jamesdeluk_

### Question

As title, is there a way to check all tools for possible upgrade? I can't see anything in the docs. I could imagine something like `uv tool check` and an output similar to `uv tool list` but with `XXX available`.

### Platform

Win11

### Version

0.5.24
