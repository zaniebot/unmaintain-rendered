Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>I've been attempting to switch our CI system over to UV, and after doing so we began encountering a relatively high failure rate. Investigating, it appears that there is a problem when multiple UV processes under the same user attempt to install in different venvs at once.</p>
<p>This can be reproduced with the following shell script on ubuntu 22 with any version of UV I tested with, up to 0.1.41.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
make_venv(){
    uv venv $1
    source $1/bin/activate
    uv pip install jaeger-client
}

for i in {1..8}
do
   make_venv $1/$i &amp;
done
</code></pre>
<p>This inevitably produces failure messages like:</p>
<pre><code>--- stderr:
error removing build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel/threadloop-1.0.2-py3.8.egg-info: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: 'build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel/threadloop-1.0.2-py3.8.egg-info'
error: [Errno 17] File exists: 'build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel/threadloop-1.0.2.dist-info'
</code></pre>
<p>It also appears to leave the uv cache in a corrupted state, where calling <code>uv cache clean</code> produces errors like:</p>
<pre><code>Clearing cache at: ~/.cache/uv
error: Failed to clear cache at:~/.cache/uv
  Caused by: IO error for operation on ~/.cache/uv/built-wheels-v3/pypi/jaeger-client/4.8.0/0rRHp2ho5iISrFqrp0Brr/jaeger-client-4.8.0.tar.gz/build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel/jaeger_client: Permission denied (os error 13)
  Caused by: Permission denied (os error 13)
</code></pre>
<p>This can be resolved by calling <code>chmod +rx</code> on whatever the offending file is and re-clearing the cache. This could perhaps be classified as a separate issue with failed builds leaving the cache in a corrupted state?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The cache error is very confusing because we already have handling for that (we try to delete; if it fails and the file is read-only, we change permissions and try again).</p>
