            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello there! I would like to use the internal crates here in <a href="https://github.com/ofek/pyapp">PyApp</a>. As far as I understand, the only functionality that I require would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>creating virtual environments using a specific path to a Python binary</li>
<li>installing packages like <code>uv pip install ...</code> (users are allowed to pass extra flags so must be CLI)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm assuming the first one wouldn't be too challenging but the latter might require shipping the actual CLI/everything. How would I go about this, or even should I at this time?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you open to interacting with <code>uv</code> over the CLI, rather than using it as a Rust library?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Certainly but not for this specific use case if possible. I would much prefer to import the necessary crates.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think our Rust APIs are stable enough for this — we would rather focus on the user experience at this time.</p>
