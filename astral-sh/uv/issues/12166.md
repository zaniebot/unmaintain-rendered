# `uv compile` raises an error if there is no whitespace before `#`

_Issue opened by @t-imamichi on 2025-03-14 09:40_

### Question

`uv compile` raises an error if there is no whitespace before `#` as follows.
Is it an intentional behavior?

```
$ cat 1.in
pip# no white space

$ cat 2.in
pip # white space

$ uv pip compile 1.in
error: Couldn't parse requirement in `1.in` at position 0
  Caused by: Expected one of `@`, `(`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `~`, `!`, `;`, found `#`
pip# no white space
   ^

$ uv pip compile 2.in
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile 2.in
pip==25.0.1
    # via -r 2.in
```

### Platform

macOS 15.4.3 arm64

### Version

uv 0.6.6

Yeah this is intentional (and I believe it matches `pip`). `pip#` is ambiguous since it could be (e.g.) a URL reference with a fragment at the end.
