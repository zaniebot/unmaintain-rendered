            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Initial state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; uv --version
uv 0.5.14
&gt; cat pyproject.toml | grep required-version
required-version = &quot;&gt;=0.5.15&quot;
&gt; uv sync
error: Required version `&gt;=0.5.15` does not match the running version `0.5.14`
</code></pre>
<p>All fine so far, but:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; uv self update
error: Required version `&gt;=0.5.15` does not match the running version `0.5.14`
</code></pre>
<p>so the obvious way to fix the uv-is-too-old problem doesn't work :) Naturally this is easily worked around by cd-ing to a different directory, but it seems likely to me that blocking <code>uv self</code> wasn't intended!</p>
<p>I've also tried the same thing after upgrading to uv 0.5.15, and changing <code>required-version</code> to &gt;=0.5.16, just to check whether the issue had been fixed already.</p>
<p>(Aside: it might also be useful if the error message said &quot;Required <strong>uv</strong> version...&quot;. I can imagine a user who didn't add the uv version bound constraint potentially being confused about what is actually binding.)</p>
