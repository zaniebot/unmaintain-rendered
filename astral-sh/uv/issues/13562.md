# M1 Mac, how to use x86_64?

---

_Issue opened by @chengyjonathan on 2025-05-20 19:33_

### Question

Hi there, I'm trying to create a x86_64 venv on my m1 mac, and I keep getting

`arch -x86_64 uv add 'rlgym[all]'`

hint: You're on macOS (`macosx_14_0_arm64`), but `rocketsim` (v2.1.1.post4) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux2014_x86_64`, `macosx_13_0_x86_64`, `win_amd64`

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

_No response_

uv uses the architecture of your Python interpreter, if it finds one. Can you check which interpreter is in `.venv` and recreate with one for x86_64 by using the full key with the architecture from `uv python list`?

python/cpython-3.11.11-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.11

ah i see

Do you know how to createa a new venv with a particular python interpreter?

It is:
```
uv venv -p cpython-3.11.11-macos-x86_64-none
```
