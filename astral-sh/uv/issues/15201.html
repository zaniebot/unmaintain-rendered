            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In resolution errors, we often show the full list of versions. We should elide wherever possible, as for real packages, these lists can become long and distract from the actual error. We usually show those lists because we otherwise have a hole in the trace where a version could be. We however know the lists of versions and know that no version can be in there, so we can just talk about ranges. One trick is to change inclusive ranges to exclusive ranges using the next package version as reference.</p>
<p>Systematically shortening the errors helps especially if they fit on a single screen page instead of scrolling for pages. The examples below are taken from the test suite, where all examples are small, while real conflicts are often much longer error messages.</p>

  And because open3d&gt;=0.16.0 has no wheels with a matching platform tag (e.g., `manylinux_2_17_x86_64`) and you require open3d, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.

  hint: While the active Python version is 3.12, the resolution failed for other Python versions supported by your project. Consider limiting your project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
