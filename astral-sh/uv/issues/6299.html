            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it would be nice to support several common backends with <code>uv init</code>. Current hatchling is the default (which is a great default), but it would be nice to be able to support compiled backends (<code>maturin</code>, <code>scikit-build-core</code>, and <code>meson-python</code>), and maybe a few other popular PEP 621 pure-python backends like <code>setuptools</code>, <code>flit-core</code>, and <code>pdm-backend</code>. This could also have a &quot;none&quot;-like option for packages that don't have a library component at all, and are just an application like a website.</p>
<p>If implemented, there would be an optional argument like <code>--build-backend</code> (or <code>--backend</code> if you'd rather shorter names) that would default to <code>hatchling</code>. But it would take other options. Selecting one of these would generate from a slightly different template, providing at least a different <code>build-system.build-backend</code> and <code>build-system.requires</code>. Ideally, especially for the compiled backends, the example file would be adjusted a bit as well.</p>
<p>https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie is an example of a cookiecutter that supports lots of backends. I'd keep the template simple, but this is example of something supporting this without too much effort.</p>
