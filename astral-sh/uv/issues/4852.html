            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi everyone, thank you for adding the new <code>--universal</code> option to pip compile, it will simplify a lot my workflow.</p>
<p>One thing I believe is a bit weird is that it adds marks for python versions below the ones on <code>pyproject.toml</code> for the <code>requires-python</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Currently we have <code>requires-python = '&gt;=3.9'</code> but I see several lines with markers like:</p>
<pre><code>tornado==6.4 ; python_version &gt;= '3.5.2'
python3-openid==3.2.0 ; python_version &gt;= '3.0'
</code></pre>
<p>I really don't know when it decides the marker is mandatory, but IMO it should be only for the supported versions of my app.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I forgot to say, the reason it is important to me not having these marks is because we have a few legacy envs where we need to package all the new dependencies with our binaries and these lines make it appear as if the dependency has changed.</p>
<p>I will do a workaround for now, but would appreciate if the output was consistent with only the supported python versions</p>
