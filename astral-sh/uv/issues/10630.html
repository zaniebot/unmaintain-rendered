            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When running <code>uv run pytest</code>, all tests are run against the current virtual environment, so running <code>uv sync --all-packages</code> is necessary for the tests not to fail due to missing dependencies. However, if one forgets to add a dependency to a workspace member, the tests might still pass even though they shouldn't. Ideally, before running tests the environment would be set up for each workspace member independently. E.g.</p>
<p>If I have workspace members A, B, C, the tests should automatically run like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv sync --package A</code></li>
<li><code>uv run pytest /path/to/A</code></li>
<li><code>uv sync --package B</code></li>
<li><code>uv run pytest /path/to/B</code></li>
<li><code>uv sync --package C</code></li>
<li><code>uv run pytest /path/to/C</code></li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think you want <code>--exact</code>. (I don't think that uv itself should be iterating over the workspace members like that, if that's the suggestion.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, I was not aware <code>--exact</code> was recently introduced though it does not solve my problem. As a workaround, I have created a custom script to iteratively do independent testing of each package. I agree; maybe adding it to <code>uv</code> introduces too much complexity.</p>
