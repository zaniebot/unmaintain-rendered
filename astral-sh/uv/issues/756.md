# Check `pyproject.toml` `requires-python` against the installed Python

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-01-03 21:33_

If a pyproject.toml exists and it declares a python requirement, we should check and warn (but not error) if the current venv doesn't match it, independent of where we get our dependency specification from.

Creating an incompatible venv is a common hard to notice footgun we should help users avoid. An example is using `python -m venv .venv` or `virtualenv .venv` when the system package manager ships an older python version than the project requires.
