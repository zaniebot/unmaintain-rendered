            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I understand correctly, then I think this <code>.output</code>:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/1e1f49bfe53b41ac313f2963359e2bf8df2b8e86/crates/uv-build/src/lib.rs#L1062</p>
<p>means that all the output from the build backend is collected whilst it is running, rather than being displayed to the user (during <code>uv pip compile --verbose</code>).</p>
<p>Would it be possible to display the output of the build backend to the user? In my case I have a custom build backend that I'd love to see some logs from during installation.</p>
<p>(This is just a nice-to-have, I can work around this by streaming the logs to a file.)</p>
