            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for this excellent piece of software as well as Ruff. My team and I are loving it!</p>
<p>I believe we may have encountered a bug.</p>
<p>We are using private JFrog/Artifactory PyPI repositories. When new users want to access them, they need permission to do so. If they do not have permissions on one of our repositories, and there is a package with the same name on PyPI.org, UV does not issue a warning that the client received a 403 Access Denied. Instead, it installs the package from PyPI.org.</p>
<p>We run UV with the --verbose flag, but nothing in the debug logs indicates that UV attempted to connect to the private repository and received a 403 error.</p>
<p>Maybe I misunderstand something, or it could be a bug?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and effort.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe it's a JFrog behavior to pass-through to PyPI when credentials are not provided — that's not a uv feature. We're probably not even receiving a 403.</p>
<p>If you provide a username on the index URL, that will force uv to use an authenticated request.</p>
