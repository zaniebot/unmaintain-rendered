# uv cannot handle `+` in package version

---

_Issue opened by @hashb on 2024-03-05 13:57_

## Summary
uv encodes `+` in package version as a html character entity which causes pypi to return 400 error. webserver expects percent encoding

uv version: 

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.1.14
```

How to reproduce:

```bash
$ uv pip install --extra-index-url https://buf.build/gen/python hashb_foxglove_protocolbuffers_python==25.3.0.1.20240226043130+465630478360 --force-reinstall
error: Failed to download: hashb-foxglove-protocolbuffers-python==25.3.0.1.20240226043130+465630478360
  Caused by: HTTP status client error (400 Bad Request) for url (https://buf.build/gen/python/hashb-foxglove-protocolbuffers-python/hashb_foxglove_protocolbuffers_python-25.3.0.1.20240226043130&#43;465630478360-py3-none-any.whl)
```

pip is able to handle this type of package

```bash
$ pip install --extra-index-url https://buf.build/gen/python hashb_foxglove_protocolbuffers_python==25.3.0.1.20240226043130+465630478360 --force-reinstall

The proximate issue is fixed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2215, but there are a few other problems here:

1. We don't respect local identifiers right now (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1855).
2. There's some feature used in the wheel zip files on this registry that we haven't encountered elsewhere (data descriptors).
