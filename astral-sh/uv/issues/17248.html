<p>For deployment, we would like to build one package in our monorepo and all its local dependencies, resulting in a <code>build</code> folder containing the wheels for all those packages.</p>
<p>It seems like this functionality is currently not exposed via the uv cli but similar functionality is used internally already:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv build</code> puts only the wheel of the present package into the <code>build</code> folder, not any dependencies.</li>
<li>In a workspace, <code>uv build --all</code> builds all dependencies and places all wheels into the <code>build</code> folder, but that is too much in a large monorepo.</li>
<li><code>uv sync --no-editable</code> already builds the present package and all its dependencies and installs them into the venv, but it doesn't place the wheels into a folder for the user to access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
