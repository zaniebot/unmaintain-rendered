            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Using uv, I was trying to make a dependency on something I had locally built. I used this in my pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.sources]
pantograph = { path = &quot;~/Documents/MyDocuments/Professional/PyPantograph/dist/pantograph-0.3.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_14_0_arm64.whl&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>But it didn't work.</p>
<pre><code>error: Distribution not found at: file:///Users/boltonbailey/Documents/MyDocuments/Professional/my-uv-project/~/Documents/MyDocuments/Professional/PyPantograph/dist/pantograph-0.3.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_14_0_arm64.whl
</code></pre>
<p>I needed to replace the <code>~</code> with the name of my home directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.sources]
pantograph = { path = &quot;/Users/boltonbailey/Documents/MyDocuments/Professional/PyPantograph/dist/pantograph-0.3.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_14_0_arm64.whl&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>After this, it worked. However, it would have been nice if <code>uv</code> had recognized that my path starting with <code>~</code> was meant to be relative to my home directory.</p>
<p>Can uv be made to interpret paths starting with <code>~</code> as non-relative paths?</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The example would be that</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.sources]
pantograph = { path = &quot;~/Documents/MyDocuments/Professional/PyPantograph/dist/pantograph-0.3.0-cp310-cp310-macosx_14_0_arm64.whl&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>described above works out-of-the-box</p>
