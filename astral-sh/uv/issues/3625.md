# Support `tool.uv.workspace.default-packages`

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-05-16 13:39_

When running commands such as `uv run` or `uv pip install -e .` in the root of a virtual workspace, we currently error because we don't know which package to install. Similar cargo, we should allow declaring a default target, in this case a package rather than a bin, as:

```toml
tool.uv.workspace.default-packages = ["<package name>", "<package name>"]
```
