# uv incorrectly thinks a 3.13t venv doesn't satisfy >=3.8

### Summary

I'm trying to run the tests for the python bindings for `kornia-rs` on the free-threaded build and noticed this strange behavior in a folder that has an existing 3.13t venv:

```
± uv run -v maturin develop -m Cargo.toml
DEBUG uv 0.6.9 (3d9460278 2025-03-20)
DEBUG Found project root: `/Users/goldbaum/Documents/kornia-rs/kornia-py`
DEBUG No workspace root found, using project root
DEBUG Discovered project `kornia-rs` at: /Users/goldbaum/Documents/kornia-rs/kornia-py
DEBUG Acquired lock for `/Users/goldbaum/Documents/kornia-rs/kornia-py`
DEBUG Using Python request `>=3.8` from `requires-python` metadata
DEBUG Checking for Python environment at `.venv`
DEBUG The virtual environment's Python version does not satisfy `>=3.8`
DEBUG Searching for Python >=3.8 in managed installations or search path

DEBUG Found `cpython-3.13.0+freethreaded-macos-aarch64-none` at `/Users/goldbaum/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.13.0+freethreaded-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.13t` (managed installations)
DEBUG Skipping interpreter at `/Users/goldbaum/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.13.0+freethreaded-macos-aarch64-none/bin/python3.13t` from managed installations: does not satisfy request `>=3.8`
DEBUG Found managed installation `cpython-3.11.10-macos-aarch64-none`

Using CPython 3.11.10
```

IMO this is wrong and uv should pick 3.13t.

To reproduce this with `kornia-rs`, do:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:kornia/kornia-rs.git
$ cd kornia-rs/kornia-py
$ just install-dev
$ uv run -v maturin develop -m Cargo.toml
```

I haven't checked if this happens in a simpler setup.

Sorry to bother you @zanieb - is this a real bug or a PEBCAK issue?

This sounds like a bug, we should allow a discovered environment to meet this request in a project context. I think it might be a bit tricky to fix, because outside of a project if you did `uv python find '>=3.8'` we would not want to select a free-threaded interpreter without opt-in.

I took a second to look at this and I think we need to change 

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/8f3583a6e63800b770fec3b7be9b754be9d65602/crates/uv-python/src/discovery.rs#L1673

to avoid filtering the interpreter too aggressively and add some other handling to avoid selection of free-threaded interpreters when not desired.
