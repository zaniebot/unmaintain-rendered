Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Currently, the user's <code>.bash_profile</code> is modified by appending <code>. $CARGO_HOME/env</code> on every <code>uv self update</code>. I understand this behavior on initial install for making uv work out of the box for everyone, but <code>uv</code> should respect if a user has since (re)moved this line in their BASH configuration when updating. Is it possible to limit this behavior to the initial install and omit it on <code>uv self update</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv --version
uv 0.2.31
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the problem is that the installer can't distinguish between a <em>newly</em> supported shell config file and previously supported one so it just adds to <em>all</em> configs. It does seem reasonable to add a flag to opt-out though?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can the difference between an update and initial install be detected? If so, implicit/automatic modification to shell config can be reserved for just the initial installation process (just communicate to the user that it was done). A flag could then be used to enable explicit opt-in to shell config modification when updating e.g. <code>uv self update --config-shell</code>, or potentially even outside of the update command e.g. <code>uv self shellconfig</code>.</p>
