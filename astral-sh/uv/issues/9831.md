# `Unexpected HTTP response: 503` running in Github CI workflow

---

_Issue opened by @DanielYang59 on 2024-12-12 02:08_

We have a [minimal setup of `uv` in Github workflow as](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/653714e4fe6914a5b9bea6eef0f44da507db1a2f/.github/workflows/test.yml#L77-L78):
```
      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4
```

And noticed [the following error from CI workflow](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/actions/runs/12278923035/job/34261741997) (seemingly intermittent, but thought might be good to keep it tracked):

```
Run astral-sh/setup-uv@v4

There might have been a short Github outage that occurred at 3.26 PM GMT. Your action failed at this time

and downdetector shows a spike in reports at this time too
