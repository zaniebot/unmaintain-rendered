            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Context:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the virtual environment is created by pipenv, PIPENV_ACTIVE environment variable is set , so similarly is there any way to detect as if the Venv is managed by UV ?</li>
</ul>
Platform
<p>5.14.0-427.40.1.el9_4.x86_64</p>
Version
<p>uv 0.6.17</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I briefly looked through the <strong>pipenv</strong> source code. It seems pipenv just uses <strong>virtualenv</strong> to create a virtual environment, and then it puts some additional files into that virtual environment&#x27;s directory.
Regarding <strong>PIPENV_ACTIVE</strong>, it&#x27;s actually an environment variable that gets added when you run <code>pipenv shell</code> to activate the virtual environment. It&#x27;s not used to determine whether a virtual environment is managed by Pipenv.</p>
<p>However, if you just want to know if a virtual environment was created by uv, you can check the <strong>pyvenv.cfg</strong> file inside the virtual environment&#x27;s folder. This file contains the version of uv that created the environment, which should tell you whether it was created by uv.
e.g.</p>
<pre><code>home = ...
implementation = CPython
uv = 0.6.6
version_info = 3.12.8
include-system-site-packages = false
seed = true
prompt = ...
</code></pre>
<p>Oh, and if you&#x27;re running a program using uv (like with <code>uv run</code>), an environment variable named <strong>UV</strong> will also be present.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv doesn&#x27;t fundamentally differentiate between venvs created by uv and those created by other tools, it can use venvs by other tools and other tools can use uv venvs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, sounds good, Thanks @FishAlchemist, @konstin.
Just expecting exactly the same approach what you suggested. I&#x27;ll hold it with .pyvenv config file to differentiate between actual venv  vs uv venv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Once the venv has been activated, As with PIPENV_ACTIVE I am able to make out that respective venv has been managed by Pipenv, Yet when It comes to venv module and uv, I couldn&#x27;t find any difference post activation. Hence the query.</p>
