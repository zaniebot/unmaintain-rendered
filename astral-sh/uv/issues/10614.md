# `uv run` output mentions `.python-version` file, but none is present

```
❯ ls .python-version .venv pyproject.toml
ls: .python-version: No such file or directory
ls: .venv: No such file or directory
ls: pyproject.toml: No such file or directory

❯ uv run test.py
Reading inline script metadata from `test.py`
warning: The Python request from `.python-version` resolved to Python 3.11.11, which is incompatible with the script's Python requirement: `>=3.12`
2.30.0

❯ cat test.py
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "open_clip_torch",
# ]
# ///

import open_clip

print(open_clip.__version__)

❯ uv version
uv 0.5.18 (Homebrew 2025-01-11)

❯ find . | grep version | wc -l
       0
```

Why is uv mentioning a `.python-version` file? Is it looking in some other directory as well?

We read `.python-version` files from parent directories, unless you're in a project — in which case we will not go beyond the project bounds.

Oh, gotcha, thanks!
