# `python-downloads` option affects `uv python list`

---

_Issue opened by @heavywatal on 2025-04-28 03:14_

### Summary

`python-downloads` is documented as "Whether to allow Python downloads.", but it actually affects `uv python list` as well. When "manual" or "never" is set, `uv python list` shows only installed ones. It is an error in implementation or documentation. Downloadable versions should be shown regardless of this option, or the current behavior should be documented.

### Platform

@zanieb would know.

This is intentional. We don't want to show uninstalled versions as "available" when downloads are not automatic.

You can override it, e.g., `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never uv python list --allow-python-downloads`. Maybe we could add a `--show-python-downloads` alias for that global option in `uv python list` for clarity.
