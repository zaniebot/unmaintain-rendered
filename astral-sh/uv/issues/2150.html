<p>Creating a separate issue for visibility, as the issue for creating the <code>uv pip list</code> command has now been closed as complete. Apologies if I missed an issue that already requested this - feel free to close this as a duplicate if that&#x27;s the case.</p>
<p>I use <code>pip list --outdated</code> all the time (more than any other form of <code>pip list</code>, probably). It would be really useful to have in <code>uv</code> as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the reply. We have a somewhat complicated dependency management process which precludes us from using tools like renovate or dependabot on our repo. As such we use <code>pip list --outdated --format=json</code> together with some custom postprocessing of the output and our <code>pyproject.toml</code> to create a list of updatable packages.</p>
<p>From that point of view this is more of a &quot;nice to have&quot; rather than a show-stopper, but for our team this functionality gives us a big quality of life improvement in our DX.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m happy to take a swing at the implementation if all the pieces are there 🤞</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for all the kind words :) that&#x27;s an interesting use-case but it makes some sense to me. I imagine it&#x27;d make sense to have a future workflow that does not depend on listing the installed packages and can just give you metadata directly from a lockfile... but we can think more about that separately.</p>
<p>Feel free to give it a try. I&#x27;m happy to provide any guidance. I&#x27;d look at the <code>pip_install</code> implementation and the <code>Plan.reinstalls</code> field.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mralusw You can keep track of the packages in requirements+lock files, upgrade those, then sync.</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip compile -U requirements.in -o requirements.txt

<p>Or without any locking or syncing, just listing top level pkgs, this may do:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just an opinion at here:
use it as separated command, like <code>pip update</code>, which takes <code>requirements.txt</code> (compiled versions <code>{pkg}=={version}</code>) as input and output is updated list.
for current venv and its installed packages in it we can then use <code>uv pip freeze | uv pip update</code>.</p>
<p>Also, fwiw I opened a enhancement request for <code>uv pip freeze</code> in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3141">astral-sh/uv#3141</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While there are work-arounds, note that <code>pip</code> can be used not only from the command line, but also from scripts and higher-order software. The update-check is conceptually different from the update-install step.</p>
<p>For example, when writing a package manager, it&#x27;s a natural workflow to</p>
<ol>
<li>check for available updates</li>
<li>notify the user</li>
<li>allow them to select an action, and</li>
<li>separately perform the update.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only the last step might need admin privileges, and only the last two need an interactive environment.</p>
<p>Also, it&#x27;s a waste to have a resolution mechanism and not expose it (especially when there&#x27;s a clear API, already exposed by an equivalent tool — as in this case).</p>

<p>I think this is a really good question and illustrates your team&#x27;s desire to provide good interfaces.</p>
<p>For me, I use this in a few places:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a faster version of <code>poetry update --dry-run</code>.  Of course, if the Poetry command were faster, then that would be preferable since it would give more accurate results.</li>
<li>After <code>poetry update</code> to find out if anything wasn&#x27;t upgraded, and then I do <code>poetry show -t --ansi | less</code>  to find out why certain things weren&#x27;t updated.</li>
<li>In my system-wide Python to find out if anything needs updating.  For me, I would be okay with my system-wide Python being managed in the same way as a Poetry project—if that were possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, I don&#x27;t really need <code>uv pip list --outdated</code>.  What I need are fast versions of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv poetry update --dry-run</code>,</li>
<li><code>uv poetry show -o</code>, and</li>
<li>some way to manage my system Python libraries as if they were in a Poetry project.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just curious, is there a technical reason why the results of the package resolution process might be difficult to expose?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m writing a package manager that sits on top of <code>pip</code> and other package sources. I&#x27;m trying to avoid fancy tools (see for instance <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/why-not-tell-people-to-simply-use">Why not tell people to &quot;simply&quot; use pyenv, poetry, pipx or anaconda</a> and the related series for why sticking to upstream python packaging tools might avoid a host of problems). <code>uv pip</code> is not of course vanilla <code>pip</code>, but it&#x27;s close, doesn&#x27;t require custom workflows, and the speed is compelling.</p>

The use-case we have is keeping our IoT Pipeline up to date and to avoid to large required changes or tech backlog. We have a fairly large application for this with quite a lot of packages and it is simply not feasible to check everything manually.</p>
<p>For example, every time I work with a PR, I can just run one command to check the status of all the used packages. If I see that quite a few packages that could be updated, I would start looking into this. I do it like this using Poetry and it works very good with keeping things up to date.</p>
<p>The alternative would be to leave this to random chance (check when you remember to do it) or set up something like a quartely calendar event to check it.</p>
<p>It would also be a neater way to automate this with for example a Github Action (which is possible with the script from @ziddey, but would be better with a an official solution).</p>
<p>This is the one feature holding me back from migrating to UV for all our packages.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#x27;t this be better as <code>uv tree --outdated</code> (analogous to <code>poetry show -o</code>, but with a nice tree view)?   After all, it doesn&#x27;t matter which dependencies have updates, but rather which dependencies <em>can be</em> updated.</p>

<p>Sorry, I think we&#x27;re talking past each other.  As I said in my last comment, this has nothing to do with format.  (It also has nothing to do with direct dependencies.)  My point was that the use case suggested above should be showing <em>the packages that can be updated given the [project file]</em> rather than <em>simply the outdated packages</em>.</p>
<p>Consider, for example that you have dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>dependencies = [
    &#x27;jaxlib &gt;=0.4.14, &lt;=0.4.31&#x27;,
    &#x27;numpy &lt;= 2.1.0&#x27;
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>And you have jaxlib==0.4.31 and numpy==2.0.0 installed.  Suppose that jaxlib 0.5.0 and numpy 2.1.0 are available. What should be displayed?</p>
<p>pip list --outdated naively says: jaxlib 0.5.0 and numpy 2.1.0</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t see your pyproject.toml file.  I think it&#x27;s more useful (considering the use cases mentioned in this thread, which are project use cases) to show only that numpy is outdated.  This is because <code>uv lock -U</code> will not update jaxlib, and it will be both useless and confusing (in my opinion)  to keep saying that it is outdated and refuse to update it.</p>
<p>This is what <code>poetry show -o</code> currently does.</p>
<p>Of course, when it comes to packaging there are more use cases than I can imagine.  Perhaps other people are more interested in the pip-like behavior.  I&#x27;m not sure.</p>

<p>no it isn&#x27;t. poetry shows all packages for which newer versions are available even if <code>poetry lock</code> would not use those newer versions.</p>
<p>fwiw I find this behaviour more useful than telling me which packages it would upgrade if I re-locked.  (I can <code>update --dry-run</code> for that: or just update and revert if I don&#x27;t like the answer).</p>

<p>Ah, my mistake.  For some reason I thought it was doing the dry run essentially.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>For me, I get a lot of noise from downstream package limits that I can&#x27;t relax holding things back.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d rather just see what I can control.  Maybe it would be nice to show at least two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>things that would be upgraded given <code>uv lock -U</code>, and</li>
<li>things that could be upgraded if constraints in the project file were relaxed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would still hide some outdated packages if they are blocked by dependencies within dependencies.  Maybe those should be shown in a third section so that you can ping their maintainers.  WDYT?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like there are different features being discussed here. I propose we use this thread to only discuss what seems to be the original feature, which is what <code>pip list --outdated</code> does and also what the script posted <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2150#issuecomment-2313934453">above</a> by @ziddey does, which is: to list outdated packages <strong>based on which packages are installed on the current virtual environment (or in the system)</strong>. This ignores any lock files or pyproject.toml files, as it only looks at which packages are currently installed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Apologies for continuing this thread for the not directly <code>pip --outdated</code> use case)</p>
<p>FYI - not great but functional work around:
Just ported a project over to <code>uv</code> from <code>poetry</code> and seeing a list of upgradeable packages (both uses cases specced by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2150">astral-sh/uv#2150</a>#issuecomment-2336453465) was a major missing functionality in the switch</p>
<p>Current work around (not ideal):</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup <code>pyproject.toml</code> via standard <code>uv</code> approach with deps pinned as strictly as you would like, make sure at least one <code>uv</code> install command has been run, like <code>uv sync</code></li>
<li>For deps that would be upgraded given <code>uv lock -U</code>:<ul>
<li>Setup (and maintain) a shadow <code>poetry.pinned.pyproject.toml</code> via the minimal required <code>poetry</code> standard with the same deps and pins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For deps that could be upgraded if constraints in the project file were relaxed.:<ul>
<li>Setup (and maintain) a shadow <code>poetry.nopin.pyproject.toml</code> via the minimal required <code>poetry</code> standard with the same deps, only do not pin dep versions (or remove upper bounds)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Whenever you&#x27;d like to check upgradeable deps (either case) - swap the actual <code>pyproject.toml</code> with the use case associated <code>poetry.*.pyproject.toml</code> and run <code>poetry update --dry-run</code> - no <code>venv</code> activation needed (both tools default to use <code>/path/to/project/.venv</code>)</li>
<li><code>poetry show -o</code> works as well after a <code>poetry lock</code> (requires a <code>poetry.lock</code>)<ul>
<li>Trivial to wrap in a script</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m not happy with this (I&#x27;m sure there are many complexities being missed here), but it works-ish</p>
<p>Goes with saying - thank you to the Astral team for all the incredible work y&#x27;all are doing in this space - huge strides!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would love for this to be a thing. I mostly use <code>pnpm</code> for my node.js projects and to me <code>uv</code> feels super familiar because of that.</p>
<p>In that ecosystem, my favourite and most commonly used commands are <code>pnpm add</code>, <code>pnpm remove</code> and <code>pnpm outdated</code>. We already have <code>uv add</code> and <code>uv remove</code> - I think being able to run <code>uv outdated</code> would be awesome too!</p>

<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to work anymore in uv 0.9.4. It just lists all dependencies.</p>
<p><code>uv pip list --outdated</code> works instead.</p>
