# Enhancement: uv activate

---

_@tiagofassoni_

Hello! 

I'm writing to discuss the possibility of a command `uv activate` command for activating the virtualenv, instead of resorting to the local shell/OS combination. I'm asking this because I teach Python and forgetting how to activate an environment is all too common. This command would lower the bar to using Python (which uv has lowered considerably, thanks so much!)

I'm willing to code this via PR, but I think it's good manners to ask first rather than start coding.

Hi this looks like a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1910

We're interested in this but not sure how feasible it is to deliver a great experience.

Let's discuss more over there.
