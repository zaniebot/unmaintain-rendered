# Windows distribution cache access denied in CI

---

_Issue opened by @MattTheCuber on 2025-02-10 21:58_

### Summary

Hello, I just set up a GitLab Docker runner using the image `python:3.11-windowservercore` on a Windows VM to add Windows-based tests to our GitLab CI and I am struggling with uv's cache not working.

My job looks like this:

```yaml
test-docker-windows:
  variables:
    UV_CACHE_DIR: .uv-cache
    UV_LINK_MODE: copy
  cache:
    key: default
    paths:
      - .uv-cache
  script:
    - pwd
    - pip install uv -q
    - uv venv
    - .venv\Scripts\activate
    - uv pip install ruff -v
    - ruff --version
  after_script:
    - uv cache prune --ci
```

I have tried with and without the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

And the error is:

```
DEBUG Released lock at `C:\builds\mvine\test-ci\.uv-cache\wheels-v3\pypi\ruff\ruff-0.9.6-py3-none-win_amd64.lock`
  × Failed to download `ruff==0.9.6`
  ├─▶ Failed to read from the distribution cache
  ╰─▶ Access is denied. (os error 5)
```

Please let me know what steps I can take to debug.

Is there any way you can reproduce this with a GitHub Actions CI pipeline that I can run myself to debug?

I can try to make a repo ~~tomorrow~~, I don't know how Windows images work on GitHub actions, but I'll find out

---

_Comment by @MattTheCuber on 2025-02-10 23:04_

I was able to create a similar setup which did not reproduce the bug here: https://github.com/MattTheCuber/test

Going to try one on https://gitlab.com/ next.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-02-10 23:08_

Okay thanks. There's some small chance this was fixed in v0.5.30 so maybe worth ensuring that the pipelines use v0.5.29, if they both pass.

_Comment by @MattTheCuber on 2025-02-10 23:10_

Great point

---

_Comment by @MattTheCuber on 2025-02-11 02:27_

Nooo, couldnt reproduce on GitLab SaaS either: https://gitlab.com/mattvine03/test

I'll try a different image on our self-hosted instance tomorrow.

Any ideas what else I can do to debug this on our server? I am having trouble using a different image.

_Comment by @DetachHead on 2025-02-20 03:52_

i'm seeing this intermittently when running `uv sync` locally since updating from uv 0.5.31 to 0.6.2. will try to see if i can reproduce it reliably and provide some more info

**edit:** actually it might be #11018 instead which is a slightly different error
