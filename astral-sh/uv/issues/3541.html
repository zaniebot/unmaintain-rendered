            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I have a setup where I call uv pip install with an extra-index-url specified as a parameter, for instance:</p>
<p>uv pip install <package> --extra-index-url <extra-index-url></p>
<p>But during CI I want to overwrite the value of that flag, for that, I am using the uv. tom file where I have specified:</p>
<p>[pip]
extra-index-url = [<extra-index-url2>]</p>
<p>So the final setup is the uv.toml file and uv being called as mentioned previously (i.e., having 2 extra index URL).
However, it appears that uv is not looking the one specified in the configuration (contrary to what pip does). Is this supposed to happen? Or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you <em>also</em> providing the <code>--extra-index-url</code> on the command-line in CI? So in CI, do you have <em>both</em> the command-line argumnet <em>and</em> the <code>uv.toml</code> file present?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, ok. Command-line arguments always take precedence over configuration files, so yes, this is the expected behavior. I think you'll need to find a way to avoid passing the command-line argument in CI.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>is there any reason to implement that behavior? That is not the behavior of pip when there are configurations specified as global in pip.conf</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's standard for the command line to override environment variables, and for environment variables to override configuration files. Even pip implements this (at least as-written here): https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/#precedence-override-order.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I looked into it and the difference in behavior is that in the case of pip, for the concrete case of the extra-index-url (since it can take multiple values), the value passed in the command line is merged with the value specified in the config file (i.e., if you have 1 extra index url specified in pip.conf and another in the command line, in the end, the two are used).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, you want <em>both</em> index URLs to be respected? I assumed from the original issue that you were trying to <em>disable</em> the index URL from the command-line given <code>extra-index-url = []</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's reasonable to merge here when the type is a vector? We at least merge when we discover multiple configuration files. What do you think @zanieb?</p>
