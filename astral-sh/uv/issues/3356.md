# universal-lock: track version numbers for all distributions

---

_Issue opened by @BurntSushi on 2024-05-03 16:01_

When creating a `Lock`, we currently have a `todo!()` when trying to extract version numbers:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e33ff95575e8165078799548070210947d1cfad0/crates/uv-resolver/src/lock.rs#L281-L287

For example, when the distribution comes from a direct URL, it only has a URL and not a version number:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e33ff95575e8165078799548070210947d1cfad0/crates/distribution-types/src/lib.rs#L567-L571

My understanding is that a version number exists for these distributions in their metadata, but we currently don't keep it around (I believe). We need the version number for our universal lock file, as part of #3347.
