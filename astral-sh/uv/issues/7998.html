            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we want to leverage <code>uv publish</code> in GitHub Actions, best is to set a trusted publisher as mentioned in the uv docs. However, it seems there is no possibility to set the environment name via <code>uv publish</code>. Setting the environment name is a best practice according to the PyPi docs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuring an environment is optional, but strongly recommended: with a GitHub environment, you can apply additional restrictions to your trusted workflow, such as requiring manual approval on each run by a trusted subset of repository maintainers.
