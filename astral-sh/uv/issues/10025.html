            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can install a package from a private repo at a specific git commit <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#git-authentication">as documented</a> using my personal access token.</p>
<p>However, when a teammate then tries to spin up my project with <code>uv sync</code>, it just hangs as previously reported <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#git-authentication">here</a>. This makes sense, as the <code>uv.lock</code> does not (and should not) include my access token.</p>
<p>Although you've clarified that you don't support <em>interactive</em> authentication, might there already be a way for a user to configure environment variables so that <code>uv sync</code> would just work?</p>
<p>Short of that, my current workaround for someone else to set up a venv consistent with mine is kinda ugly:</p>
<pre><code>uv venv

# for each private repo do
uv add git+https://${TOKEN_VARIABLE}...

# now that ^^ are already installed, we can pick up all the other deps specified in `uv.lock`:
uv sync
</code></pre>
