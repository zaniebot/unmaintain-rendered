# Incorrect entrypoint parsing of `setup.py` based projects calling methods on a variable

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
```bash
❯ uv pip install invoke
❯ inv
  File "/Users/au484925/Desktop/Git/timeseriesflattener/.venv/bin/inv", line 5
    from invoke.main import program.run
```

Invoke's entrypoints are defined at:
https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke/blob/506bf4e020c177a03cf4257a22969bad0845e4ee/setup.py#L46L51

`import program.run` is invalid syntax, and should have been parsed to `import program`. Manually editing it fixes the problem.

```bash
❯ uv --version
uv 0.1.5
(.venv) 
```

On MacOS ARM64.
