            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Starting a new project often involves repetitive tasks like configuring project structures, setting up tools, and applying team-specific templates. While these steps are common across projects, they remain manual and error-prone within the <code>uv</code> ecosystem. Developers need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predefined templates with standard structures and settings.</li>
<li>Scaffolding for frameworks (e.g., Django, FastAPI, or React).</li>
<li>Standardized configurations for CI/CD, linters, or documentation (e.g., <code>.gitignore</code>, README, LICENSE).</li>
</ul>
<p>Existing tools like <a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/cli/reference/#hatch-new"><code>hatch</code></a> and <a href="https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/"><code>cookiecutter</code></a> address these issues but lack integration with <code>uv</code>, leading to fragmented workflows for developers who rely on <code>uv</code> as their project manager. <code>npm</code>-world tools like <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app"><code>create-react-app</code></a>, available via <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init"><code>npm init</code></a> or <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/12/introducing-yarn/"><code>yarn create</code></a>, are also great and popular options, sadly specific to Node.js ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Proposed Solution: <code>uv create</code></h2>
<p>Introduce a <code>uv create</code> subcommand to streamline project bootstrapping. This command would allow users to scaffold projects using predefined or custom templates, inspired by tools like <code>hatch new</code>, <code>create-react-app</code>, and <code>cookiecutter</code>.</p>
<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<h4>Using Built-in Templates</h4>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv create django my_project
$ cd my_project
$ uv run start
</code></pre>
<h4>Using Custom Templates from GitHub</h4>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv create myuser/mytemplate my_project
$ cd my_project
$ uv run start
</code></pre>
<h4>Alternative Syntax: <code>uv init --from</code></h4>
<p>For alignment with <code>npm init</code> and avoiding redundancy with <code>uv init</code>, an alternative could implementing this as a <code>uv init</code> feature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mkdir my_project &amp;&amp; cd my_project
$ uv init --from django
</code></pre>
<p>For custom templates:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv init --from myuser/mytemplate
</code></pre>
<h2>Benefits of <code>uv create</code></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seamless integration:</strong> Unified workflow within <code>uv</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Support for both built-in and user-defined templates.</li>
<li><strong>Productivity:</strong> Automates repetitive tasks, reducing setup time and errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>If the team approves, I’m happy to contribute to the implementation with guidance on project structure and integration points.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, @zanieb! Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>First of all, I confess I did an extensive search in this repo for related issues (I even used Copilot!) but didn’t find the related issue, so I apologize for any oversight. That said, I believe there are significant differences between this proposal and #4759, so I will share my thoughts on why this merits consideration.</p>
<p>While #4759 proposes <strong>integrating external tools</strong> like Cookiecutter to <code>uv init</code>, I'm focusing on <strong>standardizing workflows</strong> with a <strong>fully native solution</strong> (thinking ultimately in <code>uv</code> becoming the Python's <code>cargo</code>/<code>npm</code>).</p>
<h2>Cookiecutter?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">Cookiecutter</a>, while popular and language-agnostic, faces some challenges such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>slow development activity (<a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/commits/main">50- commits on 2024</a>);</li>
<li>poor community support (<a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues">200+ opened issues</a>);</li>
</ul>
<p>Some basic and some serious problems were detected by the community, filled as issues and remains unsolved (opened), for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>running <code>mypy</code> on templates fails (<a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues/2116">#2116</a>);</li>
<li>lack of incremental templates (<a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues/342">#342</a>);</li>
<li>'cookiecutter' repeated everywhere (<a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues/380">#380</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Relying on such external tools could undermine <code>uv</code>'s reputation for speed and reliability, particularly as a Rust-based project.</p>
<h3>Cookiecutter + <code>uv</code>?</h3>
<p>Regarding the specific integration of <code>cookiecutter</code> into <code>uv init</code>, I see at least these risks that could arise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Misalignment with <code>uv</code>'s project structure</strong>: Many Cookiecutter templates available online may not align well with <code>uv</code>'s streamlined approach, potentially resulting in duplicated or conflicting files such as <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>setup.py</code>, <code>requirements.txt</code>, and <code>environment.yml</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent user experience</strong>: Cookiecutter templates vary widely in quality, documentation, and compatibility, leading to fragmented workflows and confusion among developers.</li>
<li><strong>Performance overhead</strong>: Cookiecutter's Python implementation introduces an additional dependency and potential bottleneck, conflicting with <code>uv</code>'s emphasis on speed and simplicity.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency risks</strong>: Cookiecutter's slow development and unresolved issues could introduce maintenance headaches for <code>uv</code>, especially if future updates break compatibility.</li>
<li><strong>Limited flexibility for customization</strong>: Cookiecutter templates often lack support for incremental updates, meaning developers must either rebuild projects from scratch or manually adjust files—an inefficient process for larger teams.</li>
</ol>
<h3><code>uv</code> + Cookiecutter: <code>uv</code> already &quot;fully supports&quot; <code>cookiecutter</code></h3>
<p>While Cookiecutter in general isn't compatible with <code>uv</code>, <strong><code>uv</code> itself is already fully compatible with Cookiecutter</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv tool run cookiecutter &lt;template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The command above works seamlessly and is readily available to any user who wants to leverage Cookiecutter templates within the <code>uv</code> ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Why <code>uv create</code>?</h3>
<p>A native <code>uv create</code> command would resolve the limitations associated with relying on external tools like Cookiecutter, ensuring stability, performance, and a seamless experience fully aligned with <code>uv</code>'s ecosystem. Unlike external integrations, a native approach would provide consistent quality, tighter control over the user experience, and avoid the maintenance risks tied to third-party tools with slower development cycles or unresolved issues.</p>
<p>By offering a fully integrated solution, the addition of <code>uv create</code> would elevate <code>uv</code> as a comprehensive, reliable project management tool, much like how <code>npm</code> or <code>cargo</code> serve their respective ecosystems. This would enable developers to scaffold projects with confidence, uniformity, and ease, while maintaining the speed and simplicity that defines <code>uv</code>.</p>
<h2>Learn from other people's mistakes and successes</h2>
<p>While Cookiecutter is a well-known tool, <strong>it hasn't become the standard for project initialization</strong>, leaving workflows fragmented across different teams and ecosystems.</p>
<p>In contrast, tools like <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-an-app"><code>create-react-app</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init"><code>npm init</code></a>, and <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/create/"><code>yarn create</code></a> have established themselves as <strong>widely adopted standards</strong> in the Node.js/Deno ecosystems (e.g. <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#start-a-new-react-native-project-with-expo">React Native's Get Started Docs</a>).</p>
<p>These tools, being the standard in the industry, provide stability, uniformity, and a consistent developer experience, making it easier for new users to onboard and adopt best practices seamlessly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This way, implementing a native <code>uv create</code> command would bring similar benefits to the <code>uv</code> ecosystem, offering an intuitive and standardized approach to project scaffolding that developers and teams can rely on.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb yes, that's correct: I'm proposing the <strong>development of a new, <code>uv</code>-specific, template tooling</strong>, written in Rust, to standardize workflows within the <code>uv</code> ecosystem, mostly inspired by <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init"><code>npm init</code></a>. For that, I'm arguing that, while cookiecutter users can <code>uv tool run cookiecutter</code>, the <code>uv create</code> approach should ensure tight integration with sane defaults, enhance performance, and provide a consistent user experience, aligning with <code>uv</code>'s goals of speed and reliability.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd love for uv to develop its own template tooling! On the other hand, there are quite a lot of templates lying around and it would be a waste to not be able to support them.</p>
<p>A built-in template engine would be really dope and could add features that are lacking in engines such as cookiecutter - chief of all, the ability to update the current project to a more recent version of a template.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would also like to see this supported by <code>uv</code>. In my opinion project setup is one of the more cumbersome tasks, and it seems to fit well in <code>uv</code> from a workflow perspective.</p>

<p>For starting small, as a PoC, why don't we just support a hit repository or folder copy without any templating support? I think this would already solve many use cases.</p>
