If I understand correctly, you want to import all Python dependencies in the current environment into pyproject.toml?
I don't think there's a single command to do that. While I wouldn't recommend importing all environment dependencies into pyproject.toml, as some dependencies might become redundant after changing the version of a package. However, if you want to do so, you can use ``uv pip freeze`` to output a requirements.txt , then use ``uv add`` to add the requirements.txt to pyproject.toml. However, you might need to set the environment, as the lock file will look for other platforms, but the current environment might not be cross-platform compatible.

Is it preferred to move all packages from requirements.txt to pyproject.toml?

Yeah.
