This started after I managed to break a different windows installation in an entirely new way, see #14637 for the previous breakage. This time, I tried to change my primary user's name so I could stop having to constantly censor it since it was my real name. It went horribly, and I managed to make the computer almost unusable, but eventually managed to mostly recover and make a new user account. The pythons were installed by the old user account, so something has happened where despite being being an administrator the new user account cannot access some files from the old one, even if the terminal is being run as admin.

Like how #14637 was fixed in #14636, I think it would be reasonable if these broken interpreters are skipped, since they are broken for reasons outside of the actual interpreter having a problem, it instead being a bigger computer issue.

Does `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_3.11.2544.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python3.11.exe` exist, and can you run it manually? If you have the Python launcher for Windows installed, what does `py -0` show?

---

_Comment by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-09-04 02:42_

Here's the output of `py -0`:
```powershell
PS C:\Users\GiGaGon> py -0
 -V:3.11 *        Python 3.11
```

If I try to go there in file explorer/non-admin cmd, I get this error:
```powershell
PS C:\Program Files>cd WindowsApps
Access is denied.
```

If I go there in an admin window, I can get to the file, but not run it.
```powershell
PS C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_3.11.2544.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0> .\python3.11.exe
ResourceUnavailable: Program 'python3.11.exe' failed to run: An error occurred trying to start process 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_3.11.2544.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python3.11.exe' with working directory 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_3.11.2544.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0'. Access is denied.At line:1 char:1
+ .\python3.11.exe
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.
```
I also tried running it from outside the broken directory, but it still doesn't work.
```powershell

It seems the restricted access to `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps` is by design. Can run `py -V:3.11`, and if that works `print(sys.executable)`?

---

_Comment by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-09-04 14:36_

```powershell
PS C:\Program Files> py -V:3.11
Unable to create process using '"C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_3.11.2544.0_x64__qbz5n2kfra8p0\python3.11.exe"': Access is denied.
```
Happens in both a normal and admin level powershell instance.

We may want to make this non-fatal in `uv python list`, and show the other interpreters despite the error, but the interpreter seems broken in some fashion, apparently related to the Windows Store.
