# `uv run` might show entrypoints?

---

_Issue opened by @baggiponte on 2024-07-18 12:41_

A feature I really liked about `rye` was that `rye run` showed all the possible entrypoints in the current project - from dependencies and the project itself. Might be a good addition for `uv` - even for an autocompletion standpoint.

I think this is the same as #4024.
