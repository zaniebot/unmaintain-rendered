# Question about best practices for cross-compat with `pip install -e .[dev]` (pre PEP 735 support)

---

_Issue opened by @tlambert03 on 2025-01-30 13:02_

### Question

I ❤️ uv and want to be able to just run `uv sync` in all of my projects and bring along all of the dev dependencies (let's assume no `uv.lock` exists yet).  However, in some cases, I also need to work with others who don't use uv and want to be able to run the classic `pip install -e .[dev]`... and if I'm not mistaken, pip does not yet support PEP 735? (https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12963)

My question is how best to accomplish this.  I know I can just use `uv sync --extra dev` (but would like to just use `uv sync`).

Would this be the best way to accomplish this until pip supports dependency groups?

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest", "ruff"]   # dev deps still go in the dev extra for now

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["my-package[dev]"]  # reference dev extra in dependency-groups.dev

[tool.uv.sources]
my-package = { workspace = true }   # declare local source
```

other tips?

We'll likely support `--group` in the `uv pip` CLI soon, but in the interim, what you could do is `uv export --dev -o requirements.txt`, and then have non-uv users `uv pip install requirements.txt`.

thanks for that tip as well!  The constraints I'd *like* to have here (if possible) are:

- i don't want to have to add/maintain `requirements.txt` in addition to `project.dependencies` / `project.optional-dependencies` 
- i'm aiming for `python -m pip install -e .[dev]` (no uv installed at all)

as a last question, do you have any caution *against* the pattern I suggested above? (and then feel free to close this)

What you have above seems reasonable... The downsides are just:

1. The `dev` extra would be part of the published package metadata (if relevant), whereas a dependency group would not.
2. Users that install with `uv pip` won't benefit from `uv.lock`, and so won't have the same constraints applied to their install.

But otherwise, I think you're on the right track in understanding the various options.
