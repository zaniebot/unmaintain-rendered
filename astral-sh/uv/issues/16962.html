            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It may be a good idea to clarify the heuristic used to determine if <code>uv_build</code> related warnings are shown, for example to specifically enable warnings for all members of the current workspace, or whenever <code>uv build</code> is invoked directly.</p>
<p>Currently <code>uv_build</code> and related infrastructure outputs some warnings (#16928 and #15750) to highlight potential issues. These warnings are intended to be only shown when the user could meaningfully act on them. The current heuristic is to check the source strategy. If the source strategy is enabled, the package is considered first-party and warnings are enabled.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The situations in which <code>uv_build</code> related warnings are shown would more accurately overlap with cases where a user can meaningfully act on them.</p>
