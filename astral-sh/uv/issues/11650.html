            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>If this functionality isn&#x27;t already available, it would be nice to have a way to automatically detect the packages a project uses based on the imports, similar to how <a href="https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs">pipreqs</a> works. I was thinking it could be an option for <code>uv tree</code>. Additionally, pipreqs is looking for maintainers, which I thought  presented an opportunity for uv to integrate it.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m happy to work on/port this into uv if astral would want it (already written in rust), I would just need some help confirming the api (i.e uv detect --update?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the offer, but I think if we worked on this we&#x27;d probably want to integrate tightly with Ruff&#x27;s parser and import analysis.</p>
<p>Your project seems cool though! I think it makes a lot of sense to explore third-party before we do it here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is technically related to the opposite operation of detecting unused packages: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13904">astral-sh/uv#13904</a></p>
