            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When trying to resolve torchaudio on python 3.12, when there are no wheels for 3.12 and no source dist, we give a bad message, pretending there are no versions even though they exist, just not for our platform/python version.</p>
<pre><code>  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no available version for torchaudio and root depends on torchaudio, version solving failed.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We agreed we cannot treat this like Python incompatibilities, right?</p>
<p>I presume we need to mark each version with an incompatible platform as incompatible in PubGrub itself, we should generalize the <code>UnusableDependencies</code> incompatibility to <code>Unusable</code> for this purpose. We can consider reusing <code>Unavailable</code> as well, as suggested by Jacob previously.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Much better:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip install &quot;torchaudio&gt;=2,&lt;2.2.0&quot;
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only the following versions of torchaudio are available:
          torchaudio&lt;=2.0.0
          torchaudio==2.0.1
          torchaudio==2.0.2
          torchaudio==2.1.0
          torchaudio==2.1.1
          torchaudio==2.1.2
          torchaudio&gt;2.2.0
      and torchaudio==2.0.0 was yanked (reason: Contains an incorrect torch dependency), we can conclude that
      torchaudio&gt;=2.0.0,&lt;2.0.1 cannot be used.
      And because torchaudio&gt;=2.0.1,&lt;=2.1.2 has no wheels with a matching Python ABI tag and you require
      torchaudio&gt;=2,&lt;2.2.0, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
