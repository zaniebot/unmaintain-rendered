# Make GitHub repositories "first-class citizens"

---

_Issue opened by @JoshPaulie on 2025-04-04 14:28_

### Summary

I'm proposing we make GitHub repositories "first-class citizens" within `uv`.

This would allow for tool installations like

```
uv tool textualize/rich
```

This is inspired by neovim package managers, which allow you to define packages with the "user/repo" convention.

The glaring caveat is not everyone uses GitHub, some prefer gitlab or other remote repository hosts. Deferring again to the neovim package management example, this doesn't seem too big of an issue. This wouldn't replace the existing `git+https://` functionality.

This would benefit the ecosystem by allowing us to distribute personal apps via GitHub, leaving more namespaces available within PyPI

### Example

Pseudo code implementation:
```
if argument starts with "git+":
	use existing functionality
if argument matches pattern "string/string":
	substitute with GitHub URL
if argument is regular string:
	search PyPI for package (existing functionality)
```
