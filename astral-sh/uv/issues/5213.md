# Support for "Updated" indicator on install/uninstall output

---

_Issue opened by @T-256 on 2024-07-19 11:00_

Ref https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5197#discussion_r1683553671

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c83a004-38a5-48ec-bf37-a3223fec27a1)

- only updated version of `from (url://)` is shown
- time is calculated on both uninstalling old version and installing new version

Example of output when installation contains all three actions (no color):
```
$ uv pip sync requirements.txt
Resolved 18 packages in 300ms
Prepared 1 package in 51ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 32ms
Installed 1 package in 28ms
Updated 1 package in 90ms
 ~ abc 0.1.3 -> 0.2.0 (from file:///E:/path/to/wheels/abc-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl)
 - test==0.1.3
 + mypkg==0.2.0
```

I think something like this would be a good change. I'm unsure on the right symbol (caret vs, e.g., dash?) and color for it. I assume that if the prior version was from a direct URL, we'd just omit it?

Agree, since caret is stands for upper numbers, but we can have also downgraded numbers. I prefer it distinguished from -+ since it has both adding and removing. we can consider `~` or `*` since they are commonly used symbols in CLIs.

We can either when both versions have url:
- show both urls (line becomes long)
- only show prior url (new version number will be on last of line)
- only show updated url (prior url not tracked)
- fallback to -+ when both have url (inconsistency)

I think `~` would be reasonable... Or `>` and `<` for upgrade and downgrade...? Is that ridiculus? Not sure if there's prior art to draw on here.

What if version number didn't change? using `=` ? I agree with >, < and = while they also come with reasonable colors. otherwise, they may bring some confusion.

I think I'd be fine with `~` in either yellow or blue.

_Comment by @j178 on 2024-07-19 13:17_

or `↑`  (U+2191) and `↓`  (U+2193)?

Updated description with tilde and blue color since yellow was hard to distinguished from white color.

> * only show updated url (prior url not tracked)

Do you know what's the point if someone may want to use prior url when updating a package? does it have any use case?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-19 13:27_

I think simplest is to show just the updated URL, it seems rare that the prior URL would be important.

Do we need do different when version number was same? e.g. editables mostly: 
```
 ~ abc 0.1.2 -> 0.1.2 (from file:///E:/path/to/projects/abc)
```
Perhaps could merge `0.1.2 -> 0.1.2` into one?

When it implemented, I think it's reasonable change sorting to action types? e.g. Updated packages shown first.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-12-27 14:52_

I believe we now have `~` for updates.
