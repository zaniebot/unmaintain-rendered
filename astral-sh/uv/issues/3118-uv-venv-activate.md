# uv venv activate

---

_Issue opened by @katterfelto on 2024-04-18 08:42_

I am really liking `uv`, great job!

This is a feature request, would it be possible to activate the virtual environment using `uv`. It would make the activation the same across platforms. I use python on windows far less than Linux, so switching takes extra time to remember the correct activation command.

I would also like it to work like `uv pip install` (which targets the parent `.venv` folder from sub folders) so if I'm in a sub folder of a project it finds the parent environment.
