            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>I&#x27;m trying to better understand the intended use case for <code>uv tool</code> vs <code>uv run</code> when it comes to external tools.  For simplicity, I&#x27;ll use <code>ruff</code> as an example.  Let&#x27;s say I want to configure <code>ruff</code> in my project and I put certain settings in my pyproject.toml.  Obviously, these settings are going to be specific to some lower-bound (and possibly upper-bound) version of <code>ruff</code>.  If some user downloads my project and tries to run ruff with some ancient version, it might not work or might give spurious errors.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to specify a version bound in my pyproject.toml to say &quot;this project needs X version of ruff&quot;.  One easy way for me to do this is to declare a dependency group like &quot;dev&quot; and declare the dependency there.  However, this feels a bit at odds with the philosophy of <code>uv tool</code> because it now opens up my project to dependency conflicts from <code>ruff</code> even though in practice the two are completely separate.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no way to declare version constraints in my project when using <code>uv tool run</code> (aka <code>uvx</code>).  I know that for the specific case of <code>ruff</code> I can declare a required version, but this will only result in an error.  What I&#x27;d like is for <code>uv tool</code> to check the required version in my pyproject.toml, then check the tools I&#x27;ve installed to see if I have a compatible version and then install compatible version if not.  This kind of requires the functionality described in #6365 but it&#x27;s a bit separate as well.</p>
<p>To summarize my question, is the best practice <code>uvx ruff</code> or <code>uv run ruff</code>?  If the answer is the former, how are versions supposed to be managed?  If the answer is the latter, what is the intended use case of <code>uv tool</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The documentation at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/#relationship-to-uv-run covers this a little. I think we could expand it, but we&#x27;re still trying to figure out what the answer is :)</p>
<p>I think the crux of your question is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7186">astral-sh/uv#7186</a>, I&#x27;d recommend reading through that and the linked issues.</p>
<p>I think the best practice depends on the tool — is version consistency important for your project, or not? If it&#x27;s important that everyone is on the same version, then you probably want to use <code>uv run</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, this is helpful.  I think ultimately what I&#x27;m looking for is <code>uv tool add</code> as described in #3560.  Are there any conceptual blockers to implementing this?  It mentions PEP 735, but this is finalized now.</p>
<p>The discussion in #7186 seems to be largely centered around &quot;magic&quot; behavior and trying to guess what the user wants.  If <code>uv tool add</code> was implemented, I think this sidesteps a lot of this.  If my project explicitly declares it needs tool X at version Y, I think it&#x27;s quite reasonable for <code>uv tool run</code> to always use that version.  If it doesn&#x27;t, then I think the current behavior is fine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think main the conceptual blocker to #3560 is that it was the largest point of confusion in that thread. The design space also overlaps with #5903. It&#x27;s not entirely clear it&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; solution.</p>
