# Authentication Issue Installing Private Git Repositories

---

_Issue opened by @akmalsoliev on 2024-09-02 21:02_

When trying to install a private Git repository requiring authentication not stored on the machine, running `uv pip install git+https://github.com/akmalsoliev/super_secret_project.git` results in `⠹ Resolving dependencies...`. Ideally, it should prompt the user for a username and token/password or display an error.

Tested with uv version 0.4.2 on Linux and macOS.

I think this is the same as #5107 -- does that sound right?

Yes, this looks to be the same issue.
