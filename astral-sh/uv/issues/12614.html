            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>i don't understand why they make installing tkinter such a pain. it should either be bundled with python itself (like it is on windows but through an optional checkbox in the installer), or it should be installable via pypi. instead the way you install it is different for each operating system</p>
<p>it would be nice if uv's automatic managing of python versions could also automatically install tkinter as well</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My understanding is weak here, but tkinter is part of the standard library and is a wrapper for tcl/tk which we <em>do</em> build as part of python-build-standalone.</p>
<p>Could you expound on the problem here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>oops my bad. i use windows locally and linux in my CI, and tkinter isn't available in our CI environment. however i completely forgot that we don't currently use an uv-managed python installation in the CI. i just tested it locally and uv does in fact install tkinter on both windows and linux. sorry for the noise</p>
