# Directly create a FastAPI sample project using the UV command

---

_Issue opened by @BasterHapy on 2025-12-08 09:12_

### Summary

I think you can directly use something like `uv init fastapi`
or `uv init --fastapi` to directly create a FastAPI example.

Specific implementation：
```bash
git clone https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-fastapi-example
```


### Example

Users can develop FastAPI projects more quickly and conveniently

I think this is encompassed by https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4759

I don't think we'll hard-code FastAPI specifically
