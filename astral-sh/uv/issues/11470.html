            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb you're absolutely right.  I tried downloading the release manually and it didn't work.  GitHub is completely inaccessible in my network (for some reason).  The <code>choco</code> error didn't make that obvious (to me).  Sorry for the false alarm.</p>
