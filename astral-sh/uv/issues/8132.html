            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>After running <code>uv run hello.py</code>, it seems that uv failed to automatically activate the venv in the current project. But uv did find this venv. Only after manually activating it using <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> can the venv be correctly recognized.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is by design -- <code>uv run</code> can't activate the environment persisntely, since it can't modify your shell. So the command you run within <code>uv run</code> has access to the environment (i.e., in <code>uv run hello.py</code>, <code>hello.py</code> has access to the environment), but subsequent commands won't.</p>
