            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Sometimes it can be cumbersome for uv to create an environment per script. This is especially true when involving large dependencies like pytorch, which could take several GB even for a hello world script. It would be great if uv could support shared environment like conda does. Something like:</p>
<p>conda create -n myenv python=3.12 &lt;=&gt; uv venv myproject --python 3.12 --global
conda activate myenv &lt;=&gt; uv activate myenv</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Thanks for your response. While using hard links is a possible workaround, it&#x27;s not an ideal solution—it&#x27;s rather clunky in practice. It would be much better if uv users had more control over how environments are organized. For example, I’d prefer all environments to be stored under ~/.uv/envs/ rather than having a separate .venv directory for each script (i.e. keep code and environment separation). Native support for configurable environment locations would make uv more attractive, especially to conda users.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s not really a &quot;workaround&quot;. I think hard links and some kind of centralized environment management are sort of orthogonal? If the concern is <em>space</em>, then hard links seem like a much better solution since they don&#x27;t <em>require</em> you to share an environment across projects. If the concern instead stems from particularities of your workflow, that&#x27;s different. I think you want <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1495">astral-sh/uv#1495</a> though.</p>
