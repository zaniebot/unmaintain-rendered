            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently it seems <code>uv build</code> includes everything found in the root directory, but it would be great to be able to exclude certain files/directories.</p>
<p>For example, I don't want to bundle these in my <code>sdist</code>/<code>bdist</code> wheel:</p>
<pre><code>**/.DS_Store
**/*.pyc
**/__pycache__
tests
</code></pre>
<p>It would also be great if I could force it to include my <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>.git/refs/HEAD</code> from the source code root dir as I like to ship it inside the sdist (so that I can print more useful debug info including installed commit hash and more).</p>
<p>Should this be accomplished by adding <code>MANIFEST.in</code> support? Or perhaps just some <code>pyproject.toml</code> config options? No strong opinions on my side, up to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for building <code>uv</code>!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv</code> is just a build frontend right now, and the file selection is handled by <code>build-backend</code> specified in <code>pyproject.toml</code>. For example, you can configure <a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#file-selection"><code>hatchling</code></a> (the <code>build-backend</code> in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> generated by <code>uv init --lib</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we're working on our own build backend but right now this is configurable using other tools (the default build backend is <code>setuptools</code> if one is not declared).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One thing you can do is add things you want to exclude to your <code>.gitignore</code> and it looks like <code>uv build</code> will ignore them too?</p>
