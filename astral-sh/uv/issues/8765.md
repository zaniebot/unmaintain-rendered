# precommit-hook: Syntax checker for pyproject.toml - equivalent for "poetry check"

---

_Issue opened by @woutervh on 2024-11-02 14:21_

Using uv 0.4.29

I went through the docs, but I did not find an equivalent for "poetry check" that check for syntax errors in pyproject.toml.


imagine a typo in a required key of pyproject.toml:
```
[project]
nameZ = "foo"

```

resulting in errors like:
````
> 
uv lock
error: Failed to parse: `pyproject.toml`
  Caused by: `pyproject.toml` is using the `[project]` table, but the required `project.name` field is not set
  Caused by: TOML parse error at line 17, column 1
   |
17 | [project]
   | ^^^^^^^^^
missing field `name`

```


Poetry has a check-command that check the syntax of pyproject.toml
```
 > poetry check
The Poetry configuration is invalid:
  - The fields ['name'] are required in package mode.
  - Additional properties are not allowed ('_name' was unexpected)

```

Use-case: precommit-hooks

I've been using `uv lock --dry-run >/dev/null 2>&1` for uses like this, but I agree an explicit command would be a good improvement.
