            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When running <code>uv sync</code> with <code>--no-editable</code>, it seems like we'd expect that we re-install packages that would've been installed as editable (for example, the main package).  Here's a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shellsession">jrosenth ~/example-project % uv init --build-backend uv
Initialized project `example-project`
jrosenth ~/example-project % uv sync --no-editable
Using CPython 3.13.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 1 package in 2ms
      Built example-project @ file:///home/jrosenth/example-project
Prepared 1 package in 15ms
Installed 1 package in 1ms
 + example-project==0.1.0 (from file:///home/jrosenth/example-project)
jrosenth ~/example-project % echo 'print(&quot;changed!&quot;)' &gt;&gt; src/example_project/__init__.py 
jrosenth ~/example-project % uv sync --no-editable                                      
Resolved 1 package in 0.88ms
Audited 1 package in 0.04ms
jrosenth ~/example-project % tail .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example_project/__init__.py 
def main() -&gt; None:
    print(&quot;Hello from example-project!&quot;)
jrosenth ~/example-project % uv sync --no-editable --reinstall-package example-project           
Resolved 1 package in 0.94ms
      Built example-project @ file:///home/jrosenth/example-project
Prepared 1 package in 15ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 0.40ms
Installed 1 package in 1ms
 ~ example-project==0.1.0 (from file:///home/jrosenth/example-project)
jrosenth ~/example-project % tail .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/example_project/__init__.py 
def main() -&gt; None:
    print(&quot;Hello from example-project!&quot;)
print(&quot;changed!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we notice the <code>example-project</code> package didn't sync local changes until <code>--reinstall-package</code> was manually used.</p>
<p>With packages that have <code>path</code> dependencies, this could be a little bit more fishy, we'd expect each of those dependencies to re-build and re-install when <code>--no-editable</code> is applied.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is some sort of caching problem. I guess uv reuses the already built wheel and ignores if there are changes in the project. This issue is still reproducible, if you delete the venv before <code>uv sync</code>!</p>
<p>There are two other workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>change project version</li>
<li>delete venv and use <code>--no-cache</code></li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah interesting. I guess the <code>{ git = { commit = true }</code> cache-keys setting would help for my use case.</p>
<p>However this still behaves pretty unexpected on a dirty repository state. In this case nothing gets updated.</p>
<p>Maybe the correct behavior in case of a dirty repository would be to skip caching for this build?!</p>

<p>I can relate to this as it's been affecting my deployment workflow.</p>
<p>I recently switched from <code>pdm</code> to <code>uv</code> to manage a workspace project with different deployable members. I then use <code>shiv</code> to create a deployable zip-app from a workspace member via a dedicated virtual environment (i.e. not the default <code>.venv</code>, but for the sake of this issue it doesn't really matter), installed via <code>uv sync --no-editable --package &lt;package_to_deploy&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>I found it really surprising that changing the source code (of either the package or any of its in-worspace dependencies) and then re-triggering my deployment pipeline ends up with a stale artifacts that includes none of the changes made, because of the aggressive cache behaviour of <code>uv sync --no-editable</code>.</p>
<p>I can understand <code>pyproject.toml</code>-based caching makes sense for editable installs since changes in <code>src/</code> would be picked up automatically. But that's not the case for non-editable installs, and having <code>uv sync --no-editable</code> not rebuild the sources feels like a broken design to me (or at least it doesn't follow the principle of least surprise).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Or perhaps hash the source files (e.g. by default search for a <code>src/</code> directory and hash its contents), possibly with a configuration option orthogonal to <code>tool.uv.cache-keys</code> for alternative non-default scenarios? (e.g. flat layouts, where <code>src/</code> is not used). In this way you still retain caching for sources that didn't change (which is convenient for a workspace with multiple members).</p>
