            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm trying to have uv manage a python version that I've built locally using python-build-standalone. However, as far as I can tell there is no way to do this.</p>
<p>What I'd like to be able to do is something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv python install path/to/cpython.tar.zst
</code></pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This would be useful for, e.g., using <code>uv</code> in an offline environment where there is no locally hosted mirror.</p>

<p>I had a need to compile python against a TCL where threading was disabled.</p>
<p>Regardless, I was able to solve this by just extracting the <code>python/install</code> folder in the build and pointing <code>uv</code> to that when I made the venv, which works sufficiently well for my use case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@lemming622 you should just set <code>UV_PYTHON_CACHE</code> and then transport that directory to your air-gapped system.</p>

<p>I think this will be our recommendation here. I don't think being able to unpack an arbitrary distribution via uv provides enough value to justify the complexity.</p>
