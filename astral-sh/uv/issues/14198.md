# Feature Request: Convert UV-managed .venv to Standalone Python Virtual Environment

---

_Issue opened by @machenme on 2025-06-22 09:44_

### Summary

**Title**: Feature Request: Convert UV-managed `.venv` to Standalone Python Virtual Environment  

**Body**:  
Currently, when using UV in our project, we encounter a portability issue:  

1. **Problem**:  
   The `.venv` virtual environment created by `uv` is tightly coupled with `uv`'s dependency management system. When the project is shared with other developers who don't have `uv` installed:  
   - The `.venv` cannot be directly activated/used  
   - They must first install `uv` and run `uv sync` to restore dependencies  

2. **Impact**:  
   This adds friction to collaboration and onboarding new team members, as it requires additional setup steps beyond standard Python tooling.  

3. **Proposal**:  
   Add a new feature (e.g., `uv env export --standalone`) that converts a UV-managed `.venv` into a self-contained Python virtual environment with:  
   - All dependencies properly installed in the virtual environment  
   - Standard `activate` scripts preserved  
   - No reliance on `uv` for future use  

4. **Alternatives Considered**:  
   - Manually recreating `.venv` via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (loses UV optimizations)  
   - Documenting `uv sync` as a prerequisite (adds friction)  

5. **Benefits**:  
   - Improves project portability  
   - Aligns with standard Python workflows  
   - Reduces onboarding complexity  

### Example

```bash
# Current (requires uv)
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate

# Proposed (standalone)
uv env export --standalone  # Converts .venv to standalone
source .venv/bin/activate   # Works without uv installed
```

Have you tried creating a relocatable venv? (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--relocatable). Due to constraints in how Python installations and venvs work, we generally consider venvs ephemeral and would recommend that all team members install uv and use `uv sync`.

There are various similar requests for this, e.g.:

thanks. sory my english is not so good. I can now use `uv venv --relocatable --seed`
