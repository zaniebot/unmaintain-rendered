            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently with <code>pipx</code>, I can run:</p>
<pre><code>pipx install black</code></pre>
<p>And I get <code>black</code> on my path.</p>
<p>I can also do:</p>
<pre><code>pipx run black</code></pre>
<p>And it runs <code>black</code>, but doesn't install it to my path.
<code>uv tool install</code> appears to do the same thing as <code>pipx install</code>.
And <code>uvx black</code> appears to do the same as <code>pipx run black</code>.
But I wonder if it would make more sense to mirror the <code>pipx</code> command structure more closely?</p>
<p>Perhaps:</p>
<pre><code>uvx --install black</code></pre>
<p>could be equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>uv tool install black</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to keep the current functionality of <code>uvx black</code> to run `black without installing.</p>
<p>There are also currently no Python packages called <code>install</code>, so you could get away with:</p>
<pre><code>uvx install black</code></pre>
<p>But this is a bit confusing, so maybe don't do that unless you completely adopt the <code>pipx</code> semantics.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you really want to keep the simplicity of <code>uvx black</code>, perhaps you could add a similar shortcut for installing?
Something like:</p>
<pre><code>uvi black</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>uvxi black</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the detailed description!</p>
<p>I don't see a particular value in mirroring <code>pipx</code> closely, we already have <code>uv tool</code> which roughly mirrors this with <code>uv tool run</code> and <code>uv tool install</code>. What's the benefit in a shorter installation invocation? If it's critical in your workflow maybe <code>alias uvi=&quot;uv tool install&quot;</code> makes sense?</p>
<p>Note that we match other tools here, for example, <code>npx</code> also optimizes for running a command quickly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess my thought is that for a tool in the Python ecosystem, it makes sense to match existing Python tools.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>pip install
pip uninstall
pipx install
pipx uninstall
</code></pre>
<p><code>uv</code> is the odd one out here.</p>
<p><code>pipx</code> is a gentle adaptation of my existing mental model. I know how to <code>pip install</code> things. Now I can <code>pipx</code> install things, and it's exactly like <code>pip install</code>, but with isolated environments, etc.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> breaks that mental model by copying a package manager from a different ecosystem.</p>
<p>I understand that you are trying to do a lot with a single tool, so I understand why you need an extra command level in the base <code>uv</code> tool.</p>
<p>But <code>uvx</code> is intended to be a shortcut for this tool.</p>
<p>You ask &quot;What's the benefit in a shorter installation invocation?&quot;</p>
<p>For me, yes it's nice to type a few less characters.
But more importantly, it matches the existing mental model of everyone who's ever used <code>pip</code>.
You just replace <code>pip</code> with <code>pipx</code>, <code>uvx</code>, etc, and carry on with faster installs, dependency isolation, and so on.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, we didn't copy this other package manager. We assessed interfaces like this in every ecosystem and then decided on an interface that makes the most sense for us.</p>
<p>We have to worry about people being confused about if they should use <code>uvx install</code>, <code>uv tool install</code>, <code>uv pip install</code>, and <code>uv add</code> — it doesn't sound worth it.</p>
<p>Sorry, but we have to focus on correctness things right now and even if we were amenable to this it'd be low priority.</p>
