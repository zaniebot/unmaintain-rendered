# `uv pip install` does not recognize `pyproject.toml` in subfolder

_Issue opened by @mikeweltevrede on 2025-07-07 09:11_

### Summary

# Structure
Suppose we have the following folder structure:

```
root
├── subfolder/
│   ├── ...
│   └── pyproject.toml
│   ...
└── pyproject.toml
```

Suppose this is the `pyproject.toml` in the root.
```toml
[project]
name = "test-dependency-groups"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = "<4.0,>=3.9"
dependencies = [
    "requests==2.32.2",
]

[dependency-groups]
docs = [
    "sphinx==8.2.3",
]
```

The subfolder also has the `dev` dependency group:
```toml
dev = [
    "pytest"
]
```

# Issue
Running `uv pip install -r subfolder/pyproject.toml --group=dev` yields `error: The dependency group 'dev' was not found in the project: pyproject.toml`. It seems to look at the `pyproject.toml` in the root, because if I add the `dev` group in the root `pyproject.toml`, it does install the `dev` group:

```shell
$uv pip install -r subfolder/pyproject.toml --group=dev   
Using Python 3.13.4 environment at: venv
Resolved 10 packages in 511ms
Audited 10 packages in 0.41ms
```

# Comparison with requirements file
I wanted to check if maybe the `requirements.txt` file option has the same issue, that it looks at the root. My MRE project does not have a `requirements.txt` file on the root so, if it does this, then it should raise an error. However, providing a requirements.txt file in a subfolder seems to work fine:
```shell
$ uv pip install -r subfolder/requirements.txt
Using Python 3.13.4 environment at: venv
Audited 1 package in 36ms
```
