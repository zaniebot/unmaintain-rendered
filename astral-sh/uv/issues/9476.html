            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I always get an error like <code>.venv\...\Scripts\httpx.exe: Access is denied. (os error 5)</code>. The obvious solution is to run as admin, but in my corporate environment this would require involving IT.</p>
<p>It's unclear how much this is a uv issue vs an httpx issue (<a href="https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/3417">cross posted</a>) vs something else. But I'm suspecting uv somehow because plain <code>pip install httpx</code> in a standard <code>python -m venv .venv</code> environment still works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you install other packages?</p>
<p>I don't really know what's going on here, it seems specific to your system. We use <code>httpx</code> in a lot of our tests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I can install many packages, and httpx is the only one where I've encountered the issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps your antivirus is flagging the executable for some reason? There's not anything we can do to help with that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right, maybe. Another peculiarity here is that if I simply rerun the command (either in the context of <code>uv add</code> or <code>uv sync</code>), it succeeds.</p>
