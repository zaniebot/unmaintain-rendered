# Can we use uv for dependency management like poetry

---

_Issue opened by @YeonwooSung on 2024-02-22 14:25_

Just curious, is it possible to use uv for managing and updating the dependencies and dependencies of dependencies just like poetry so that we could replace the poetry with uv?

Not yet! This is on our roadmap.

Ah, nice.
Thanks for the reply.

I will look forward to that day that we could replace the poetry with uv

FYI there is a discussion about standardizing lock files that are not Poetry-like but more pip-tools style at https://discuss.python.org/t/lock-files-again-but-this-time-w-sdists/46593/ .

@zanieb Is the roadmap publicly documented somewhere?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-03-12 16:53_

Not yet, just in the issue tracker.

because I did not find it in the tracker: is there an issue for platform independent lock files? Will uv wait for the finalization of the mentioned PEP?

What is the currently recommended worklow for managing/freezing dependencies?

> What is the currently recommended worklow for managing/freezing dependencies?

I've been doing this:

```console
uv pip compile --generate-hashes -o requirements.lock pyproject.toml
```

Basically takes the dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and pins them in `requirements.lock`.

Then install from `requirements.lock` directly.

We are implementing platform independent lock files and will do so before waiting for a standard to be established. I can't find an issue either, @BurntSushi do you know of one / want to make one?

I believe it's here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2679

The lock file work is being tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3347 and we're actively adding experimental Poetry-style commands such as `add`, `remove`, `sync`, and `run`.
