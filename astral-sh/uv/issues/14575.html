<p>Running:</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv add &quot;mcp[cli]&quot;
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies for split (python_full_version == '3.9.*'):
  ╰─▶ Because the requested Python version (&gt;=3.9) does not satisfy Python&gt;=3.10 and your project depends on mcp[cli],
      we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: While the active Python version is 3.13, the resolution failed for other Python versions supported by your
      project. Consider limiting your project's supported Python versions using `requires-python`.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking
        and syncing.
</code></pre>
<p>The hint text is rendered by us; the help text is rendered by Miette. And they appear at different levels of indentation, with different styling (<code>hint</code> is bold, <code>help</code> is not).</p>
