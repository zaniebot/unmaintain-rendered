            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>What I am trying to do is to get the path to the virtual environment for a script, so that I can use that virtual environment in my editor (neovim) so I get autocomplete on 3rd party libraries. <code>uv sync --script</code> was recently added in #11361 , and in the output you can see the path to the venv. But I am wondering if there is a command to just get the path to the venv without syncing?</p>
<p>I tried looking around in the docs if this feature is already suppoted but couldn't find anything.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's not a way to get the path right now.</p>
<p>I'd be supportive of <code>uv python find --script &lt;name&gt;</code>, though I think you'd need to sync first? Maybe there's another interface we could do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>uv python find</code> sounds good. Maybe return an error if the environment has not been created? Or maybe create if it it doesn't exist, but that sounds like <code>uv sync</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The &quot;best&quot; solution for this seems like <code>uv sync --script foo.py --dry-run</code> with a (not yet implemented) JSON output format?</p>
