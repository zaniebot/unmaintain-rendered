<pre><code>$ echo &quot;apache-airflow[all]&quot; | uv pip compile - --only-binary apache-beam
error: Failed to download and build: apache-beam==2.2.0

<p>But a solution exists because if I put a lower bound on <code>apache-beam</code> so that my environment can always get a wheel it can resolve:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo -e &quot;apache-airflow[all]\napache-beam&gt;=2.47&quot; | uv pip compile -

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IIRC, <code>--only-binary</code> doesn't affect the resolution -- it just disallows building from source. Like, we don't <em>skip</em> versions that lack binaries, we just error if you try to build one. I don't know if this was intentional, @zanieb would know when they're back from vacation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, pip definitely uses this to determine what is resolved: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/development/architecture/upgrade-options/#controlling-what-gets-considered</p>
<p>I wouldn't of normally tried this but this comment indicated it would work like that with uv but I can't reproduce resolving it: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1560#issuecomment-1949626187</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this sounds unintentional. I think <code>--no-binary</code> is taken into consideration during resolutions i.e. we mark distributions with only wheels as unusable but I don't think we don't do the same for <code>--only-binary</code> right now? I could take a look at this as part of (or after) #1298</p>
