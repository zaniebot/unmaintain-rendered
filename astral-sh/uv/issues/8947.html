Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>I tried these commands in a folder with an apostrophe and a space.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Documenting the background on shell escaping:</p>
<p>We want our <code>activate</code> script to support basically any posix shell. There's two kind of quotes: Single and double quotes. In bash, single quotes must not contain another single quote, you can't even escape it (https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash under &quot;QUOTING&quot;). Double quotes have escaping rules different from shell to shell, which we can't do. bash has <code>$'\''</code>, but that's not universal enough.</p>
<p>As a workaround, we can go through printf:</p>
<pre><code>VIRTUAL_ENV=$(printf '/home/konsti/projects/uv/Testing\047s/.venv')
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You could maybe use what shlex suggests (python stdlib shlex), both <code>''</code> and <code>&quot;&quot;</code> strings.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(shlex.quote(&quot;/home/Testing's/.venv&quot;))
'/home/Testing'&quot;'&quot;'s/.venv'
</code></pre>
<p>That works in at least bash and dash</p>
