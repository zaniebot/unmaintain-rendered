# Document virtualenv discovery

In the README. We should also mention that you can use Puffin with a virtualenv outside of wherever it's installed by setting `VIRTUAL_ENV`.

We should document Python version discovery in general probably?

Oh, we actually already have this in a section called `### Python discovery`. Do you want to edit it with any changes you've made?

Oh wow I searched for "Python version" and missed that. I think it looks okay so far. Could be a little clearer on behavior when an alternate version is provided, I'll follow up on that.

I will do this, but will request review for correctness.
