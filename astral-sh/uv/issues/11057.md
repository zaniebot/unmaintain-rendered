# --no-modify-path has been deprecated

_Issue opened by @ohmydds on 2025-01-29 11:14_

### Summary

I checked `--help` prior to installing and ran the install.sh script with the `--no-modify-path` flag which produced the following warning about that flag being deprecated:
```
$ ./install.sh -v --no-modify-path
--no-modify-path has been deprecated; please set UV_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1 in the environment
downloading uv 0.5.25 aarch64-apple-darwin
  from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.5.25/uv-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
  to /var/folders/j4/938xc6yx00v6kfjv8nzfb0v80000gs/T/tmp.p5NwOasNJk/input.tar.gz
no checksums to verify
installing to /path/to/.local/bin
  uv
  uvx
everything's installed!
```

Should the `--help` contents be updated to reflect the change?

Do you mind filing this on https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist instead? The installer script is generated by `cargo-dist`.
