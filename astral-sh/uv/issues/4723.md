# Cannot install editable if written as absolute path

_Issue opened by @yajo on 2024-07-02 07:18_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


Consider I already have a venv activated, and the CWD is `/home/yajo/my-env`:

```shell
echo "-e /home/yajo/my-custom-pkg" > requirements.txt
uv pip sync requirements.txt
error: Failed to build editables
  Caused by: Source distribution not found at: /home/yajo/my-env/"/home/yajo/my-custom-pkg"
```

It's trying to interpret the editable requirement as a relative path always.

Huh, this works as expected for me. Are you on Windows?
