            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv version: <code>uv 0.4.30 (61ed2a236 2024-11-04)</code></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/localstack/awscli-local?tab=readme-ov-file#Limitations"><code>awslocal</code></a> on Windows doesn't seem to work properly with <code>uv tool run --from awscli-local awslocal</code></p>
<pre><code>The executable `awslocal` was not found.
warning: An executable named `awslocal` is not provided by package `awscli-local`.
The following executables are provided by `awscli-local`:
- awslocal
- awslocal.bat
Consider using `uv tool run --from awscli-local &lt;EXECUTABLE_NAME&gt;` instead.
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>awslocal</code> file is actually a script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!python.exe

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Thin wrapper around the &quot;aws&quot; command line interface (CLI) for use
with LocalStack.
...
</code></pre>
<p>while for other tools it looks like a <code>.exe</code> is installed, which seems to work with <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>This is probably caused by the fact that they provide the entry scripts as a path to file, not as <code>module:function</code>.</p>
<p>Using the provided <code>.bat</code> file does work, but it requires providing a different executable name based on the current OS and it looks like python detaches from the terminal when run from a batch script.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether this is a problem with awslocal or uv. I thought I'd report it here first since this usage of setuptools seems legit.</p>
