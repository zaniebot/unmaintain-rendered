            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd love to see a way to directly create a venv from a script's inline metadata. Perhaps a <code>uv sync --script myscript.py</code> option would work.</p>
<p>The use case is to simplify setting up development environments when working in a repository with one or more scripts with inline metadata. Commonly, IDE's have support for utilizing a project's .venv when resolving import paths and running dev tooling. This is easy to configure if your repository is a standard Python project. However, for a directory of scripts (which may each have distinct dependencies), venvs must be manually configured before working on any particular script in order to gain the benefit of these tools.</p>
<p>My current work around is to define a top level pyproject.toml in virtual project mode with a union of all the scripts dependencies. However, this is error prone in a repo with more than a trivial number of scripts. Also, it's possible to run into version conflicts between script dependency requirements.</p>
<p>Being able to quickly sync the .venv with a scripts requirements would give a quick and easy way to ensure a compatible IDE experience when working in project-less repositories.</p>
