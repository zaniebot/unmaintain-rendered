<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


### Issue

A Dockerfile copies a `.venv` from an earlier build stage that contains `uv` generated stubs, then one of the stubs is executed and errors out with a bug typically associated with 32 bit programs running on 64 bit platforms.

**Dockerfile**:

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/server:10.0.20348.1970 AS build
USER ContainerAdministrator

ARG PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
ARG PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=1

RUN powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"
RUN choco install -y --no-progress python --version=3.11.9
RUN choco install -y --no-progress git cmake

WORKDIR C:/

RUN powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
RUN uv venv --seed
RUN C:/.venv/scripts/activate.bat
ENV UV_LINK_MODE=copy
RUN git config --system core.longpaths true
RUN uv pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/hiddenswitch/ComfyUI.git
# ...


FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/server:10.0.20348.1970 AS final
USER ContainerAdministrator

# Copy our pre-built Python site-packages
COPY --link --from=build C:/Python311 C:/Python311
COPY --link --from=build C:/.venv C:/.venv

RUN powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"
RUN choco install --no-progress  -y vcredist140 vcredist2015 vcredist2017 directx
SHELL ["cmd", "/S", "/C"]
RUN powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
RUN setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\ContainerAdministrator\.cargo\bin;C:\.venv\bin;C:\Python311;C:\Python311\Scripts"
RUN "comfyui --quick-test-for-ci --cpu --cwd C:/
```

This will error out with something like:
```
...
Step 53/56 : RUN "comfyui --quick-test-for-ci --cpu --cwd /comfyui-init-workdir --extra-model-paths /extra_model_paths_in_image.yaml"
...
> Could not build image: container 3b12160c8f0f4e72ae971795746823ab846ec8fdd64ae36b05b8841106e9bbfe encountered an error during hcs::System::CreateProcess: failure in a Windows system call: This version of %1 is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher. (0xd8)
```

which is unexpected

**Notes**

- `uv 0.4.8 (956cadd1a 2024-09-09)`
- Enabling bytecode compilation will cause a different exception. So there's some kind of sensitivity to the environment.
- This does not reproduce with Docker Desktop on Windows 2022 10.0.20348.2227, Docker version 25.0.3, build f417435.
- This is occurring on Windows 2022 10.0.20348.1787, Docker version 23.0.0. However, this may be a red herring; the platform where this is occurring may have caches that are interacting in an interesting way.
