            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies</p>
<p>I find inline script metadata difficult to adopt because it forces all my users to run the script with a compatible runner (e.g., uv or pipx). For backwards compatibility with <code>pip install</code> method, a tradition requirements file is still necessary.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ uv pip compile --script example.py -o requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh"># Users without uv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python example.py
</code></pre>
<p>Other use cases involve, not relying on uv's venv management. For example, you have many scripts with inline metadata, but want 1 venv to be compatible with all:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip compile --scripts scripts/*.py -o requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>My title could be more specific, but I am opening it up to <code>uv run example.py</code> automatically creating a <code>uv.lock</code>. This could be a future once we have a standard lock file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's some overlap with #6318, though I guess you're also asking here for a way to install the script dependencies outside of uv. I'm not sure if we're likely to support that since it kind of defeats the purpose of the PEP.</p>

<p>I feel it---I have the same sentiment back when the PEP was designed. After the fact, I now wish the PEP went further with addressing reproducibility (no good ideas until we have a standard lock file)</p>
