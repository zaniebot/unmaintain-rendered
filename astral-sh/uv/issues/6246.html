<p>With <code>pip</code> you can use <code>--implementation py</code> to only select packages which don't have platform dependent binary content. I couldn't find a way to reproduce this behavior with <code>uv</code>. See https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/</p>
<p>Would be great if this could be supported in <code>uv</code> for the relevant operations as well. I guess that would be <code>uv pip install</code> and maybe <code>uv pip compile</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did a little a bit of experimentation (see #6553)</p>
<p>For my actual use case, to select only pure Python wheels (implementation, platform and abi agnostic), I just learned that you have to pass <code>--implementation py --abi none --platform any</code> to pip to get the expected behavior. Apperently it is perfectly fine to provide a wheel with a <code>py310-none-win_amd64</code> tag - for example if it is a pure Python library with embedded .exe or .dll file.</p>
<p>Maybe uv could provide a shortcut flag for getting this kind of behavior, <code>--pure-wheels</code> or something like that. I think I would be able to provide a PR for this part.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is the general use case to define implementation, abi and platform to get specific wheels. In pip you can define multiple abis <strong>and</strong> multiple platforms. I do not really see a real world use case for the latter part, but specifying multiple abis could make sense. For example if you want to install a Linux compatible wheel you could allow different manylinux abis.</p>
<p>I guess for the second part it needs more time and input from other to define a precise specification. It could require a lot of internal refactoring to select multiple abis from a command line argument.</p>
