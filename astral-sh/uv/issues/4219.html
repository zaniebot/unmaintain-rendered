            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that this has a subtle problem. Using <code>*</code> causes git to ignore the <code>.gitgnore</code> file itself! This should more correctly have the contents</p>
<pre><code>*
!.gitignore
</code></pre>
<p>That way everything is ignored <em>except</em> the <code>.gitignore</code> file. Otherwise, the <code>.gitignore</code> file will not be added to the repository. This is arguably not a problem since either way it will be ignored, but I think it misses the intent. Also, if someone somehow deletes the <code>.gitignore</code> file, it won't show up in git status output, but you'll now see the whole <code>.venv</code> directory as untracked which could potentially mistakenly get added.</p>
