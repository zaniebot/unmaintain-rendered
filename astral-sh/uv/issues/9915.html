            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a console script which invokes a code that expects environments variables containing a dot (.) in their names to be passed. Sadly unlike &quot;/bin/bash&quot;, /bin/sh does not support environment variable names in that format. It would be really nice if you could respect the &quot;SHELL&quot; env var to override the shebang in the relocatable console_scripts.
This is the relevant line of code:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My understand is that the shebang is consistent with rest of the ecosystem, though I could be wrong. Are there other tools that use <code>SHELL</code> here? Separately, I don't think it's desirable for us to maintain these shebangs for multiple shell dialects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Doesn't seem like /bin/sh is used anywhere as a const in the rest of the ecosystem. In my case the /bin/sh shebang causes environment variables the code I am running depends on to be ignored. Changing the shebang to /bin/bash just fixes it but I can't control it because when using a relocatable venv it is automatically created with this shebang. @zanieb I understand that using /bin/sh allows the console script to be executed on every posix machine, but some applications rely on a specific shell dialect to execute the process. If you maybe have a solution how to solve it without manually editing the console scripts using sed, yet still making the venv relocatable it would be great (:</p>

<p>Can you provide an example? The code you link to has a reference to pip which uses <code>/bin/sh</code> as well</p>
