Doing this efficiently is not trivial though and it does require iterating over _all_ available versions for every package (often, we can skip most of them).

Perhaps some heuristic whereby we only look at the number of versions if it's... pretty small?

I realized we can't actually do this because we don't have all metadata available for all packages at once. We'd have to wait for all packages to be fetched. Unclear if that's worth it 🤔 It might be?

(We can't answer this until we have a more extensive benchmarking setup, IMO.)
