# Support for arbitrary targets in uv build frontend

---

_Issue opened by @Panacea729 on 2025-07-07 21:41_

### Summary

Hatch supports building for an arbitrary target (https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/plugins/builder/reference/). I want to use the hatchling build backend with uv but need the ability to build a custom target using `uv build`. Unfortunately it seems the uv build frontend is hardcoded to call `hatchling.build.build_wheel`/`hatchling.build.build_sdist`. I don't know rust but that seems to be how this works: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/dedced32657e9db1e5561798da47b35a0ac42b64/crates/uv-build-frontend/src/lib.rs#L759

I personally am using the hatch frontend and was considering moving to uv for better workspace support, but I require to continue using the custom build targets we've created for hatch.

I understand that it is possible to use a hatch build hook to generate custom artifacts from the wheel/sdist, but it would be much cleaner to forego the wheel and sdist distrubution altogether to use our custom target(s).

Additionally/optionally, it could be helpful to allow different build-dependencies depending on the target.

I imagine a coordinating issue should be made in hatch/hatchling (for hatchling to expose this --target functionality). I've held off on doing that without garnering some support here first. This will require some cooperation from hatchling if it's intended to continue using the `hatchling.build.build_` functions (instead of something like `python -m hatch build`) since it seems as though `hatchling` does not expose the ability to use custom targets in `build.py`.

Thanks for sharing your use-case!

`build_wheel` and `build_sdist` are a part of the PEP 517 standard for build backends. It seems pretty unlikely that we'll add hatch-specific options for `uv build` to allow targeting other build hooks.
