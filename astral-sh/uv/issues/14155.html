            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm confused about what seems like contradictory behavior between uv's automatic syncing and optional-dependencies handling. The documentation and observed behavior appear to conflict with each other.</p>
<p>From the documentation (<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/">Locking and syncing</a>):</p>
<p>From my understanding, commands like <code>uv run</code> will automatically invoke <code>uv lock</code> and <code>uv sync</code> before executing the command.</p>
<p>Syncing is <strong>&quot;exact&quot;</strong> by default, which means it will remove any packages that are not present in the lockfile, and because uv does not sync extras by default, optional dependencies will all be removed.</p>
<p>However, my observed behavior:
When using uv add --optional <extra-name> <package> to add dependencies to optional-dependencies, the package gets added to the current environment immediately, even though optional-dependencies are not supposed to be synced by default. Moreover, after executing a python script with <code>uv run xxx.py</code>, the optional dependencies are still not removed. It's only removed if I explicitly call <code>uv sync</code>. (I have some confusions about this command as well. It's mentioned in the document that this command only syncs the environment, but it actually runs <code>uv lock</code> first?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv run</code> performs an inexact sync by default, unlike <code>uv sync</code>. <code>uv run</code> doesn't <em>quite</em> invoke <code>uv lock</code> and <code>uv sync</code> before running the command, it performs a lock and sync using internal abstractions, not that exact public interface.</p>
