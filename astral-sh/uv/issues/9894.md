# NEW COMMAND: ```uvnb```

_Issue opened by @nbiish on 2024-12-14 11:52_

I really like the mojo🔥 option in the notebook lab so I made my own script to play with notebooks faster🔥

...marimo has it's place but **_uvnb_** could be so much better, faster, and more secure...

```bash
uvnb
 ``` 
RUNS THE FOLLOWING:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
#
#
# MOJO    0.0 **shock and happiness**
#
#

uv venv --seed
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```

Sorry, I don't think we'll be pursing this soon.

I'm not sure I follow how it connects to mojo?
