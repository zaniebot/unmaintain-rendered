<p>Hi, first of all—thank you for the great work on uv. I’ve been using it happily, but I encountered a very strange issue yesterday and I’m hoping to understand if it might be related to uv.</p>
<p>I’m using uv with multiple index URLs configured in my pyproject.toml like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.pip]
extra-index-url = [&quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot;, &quot;https://pypi.private.domain/&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Normally everything works fine, but yesterday(specifically from PST 1:00 ~ 7:00), both of the following commands suddenly started failing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">uv pip compile
uv pip install
</code></pre>
<p>However, running pip install directly (outside of uv) worked without any issues.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this might be a bug in a specific version of uv==0.6.x, but I found that no version of uv worked, until I downgraded all the way to uv==0.5.31, which seemed to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The most confusing part is that I had been using uv==0.6.5 just fine before, but after the issue started, even rolling back to that version didn’t help. Only switching to 0.5.31 fixed things.</p>
<p>Even more mysteriously, I re-ran a GitHub Action workflow just now that had been failing yesterday—and now it passes without any changes on my end.</p>
<p>Since pip install always worked while uv pip install failed, I’m quite curious what could have caused this, and whether uv’s index handling might be involved.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insights!</p>
