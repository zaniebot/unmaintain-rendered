# feat: add a command to search for installable packages (similar to npm search)

---

_Issue opened by @EGQM on 2025-11-11 03:03_

### Summary

It would be a great improvement to add a command that lists all available packages for vu tool install. A similar feature exists in other tools, like npm search, which greatly improves user experience by making the ecosystem more discoverable.
`uv tool list` shows what's installed, but how do I see what I can install?

### Example

_No response_
