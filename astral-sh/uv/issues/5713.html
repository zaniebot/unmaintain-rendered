            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Running tests in CI is now &gt;8 minutes (and was previously &lt;1 minute). We've done a lot to optimize this previously, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/889</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3044</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/875</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/887</li>
<li>#3508</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1830</li>
<li>#1832</li>
<li>#2933</li>
<li>... more examples coming</li>
</ul>
<p>But, CI time is always growing as we add more features and coverage. This is a tracking issue to improve the situation and discuss sources of slowness.</p>

<p>At least for python, maybe worth using something like https://github.com/hauntsaninja/nginx_pypi_cache and saving a copy of the cache as a github cache and reloading it. I actually use it locally a lot to speed up tests. Not sure how it would perform in CI.</p>

<p>edit: I created a published image at https://github.com/astral-sh/nginx_pypi_cache/pkgs/container/nginx_pypi_cache we can use in our jobs if someone wants to trial it in Ubuntu (or locally even, to start)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Linux is acceptably fast now. We're at the limit for macOS machine size without going to alternative runner providers. There are larger Windows runners, maybe I should test one (#5890). Cost may be a problem at some point, alternative runner providers may be cheaper (often saying things like a 2x cost reduction).</p>

<p>admittedly adding bazel would significantly increase the complexity though 🙀</p>

<p>this is definitely true - i've seen it improving the CI time drastically at the same time though so maybe something to consider down the line if there's no other option...</p>
