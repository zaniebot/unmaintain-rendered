# Problem installing fontawesomepro package from the extra fontawesome package index

---

_Issue opened by @jacklinke on 2024-10-09 02:39_

I am trying to install the fontawesomepro in my DOCKERFILE (in a docker compose project). I am installing the latest stable version of `uv`.

Per [the fontawesome docs](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/use-with/python-django), which have worked well for years using `pip`, the requirements-fontawesomepro.txt file should look like:

```
--extra-index-url https://dl.fontawesome.com/TOKEN/fontawesome-pro/python/simple/
fontawesomepro==version_number
```

This does not work with `uv`, but none of the recommended approaches in the docs or in dozens of past Issues seem to work either. In each attempt to get fontawesome to install, I have gotten variations on the error messages below.

```

Thanks for all the details. From

> Encountered an unexpected header (actual: 0x6064b50, expected: 0x2014b50)

It sounds like something is actually wrong with the zipfile? Or that the upstream library we're using can't handle it?

I can't investigate further since the file itself is private.

It is so strange, because I can install any of the various available versions of this package via plain old `pip` and have not ever had a problem. I can also install all of my PyPI-based dependencies with no issues.

Is there any analysis I could do on a downloaded copy of the wheel that might provide more insight? Alternately, if I got permission from the FontAwesome folks to send you a copy of the wheel, could someone at Astral take a look at it? 

---

One of the lines in the error is "Failed to fetch wheel" (before it says "Failed to extract archive" and "Encountered an unexpected header").  That makes me wonder if it's even getting the actual *.whl file to begin with.

---

Also, the only other Issue with a similar error is https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3687. That one seems to be due to a credentials issue. While I don't have the same `DEBUG: redirecting` statement, the end result seems to be the same.

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-10-09 13:45_

We unzip the wheel while streaming the request, so fetching fails if extraction fails.

Can you run with `RUST_LOG=trace`? That will produce a lot more logs.

@zanieb  Any other ideas or things I could try?

I am really hoping to start using uv for my project, but this is a major obstacle.

---

_Comment by @jacklinke on 2024-10-30 02:50_

If I do either of:

- `uv pip install fontawesomepro --index-url https://dl.fontawesome.com/MYTOKENHERE/fontawesome-pro/python/simple/`
- `uv pip install fontawesomepro --extra-index-url https://dl.fontawesome.com/MYTOKENHERE/fontawesome-pro/python/simple/`

the command fails the same as the examples given previously.

But...

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**If I manually download the wheel and `uv pip install "fontawesomepro-6.6.0-py3-none-any.whl"`, it succeeds.**
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Likewise, if I use another local package version, `uv pip install "fontawesomepro-6.5.0-py3-none-any.whl"`, it works just fine.

_(But I don't want to put the 300mb wheel into my git repo 😲)_

---

The fact that it works if the wheel is local makes me think it's an issue with how the file is being streamed/downloaded when using an index.

As @zanieb mentioned:

> We unzip the wheel while streaming the request, so fetching fails if extraction fails.

And...

> It sounds like something is actually wrong with the zipfile? Or that the upstream library we're using can't handle it?

Does `uv` use a different library for unzipping a local wheel vs unzipping while streaming a request from a remote index? 🤔


---

_Comment by @jacklinke on 2024-10-31 21:08_

@zanieb could it be an issue with how large the Wheel is? Fontawesome pro is about 330 MB, which is a lot larger than most wheels.

I've verified on two wheels for this package that the files are good, valid zip files.

I know nearly nothing when it comes to rust, but I did some digging around in the hopes that I could find something useful for narrowing the problem down and helping the `uv` maintainers with as much context as possible about this issue. Hope this is helpful.

---

It looks like `uv` first started unzipping while streaming the wheels in #1157. At that point, `uv` started using the `async_zip` (aka: rs-async-zip) in a repo owned by @charliermarsh, forked from @Majored.

The error message I'm seeing, "Encountered an unexpected header (actual: 0x6064b50, expected: 0x2014b50).", is defined in [error.rs](https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip/blob/main/src/error.rs#L65) in that package's repository with the error `UnexpectedHeaderError`.


If I am understanding the flow of the code correctly, this is what's happening:

In `CentralDirectoryReader` ([src/base/read/cd.rs](https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip/blob/011b24604fa7bc223daaad7712c0694bac8f0a87/src/base/read/cd.rs#L44C13-L44C35)), when unzipping a streaming file we iterate through each `CentralDirectoryEntry`. We expect to either get the `CDH_SIGNATURE` for a `CentralDirectoryEntry`, or if we get [`EOCDR_SIGNATURE`]((https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip/blob/011b24604fa7bc223daaad7712c0694bac8f0a87/src/spec/consts.rs#L16)) we consider that `OK` and end the loop. Otherwise we return an `UnexpectedHeaderError`.

The problem is that after the last `CentralDirectoryEntry`, instead of `EOCDR_SIGNATURE`, we are seeing [`ZIP64_EOCDR_SIGNATURE`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip/blob/011b24604fa7bc223daaad7712c0694bac8f0a87/src/spec/consts.rs#L29C32) - which is perfectly valid for a zip64 file - but we return an `UnexpectedHeaderError` even though a perfectly good `EOCDR_SIGNATURE` is just a few bytes further away.

From the zipfile spec:

### 4.3.6
   Overall .ZIP file format:

      [local file header 1]
      [encryption header 1]
      [file data 1]
      [data descriptor 1]
      . 
      .
      .
      [local file header n]
      [encryption header n]
      [file data n]
      [data descriptor n]
      [archive decryption header] 
      [archive extra data record] 
      [central directory header 1]
      .
      .
      .
      [central directory header n]
      [zip64 end of central directory record]  <-- What cd.rs finds after last CentralDirectoryEntry
      [zip64 end of central directory locator] 
      [end of central directory record]  <-- What cd.rs expects after last CentralDirectoryEntry

---

I can't provide the whole file, but here is the beginning and end of the wheel. You can clearly see the last central directory header signature, the zip64 end of central directory record signature, and the end of central directory record signature.

I would appreciate guidance on next steps. If my understanding of the problem above is correct, there are several things that **might** be appropriate:

- Request `uv` consider adding an option to prevent unzipping while streaming or maybe if unzipping while streaming fails, download the file and try to unzip locally.
- Submit an Issue to https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip
- Submit an Issue to the repo `rs-async-zip` is forced from https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip

Thank you for digging into the details again! It's really helpful for pushing things forward.

@charliermarsh will probably have the best recommendation regarding next steps. No need to open an issue in our fork, but it does sound worth opening one upstream since they're presumably the expert.

@charliermarsh did you have any thoughts on this one?

I [opened an issue at the upstream](https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip/issues/151), but have heard nothing further.

Thanks @jacklinke. The context is very helpful. I will try to take a look when I can -- just juggling a lot and have a few other issues ahead of this in my queue.
