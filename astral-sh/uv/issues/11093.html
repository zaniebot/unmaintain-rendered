            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I ❤️ uv and want to be able to just run <code>uv sync</code> in all of my projects and bring along all of the dev dependencies (let's assume no <code>uv.lock</code> exists yet).  However, in some cases, I also need to work with others who don't use uv and want to be able to run the classic <code>pip install -e .[dev]</code>... and if I'm not mistaken, pip does not yet support PEP 735? (https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12963)</p>
<p>My question is how best to accomplish this.  I know I can just use <code>uv sync --extra dev</code> (but would like to just use <code>uv sync</code>).</p>
<p>Would this be the best way to accomplish this until pip supports dependency groups?</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [&quot;pytest&quot;, &quot;ruff&quot;]   # dev deps still go in the dev extra for now

[dependency-groups]
dev = [&quot;my-package[dev]&quot;]  # reference dev extra in dependency-groups.dev

[tool.uv.sources]
my-package = { workspace = true }   # declare local source
</code></pre>
<p>other tips?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We'll likely support <code>--group</code> in the <code>uv pip</code> CLI soon, but in the interim, what you could do is <code>uv export --dev -o requirements.txt</code>, and then have non-uv users <code>uv pip install requirements.txt</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thanks for that tip as well!  The constraints I'd <em>like</em> to have here (if possible) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>i don't want to have to add/maintain <code>requirements.txt</code> in addition to <code>project.dependencies</code> / <code>project.optional-dependencies</code></li>
<li>i'm aiming for <code>python -m pip install -e .[dev]</code> (no uv installed at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>as a last question, do you have any caution <em>against</em> the pattern I suggested above? (and then feel free to close this)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What you have above seems reasonable... The downsides are just:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>dev</code> extra would be part of the published package metadata (if relevant), whereas a dependency group would not.</li>
<li>Users that install with <code>uv pip</code> won't benefit from <code>uv.lock</code>, and so won't have the same constraints applied to their install.</li>
</ol>
<p>But otherwise, I think you're on the right track in understanding the various options.</p>
