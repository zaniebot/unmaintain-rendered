            <div class="timeline-body"><p>os.pidfd_open has been supported since python 3.9 and kernel 5.2, but despite this recent python versions pulled by uv don't support os.pidfd_open. It would be nice if either upstream provided builds with <code>os.pidfd_open</code> enabled, or if uv provided more sources for python builds, or if uv had the option to build python from source.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding the option to build python from source would be nice for developers looking for maximum performance from their python version as well. Using https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone is much quicker to download and run for a one-off python execution, so ideal for the default uv behavior, but for somebody who wants to use the best python possible for his system and does not mind waiting a bit longer for it to build, the option for a source compiled python (like pyenv does) should be an improvement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't have plans to build Python from source on the user's machine, there are other tools better suited for that. We're already investing a great deal into the standalone builds, which <em>are</em> pretty heavily optimized. I'd prefer to invest my time into weak symbols upstream as suggested by Greg in https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/issues/193#issuecomment-1751971155</p>
