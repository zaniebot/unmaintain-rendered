# Filter Python executables on Windows by Python version metadata

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-06-09 16:58_

See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18550#issuecomment-2956350021

Windows Python executables seem to have the Python version embedded in their metadata. This may be faster than querying the Python interpreter to get its version, which would speed up Python discovery on Windows when a specific version is requested.

See https://docs.rs/pelite/latest/pelite/resources/version_info/struct.VersionInfo.html

I don't know if we want to add that as a dependency, but the `object` crate (which we use for `PeFile` currently) doesn't seem to include resource parsing.

I took a shot at this in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13948 but ran into problems and don't have a Windows setup to debug easily.
