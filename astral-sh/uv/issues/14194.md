### Summary

Till uv 0.7.13, according to the changelogs, `--dry-run` is already added to several (sub)commands:

| Version | (Sub)command(s) |
|--------|--------|
| [0.1.18](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/changelogs/0.1.x.md#0118) | `uv pip install` |
| [0.4.27](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/changelogs/0.4.x.md#0427) | `uv lock` |
| [0.5.6](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/changelogs/0.5.x.md#056) | `uv pip uninstall` |

Similar to `uv pip install` and `uv pip uninstall`, it would be helpful if both `uv tool install` and `uv tool uninstall` can accept a `--dry-run` flag. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6314#issuecomment-2504694125 once mentioned adding support for `uv tool install --dry-run`.

Perhaps `uv tool upgrade` also needs an `--dry-run`.

Open issues which request adding `--dry-run` to other uv (sub)commands:

- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12387
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9828
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3021 (`uv pip sync --dry-run` was mentioned in discussion)
