            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for <code>uv</code>, it's very impressive! :)</p>
<p>Our build system creates and manages a virtual environment that's used for later parts of the build, and to host editably-installed packages that have console script entry points.</p>
<p>To remove complexity (environment variables, python versions, PATH shenanigans) and potential ambiguity, we try to avoid modally entering the virtual environment via <code>activate</code>, and instead invoke <code>pip</code> via the venv's python:</p>
<p><code>/path/to/my/venv/bin/python -m pip ...</code></p>
<p>(We do this on mac/linux and also windows, but I'm just using the non-windows forms here)</p>
<p>Right now, <code>uv pip</code> seems to require running inside of a modally-activated venv. It would be very handy if we could give <code>uv pip</code> an explicit path to the virtual environment directory, similar to how <code>uv venv</code> can be given an explicit python interpreter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! Thank you :)</p>
<p>You can provide the virtual environment path via the <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> variable or, if you run <code>python -m uv</code>, we'll automatically detect the virtual environment (#1504).</p>
<p>We may consider adding this as a CLI option too, I think there are a couple other similar issues about that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the quick response, and sorry I missed the <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> variable; if I can set that before spawning <code>uv</code> that'll totally work for us. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>python -m uv</code> is interesting and I think even nicer; would it be interesting to have an option like <code>--seed</code> for <code>uv venv</code> that also installed <code>uv</code> into the new venv? That would handle bootstrapping pretty elegantly, I think.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm yeah it seems like we should probably stub <code>uv</code> into the environment by default so that you can use <code>python -m uv</code>. I'm not exactly sure what that would look like.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If the Python <code>uv</code> package uses uv functionality by bundling the executable, it might be nice to have a venv-creation bootstrap copy-in the <code>uv</code> executable that invoked the <code>venv</code> command. That would be nice for pinning versions etc; for a single-file executable like this, we'd version it by just checking it into git.</p>
