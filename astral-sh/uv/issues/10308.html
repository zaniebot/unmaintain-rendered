            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When a registry distribution lacks hashes, we attempt to generate them. However, we only generate such a hash for the currently-selected wheel. So we're only generating hash for one distribution, rather than for each distribution for a given package-version. The original motivation here was to include hashes for <code>--find-links</code> entries. But to do this <em>right</em>, we need to hash all the distributions for package-version. I don't know if this is actually worth doing, so I'm somewhat inclined to stop generating hashes here entirely and say that we need the registry to provide them.</p>
