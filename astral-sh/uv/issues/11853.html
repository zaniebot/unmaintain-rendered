            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>At the moment I see a two ways of HTTPS authentication for private package registries. Either by storing the username/password/token somewhere, or by directly including it in the URL. My idea/request is to have a mode where the user gets prompted for username/password instead. I have looked around a bit, I can see a few possible options to achieve this and I would be willing to work on such a feature if there is no specific reason not to have such a functionality.</p>
<p>Some possible options that seem to be feasible:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the --keyring-provider subprocess flag and have a special value for username or username:password combination, which leads to prompts for the credentials instead of using the keyring. (This seems to be the easiest way, but might not be the cleanest option)</li>
<li>Create a --keyring-provider manual-input option that then achieves the same.</li>
<li>Extending this issue: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11600 with a manual-input mode which then leads to the user being prompted for credentials.</li>
</ol>
