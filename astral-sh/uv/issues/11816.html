            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I am attempting to uv to create an environment for a package using https://github.com/facebook/Ax and https://github.com/pytorch/botorch both of these are installed using git+url in the pyproject. The issue is that for Ax not to require a pinned version of botorch it checks for the environment variable &quot;ALLOW_BOTORCH_LATEST&quot; in https://github.com/facebook/Ax/blob/main/setup.py. All the ways I have tried to export this as true before running uv sync still lead to the error</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I assume that the Ax build got cached on the first build with the too-strict requirement, you can try <code>--reinstall-package Ax</code> to rebuild it.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, you can also try building Ax without <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#build-isolation">build isolation</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think the first idea works. I will explore the second some more but I also don't think it's the right solution here. Will explore more with Ax developers whether they can relax their dependencies a little.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I was going further with this same package today and moved these to an optional dependency, if they're installed as an optional dependency then the override-dependencies &quot;fix&quot; from before doesn't stop it from complaining. Is there any further logic to add here to deal with this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the issue here was that installing like <code>uv pip install &quot;./package&quot;</code>  and <code>cd package; uv pip install .</code> give different behavior due to uv reading the pyproject in the current directory and then ignoring commands in other directories. This means that the &quot;override-dependencies&quot; will need to be in the toml of everything in the monorepo we use but seemingly I now understand what was going wrong.</p>
