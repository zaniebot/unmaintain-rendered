            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Right now <code>uv pip install --python-platform macos</code> or <code>uv pip compile --python-platform macos</code> are searching for packages built for least-recent non-EOL macOS version. It means that if there is no such build on PyPI, <code>uv</code> will raise an error even if there are builds for higher macOS versions available.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong></p>
<p>Switch from &quot;least-recent non-EOL version&quot; to &quot;least-recent non-EOL version s.t. there is a corresponding build for the package&quot;. For example, <code>uv pip install --python-platform macos &lt;package&gt;</code> could do the following:</p>
<pre><code>for mac_version in sorted(non_eol_mac_versions):
    if there is the &lt;package&gt; build for mac_version:
        choose that build
        break
</code></pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This will likely impact experience in companies, where internal PyPI index is configured. Engineers can upload internal packages to the internal PyPI and then <code>uv pip install</code> them. Considering that engineers are likely to work on the latest macOS version due to security reasons, they will be uploading packages for the latest macOS version to PyPI.</p>
<p>Without this feature, <code>uv pip install --python-platform macos</code> will not be able to find such packages on PyPI.
With this feature, <code>uv pip install --python-platform macos</code> will be able to do that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The proposal here is to effectively &quot;solve&quot; for the supported macOS version, but I don't know if that's a good idea? I think you'd be better off advocating that we change the default to &quot;most recent macOS version&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, it would be even better if &quot;most recent macOS version&quot; were used. I would be happy with any solution 🙂</p>

<p>@charliermarsh - Should I open a feature request for that and close this one?</p>
