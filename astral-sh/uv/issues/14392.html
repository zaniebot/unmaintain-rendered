            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I've looked at the documentation on the main branch, and I only know that <strong>uv_build</strong> is built into <strong>uv</strong>.
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/3774a656d7c864370408b8c253909af3b83296d5/docs/concepts/build-backend.md</p>
<p>I want to confirm: Is <strong>uv_build</strong> fully compatible with any configuration of the <strong>complete uv</strong> of the same version?
This includes reading environment variables and behaving the same as <strong>uv</strong> when installing packages.</p>
<p>Can a note be made in the documentation regarding the differences between <strong>uv_build</strong> and the <strong>complete uv</strong>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv_build</code> can't do much, from a user perspective it's really just the value you put in the <code>build-system</code> table. <code>uv_build</code> doesn't install packages, it can only build a package in an environment prepared by a build environment. It does react to the same environment variables as uv, e.g. for logging, but it reads only the few environment variables it needs for its limited functionality.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> and <code>uv_build</code> for the same version are built from the same rust crates, except <code>uv_build</code> dependency tree is a subset of that of <code>uv</code>, so it's more portable and smaller. Does that answer your question? I'm having a hard time explaining the differences as one is a subset of the other, but also as a user, you should only need to interact with <code>uv</code> expect for the two lines that have <code>uv_build</code> in them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, can I assume the following three points are correct?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv_build</code> only reads the content of <code>[tool.uv.build-backend]</code> and the configuration information required for the build.</li>
<li>Regarding environment variables, <code>uv_build</code> only includes those necessary for building packages, and its behavior is consistent with <code>uv</code>.</li>
<li>Do not read <code>[tool.uv]</code> and <code>[[tool.uv.index]]</code> because they are almost exclusively related to project management and installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>My main goal is to avoid mistakenly assuming <code>uv_build</code> has the same rich functionality as <code>uv</code>, apart from the CLI.</p>
