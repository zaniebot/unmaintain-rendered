Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>I use the current version <code>0.4.12</code>, but I initially compiled my packages with <code>0.4.8</code> and upgraded and synced since then sometimes, but I had an issue with <code>ainsible-lint</code> since the introduction of <code>uv</code>, but until now I didn't know why. But now I found out that <code>uv</code> is installing a very old version of the package.</p>
<p>That's my <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;koala&quot;
description = &quot;...&quot;
readme = &quot;README.md&quot;
version = &quot;1.0.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.12.5,&lt;3.13&quot;
dependencies = [
  &quot;ansible&quot;,
  &quot;ansible-core&quot;,
  &quot;ansible-pylibssh&quot;,
  &quot;hvac&quot;,
  &quot;jmespath&quot;,
  &quot;netaddr&quot;,
  &quot;paramiko&quot;,
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
  &quot;ansible-lint&quot;,
  &quot;icecream&quot;,
  &quot;ruff&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>--&gt; I hardcoded the Python to <code>&gt;=3.12.5,&lt;3.13</code></p>
<p><code>uv sync --extra dev --verbose</code> produces the following versions:</p>

<p>The package resolution <code>ansible-lint==6.8.7</code> is wrong as we can see with <code>uv pip compile --extra dev pyproject.toml</code> that produces <code>ansible-lint==24.9.0</code>:</p>

<p>Where does that version <code>6.8.7</code> come from? Is it expected that <code>uv sync</code> and <code>uv pip compile</code> produce different package versions?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The issue is that <code>uv sync</code> tries to resolve for all platforms -- it's materially different than <code>uv pip compile</code> which by default only resolves for the <em>current</em> platform. It seems that newer versions of <code>ansible-lint</code> don't support Windows and require WSL instead, so we end up backtracking to a version that <em>does</em> work.</p>
<p>You can add:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
environments = [&quot;platform_system != 'Windows'&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>...to only solve for non-Windows, which will give you the version you expect.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can add:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv]
environments = [&quot;platform_system != 'Windows'&quot;, &quot;platform_system == 'Windows'&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>...to solve for non-Windows, then Windows (in that order), which will also give you the version you expect on non-Windows while resolving to a different version on Windows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's really interesting to know, thanks for the solution!</p>
<p>The command <code>uv pip compile</code> shows the dependency and therefore why a specific version has been choosen. Would it also be an idea to show that a specific system lead to that version (if some system is behind all other systems)?</p>
<p>Edit:
Because until now I compiled several projects, but didn't saw that one system is leading to a downgraded version.</p>
