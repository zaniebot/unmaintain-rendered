# Wheel can't be installed because the binary distribution is incompatible with the current platform

_Issue opened by @vultix on 2025-03-15 00:46_

### Summary

I'm getting the following error when trying to install a wheel on the correct environment:
```
error: Distribution `ray==3.0.0.dev0 @ direct+https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-3.0.0.dev0-cp313-cp313-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl` can't be installed because the binary distribution is incompatible with the current platform
```

This is the install command:
```
uv pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-3.0.0.dev0-cp313-cp313-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl
```

These wheels are found in ray's documentation here: https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-overview/installation.html#daily-releases-nightlies.

I've also tried installing by using `tool.uv.sources`, with the same error:
```
[tool.uv.sources]
ray = [
    { url = "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-3.0.0.dev0-cp313-cp313-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl", marker = "sys_platform == 'darwin' and platform_machine == 'arm64'"},
    { url = "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ray-wheels/latest/ray-3.0.0.dev0-cp313-cp313-manylinux2014_aarch64.whl", marker = "sys_platform == 'linux' and platform_machine == 'aarch64'"}
]
```

Does `uv cache clean` help at all?

Yep, that fixed it! Thanks for the help!

Hmm okay, thanks. That's annoying. I wonder what went wrong.
