Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>The file <code>crates/uv-extract/src/vendor/cloneable_seekable_reader.rs</code> is vendored and forked, apparently from https://github.com/google/ripunzip/blob/v0.4.0/src/unzip/cloneable_seekable_reader.rs.</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/c46adee48d6babbad9a2293e5f05232ceca6eed4/crates/uv-extract/src/vendor/cloneable_seekable_reader.rs#L3-L7</p>
<p>At least the <code>MIT</code> license requires the original license text to be included with “all copies or substantial portions of the Software,” i.e., with source and binary distributions. However, the contents of https://github.com/google/ripunzip/blob/v0.4.0/LICENSE are not present in <code>uv</code>’s source tree.</p>
<p>Perhaps copying https://github.com/google/ripunzip/raw/v0.4.0/LICENSE into <code>crates/uv-extract/src/vendor/</code> would suffice?</p>
