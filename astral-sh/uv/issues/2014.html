            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Dear team 🙇‍♂️ !</p>
<p>Thank you for this amazing development and congratulations with the launch of <code>uv</code>. I'm following your work closely and am eager to bake it into many projects!</p>
<p>I've stumbled upon a small feature request that I hope you could implement/muse about.</p>
<p><strong>The situation</strong>: I live in dependency hell 🔥</p>
<p>A typical project that I maintain has ~250 (transient) python dependencies it uses. These are larger AI projects that unfortunately are all currently monolith with no real designed way to change that. Try installing <code>lightning</code> (from <code>torch</code>/<code>pytorch_lightning</code>) and you'll see what I mean.</p>
<p><code>pip</code> has a hard time downloading all these dependencies due to the endless configurations that all need to be tried. f.e. <code>fastapi</code> is depended upon several times and this creates many download requests.</p>
<pre><code>$ time pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt --no-cache-dir
...
real	4m43.482s
user	1m28.243s
sys	0m7.930s

$ pip freeze | wc -l
230
</code></pre>
<p>Due to this scenario <code>uv</code> isn't much faster because it will have to do the same loops as <code>pip</code> to figure it out.</p>
<pre><code>$ time uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt --no-cache-dir
...
Resolved 228 packages in 2m 24s
...
Downloaded 227 packages in 2m 08s
Installed 227 packages in 367ms
...
real	4m33.699s
user	1m25.720s
sys	0m54.672s

$ uv pip freeze | wc -l
231 (uv also installed)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The feature request</strong>: Print out which packages took longest to resolve.</p>
<p>If <code>uv</code> could print out a summary (upon request) of which dependencies took longest to figure out and settle that would be extremely helpful! I could then go in and hard-pin those dependencies to an exact version to shorten the dependency calculation time.</p>
<p>I suppose I am in part describing creation of a lock file 🤔 but I have little to no experience with that, your guidance would be appreciated. 🙇</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>P.S. I unfortunately cannot show the actual requirements.txt files since they contain many private packages that we maintain ourselves.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be handy! and solve my request. If those were configurable it would be even more flexible. 🙏</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I ran <code>pipdeptree</code> to see very wide ranges for these packages.</p>
<pre><code>boto3 [required: &gt;=1.21.38,&lt;2, installed: 1.34.50]
urllib3 [required: &gt;=1,&lt;3, installed: 2.0.7]
</code></pre>
<p>I cannot be sure which packages are the worst offenders (hence the request).</p>

<p>Also also, I have a very experimental branch of pip that tests an resolution idea that I'm suggesting for uv to try (preferring upper bounded requirements) but I make no promises about that branch e.g. it could break pip, but if you're willing I'd be curious of the results: https://github.com/notatallshaw/pip/tree/backjump-to-upper-bounded</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It can be both, for the slow cases i have investigated (i can't repro this one, this is a guess from other requirements): For the first (uncached) run we're bound by network times since we make a request for each version. We'd like to improve this with prefetching when we see that we already fetched a lot of versions of the same package. For the cached case, we currently run into a bottleneck with pubgrub-rs where its range implementation is slow. pubgrub-rs stores ranges as exclusions of versions that , so we perform all operations including backtracking on a large list of <code>!=</code>s, which gets slow.</p>
<p>I'd be cool if we could fix boto by just changing the selection strategy; I'm fine with whatever order we do as long as it's deterministic (e.g. we can't decide based on raced network requests).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I suppose it's the resolution time (given the output from above). The download time is linked to the resolution time as we are downloading all those versions that we think may work but then find out actually don't. Right?</p>
<p>That being said, downloading 230 packages can be a lot.</p>
<p>I managed <code>du -sh &lt;path-to-site-packages&gt;* | sort -hr</code>, for a total of ~6.1GB of dependencies. The <code>torch</code> package is cached in the docker image I'm using, so it should download ~4.6GB. My connection is ~250Mb/s  so I'd expect that to download in about (4600MB/(250Mbit/8))=~150 seconds or around 2.5 minutes. and that's exactly what <code>uv</code> shows above as download time!</p>

<p>Well there's a recent innovation where there can be a metadata file separate from the wheel itself, so in the case of lots of backtracking only the metadata needs to be downloaded until the solution has been found.

<p>I've not used Artifactory in a few years, but as I understand it there would be two different parts to could support it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allowing the metadata files from PyPI (and other indexes in the future) read through</li>
<li>Having the Artifactory generate metadata files for internal packages</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1 this will be a configuration issue, you might have to allow &quot;*.metadata&quot; files to read through, the same as &quot;*.whl&quot; files. I don't know if this is set up by default for a PyPI configured repo or not.</p>
<p>For 2 this is something Artifactory would need to impelement.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Artifactory might have implemented this, but in most configurations it acts a caching proxy, so it would have to handle both cases of where it has to go out and get the file and where it has already cached the file permanently. I'm sure at some point the Artifactory team will post any comaptability issues they have with uv, they have worked with pip in the past.</p>

<p>It's as you suspected. I see &quot;Range requests not supported&quot; showing up in the logs a lot. I suppose this means that Artifactory does not support it.</p>
<p>For fun I decided to ran <code>uv pip compile -o requirements.compiled requirements.txt requirements-test.txt</code> so I could check which dependencies are mentioned a lot. Then I wrote a small script that shows how many other dependencies depend on them.</p>

<p>I hope this illustrates why it would be useful to understand which dependencies were particularly hard to find out 🙇 I cannot tell you if numpy actually is an issue 🤔</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect the problem is less that the dependency graph is too complex (making decisions in the resolver is generally very fast), but that for every version you try, uv has to download the entire wheel just to know which dependencies it has. So when we want to know what deps numpy has, we have a ~15MB web request, between 60MB and 755MB for checking a torch version, you get the gist (at least for scientific packages, pure python packages, a 80KB tqdm is still fast). With PEP 658 (pypi gives us metadata for some packages directly in the api) or range requests, it's a few kilobytes at most.</p>

<p>I beleive thats to support Artifactory adding metadata files for interally uploaded packages. When proxying PyPI you should be able to configure it to pass through *.metadata files.</p>
<p>But its been years since I had to touch Artifactory configuration, so I cant directly advise.</p>

<p>@notatallshaw Is there somewhere for me to track which packages do and do not (yet) have metadata available on pypi?</p>
