# uv pip doesn't accept --trusted-host inside requirements.txt, but vanilla pip does

_Issue opened by @Gualor on 2025-02-12 09:49_

### Summary

Hello, I was trying out `uv` for the first time for a possible replacement of anaconda (due to restrictive license).

I created a virtual environment and tried running `uv pip` using the same requirements.txt I use with standard `pip`, however I get the following:

```txt
$ uv pip install -r requirements.txt
warning: Ignoring unsupported option in `requirements.txt`: `--trusted-host` (hint: pass `--trusted-host` on the command line instead)
warning: Ignoring unsupported option in `requirements.txt`: `--trusted-host` (hint: pass `--trusted-host` on the command line instead)
Using Python 3.9.13 environment at: C:\mypath\.uv\myenv

Thank you for the support!

Unfortunately IIRC this is an intentional behavior (hence the hint that’s visible in the output). This setting is potentially insecure (it opens you up to various attacks by disabling SSL), so we require that it’s passed on the CLI or in a pyproject.toml or uv.toml file.

I see the issue, I just thought `uv pip` was 100% compatible with `pip`, thanks for the explanation.

Running the above command with --trusted-host as CLI argument instead of option in requirements.txt worked fine, so I will close the issue.

BR,
Lorenzo

We have a few intentional differences https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/
