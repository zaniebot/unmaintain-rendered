            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Writing a standalone single script, a developer should be able to make full use of IDEs, too. That means the IDE needs to know about the venv to inspect code of installed dependencies, for type checking, etc.</p>
<p>When I was developing a script uv, I did manage to find the venv nosing through the cache (under ~/.cache/uv/environments-v2/). For VSCode specifically I had to pass the path to python via &quot;Select Interpreter&quot;.</p>
<p>A programmatic way to return this would be very welcome.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this has already been resolved by #11891, which introduces <code>python find --script</code>. If that's not what you are looking for, there's also #12387 and its linked PR #12405.</p>
