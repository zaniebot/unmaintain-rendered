            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a single uv command that achieves both <code>uv sync; uv pip install -e .</code>?</p>
<p>In my project's young and hackish workflow, the convention is to activate the virtual env and then cd into other directories to run stuff (still using the same venv). In that case, I need my project to be installed (as editable) in its own venv. The instructions <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/#editable-packages">here</a> say to do <code>uv pip install -e .</code>. But this makes no changes to the <code>uv.lock</code>, and correspondingly <code>uv sync</code> undoes the initial action. Which means that users need to remember to run <code>uv pip install -e .</code> after every time they do <code>uv sync</code>.</p>
<p>I noticed there is also the option of doing <code>uv add myproject --dev</code>, which looks like it <em>could</em> be the right idea, but it doesn't seem to actually install anything, as <code>import myproject</code> does not work from other directories (with the same venv activated).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! Indeed adding this to my pyproject.toml resolved the issue, now <code>uv sync</code> behaves as desired:</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]
requires = [&quot;setuptools&gt;=42&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;setuptools.build_meta&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>However, I noticed that <code>uv build</code> assumes a default backend in case on is not provided. I wonder if <code>uv sync</code> could be modified to make a similar assumption?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a tradeoff we're making: We want to support people who don't write a package but only have scripts that shouldn't be installed (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#build-systems), while in <code>uv build</code>, we have to assume a setuptools default for backwards compatibility (PEP 517).</p>
