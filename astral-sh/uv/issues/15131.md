# config file ~/.config/uv/uv.toml seems not to be used with `uvx`

### Question

I created a fairly simple file at `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` (windows user):
```toml
[[index]]
url = "https://our.local.nexus/PyPI_Public/simple"
default = true
```

But when I run: `uvx -v migrate-to-uv`, I get this errors:
```
$ uvx -v migrate-to-uv
DEBUG uv 0.8.5 (ce3728681 2025-08-05)

  Caused by: client error (Connect)

```

My issues here:
1. I don't know where the config is coming from? I have a pyproject.toml in my local directory, which is configured for poetry. Nothing for uv yet. As I understand it should merge all these together, so it should have the index url.
2. no debug/trace stating what files and what configuration options are taken.
3. defining the index-url via the commandline gets me the same error (but at least changes to the correct search location)
4. I want to skip verification of the issuer. (don't ask :( ). How do I do that?

Thanks

I don't think `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` is being detected. On Windows, isn't it `%APPDATA%\uv\uv.toml`? You would see it in the debug logs if it were being picked up.

You can use https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#allow-insecure-host to skip verification, though we of course don't recommend it.

Closing for now, can always follow-up.
