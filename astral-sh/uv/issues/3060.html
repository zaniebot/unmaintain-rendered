            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pip allows you to install into a given virtual environment using <code>pip install --python /path/to/.venv ...</code>. This is a minor convenince feature because it lets you specify the environment without needing to consider the platform difference of where the interpreter is located <code>bin/python</code> or <code>Scripts/python.exe</code></p>
<p>Could <code>uv</code> add the same feature?</p>
<p>(From a brief scan of the code, it appears that this would simply involve an extra branch in <code>find_python::find_requested_python</code>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems reasonable to me but may have some nuances. There's some relevant discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1795 where we are unclear about how to select a Python interpreter found in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>For my own notes, we'd probably want to track this in the design at #2386</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this seems reasonable to support. I think it should be straightforwardish? If we're passed a directory, assume it's a virtualenv, in which case the Python must be at <code>.venv/bin/python</code> or <code>.venv/Scripts/python.exe</code> depending on the platform.</p>

<p>I don't think so - if the argument to <code>--python</code> is a directory, look for <code>&lt;supplied_dir&gt;/bin/python</code> (on Unix) or <code>&lt;supplied_dir&gt;/Scripts/python.exe</code> (on Windows)[^1] and use that in its place. We only do this if the user explicitly supplies <code>--python</code>, so there's no implication on the environment discovery code.</p>
<p>#1795 is about <code>uv venv</code> - I wasn't thinking of this for <code>uv venv</code> but even so, I don't think it will make a difference. The same code still runs, we just pre-process the <code>--python</code> argument value.</p>

<p>Yep, that's what pip does. I'm happy to try to contribute a PR if you'd like. I'm pretty new at Rust, though, so it could take me a little while to set things up. And I've no experience writing tests in Rust, so I may need some help there.</p>
<p>[^1]: I'd actually check both, just to cover things like Cygwin.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I missed that this was <em>just</em> for <code>pip install</code> that seems really straight-forward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There <em>is</em> an interesting nuance here, though. <code>python -m pip install -p .venv ...</code> currently means &quot;search for a Python executable called <code>.venv</code> in <code>PATH</code>&quot;, because the path search is triggered by the lack of a separator in the value. Changing that would be a behaviour change (although I'd have trouble imagining someone calling their virtual environment <code>python.exe</code>, so it's unlikely to matter in practice).</p>
<p>I'd propose the following behaviour:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for a version number as at present.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if the <code>--python</code> value is a path to an existing file, use that as the interpreter.</li>
<li>If it's a directory, assume it's a venv and use the venv interpreter.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if it contains a path separator, fail with an error.</li>
<li>Finally (a filename with no path part) try a search on <code>PATH</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this sound reasonable?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pfmoore when you say path separator here... do you mean <code>PATH</code> separator or file system path separator? lol</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, I meant <code>/</code> on Unix, and <code>\</code> or <code>/</code> on Windows - so <em>filesystem</em> separator (<code>os.sep</code>/<code>os.altsep</code>, rather than <code>os.pathsep</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At the end of the day, anything that isn't an executable on <code>$PATH</code> will fail with an error anyway, so this is mostly an optimisation to fail fast on things that can't possibly be the name of a Python interpreter.</p>
