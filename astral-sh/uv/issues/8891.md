# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mymodule' from jupyter notebook 

---

_Issue opened by @AlexAtCCRI on 2024-11-07 16:39_

**context**: i have a project called `mymodule`  that i am using `uv` to manage. i would like to use `mymodule`'s   venv to test out some notebooks that make use of `mymodule` (but the notebooks live in a different repo). 

i can import the module from within the venv, 
`uv run  --all-extras --with jupyter -- python -c 'import mymodule'`
works. but,  i can not import the module from within a notebook (run from a jupyter server within mymodules venv)

`uv run  --all-extras --with jupyter   jupyter-lab ~/path/to/notebooks/`

then create notebook, add cell with  `import mymodule`
fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`


* on linux 
* uv 0.4.30

From the report, it's not clear where `mymodule` is located and why it is expected to be able to import it. Is it a module in the source tree, or is it installed in a virtual environment?

One thing you might keep an eye on - run `import sys; print(sys.path)` in the notebook and inspect the paths, and also run `import os; os.getcwd()`; the empty string entry in sys.path will point to the current directory.

Jupyter executes notebooks with the current directory == the notebook's directory. That could be the explanation - notebooks will find and import modules in the same folder as themselves because of the `''` entry in `sys.path`  which corresponds to the current directory.

some more context. 
`mymodule` is a python package. i would like to use  `uv`'s  venv to build/install  `mymodule`  and run some test notebooks, which live somewhere outside of `mymodule`. 

previously i would make a venv,  install `mymodule` in editable mode, and then install a whole jupyter stack in the venv,  and run the notebooks.  i was hoping i could do this faster/ligher/more reproducably with `uv` venv. 

please let me know if this still doesnt make sense?  thanks again!

I have tried this, and I can't reproduce it, importing a library module from the current project works.

I have the following suggestion as the next thing to test, it would be to run this:

`uv run  --all-extras --with jupyter -- python -I -c 'import mymodule'`

`-I` for isolated would demonstrate that mymodule is really installed in the virtual environment. If that fails, it is relevant for the issue.  (When I try this command executes without problem.)

so here is what i got, 
```
uv run  --all-extras --with jupyter -- python -I -c 'import mymodule'
Installed 96 packages in 61ms
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mymodule'
```

but after inspecting the build whl, i found the problem was me. the module was not being packaged correctly (all the submodules were at the root of the dist, so the 'real'  package was not importable. !  (i was updating an existing build to pyproject.toml AND updating to `uv` so i confounded the two)

i had to add 

```
[tool.setuptools]
packages = ['mymodule']
```
in case anyone else makes this mistake.  totally my fault. your suggestions work now.  thanks.
