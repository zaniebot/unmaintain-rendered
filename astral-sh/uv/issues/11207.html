            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In the following, the <code>uv remove</code> command also installs a package (<code>urllib3</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ uv init --python 3.13 testcase-uv-add-remove &amp;&amp; cd $_
$ uv add --dev urllib3

$ rm -rf .venv/
$ uv add typing-extensions

</code></pre>
<p>It appears that the <code>uv add</code> step creates the venv, installs <code>typing-extensions</code> but doesn't perform a full sync, so the dev dependency isn't installed. Then the <code>uv remove</code> does perform a full sync, which installs it.</p>
<p>I would have expected that both <code>uv add</code> and <code>uv remove</code> behaved the same, in that they either:</p>
<ul>
<li>both performed the equivalent of a <code>uv sync</code> after updating the lockfile</li>
<li>or else, both only added/removed the specified package (and its transitive dependencies) and didn't sync the rest of the project's dependency list with the environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, if <code>urllib3</code> was installed as a normal dependency and not as as dev-dependency, then this inconsistency doesn't occur (the initial <code>uv add</code> step causes both <code>urllib3</code> and the new package to be installed, so there is no stray install of urllib3 during the <code>uv remove</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I kind of wish <code>uv remove</code> didn't do a sync at all. It leads to a lot of confusing interactions. In this case, it looks like <code>uv add</code> does a non-strict sync (so, just adds dependencies, doesn't remove things if not needed) while <code>uv remove</code> does a strict sync with the default groups enabled.</p>
