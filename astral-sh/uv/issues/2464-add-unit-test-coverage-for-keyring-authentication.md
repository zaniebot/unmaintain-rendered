# Add unit test coverage for keyring authentication

Similar to #2447 — but we should use a keyring provider instead of in-url authentication.

We'll probably need to install and configure keyring to temporarily use a password (bypassing the system keychain). We don't want this to affect the developer's machine.

We have more test coverage in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2976 now but still not end-to-end.
