# uv trying to symlink on exfat drive

---

_Issue opened by @joshafeinberg on 2025-08-31 13:50_

### Summary

I am trying to run uv on a directory that is on a disk formatted exfat (so no symlink support). When I run `uv venv -c --link-mode=clone` it still attempts to symlink

```
> uv venv -c --link-mode=clone
Using CPython 3.12.11
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
error: Failed to create virtual environment
  Caused by: failed to symlink file from /root/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.11-linux-aarch64-gnu/bin/python3.12 to /mnt/external/server/.venv/bin/python: Operation not permitted (os error 1)
```

When I move this onto the default drive that does support symlink this works fine

### Platform

Linux 6.6.51+rpt-rpi-2712 aarch64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.8.14

### Python version

_No response_
