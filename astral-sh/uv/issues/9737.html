            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there any command or migration guide for converting an existing project to using uv?</p>
<p><code>uv init</code> doesn't work, and I'm a bit unclear on the steps required.</p>
<p>(I maintain too many packages, I'm excited about <code>uv</code> making that maintenance easier, not looking forward to the overhead of migration)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>from https://github.com/samuelcolvin/rtoml/pull/85 it seems like the process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a <code>.python-version</code> file if you don't want to use 3.13 by default</li>
<li>start adding dev dependencies <code>uv add --dev ...</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That's kind of all, then you need to update all the places you used your old build system, but no command could help with that.</p>
<p>I think a short section in the docs is all that's needed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Docs work is tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5200</p>
<p>There was a proposed change adding <code>uv add -r pyproject.toml</code> support but it never got finished due to concerns about expectations around what would be copied.. can't find it right now. Perhaps https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/commit/9fec29d152f25680008c3201e0a7c4330fb6a863</p>
<p>There's also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6374 which is similar.</p>
<p>I'd like <code>uv init</code> to &quot;work&quot; with an existing <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but I'm not sure what the behaviors should be yet.</p>
