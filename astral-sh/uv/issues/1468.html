            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we plan to support it. The usage is small and there are simple workarounds e.g. a requirements file that includes the others. Sorry I know that's not a great answer to hear but I'd rather focus on building new workflows that solve this problem rather than adding another compatibility interface.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Could you provide more details on the specific plans and features you’re considering? Additionally, how do you see uv evolving in terms of unique workflows and integration with Dependabot? Enhancing these areas and good dependabot integration could significantly popularize uv and streamline dependency management.</p>
<p>For reference, Dependabot is open to contributing new ecosystems, which you can find more about <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-ecosystems">here</a>.</p>
<p>I was too embarrassed to open a new issue, so I asked here. Moreover this ticket can probably be closed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>Dependabot support is being tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2512 — of course we'd love an integration once what we're stable.</p>
<p>You can see all the work in progress with the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues?q=label%3Apreview+">preview label</a>. We don't have a full roadmap written out at this time, the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap">readme</a> has a blurb though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I tried to work on a PR to implement this, would you be interested or do you feel it's not worth supporting? We're finding the sequential import workflow to be a pain.</p>
