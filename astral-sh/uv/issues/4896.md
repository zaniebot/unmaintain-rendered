# Define a CLI style guide

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-08 14:08_

We should determine and document our preferred styling for CLI output so we can be consistent. 

Content may include:

- Use of backticks (`)
- Use of colons (`:`)
- Use bolding and dimming
- Capitalization
- Preferred terminology
- Meaning of colors
- When progress bars are needed
- When lines should be ephemeral
- If messages should be tracing logs or written directly
- When stderr or stdout should be used
- Error message styling
- When capitalization should be used in error/log messages
