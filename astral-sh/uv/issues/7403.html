Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>Apologies if this was brought up before or exists as a feature already, but I could not find either in documentation or existing issues.</p>
<p>It would be useful to have the ability to pass a flag or environment variable to tell <code>uv</code> where to download pre-built python interpreters as opposed to always choosing <code>python-build-standalone</code>. This would be useful for machines which may not access to the internet. In this case a mirror could be supplied.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR</code> environment variable may help you in this case. Search for the term in the official <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/">docs</a> for more details.</p>
