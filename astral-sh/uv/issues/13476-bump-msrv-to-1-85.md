Can we update to the 2024 edition with/after the bump? :eyes:

Yeah do you have an old PR for this that we can revive?

From my last time doing this, it's easier to redo it than to fix the merge conflicts; most of it is automated or one click fixed (for comprehensiveness: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11724)

If you wanna do it LMK (no preference either way!)

I have an idea how to split this into PRs so it's not all at once, I can do the non-breaking PRs first that don't conflict with you doing the 1.85 MSRV update.
