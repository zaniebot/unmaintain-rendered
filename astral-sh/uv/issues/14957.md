# Inconsistency of docs to init: hatchling vs uv_build

---

_Issue opened by @michellepace on 2025-07-29 15:25_

### Summary

Hello. 

When I initialise with `uv init —package my-thing` as of July 29, 2025 with latest uv version 0.8.3 the default is uv_build .  

But in the docs there is only mention of  `hatchling` making it appear like UV's typical default. 

Reported as a Bug to align consistency - I’m unsure which to use?

Thank you for UV, discovered it a few days ago as a novice. It’s lovely.

Michelle

Which documentation page are you referring to, where does it say uv uses hatchling?

If you do a search on the docs website you’ll find multiple mentions. But this is the page that got me confused specifically: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/init/#packaged-applications

That's just outdated, thanks!
