            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Originally requested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11360</p>
<p>I think the idea here is that this would simplify configuring uv across multiple platforms?</p>
<p>I'm not sure where this would fit into our system -&gt; user -&gt; project configuration hierarchy.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would consider it a system level <code>uv.toml</code>, matching the request for portable installs  in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11360 where the the directory of the uv install would be the system level. It also works for other linux-patterns, such as a <code>/opt/uv</code> install.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It needs to go either before or after the existing system configuration though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main intention here was for a portable installation. The main use case here is sharing python projects with non-IT folks. I would like to give users a folder containing my Python-scripts, the UV-Executable and the uv-configuration, along with a batch-file which simply contains <code>.\uv.exe run my_script.py</code>. When you mention &quot;before or after the existing system configuration&quot;, I suppose you are referring to its priority. My suggestion would be, if a local <code>uv.toml</code> is found, for that to be the only considered configuration file but I would also be open to that one being merged with the system configuration</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah interesting. You probably want something like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5802 then, though this could be a good intermediate step.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, definitely! A bundling solution would be absolutely amazing and as you mentioned, this is mainly a &quot;workaround&quot;. But even using this workaround uv has been an incredible gamechanger considering how hard it was before to get Python Applications running on end-user PCs (unless you were using pyinstaller &amp; co but even there I ran into trouble). For now I just did all the configuration of uv-environment variables in the accompanying bat-file which works but becomes nasty when I want to execute some other uv-commands, as I either have to change the bat-file or set the environment variables manually. This is also the reason, why in my original issue I combined it with the toml-extensions.</p>
