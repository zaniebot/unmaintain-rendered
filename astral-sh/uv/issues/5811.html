            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I’m wishing for a way to specify persistent options for <code>uv</code> commands in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>This is a generalized solution to issues such as #5737.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.uv.options]
venv = [ &quot;--relocatable&quot; ]
pip = { install = [ &quot;--offline&quot;, &quot;--no-build-isolation&quot; ] }
</code></pre>
<p>Invoking <code>uv venv</code> would then implicitly pass the option  <code>--relocatable</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could print a message to let the user know that options were collected from <code>pyproject.toml</code> to respect the principle of least astonishment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thinking out loud…</p>
<p>How would this feature handle options that take arguments (such as <code>--find-links</code>) or options that could be used multiple times (such as <code>-e</code>/<code>--editable</code>)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel like it'd probably be better to just provide these as configuration options, e.g. <code>tool.uv.pip.offline</code> or <code>tool.uv.venv.relocatable</code>. Why set this per-command using CLI flags?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it comes down to style and ease of maintenance.</p>
<p>The kv pair approach is verbose. The array approach seems tidier to me and uses fewer lines of TOML.</p>
<p>Setting it per command is mostly for flexibility and consistency. Would you rather make this work for all commands (both current and future) or have to manually maintain config options?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Basically, yeah I think we'd rather maintain an explicit configuration schema that applies for all commands or follows a clear hierarchy for sections of commands (as with <code>uv.pip</code>) rather than have a way to dynamically inject untyped arguments in front of commands — it's more aligned with the user experience we typically deliver.</p>
<p>I see the benefits of your suggestion though.</p>
