# [feature request] should uv format/lint pyproject.toml?

---

_Issue opened by @baggiponte on 2024-08-21 07:48_

Hello there! I was wondering if uv should do something along the lines of [validate-pyproject](https://validate-pyproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and/or [pyproject-fmt](https://pypi.org/project/pyproject-fmt/).
