# [Question] Unable to import local packages for running pytest

---

_Issue opened by @vaibhavmano on 2025-09-11 16:18_

### Question

I'm currently in the process of migrating my organization's monorepo to `uv`. We currently have a flat structure and it consists of both packages and service folders that correspond to each microservice. I've since changes the structure to have `src/` folder in the root which will contain all the packages. 

I've also taken advantage of uv workspaces.

```
org-backend 
└── src
    └── base
        └── ..
        └── pyproject.toml
    └── bo
        └── ..
        └── pyproject.toml
└── application
   └── ..
   └── pyproject.toml
└── pyproject.toml
```

I'm able to build the packages in `/src` (using `hatch` for build) but where I'm having issue is within the service folders (in this case, `/application`)

below is the`pyproject.toml` for `/application`
```
[project]
name = "application"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Contains all business logics of the app"
requires-python = "==3.12.*"
dependencies = [
    "base",
    "jsonschema==4.22.0",
]

[tool.uv]
package = false

[tool.uv.sources]
application = { workspace = true }
base = { workspace = true }

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "bandit>=1.8.6",
    "pytest>=8.4.2",
    "pytest-cov>=7.0.0",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["."]
addopts = "--cov=. --cov-report=xml"
testpaths = ["tests"]

```

Whenever I try to run pytests with `uv run pytest` after `uv sync`, I end up getting the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'base'` but I can see that the base is installed in the virtual environment. I'm also unable to import it via python console. Is there anything that I'm missing?


### Platform

macOS 15.4.1

### Version

uv 0.8.13

It's hard to answer it from afar, but there's some things we can try for debugging: You can run `uv build` in base, and check what's the wheel that is build - is there's a `base` directory in there? You can run `uv venv -c && uv sync -v` to get debug logs for a fresh install. You can check that `site-packages` directory inside the venv and the `<...>.pth` file for `base` in it, plus the value of `sys.path` in `uv run python`.

For what's it worth, here's my `pyproject.toml` from the root

```
[project]
name = "org-app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ".."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = "==3.12.*"
dependencies = [
    "base==0.1.0",
    "bo==1.0.0"
]

[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["src/base", "src/bo", "application"]

[tool.uv.sources]
base = { workspace = true }
bo = { workspace = true }
application = { workspace = true }
```

And here's the `pyproject.toml` of `src/base`
```
[project]
name = "base"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "..."
authors = [{ email = "..." }, { email = "..." }]
requires-python = "==3.12.*"
dependencies = [
    "aiohttp==3.11.9",
    "firebase-admin==6.6.0",
    "flask==3.1.0",
    "grpcio==1.67.1",
    "hatch>=1.14.1",
    "marshmallow==3.23.1",
    "oauth2client==4.1.3",
    "pillow==11.0.0",
    "psutil==7.0.0",
    "pydantic>=2.11.7",
    "supabase==2.10.0",
    "user-agent-parser==0.1.2",
    "uwsgi==2.0.28",
    "werkzeug==3.1.3",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling>=1.25"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["base"]
include = [
    "base/*.py",
    "base/config/.yaml",
    "base/util/audit/config/.yml",
    "base/app_server/configs/*.json",
]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]
include = [
    "base/**",
]

[tool.uv]
package = true

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "bandit>=1.8.6",
    "pytest>=8.4.2",
    "pytest-cov>=7.0.0",
]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
pythonpath = ["."]
addopts = "--cov=. --cov-report=xml"

```
I've scoured over the uv documentation and there isn't any doc regarding importing and using local pakcages that are a workspace themself. Many of the threads in reddit and stackoverflow suggest to install the local package with the whl file using `uv pip install` but that seems like a workaround.

As @konstin mentioned, I also checked the site packages but only `base-0.1.0.dist-info` is present, whereas other packages seem to have 2 folders, I'm assuming this is because base is a local package.

The decision what gets included and installed of the package is made by hatchling, not by uv. If you do a `uv sync`, uv asks hatchling to build in editable, which should create a `.pth` file with the name of a directory in it, which goes inside the site-packages. The contents of this `.pth` gets added to `sys.path`, the question what is in the `.pth` file, what is in `sys.path`, and what does `uv sync -v` say?

_Comment by @vaibhavmano on 2025-09-12 07:19_

@konstin This is what `uv sync -v` returns when I run it inside `/application` directory. Also both `_base.pth` and `sys.path` is empty.

`_base.pth` being empty would explain it, in that case it's a problem with the hatchling configuration. `sys.path` should never be empty, can you double check with `uv run python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"`?

_Comment by @vaibhavmano on 2025-09-12 07:36_

It looks like you're right. I'm able to import the `bo` package but not the `base`. They both have the exact hatchling configuration. 

This is the output for the above cmd
```
['', '/../.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.11-macos-x86_64-none/lib/python312.zip', '/../.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.11-macos-x86_64-none/lib/python3.12', '/../.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.11-macos-x86_64-none/lib/python3.12/lib-dynload', '/../Desktop/org-app/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages', '/../Desktop/org-app/src/bo']
```

@konstin Thanks a ton. Figured it out. It seems like hatch and uv play nicely out of the box with the src folder structure. Changed my package to the src structure and works fine.
