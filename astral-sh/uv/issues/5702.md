# Improve ordering of top-level commands

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-01 18:24_

With https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5700, the ordering is all over the place in the documentation and help menu.

In my point of view, I see these groups:
```
Workspace:
      init     Initialize a project
      add      Add one or more packages to the project requirements
      remove   Remove one or more packages from the project requirements
      run      Run a command in the project environment
      sync     Sync the project's dependencies with the environment
      lock     Resolve the project requirements into a lockfile
      tree     Display the dependency tree for the project
Standalone:
      tool     Run and manage executable Python packages
      python   Manage Python installations
      pip      Resolve and install Python packages
      venv     Create a virtual environment
Internal:
      cache    Manage the cache
      version  Display uv's version
      help     Display documentation for a command
```

Does clap support subcommand help headings?

> Does clap support subcommand help headings?

No, although there's a `subcommand_help_heading`, it's not for multiple groups of `subcommands` .

Thanks! I didn't think so. I think the proposed ordering above is fine (without the grouping),  but `uv run` should be at the top.

it's lgtm:
```
      run      Run a command in the project environment
      init     Initialize a project
      add      Add one or more packages to the project requirements
      remove   Remove one or more packages from the project requirements
      sync     Sync the project's dependencies with the environment
      lock     Resolve the project requirements into a lockfile
      tree     Display the dependency tree for the project
      tool     Run and manage executable Python packages
      python   Manage Python installations
      pip      Resolve and install Python packages
      venv     Create a virtual environment
      self     Manage the uv executable <OPTIONAL>
      cache    Manage the cache
      version  Display uv's version
      help     Display documentation for a command
```
