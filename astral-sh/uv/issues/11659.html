            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Installing opencv-python &amp; opencv-contrib-python from uv, or from pip (through <code>uv export &gt; requirements.txt</code> then <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>) has the strange difference that accessing <code>cv2.ppf_match_3d_ICP</code> fail in the first case but success in the second.</p>
<p>Here is an example: https://github.com/nim65s/cv2-uv/actions.</p>
<p><code>pip freeze</code> / <code>uv pip freeze</code> outputs are the same, though.</p>
<p>Am I missing anything ?</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>ubuntu 24.04</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.6.2</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>3.13</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank for the clear reproducer!</p>
<p>Both opencv-python and opencv-contrib-python contain a <code>cv2</code> module with a <code>cv2/__init__.py</code>, but the content is different. By installing both, it's up to change which package &quot;wins&quot; by being installed last and overwriting the other package. It seems that your use case is only working if <code>opencv-contrib-python==4.11.0.86</code> is installed (or at least, installed last), while <code>opencv-python==4.11.0.86</code> doesn't work. Can you try removing <code>opencv-python==4.11.0.86</code> from your package?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, you are right, I should have read opencv wheel doc 😅</p>
<p>The test on the reproducer show this is fixed.</p>
<p>I wish we had a way to declare incompatibilities between packages (here, opencv-contrib-python include opencv-python, so the first should declare that it &quot;provide&quot; or &quot;conflict&quot; with the second…), but no: https://discuss.python.org/t/can-python-package-metadata-wheels-explicitly-conflict-or-replace-others/39966</p>
