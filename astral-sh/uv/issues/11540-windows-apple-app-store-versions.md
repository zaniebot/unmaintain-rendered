# Windows/Apple App Store Versions

---

_Issue opened by @BruceEckel on 2025-02-15 17:57_

### Summary

I'm sure you have thought of this but I couldn't find an issue about it so I want to get it on the list.

Since one goal is to be able to say `uv run the_tool.py`, more inexperienced users will be able to use Python programs if they can get `uv` installed via the app store for Windows and Apple.

Icing on the cake would be if I can create my own app installer that will install `uv` along with all the necessary things for that OS to produce a clickable app that will execute `uv run the_tool.py`, so the end user has the same experience as any other app, without knowing that they are actually installing a python app.

Again, I'm sure you've thought of all this.
