Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>uv currently renders a spinner that might make it difficult to render logs in browser/web components easily as it can spew a lot of output. It would be great if uv could expose a flag similar to pip to disable the progress bar/spinner.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A global <code>--no-progress-bar</code> option is a good idea I think.</p>
<p>I can take care of this, though I don't know all the commands that print progress bars.</p>
