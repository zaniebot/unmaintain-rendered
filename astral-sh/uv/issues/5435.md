# new INSTALLER and REQUESTED files are chmod 600

_Issue opened by @AtomBaf on 2024-07-25 07:10_

Since recently, I noticed that the `uv pip install` command will add 2 files in the metadata directory of an installed package: `INSTALLER` and `REQUESTED`.

These files were not there in previous `uv` versions, I don't know however when it was introduced but I can tell that this was not the case in version `0.2.2`.
Now with the current version `0.2.28` these files are there. My problem is that their mod is 600 instead of a more usual 644 for other files in the same directory (like `METADATA`or `WHEEL`).
This causes a problem on my stack since for other reasons I install the package with one user, and another user read the libs metadata for some checks.

Interesting, thanks.

What operating system are you on?

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-25 14:02_

Interesting, ok, this changed because we initially create the file in a temporary directory, then move it over (to avoid partial writes), and by default that uses 600: https://docs.rs/tempfile/latest/tempfile/struct.Builder.html#method.permissions

I'm surprised we don't see this in more places?

Sorry, my OS is Rocky Linux 9.3.

And I think what I'm doing should not happen often since reading all the files including these 2 files is not what python will typically do. This is probably why I'm the first to report this.

No worries. You're right that the permissions should be changed.
