However, this seems to be an upstream issue, so I think it would be more appropriate to open an issue directly there.
https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/
It's also possible that uv just neglected to add them in the uv.

I think 3.11.2 was skipped in python-build-standalone: https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/20230507. Is there a reason you need that specific patch...?

@charliermarsh 
Thank you for replying.
My Raspberry Pi 5 uses Python 3.11.2, so I'm trying to develop the related components on my laptop.

I think we're unlikely to re-add these, since patch releases are generally meant to be upgradeable without issue. So you should be able to use, e.g., 3.11.3 interchangeably.
