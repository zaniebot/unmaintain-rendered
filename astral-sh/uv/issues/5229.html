            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here's use case I have where it would be useful. I was trying to migrate https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/ to <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>I mount the local development directory inside the Docker container as a volume: https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template/blob/master/docker-compose.override.yml#L58</p>
<p>This allows fast iteration on the code, as it only takes a reload of the server instead of a re-build of the Docker image to try a change.</p>
<p>If I have a local <code>.venv</code> directory, it will end up mounted as well. But inside the container, the file links are not resolved.</p>
<p>I tried using <code>UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON</code> and <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code> to move it to some root directory (so that it wouldn't be mounted), but <code>uv</code> would still try to use the venv in <code>.venv</code>. And if I remove it from inside the container, the in-container <code>uv</code> would create a new venv in <code>.venv</code> that would also show up in the local (mounted directory).</p>
<hr />
<p>Somewhat related, I would like to be able to use Python directly, not only through <code>uv run</code>. For example, in that project, I currently use a base Docker image that comes with its own entrypoint and command. But those wouldn't be able to run the programs without activating the <code>uv</code> venv in some way (or using the system Python).</p>

<p>Here, you're referring to the installed Python, like outside of the virtualenv, is that right? (Since you can always <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code> without going through <code>uv run</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To add to this. Being able to configure the <code>.venv</code> location will also help out when using docker bind mounts during the build phase. https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/#add-or-copy.

<p>I personally actually don't like shims, I can't use <code>which python</code> with shims, that's the main reason I ended up not using other tools that used/needed shims. :sweat_smile:</p>

<p>About Docker, yep! Actually great docs! That's what I was basing my work on. Maybe the detail of <code>RUN . $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate</code> could be added, don't know. :thinking:</p>
<p>But anyway, great job on the docs already. :clap:</p>

<p>@tiangolo am actually having a similar issue except we install to the system python in the Dockerfile -  so I have maade a similar request to allow disabling force install into virtual env..  <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6459">Here is link</a>
However doing <code>RUN . $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate</code> doesn't seem to help in my case
When I run the the docker-compose command I get an error <code>/usr/local/bin/python: No module named ...</code> which would indicate env isn't activated</p>
<p>(Side note - absolutely love fastapi)</p>
<p>Happy it is working for you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Thank you! I figured out a way in the end
If I do the uv sync and venv activation inside a different workdir like /opt
as well as set the python path to the venv that is in /opt, it works exactly as it should. (I can then go to /app workdir and copy all the code and run everything successfully)</p>
<p>I assume my issue is that the virtual env is getting messed up by the way we mount our volume as well as copy our folders in the Dockerfile (one or the other)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to chime in with our use case: currently, we use pip-tools in our container images, where we have <code>VIRTUAL_ENV=/opt/venv</code> and <code>PATH=/opt/venv/bin:$PATH</code>. We have an intricate multi-stage Dockerfile that populates <code>/opt/venv</code> in an early build stage using <code>pip-sync</code> on a compiled requirement file, and it's <code>COPY</code>'d wholesale to the actual runtime stage with no build stage dependencies present. Would be nice to run <code>uv sync</code> instead of <code>pip-sync</code> in the build stage to achieve the same, migrate from a compiled requirement file to <code>uv.lock</code>, and change nothing else about how our system currently works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another use-case for having a custom venv location outside of the project directory is CNBs (<a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a>).</p>
<p>With CNBs, the layer/caching model is different to <code>Dockerfile</code>, so standard Dockerfile best practices don't apply. For example, with CNBs:</p>
<ul>
<li>buildpacks aren't run as root</li>
<li>layers are created as directories under <code>/layers/&lt;buildpack_name&gt;/&lt;layer_name&gt;</code> which are separate to each other, and also separate to the app source code</li>
<li>layers can be marked with various properties that control whether they are cached or made available in the final run-image or not</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties allow for several benefits such as base image &quot;rebase&quot;, finer grained cache re-use/invalidation, smaller run-images (via excluding build time only deps), the ability to support multiple languages/ecosystems (Docker multi-stage builds get messy fast when trying to build a multi-language app, since it's hard to re-use official Docker images etc).</p>
<p>However, they do mean that the various components have to be installed into separate directory trees (rather than relying on an overlay filesystem to keep files contributed by different stages of the build separate).</p>
<p>For example when using pip a possible layout that a Python buildpack might use, could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/layers/&lt;buildpack_name&gt;/python</code>:<ul>
<li>A layer containing the custom relocated Python installation (compiled in advanced and downloaded from S3)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>/layers/&lt;buildpack_name&gt;/pip</code>:<ul>
<li>A layer containing pip, as a user site-packages install (using <code>PYTHONUSERBASE</code> to set the location)</li>
<li>This layer can then be marked as <code>launch=false</code> to exclude it from the run image</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>/layers/&lt;buildpack_name&gt;/venv</code>:<ul>
<li>A layer containing the application dependencies in a PEP-405 compliant venv</li>
<li><code>PIP_PYTHON</code> points at this layer, so <code>pip install</code> will install into it rather than the global Python installation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>/workspace</code> (the location of which is end-user customisable, and often changed to eg <code>/app</code>)<ul>
<li>The layer containing the app source code</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each layer can then have its own cache invalidation logic. Any layers that are unchanged don't have to be rebuilt or even pushed to the remote. More at:
https://buildpacks.io/docs/for-buildpack-authors/concepts/
https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md</p>
<p>Use of a venv for the app dependencies is needed due to:</p>
<ol>
<li>A system install not allowing keeping the dependencies in a separate layer for separate cache invalidation/re-use</li>
<li><code>--user</code> installs being problematic for relocated Python (xref https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2077#issuecomment-2312410060)</li>
<li><code>PYTHONPATH</code> tricks being problematic due to stdlib shadowing (paths on <code>PYTHONPATH</code> take precedence over the stdlib, which can cause hard to debug issues from eg outdated backport packages in the app's transitive dependency tree)</li>
</ol>
<p>As such, when we add support for uv in the future, we'll need a way to force the venv to be created outside the project directory and in its own layer.</p>
<p>I'm mostly indifferent as to whether we have to create the venv ourselves or whether uv does that for us (so long as we can control the exact path uv creates; a generated venv path name derived from the project path/metadata like Poetry does would be more hassle). If we manually create the venv ourselves, I also don't mind too much how we'd tell uv to use that venv - for pip we'll soon be using <code>PIP_PYTHON</code> (since pip doesn't check <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code>), and for the upcoming Poetry support we instead set <code>VIRTUAL_ENV</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb The updated guide is pretty thorough and helpful! I was actually able to get it working using a watch config which I guess is fine though it seems inconsistent sometimes and may not work as well as gunicorns hot reload setup!</p>
<p>I will say that I did try using the new setup without watch config and trying to mount .:/app but the app failed due to loosing my env it seems.</p>
<p>Regardless - really appreciate your help in this!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@edmorley thank you for your thorough response. I take that feedback pretty seriously and it makes me think we'll need to expose <em>some</em> way to allow custom virtual environment locations. The difficulty will be in encouraging users that would be better suited <em>not</em> customizing the location to stay on the happy path.</p>
<p>@adiberk I'm glad it helped! What's inconsistent about the watch setup? What happened with the mount? Feel free to open a targeted issue if something from the documentation didn't work out and we can chat over there.</p>

<p>tl;dr the lack of this feature in my context is awkward but easy to work around.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I came back just to say: thanks for writing this guide! https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#configuring-watch-with-docker-compose :tada:</p>
<p>I didn't know about Docker Compose's <code>watch</code>, that solves my problems even better than what I had (bind mounts). I learned something, thanks! :nerd_face: :rocket:</p>
