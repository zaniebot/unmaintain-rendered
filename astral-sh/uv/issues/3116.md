# uv powershell windows only works if you are running powershell as admin

---

_Issue opened by @Chris2L on 2024-04-18 05:51_

Trying to run uv using VS code on windows.  Install uv on powershell using command 
`powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
This installs version 0.1.33

If I try to create venv running command:
`uv venv`
powershell responds with 

> uv : The term 'uv' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

If I install and run powershell as admin, it seems to work fine while still in admin.  This should not be the way to use it as running things with admin should be reserved to extreme cases. 

Running windows 11

Ahh sorry, I think this might be the same as https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/833? We're tracking it over in `cargo-dist`.

I'm not convinced it's the same problem as I've updated the policy to be able to run the sh script in regular venv. The install runs without error, the terminal just does not find uv exe

I ran into this issue as well on my Windows 10 machine. uv installed (or appeared to without error) but I get the following message:

```
PS C:\Users\matt> uv
uv : The term 'uv' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the
spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

@mattharrison does it work if you install with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "..."`?

_Comment by @cOborski on 2024-09-10 19:41_

## tl;dr:
> [!NOTE]
> Running either `sudo powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "pip install uv"`, or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "pip install uv"` in admin mode, is a workaround if you're running into this problem.

I was getting the same error--long story short, `sudo powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "pip install uv"` ended up working.

I'm running gsudo in powershell on windows 11.

**Edit:**

When I say it worked, I mean I can now use the `uv` command outside admin mode.

All below *did not* work correctly:

- `pip install uv`
- `sudo pip install uv`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "pip install uv"`

So there is no solution to this yet? Thought i finally found a way to set up python for clients in a straightforward way on windows but no still hard

_Comment by @Chris2L on 2024-11-26 10:23_

Just check after a reboot if it is still an issue. I installed it again a few weeks ago, and it only started to work after logging out or rebooting. Basically, the PATH variable needs to be reloaded.  I hope it helps.  I'm enjoying UV so far!

_Comment by @Scylla2020 on 2024-11-26 12:50_

Thanks will try that

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-11-26 15:38_

I don't think there's more for us to do with this one.

When it happened, I found a lot of ways to solve it, and then I remembered that the easiest reboot was solved. ;)

If any of the steps given in the official docs and the above works 😟, then try these 👇

## This worked for me

- **Install via pip**:
  If issues persist, consider installing `uv` directly using pip:

  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "pip install uv"
  ```

  This command bypasses the execution policy temporarily just for this command and installs `uv` globally.

_Comment by @CodenameCookie on 2025-02-12 16:13_

I think I'm having this issue too. I installed it globally with this line but PowerShell doesn't seem to have access to UV unless in admin mode. Which isn't ideal for me. Bit of a security issue. 
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex`

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-02-12 16:24_

You shouldn't need admin access, did you install it as an admin? did you reboot? is it on your `PATH`?

---

_Comment by @raminmardani on 2025-02-19 15:34_

in windows:
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

then close your powershell and open a new one 
`uv `
will work after

---

_Comment by @huni1023 on 2025-04-05 07:30_

I have the same issue too,
For me solution @CodenameCookie, @raminmardani suggested worked.
But my firewall software ("AhnLab V3 Lite") blocks install, I have to shutdown firewall while installing. Thkx!

when use pip install uv,where it will install?

_Comment by @wyattscarpenter on 2025-10-05 18:21_

Maybe not the same problem, but I got the same error message under discussion (uv not found on the command line), for which this is the first google result for me, on Windows 11 when I installed python from the windows store and then used its pip to install uv. Turns out that doesn't really work! So, if you're also getting this error message and the other fixes don't work for you, try installing python from the python website instead, I guess.

this actually fixed the issue on my end

tks a lot @CodenameCookie
