            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I use <code>uv</code> as a package manager for things that are hosted on pypi. It would be nice to add some additional functionality to learn more about and search for available tools.</p>
<p>For example, this is what <code>brew</code> provides for <code>ruff</code>, which is also (obviously) available to install via <code>uv</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">❯ brew search ruff
==&gt; Formulae
ruff             ruff-lsp         sqruff           truffle          trufflehog       riff

~

</code></pre>
<p>For the info that gets returned, I think at a minimum this should include a description, a website/github/pypi/github page, and the current version. I think the description can also get parsed directly from pypi (e.g. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ruff/#:~:text=Dec%204%2C%202025-,an%20extremely%20fast%20python%20linter%20and%20code%20formatter%2C%20written%20in%20rust,-.">here</a>).</p>
