# Certain options/subcommands could be hidden from completions to reduce noise

---

_Issue opened by @EliteTK on 2025-12-10 23:20_

### Summary

Completions generated by `uv` include a bunch of hidden options and subcommands, in some cases these hidden options are beneficial to keep in the completions (e.g. `--no-` variants of certain flags) but in other cases such they should probably not be included as they're misleading.

Examples include:

* `InitArgs::backend` - this exists to redirect users to the correct option (`--build-backend`)
* `ToolInstallArgs::from` - redundant option
* `GenerateShellCompletionArgs` - broadly the options in here don't do anything and seem to just exist to avoid errors?
* `BuildBackendCommand` - this isn't meant to be used directly by end users at all

There are probably other arguments/subcommands like these.

### Example

Power users would find it easier to tab complete options they want, and newer users would avoid confusion when they discover invalid/intentionally hidden options through the completions.
