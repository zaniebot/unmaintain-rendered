# FR: Add support for `uv tool upgrade --python <PYTHON>`

---

_Issue opened by @weihenglim on 2024-08-21 04:39_

It would be useful to have a way to reinstall/upgrade all installed tools to the latest Python version. 

Currently we are able to reinstall all tools via `uv tool upgrade --all --reinstall` but are unable to specify the Python version. The workaround is to perform `uv tool install --python <PYTHON> <PACKAGE>` for all tools individually. 

As an aside, it would also be nice if `uv tool list` displays the Python version that was used to install the tool (similar to how `pipx list` behaves)

Upgrading Python versions makes a lot of sense.

Why is the version important for you to see in `uv tool list`? Aren't most tools Python version agnostic?

Personally for me it just makes it easier to spot, at a glance, the tools that are stuck on an older version due to being installed by an old Python interpreter. 

For example if I run `uv tool install yt-dlp` with a system Python 3.7, `uv tool list` will show the installed package as `yt-dlp v2023.11.16`. After upgrading the system Python to 3.12, performing a `uv tool upgrade yt-dlp` will result in a `Nothing to upgrade`  message even though a newer version (`v2024.8.6`) is available for Python 3.12.

Hope that makes sense.
