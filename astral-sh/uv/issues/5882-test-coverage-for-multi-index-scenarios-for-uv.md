# Test coverage for multi-index scenarios for `uv.lock`

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-08-07 17:40_

Currently, there is only one scenarios for the lockfile with multiple registries (`add_lower_bound_local`) and that is testing something else. We should add at least a basic test for multi-index cases.
