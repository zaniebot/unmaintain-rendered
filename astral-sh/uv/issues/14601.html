            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you very much for the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md">existing benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>When migrating our organization from PyEnv + Poetry, I noticed an even greater performance difference in PyEnv. I think it would be worthwhile to benchmark this strong point as well, as mentioned.</p>
<p>I'd suggest a Pull Request, but I'm not entirely sure how to compare a global PyEnv installation versus a local uv installation. However, that's likely just my lack of knowledge/uncertainty.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>When I tried it out (just use unix <code>time</code> cmd), I found the following results:</p>
<p>| Tool  | Executed in | CPU time |
|-------|------------:|---------:|
| uv    |        3.11 |     1.20 |
| pyenv |       94.40 |   343.14 |</p>
<p>In both cases, the values represent the average of two measurements, in seconds.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Something like: <code>time uv python install 3.14</code> vs <code>time sudo pyenv install 3.14-dev</code></p>
<p>But I am uncertainty about cache and equality of commands. In one case there is a sudo... But for me as end user is important the speed of uv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, it's very expected that <code>pyenv</code> will take much longer to install because it has to build the Python distribution on your machine. I don't think we'd want to show a benchmark for that since we're not doing the same operation, though yeah it's a benefit that uv doesn't do that :)</p>
