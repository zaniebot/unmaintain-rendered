Installation succeeds when using the standalone installer

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

downloading uv 0.8.2 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
no checksums to verify
installing to /home/manikandan/.local/bin
  uv
  uvx
everything's installed!
```

Hi! 

Installing via Cargo works for me:

```
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/uv`
  Installing uv v0.8.2 (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#21fadbcc)
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/reqwest-middleware`
    Updating crates.io index
...
   Compiling uv v0.8.2 (/Users/emorley/.cargo/git/checkouts/uv-c9e40703e19509a8/21fadbc/crates/uv)
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 4m 05s
  Installing /Users/emorley/.cargo/bin/uv                                                 Installing /Users/emorley/.cargo/bin/uvx
   Installed package `uv v0.8.2 (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#21fadbcc)` (executables `uv`, `uvx`)
```

What version of Rust are you using? (`cargo --version`)

I am at 1.83.0

```bash
cargo --version
cargo 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)
```

Ahh. It works after i updated to Rust 1.88.0

```bash

cargo install --git https://github.com/astral-sh/uv uv
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/uv`
  Installing uv v0.8.2 (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#21fadbcc)
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/reqwest-middleware`
    Updating crates.io index
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/pubgrub`
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/rs-async-zip`
    Updating git repository `https://github.com/astral-sh/tl.git`
     Locking 458 packages to latest compatible versions
      Adding async-compression v0.4.19 (available: v0.4.27)
      Adding console v0.15.11 (available: v0.16.0)
      Adding windows v0.59.0 (available: v0.61.3)
      Adding windows-core v0.59.0 (available: v0.61.2)
      Adding windows-sys v0.59.0 (available: v0.60.2)

```

Makes sense as the minimum required version is set to 1.86 in the repo.


`rust-version = "1.86"`

Thank you for confirming!

I wonder if the Cargo install method should be discouraged in the uv install docs? It's an advanced install method (requires Rust toolchain of a compatible version, compiles from scratch so is much slower, plus presumably doesn't support self updates) so it seems like the other options (install script, Homebrew, PyPI, ...) are what most people would be best using?

Perhaps the Cargo section should (a) be moved lower down the install page, (b) have a hint that it's not recommended?

I agree @edmorley. 

Moving the Cargo install section lower on the install page sounds like a good idea. Since uv is a package manager, it also feels more natural for most users to install it through channels that are easier (and faster) to keep up to date.
