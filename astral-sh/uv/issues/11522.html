            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I had a user report today that their</p>
<pre><code>[pip]
index-url = ...
</code></pre>
<p>wasn't taking effect.  They expected <code>uv tool install</code> to use the same settings as <code>uv pip install</code>, and in fact it appears that <code>tool.index-url</code> is disallowed.  The global setting at the top level does work.  Thoughts on...</p>
<ol>
<li>Supporting <code>tool.index-url</code> (the first place I looked, if the first subcommand should be the section name)</li>
<li>Warning in <code>uv tool install</code> if you have pip.index.url but not global index-url</li>
<li>Falling back to <code>pip.index-url</code> when both <code>tool.index-url</code> and global <code>index-url</code> are missing</li>
</ol>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>Any</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.6.0</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>[pip]</code> settings intentionally only apply to <code>uv pip</code>.</p>
<p>See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/#configuring-the-pip-interface</p>
<p>I don't think we should fallback to it when the top-level configuration is missing.</p>
<p>We could warn if the command fails due to a missing package and an index is present in <code>[pip]</code>? But it'd be kind of hard to implement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Makes sense from the coding design perspective (keep config separate), however what would the use case be for having 2 distinct pypi mirrors? Would it ever make sense to have this?</p>
<pre><code>index-url = &quot;foo&quot;
[pip]
index-url = &quot;bar&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is hard to grok/follow, what does that do?
If I use <code>uv pip install</code> then one mirror is used, but a different one for <code>uv tool</code>? I can't imagine a legit case for it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>[pip]</code> section is provided for backwards compatibility. I'd generally recommend not using it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Experimenting, it seems <code>uv venv --seed</code> already use the <code>[pip]</code> settings though.  I didn't spot any commands that have their own <code>index-url</code> yet?</p>
