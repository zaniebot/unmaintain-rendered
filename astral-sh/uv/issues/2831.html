            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m trying to debug some native c++ that is a part of my python project with Visual Studio. To get this working with a &quot;pip generated&quot; venv (after ~python 3.10) you need to add <code>--symlinks</code> when you create the the <code>venv</code> on a Windows machine. Do you think that it would be possible to add this option to uv as well? (So that the files gets created as symlinks instead as of copies..)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For my current potential <code>uv</code> use case, I pass <code>--symlinks</code> or <code>--copies</code> to <code>python -m venv</code> explicitly to guard against the platform-specific defaults ever implicitly changing on me (the virtual environments I&#x27;m creating need to do the right thing when packaged up as tarballs and/or zip archives, so I really need to know exactly how the relationships between virtual environments and their base environments are being managed).</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1795">astral-sh/uv#1795</a> though, I think I&#x27;ll back off from trying to replace <code>python -m venv</code> for now, and stick with just replacing <code>pip install</code>, <code>pip-compile</code>, and <code>pip-sync</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I replied over there, but I&#x27;m pretty sure <code>python -m venv</code> is in the wrong in the way it is handling attempts to create virtual environments from within virtual environments (I had to change my current project to explicitly create layered venvs from the base Python runtime, since attempting to create them directly from the next layer down gave an unusable environment)</p>
