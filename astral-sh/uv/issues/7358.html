Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>When creating a virtualenv (either with <code>python -m venv --system-site-packages</code> <dir><code>or with</code>uv venv --system-site-packages` the packages installed in the system python installation are not recognized by uv at all. We then install a wheel into our venv, expecting uv to only download the missing dependencies. uv redownloeads and reinstalls a lot of additional packages which are already available in the system though. pip correctly installs only the missing packages.</p>
<p>Our targets are embedded devices which ship a python installation with most dependencies installed and updated via the firmware image, for custom deployments and prototyping we'd like an easy way to &quot;overlay&quot; the available system packages with newer versions or additional dependencies. (Also this happens via mobile network, so downloading an additional maybe 30MB of dependencies could be a big deal, depending on the connection quality)</p>
<p>Platform: linux-aarch64, uv 0.4.9</p>
