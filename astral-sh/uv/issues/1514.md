# Private git dependency URLs with credentials do not resolve

---

_Issue opened by @meridionaljet on 2024-02-16 16:59_

Working with private git repos that require a username and token to resolve seems to fail in `uv`:

```
uv pip install '{packagename} @ git+https://{username}@github.com/{organization}/{packagename}.git'
Updating https://{username}/ (github.com/{organization}/{packagename}.git) 
error: Failed to download and build: {packagename} @ git+https://{username}@github.com/{organization}/{packagename}.git
  Caused by: Git operation failed
  Caused by: failed to fetch into: /home/user/.cache/uv/git-v0/db/20cbf189775078d1
  Caused by: failed to connect to the repository
  Caused by: failed to resolve address for {username}: Temporary failure in name resolution; class=Net (12)
```

`pip` will read `~/.git-credentials` and find the token associated with `username` and resolve the URL correctly. `pip` will also accept the token directly using the form `pip install '{packagename} @ git+https://{username}:{token}@github.com/{organization}/{packagename}.git'`, but `uv` complains about the URL format in this case, trying to interpret `token` as a port:

```
thread 'main' panicked at crates/cache-key/src/canonical_url.rs:113:38:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: InvalidPort
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

I have seen a similar problem when attempting to install `pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/…` where `github.com` has a corresponding `Host` entry in `~/.ssh/config`

Did you try to use GITHUB_ACTOR and GITHUB_TOKEN for auth? For me works well

I'm also having this issue with dependencies with URLs that begin like `git+ssh://git`, for example:

Hrm. Actually I can't get `uv pip compile` to work, even after adding a `~/.ssh/config` file (which allowed `pip install` to work).

```shell
➜ uv pip compile reqs.in

Exit code 2.

I'm encountering the same issue. I can 

- clone the repo from the terminal
- install the repo with `pip install "doraemon @ git+ssh://git@github.com/Komorebi-AI/doraemon.git@1.0"`

But using `uv pip install "doraemon @ git+ssh://git@github.com/Komorebi-AI/doraemon.git@1.0"` throws the error:

```
error: Failed to download and build: doraemon @ git+ssh://git@github.com/Komorebi-AI/doraemon.git@1.0

After some attemps in different ways manage to find this message: attempted to find username/password via credential.helper, but maybe the found credentials were incorrect

then do:
```
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
uv pip install "<PACKAGE>@git+https://gitlab.com/<ORG>/<REPO>.git"
```

not sure if works as well in github
edit: this only works running Gitlab CLI `./glab.exe auth login` and populating Git with Gitlab credentials probably the same for github username and GITHUB_TOKEN

I don't see why uv couldn't transparently support the git credential cache when accessing private git URLs.  The idea that anything user-specific should be specified inside the pyproject.toml file is anathema to CI/CD.  

When I try running `uv add -U any-package` in a project that has dependencies on a private bitbucket repo, uv seems to skip over the git credential cache mechanism.  In my case, I'm using the git **credential.helper _cache_** backend, so it will interactively prompt me for a password the first time.  This interactive prompting is ignored by uv.  The prompt pops up for my bitbucket username, but it never gets to the point of asking for my password.  Instead, uv steamrolls forward and gives the following error:

_pyproject.toml:_
```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
my-package = { git = "https://bitbucket.my-company.com/scm/de/my-package.git" }
```
_**uv** command:_
```bash
uv add -U any-package
```
_Error:_
```

      --- stderr
      fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://bitbucket.my-company.com/scm/de/my-package.git/'
```
At least there could be a uv command line option to support the git credential cache.  (Note that `--keyring-provider subprocess` option doesn't work for this type of reference to a private git repo (but it should 😉).

UPDATE:  **uv** _does_ work transparently with the git credential cache mechanism if the username and password have recently been stored _prior_ to running `uv add -U any-package`.  I'm guessing it doesn't work with the interactive prompting because uv is running things in the background (non-interactively) which isn't compatible with the git **credential.helper _cache_** mechanism.  A more permanent storage than _**cache**_ should avoid this problem.
