# UV fails installing a python library with CRC mismatch

---

_Issue opened by @unmultimedio on 2025-04-04 18:03_

### Summary

Attempting to install a uv package fails due to a CRC mismatch:

```
$ uv add 'bufbuild-registry-grpc-python==1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b' --index https://buf.build/gen/python

  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because
      bufbuild-registry-grpc-python==1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b
      has an invalid package format and your project depends on
      bufbuild-registry-grpc-python==1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b,
      we can conclude that your project's requirements are
      unsatisfiable.

      hint: The structure of `bufbuild-registry-grpc-python`
      (v1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b) was invalid:
        Bad CRC (got bb621658, expected 00000000) for file:
      bufbuild_registry_grpc_python-1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b.dist-info/METADATA

      hint: `bufbuild-registry-grpc-python` was found on
      https://buf.build/gen/python, but not at the requested version
      (bufbuild-registry-grpc-python==1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b).
      A compatible version may be available on a subsequent index
      (e.g., https://pypi.org/simple). By default, uv will only
      consider versions that are published on the first index that
      contains a given package, to avoid dependency confusion attacks.
      If all indexes are equally trusted, use `--index-strategy
      unsafe-best-match` to consider all versions from all indexes,
      regardless of the order in which they were defined.
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed
        resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to skip locking and
        syncing.
```

Trying to download the library zip file manually and run `zipinfo` on it, I get the correct expected CRC32 for the `METADATA` file entry:

```

Seems like CRC32 values should match?

```
From error message:
bufbuild_registry_grpc_python-1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b.dist-info/METADATA
Bad CRC (got bb621658, expected 00000000)

From zipinfo:
bufbuild_registry_grpc_python-1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b.dist-info/METADATA
CRC: bb621658
```

This happens with the latest release https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.6.12, probably related to this PR? https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12623

Installing the same package using pip it works:

```
python3 -m pip install bufbuild-registry-grpc-python==1.71.0.1.20250116203702+1c024d64352b --extra-index-url https://buf.build/gen/python
```

And pip seems to do a CRC check [when the CRC is not zero in the header](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/zipfile/__init__.py#L1049).

This looks to be related to https://github.com/Majored/rs-async-zip/issues/141#issuecomment-2195612262. It appears that reading the expected CRC32 from the data descriptor isn't supported.

Ah interesting. Data descriptors are fairly rare in Python packages but I know the `buf` registry uses them (since that's the only place it's come up before).
