This is a choice by the package, not by uv. Please contact the package maintainers if you think this is a problem.

I can ask maintainer of ~pio~pip packages.
Is it able to request --strip, --release, etc...?

This is currently not supported by Python packaging, there is one build per platform. To get a specific version, you need to build from source.

Closing since there is nothing what this project itself do.
