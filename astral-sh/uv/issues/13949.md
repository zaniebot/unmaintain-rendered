# Python installation can fail with HTTP 500 from GitHub

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-06-10 13:43_

e.g.,

```
error: Failed to install cpython-3.13.2-windows-x86_64-none
  Caused by: Failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/202[50](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/15560408097/job/43811059422?pr=13946#step:6:51)317/cpython-3.13.2%2B20250317-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-install_only_stripped.tar.gz
  Caused by: HTTP status server error (500 Internal Server Error) for url (https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20250317/cpython-3.13.2%2B20250317-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-install_only_stripped.tar.gz)
```

Should we... retry on these?

We probably are but we aren't showing it: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13897/files#diff-a6e0e21a018971af790e29f1b21d6f45dc5dea4a33f5c8c6b3eb1e58e97ebfcb

There's a gap, namely that we atm can't retry once we started streaming, though I wouldn't see how that could lead to the 500.
