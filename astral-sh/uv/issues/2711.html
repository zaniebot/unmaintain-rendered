<pre><code>$ uv pip install avro
error: Failed to download and build: avro==1.11.3
  Caused by: Failed to deserialize cache entry

</code></pre>
<p>With uv 0.1.24, this works fine.</p>
<p>Both commands were run with that avro package in the cache. Not sure if there was a change in the cache format that might&#x27;ve caused this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After a <code>uv cache clean</code>, things work as expected. So it seems like a change in cache format.</p>
