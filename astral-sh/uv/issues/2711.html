            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With uv 0.1.25</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip install avro
error: Failed to download and build: avro==1.11.3
  Caused by: Failed to deserialize cache entry
  Caused by: expected version to start with a number, but no leading ASCII digits were found
</code></pre>
<p>With uv 0.1.24, this works fine.</p>
<p>Both commands were run with that avro package in the cache. Not sure if there was a change in the cache format that might've caused this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After a <code>uv cache clean</code>, things work as expected. So it seems like a change in cache format.</p>
