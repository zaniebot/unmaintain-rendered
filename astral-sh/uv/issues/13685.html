            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran into a problem where I need UV to install a package normally (not in editable mode), but also this env is part of a development workflow and if changes are made locally the expectation is that the installed package will get updated when <code>uv sync --no-editable</code> is executed again, however this doesn't happen. What's worse is that even if venv is wiped and created anew, uv will still install the old version of the built package from cache, it will not rebuild it.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make uv detect that sources are modified (even though project version did not change) and rebuild the package when --no-editable is requested? Imho this should be default behavior, as caching an in-development package might not be the best idea.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think and if there's any existing solution</p>
