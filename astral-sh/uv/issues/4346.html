<p>Even the verbose output doesn't show any indication of updating the lock file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree. Would it also make sense to give a brief description of what changed (it can be enabled by default and users would be able to disable it using a <code>--no-summary</code> flag)?</p>
<p>The output command can be
|  package | old version  | new version  | action
|---|---|---|---|
| xyz |   | 1.0.0  | ADDED |
| abc  |  0.0.1 |   | DELETED |
|  efg |  0.1.0 | 0.1.1  | UPDATED  |</p>
<p>Although this has a downside of a huge output on initial lock creation (and probably more things). Apart from this, for a usual development workflow, teams can always check the diff to see what has changed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cargo has a nice example here</p>
<pre><code>
Updating lockfile...
    Updating uv v0.2.11 (/Users/zb/workspace/uv/crates/uv) -&gt; v0.2.12
    Updating uv-version v0.2.11 (/Users/zb/workspace/uv/crates/uv-version) -&gt; v0.2.12
note: pass `--verbose` to see 102 unchanged dependencies behind latest

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this is a nice inspiration.</p>
<p>I see <code>cargo update --verbose</code> is way less verbose than <code>uv lock --verbose</code>. Do you think we should transition the current verbose flag to very verbose (-vv) and have the verbose flag (-v) for a pretty verbose output?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a tracking issue for that at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1569, we need to do quite a bit of work around our tracing output levels eventually it's just not as high of a priority as the rest of the interface right now.</p>
