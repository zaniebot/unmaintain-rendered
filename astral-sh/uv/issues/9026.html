            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I install packages via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv sync
or
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
</code></pre>
<p>Then try to run pytest on the project via a tool</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool run pytest
</code></pre>
<p>It won't work because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'boto3'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is part of the main dependencies block in pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>To overcome this I could do either of:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv sync
uv run pytest
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool run --with boto3 pytest
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>(i am assuming this will also install dev packages every time a tool is ran)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool run --with-requirements pyproject.toml pytest
</code></pre>
<p>The second one isn't worth it in my case due to the number of tools I may need to add, and the last one will re-link (or in my case it copies over the files as a fallback option) the packages on every run for that specific tool.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to run the tool in the same environment as the <code>uv run pytest</code> would run in. This is useful when I want to enforce a tool on users of a CI pipeline without affecting their project dependencies with &quot;add&quot;. While I could run something along the lines of <code>uv sync --with pytest</code> and then have the ability to execute it I'd like to know whether a simpler solution is available to me.</p>
<p>I also have found that <code>tool run</code> comes with an <code>--isolated</code> flag, which I am assuming is on by default from the output of the example above?</p>
<pre><code>--isolated
    Run the tool in an isolated virtual environment, ignoring any already-installed tools
</code></pre>
<p>So I am not sure if I can de-isolate the tool to reuse the isolated environment of a project .venv instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a great suggestion! This could go hand in hand with introducing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3560#issuecomment-2719148617">project-level tools</a> by adding an option to include the project's &quot;prod&quot; dependencies in a given project tool's isolated venv.</p>
