            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When providing a target version to <code>pip compile</code> we must determine two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What Python version should we use for tags during resolution?</li>
<li>What Python interpreter should we use to build wheels?</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently</p>
<ol>
<li>We use the latest known patch version of the Python version (if not explicitly provided and if available)</li>
<li>If in a virtual environment, we use that version regardless of the target version</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if I use <code>pip compile --python-version 3.11</code> and have 3.11 installed but am in a 3.12 virtual environment we use 3.12 to build wheels. Consequently, if a wheel cannot be built on Python 3.12 we will say the resolution is unsatisfiable.</p>
<p>I believe that we should change (2) to have a preference for the target Python version if available. If not available, it should use the closest patch version with a matching minor version. If that's not available, it should use the current environment's version. This change would mean that when you provide an alternative Python version you may end up with compiled requirements that are not installable in your <em>current</em> environment but our outcome will be more correct with regards to installation in an environment with the target version available.</p>
<p>The current behavior appears to be historical, ensuring that we had a virtual environment to perform builds in. Now, I believe we create a temporary virtual environment for builds.</p>

<p>It used to be that we required a virtualenv for <code>pip compile</code> and <code>pip sync</code>. But, we only really need one for <code>pip sync</code> (since we're installing into it). So that requirement was lifted.</p>
<p>Whatever we do here, it should probably be in sync with <code>puffin venv</code> which I think @konstin is tweaking.</p>
