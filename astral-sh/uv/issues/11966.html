            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>requirements.in includes:</p>
<pre><code>-e .
</code></pre>
<p>I want to create a compiled requirements.txt in &quot;foo/bar/&quot; that installs the package 2 levels up.
when I run <code>uv pip compile requirements.in -o foo/bar/requirements.txt</code> I get:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o foo/bar/requirements.txt
-e .
    # via -r requirements.in
</code></pre>
<p>But I expect to get:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o foo/bar/requirements.txt
-e ../../
    # via -r requirements.in
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried moving the CWD to foo/bar/ and using the --directory option, neither changed the output.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, this seems like the correct behavior to me. We intentionally preserve the verbatim path supplied by the user. I think I'd expect that your <code>requirements.in</code> contain <code>-e ../../</code>, and that you run <code>uv pip compile</code> from <em>that</em> directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>fair, it may be the intended behavior. A bit of motivation: the reason I want to have the behavior is I have a library in &quot;foo/bar/&quot; that I want to both install into a venv at the root and separately provide a requirements.txt in &quot;foo/bar/&quot; for a containerization build that only uses the sub directory (I know that is a bit opposite of what I initially described, but the same issue comes up).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is counter-intuitive because relative paths in <code>-e &lt;dir&gt;</code> and <code>-r &lt;file&gt;</code> in a <code>requirements.in</code> file are treated differently.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv pip compile</code> resolves relative paths in  <code>-r &lt;file&gt;</code> relative to the <strong>directory of the file</strong> that contains the line, and</li>
<li><code>uv pip install -r &lt;file&gt;</code> resolves paths i <code>-e &lt;dir&gt;</code> relative to the <strong>current working directory</strong>, where the command is executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>But my conclusion is that <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6112">this is how <code>pip</code></a> and <code>pip-tools</code> currently work, so while it's bad UX, it is <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/">expected for a drop-in replacement</a>.</p>
