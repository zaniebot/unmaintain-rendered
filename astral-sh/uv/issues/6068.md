# uv sync dependencies only

_Issue opened by @sbidoul on 2024-08-13 20:52_

With dependencies locked in a `requirements.txt` I can do a two layers Dockerfile where the infrequently changing `requirements.txt` is copied to the image and is installed first, and then the frequently changing project is installed in a second layer. This is to benefit from layers caching.

What would be the way to achieve something similar with `uv.lock` ?

Ah, looks like this is already requested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4028#issuecomment-2252762915

Quite an important feature IMHO.
