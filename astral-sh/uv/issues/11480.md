# uv is taking longer to install pytorch than pip

---

_Issue opened by @tanishy7777 on 2025-02-13 15:07_

### Summary

I am not sure whats the problem but I tried installing pytorch using the commands

```
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

and 

```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

UV took about 20 mins

while normal using the pip installation method took way less time.

### Platform

Endeavour OS 2024.09.22

### Version

uv 0.5.31

### Python version

Python 3.13.1

Can you share the verbose output of both commands? Did you run both commands with a clean cache? That command involves downloading multiple gigabytes worth of wheels. It takes about 20 seconds on my machine:

```

I ran `uv clean cache` it reduced to 2.30 mins total. Thx!

Is there anyway to speed it up any faster though?
