            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is partly a follow up to some of the commentary on https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8067 I found if I deleted a uv python version (in this case because I'd installed Python 3.13.2 with uv), e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv python uninstall cpython-3.13.1-windows-x86_64-none
</code></pre>
<p>and that was the Python my uv tools were installed against, when I run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">uv tool upgrade --all
</code></pre>
<p>I get a long list of errors, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">error: Failed to upgrade hatch
  Caused by: `hatch` is missing a valid environment; run `uv tool install --force hatch` to reinstall
error: Failed to upgrade linkchecker
  Caused by: `linkchecker` is missing a valid environment; run `uv tool install --force linkchecker` to reinstall
error: Failed to upgrade maturin
  Caused by: `maturin` is missing a valid environment; run `uv tool install --force maturin` to reinstall
error: Failed to upgrade mkdocs
  Caused by: `mkdocs` is missing a valid environment; run `uv tool install --force mkdocs` to reinstall
</code></pre>
<p>My only options (I'm aware of) to get around this are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each tool call <code>uv tool install --force &lt;tool name&gt;</code> as suggested (but I have dozens of tools and that's onerous).</li>
<li>Reinstall the Python I deleted <code>uv python install cpython-3.13.1-windows-x86_64-none</code>, then run <code>uv tool upgrade --all --python 3.13.2</code>, then uninstall the older Python after the upgrade <code>uv python install cpython-3.13.1-windows-x86_64-none</code> - which is easy when you understand the workflow but not obvious and for me required searching uv documentation / issues</li>
</ol>
<p>I was hoping the behaviour of <code>uv tool upgrade --all</code> could be changed to do a force reinstall itself in the situation the previous Python it was installed against was removed - or there could be some new CLI options, e.g. <code>uv tool upgrade --all --force</code> or <code>uv tool reinstall --all</code> - something like that where I could express I do want to force reinstall everything in the case I know I have deleted the Python the tool was installed with.</p>
<p>I guess a related bit of feature parity it'd be nice to have versus pipx is <code>pipx list</code> shows the Python version each package was installed with whereas <code>uv tool list</code> doesn't show that.</p>
<p>My current uv version is: <code>uv 0.6.0 (591f38c25 2025-02-14)</code></p>
