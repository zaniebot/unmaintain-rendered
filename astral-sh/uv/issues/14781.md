uv checks in the registry and in PATH for Python interpreters, this looks like a problem with PythonWin7 rather than with uv.

Windows 7 is end of life, so certain things may not work on it anymore.

Yes, windows7 is is out of life.
I would like transfer to uv from PDM,while PDM can find the python 3.12

We won't find executables with a name like `python-3.12.10-full.exe` by default. Set `UV_PYTHON` or `--python` to the path of the executable.

Or rename it to something conformant, like `python.exe`
