            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like it can't find uv? We now install to <code>~/.local/bin</code> by default and it's not on your path. Check out the release notes including the breaking change from v5: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.5.0.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep, that got my CI too... But a pretty quick fix as charliermarsh pointed out.</p>
<p>You also have the option to specify the version when you install to avoid issues in future.
e.g. <code>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.5.0/install.sh | sh</code> (or 0.4.30) if you want the latest version before this change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh awkward. Sorry this broke your CI — I presume it only worked before because the Cargo path is special-cased on their runners?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Can you open a new issue? This one is for CI / CD. Briefly, a <code>uv self update</code> should not change the install location so I'm curious how it broke — it's possible there's a bug upstream.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Yea, I had the Cargo path set in a Docker file that my CI depended on. So CI was just where I happened to notice it. Easy to fix, and now I know that I can version the install too. Thanks for the good work!</p>
