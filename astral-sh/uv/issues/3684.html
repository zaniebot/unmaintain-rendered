            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👋 We're hoping to network mount a read-only (hot) cache for <code>uv</code> so our servers can bootstrap themselves quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since the tempdir for build isolation is installed under the cache dir, there's no good way to do this.</p>
<p>I think the issue is in:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/03629181962e1f358361679d8b30bf48f386ad1d/crates/uv-build/src/lib.rs#L404</p>
<p>(Out of curiosity, why not put it in the default tempdir location per-platform?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can't hardlink or reflink across filesystems, and often the default tempdir is on a different drive or partition than wherever you put the cache. Using the cache for the temporary build environment ensures they're colocated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That in itself makes sense, I'm guessing the benefit there is along the lines of &quot;we can fast-install the build requirements from the cache because we know they're colocated?&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm open to it... We'd need to figure out what to call it and what it &quot;means&quot;. Can you look around at all the <code>tempfile</code> uses that would be affected by this decision? We tend to always use the cache dir for this.</p>
