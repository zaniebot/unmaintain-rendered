            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I would like <code>uv</code> to help manage my frequently used tools by 1) knowing about the tools (with their version constraints and extras) used in development for a project and 2) ensuring that matching tools are available.</p>
Example
<p>For instance, suppose I have a  <code>pyproject.toml</code> that includes a &quot;tools&quot; dependency group.</p>
<pre><code>[dependency-groups]
tools = [
    &quot;dvc[s3]&gt;=3&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>The name &quot;tools&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be special, as there would be a new setting like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
install-tools = [&quot;tools&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>When I am working in this project, I would execute the new subcommand.</p>
<pre><code>$ uv tool sync
</code></pre>
<p>As a result, I would get</p>
<pre><code>$ dvc --version
3.59.1
</code></pre>
<p>Which would be great, because trying to use a 2.x version of <code>dvc</code> or one without <code>s3</code> extra would not work at all.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure there are better people than me to improve on the useage, but I hope that example demonstrates the goal. Being able to easily share the tools I want my collaborators to have available this way would help me move away from installing tools in project virtual environments, which seems common but annoying nowadays.</p>
<p>Thank you for a great tool!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, @zanieb. It looks like <code>uv tool sync</code> (along with <code>uv tool add</code> and <code>uv tool remove</code>) were considered but not included in the original implementation of <code>uv tool</code>. Perhaps with the <code>depency-groups</code> table, there is now much less potential for confusion. I&#x27;m glad there is support for something similar expressed in #12533. I&#x27;ll leave this open though, as I don&#x27;t think my description duplicates that one. But no worries if you prefer to close this one!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we sort of wanted to wait for the <code>dependency-groups</code> table to move forward on a design there. I think there&#x27;s still some design work to be done before we can ship something, but definitely agree it will be nice to have!</p>
