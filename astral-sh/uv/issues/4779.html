            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Classic <code>pip</code> did the same until a few years ago where they changed the default to <code>--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed</code> for which <code>uv</code> currently does not have an equivalent. The only way to get this behavior is <code>uv pip install -P somepkg somepkg</code> which is a bit ugly since I need to specify the package name twice.</p>
<p>I think this behavior would be more desirable than &quot;upgrade everything&quot; because:</p>
<ul>
<li>In most proper production deployments you have lock files anyway and will not use <code>uv pip install -U</code> at all</li>
<li>If you have some extra packages in such an environment, you do NOT want updating that package to also update some random dependency (that's actually specified in another package's lock file)</li>
<li>In a development environment, I guess it's a matter of preference</li>
</ul>
<p>My suggestion would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the default to match <code>--upgrade-strategy only-if-needed</code> (or at least implement this option)</li>
<li>Display a notice if any (direct?) dependencies of the specified package could also be updated (maybe only if this does not conflict with version pins of already-installed packages?)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds like you're just looking for <code>--upgrade-package</code>? Why is it a big deal to specify the name twice? Isn't it harder for users to do <code>uv pip install &lt;package&gt; --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager</code> to update their environment? I've been bitten by this surprising behavior in <code>pip</code> several times in CI.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not particularly opposed to <code>--upgrade</code> applying to all of the &quot;given packages&quot; if we can find a nice way to specify upgrading the environment. I guess <code>--upgrade-strategy</code> isn't bad.</p>
