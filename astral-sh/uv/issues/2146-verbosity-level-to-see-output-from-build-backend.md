# Verbosity level to see output from build backend

---

_Issue opened by @hauntsaninja on 2024-03-04 07:03_

Related to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1569 , but I'd love to be able to see the output from the build backend during a successful install. `pip install -v` will show this to you

Would make debugging things like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2145 much easier
