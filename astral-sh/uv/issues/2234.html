            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While <code>--system</code> has been added recently, as per <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/">Externally Managed Environments</a>, if there is the <code>EXTERNALLY-MANAGED</code> marker file in the Python distribution, then packages won't be installed.</p>
<p>However, the env variable <code>PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES</code> can make <code>pip</code> to forcely install to externally managed Python distribution. I try to migrate <code>pip</code> to <code>uv</code> but <code>uv</code> doesn't seem to respect <code>PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES</code> so I guess there is just no way to skip that check. An workaround is that I just remove the <code>/usr/lib/python3.x/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED</code> file.</p>
<p>My use case is that I am making a read-only Singularity image (it's just like a Docker image). So I just don't care about that.</p>
