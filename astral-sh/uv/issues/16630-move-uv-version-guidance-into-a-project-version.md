# Move `uv version` guidance into a "Project version" concept

---

_@terror_

The "Building and publishing a package" guide currently documents `uv version` behavior that really belongs in conceptual docs. We should move the full `uv version` explanation into a dedicated “Project version” section under `docs/concepts/projects/config.md`, trimming the guide to a short summary that links to the concept page, and ensuring other references point to the new section.
