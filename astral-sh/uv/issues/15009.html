            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It is tedious to keep typing <code>--no-dev</code> on a platform that is meant for production testing only. I think it would be more convenient to respect an env var <code>UV_NO_DEV</code> when present. Alternatively, I would appreciate support for <code>UV_DEFAULT_GROUPS</code>, but that seems way more complex since it is not a simple boolean value.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>I want <code>pre-commit</code> installed when developing a project for embedded-Linux environments. But users that try the lib from an embedded-Linux env do not need any additional dependencies installed. Thus, the <code>--no-dev</code> option is the only way around that. I'm against removing <code>dev</code> from the default groups, because it may cause git to crash when the pre-commit binary executable is no longer in the venv for which <code>uv run pre-commit install</code> was invoked.</p>
<p>I have considered adding <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/#environment-markers">env markers</a> on all my dependencies in my dev group. Sadly, the available markers do not provide an adequate way of identifying an embedded-Linux env. For instance, the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka/blob/main/setup.py"><code>adafruit-blinka</code> package dynamically declares dependencies in it's setup.py for sdist</a> (which is not ideal and only really works because of the <a href="https://www.piwheels.org/">piwheels index</a> added to default indexes in all RPi OS).</p>
