Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p>It would be cool to have a possibility to audit licenses of dependencies like <code>pip-license</code> does. (And including the new License-Expression in Metadata 2.4)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh would an appropriate approach here to include license information in the <code>uv.lock</code> file? I am new to the <code>uv</code> codebase, but exploring the feasibility of adding this capability.</p>
<p>It seems that ideally given a set of dependencies pulled in from a Lockfile that we would then introspect the license and report back.  I spent an ~hour exploring the <code>Package</code> and <code>PackageMetadata</code> data models. It seems like most of what is discovered by the resolver is ultimately serialized into uv.lock and I'm not sure that would be appropriate here.</p>
<p>I'm exploring the codepath of <code>uv tree</code> as that seems most conceptually similar. Given a list of Packages, what would the most sensible way be to access either (a) classifiers, and/or (b) pyproject toml license data?</p>
