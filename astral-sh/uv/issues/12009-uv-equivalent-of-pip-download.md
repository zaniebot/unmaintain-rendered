# uv equivalent of `pip download`

---

_@alechouse97_

### Summary

Is there a uv equivalent of `pip download` that pulls all the whl files for a project, but just drops them into a local directory instead of installing? I cannot immediately find a replacement.

This is useful (any really the only way) when installing packages on a system without an external network connection.

Is this something that is willing to be supported?

### Example

_No response_
