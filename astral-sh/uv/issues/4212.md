# Project environment creation doesn't respect version specifiers in `requires-python`

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-10 19:17_

Per https://github.com/charliermarsh/autobot/actions/runs/9454139177/job/26041035557?pr=4, it looks like `requires-python = ">=3.8"` gets parsed as an executable named `>=3.8`. I think stringifying there probably _never_ works for `requires-python`? But I'd have to look at the tests to understand whether there's some case it _is_ handling today.
