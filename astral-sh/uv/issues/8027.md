# Add `uv tool upgrade-all`

---

_Issue opened by @dpoznik on 2024-10-09 00:11_

I think it would be helpful to add a `uv tool upgrade-all` subcommand to upgrade all installed tools, like [`pipx upgrade-all`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/#pipx-upgrade-all).

You can do `uv tool upgrade --all`.
