            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When developing CPython extensions it is very useful to develop and test on non-optimized, <code>--with-pydebug</code> builds of Python. The set of asserts enabled by such builds provide early warning of a plethora of otherwise tricky to detect bugs, most notably bad reference counting.</p>
<p>Doing so today requires developers to download and compile all relevant versions, and somehow make those versions available to their virtual environment managers (you typically don't want these in <code>PATH</code>). <code>uv</code> could simplify this workflow greatly for most use-cases.</p>
<p><code>uv</code> already provides a free-threaded variant via the <code>t</code> suffix for freethreaded python, see https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/320</p>
<p>The same could be provided for <code>--with-pydebug</code> builds via <code>d</code> suffixed versions</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>uv python install 3.13d
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We were about half-way there on this so I pushed some progress https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11520 — will discuss more the state of it there but if you're interested in contributing it could use some help.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah crap, I promise I tried to search for extant issues. Thanks for the rapid response.</p>
<p>I'll give a look through of the existing work and discuss in the MR if there's anything I think is a problem or can help with.</p>
