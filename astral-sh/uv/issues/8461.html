            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I uninstalled uv from my machine, deleted it from my bashrc and cleared my cache however I still get some issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to uninstall and reinstall uv locally because <code>uv add</code> and <code>uv sync</code> were failing however <code>uv pip install</code> was working. I tried running <code>uv cache clean</code>, <code>uv cache prune</code>, <code>uv self updated</code> however all these commands with fail saying command not found.</li>
<li>I decided to follow this stack overflow article to uninstall uv (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78076401/uninstall-uv-python-package-installer) and it didnt work.</li>
<li>I did a pip uninstall of uv but i expected it to fail since i got it via brew</li>
<li>I ran the commands mentioned on the official uv page and even went to the locations to verify no uv, however I can still run uv in my shell.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you have to uninstall with Homebrew, or even just remove the binary (<code>rm -rf /opt/homebrew/bin/uv</code>).</p>
