# Can the `--help` output be wrapped differently?

---

_Issue opened by @bluetech on 2024-04-16 08:28_

The `uv pip install --help` output looks like this for me:

![image](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/assets/1223550/60d7511e-9f64-41c3-a8d7-3fd19c4fd8b1)

This is pretty minor, but the long lines which wrap (the "When enabled ..." lines in this image) are not indented, which makes it hard (for me at least) to quickly scan the options. I think for this reason usually the wrapping is indented.

For contract, here is part of `ruff check --help`:

![image](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/assets/1223550/679eec76-cc39-4937-a492-4a175ad86f42)

and `pip install --help`:

We probably just need to do the same thing we did over at Ruff in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9633
