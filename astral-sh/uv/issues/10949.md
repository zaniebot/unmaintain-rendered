# Alias pip

---

_Issue opened by @stevenwalton on 2025-01-24 22:59_

### Summary

Some programs or scripts expect pip to be installed and then will fail because you're using a `uv` environment or *worse* packages will be downloaded into an environment that that you weren't expecting. This can be easily solved with a simple script (many ways to skin this cat)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

pip() {
    uv pip "$@"
}

pip "$@"
```

Effectively this is doing `alias pip=uv pip`. If this lives in `.venv/bin` then it'll be in the user's `$PATH` and 

### Example

```bash
$ uv venv
$ pip install foo
zsh: command not found: pip
$ echo -e "#\!/usr/bin/env bash\n\npip() {\n\tuv pip \"\$@\"\n}\n\npip \"\$@\"" > .venv/bin/pip
$ chmod +x .venv/bin/pip
$ pip install foo
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there are no versions of foo and you require foo, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
```
