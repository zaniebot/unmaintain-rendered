Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

<p><code>uv pip install -i https://pypi.some.address/simple . --prerelease=allow</code>
uv 0.2.21
Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS</p>
<p>Hi! Thank you for a great tool.
I have most of my packages pinned to exact version. And the list of requirements is very long.
I found out that with uv still scans the repo even for other versions and platforms. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">error: Failed to download `simplejson==3.11.0`
  Caused by: HTTP status client error (404 Not Found) for url (https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/89/a3/99dbad31efaa84da0443ebe277fa4e4a6ade4200607f0851c76c0aa031a5/simplejson-3.11.0-cp27-cp27mu-macosx_10_11_x86_64.whl)
</code></pre>
<p>Even when I asked for <code>simplejson==3.17.0</code> on linux.</p>
<p>First, I should say thanks for showing the problems with our repo. I fixed them all.</p>
<p>But at least I want them to be shown all together and not one-by-one with pretty long resolving stage. Or skip those errors if there are &quot;good&quot; versions available.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks -- that's an interesting one. Hard to know why <code>simplejson==3.11.0</code> without seeing the full list of requirements and understanding the dependency tree, but agree that's strange. Not 100% sure how we should handle 404s like that.</p>
