# Global venv registry

---

_Issue opened by @theelderbeever on 2025-10-23 16:23_

### Summary

I am attempting to replace `pyenv` with `uv` and one of the functions that doesn't seem covered right now is the concept of global named virtual environments. `pyenv` stores its virtualenvs in `PYENV_HOME` and can be activated by name. ie: `pyenv activate my-env` from anywhere. Supporting something similar would be really nice as python is such a general purpose language being able to jump into a virtualenv anywhere for some quick scripting is helpful.

### Example

Define a `UV_HOME/virtualenvs` directory or use something like `XDG_CONFIG/uv/virtualenvs`.

Extend `uv venv` to 
```bash
uv venv -g/--global [name] # As opposed to path. The `-g` flag could enforce that name/path can't be nested. ie: no `/`
```

Add an activation command
These would be potentially breaking changes
```bash
uv venv --activate [name] 
uv venv activate [name]
```

Or a non-breaking change option
```bash
uv activate -g/--global [name] # if no name or global flag is provided it could just activate the first discovered virtualenv
uv deactivate
```

This sounds like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1495

@konstin hey! Yes it very much does! Sorry for the duplicate.

That said I think that one still assumes a project.toml and the venv is tied to a project. I would want something fully separate.

(Gonna merge since the ideas are similar.)
