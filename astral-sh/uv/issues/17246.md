# Auto-completion of project.scripts commands

---

_Issue opened by @TurtleOrangina on 2025-12-28 08:37_

### Summary

I would like to be able to:
`uv run enab[tab]` to get `uv run enable-warp-drive`

When using `uv run command` instead of activating the virtual environment and using `command`, many issues with outdated dependencies are avoided, so this is the recommended work-flow. The main down-side I encounter, is that I cannot auto-complete commands that are defined in the `[project.scripts]` of my `pyproject.toml`.

I tried on both bash and zsh. I have the relevant `eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion zsh)"` line in my .zshrc, but still it doesn't work for scripts. It works fine for paths, e.g. I can auto-complete `uv run src/spaceship/cli/enable_warp_drive.py`.

Note that this issue will become useful to even more people if #5903 is implemented, as that will add a second section where scripts can be defined. But it is already very useful now, in projects withere `project.scripts` is used.

### Example

I have prepared a repo for reproduction:

```
git clone https://github.com/TurtleOrangina/spaceship.git
cd spaceship
uv run ena[tab] # does not autocomplete
uv run enable-warp-drive # works when typed out
uv run src/spaceship/cli/enable_warp_drive.py # auto-completes fine
uv run ena[tab] # still does not autocomplete
```

The ideal solution in my mind: The auto-completion code that is generated via `uv generate-shell-completion` could be extended to also auto-complete the defined scripts.

Currently I use a work-around for zsh from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8432#issuecomment-2605216865 - this does allow binaries from `.venv/bin` to be auto-completed - but with the draw-back that it only works once those files are actually created - so with a fresh check-out, where .venv doesn't even exist yet, the auto-complete will not work. In the above example code, the first `uv run ena[tab]` still fails with this work-around, but the second one `uv run ena[tab]` would work (because we successfully created the .venv with the commands in between).

This request seems to be a subset of what is requested by #15325

Hi @TurtleOrangina, thanks for filing. Yeah, I agree this is a subset of #15325, let's dedupe and track there!
