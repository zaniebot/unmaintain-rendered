# uv pip install -e fails with spaces

_Issue opened by @csm10495 on 2024-09-28 19:02_

Hey folks,

Running: 
```
python.exe -m uv pip install -e "C:/Users/csm10495/AppData/Local/Jenkins/.jenkins/workspace/Update Lump Status/csmutil"
```
fails with something like: 

```
error: Failed to parse: `C:\Users\csm10495\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Update Lump Status\csmutil`
  Caused by: Expected end of input or `;`, found `L`
C:\Users\csm10495\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Update Lump Status\csmutil
```

With verbose:

```
C:\Users\csm10495\AppData\Local\Jenkins\.jenkins\workspace\Update Lump Status\infra\Scripts>python.exe -m uv --verbose p
ip install -e "C:/Users/csm10495/AppData/Local/Jenkins/.jenkins/workspace/Update Lump Status/csmutil"
DEBUG uv 0.4.17
error: Failed to parse: `C:/Users/csm10495/AppData/Local/Jenkins/.jenkins/workspace/Update Lump Status/csmutil`
  Caused by: Expected end of input or `;`, found `L`
C:/Users/csm10495/AppData/Local/Jenkins/.jenkins/workspace/Update Lump Status/csmutil
```

I've tried flipping the / to \ as well. It gets the same error.

I think it doesn't seem to like the space in the path.

Debug info:
```
uv --version
uv 0.4.17 (d2e7b40ce 2024-09-27)
```

Windows 10. Python 3.11.0.

Running the exact same command without uv (via pip directly) works fine.
