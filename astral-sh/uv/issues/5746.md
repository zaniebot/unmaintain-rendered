# `Environment variables` doc should mention XDG_* variables

---

_Issue opened by @j178 on 2024-08-03 12:40_

I think uv uses
- XDG_CONFIG_HOME
- XDG_BIN_HOME
- XDG_DATA_HOME
- XDG_CACHE_HOME

these should be mentioned in `Environement varibles` page.

_Renamed from "`Environment variables` doc should mention `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_BIN_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`" to "`Environment variables` doc should mention XDG_* variables" by @j178 on 2024-08-03 12:41_
