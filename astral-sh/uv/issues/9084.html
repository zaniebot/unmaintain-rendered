            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m coming from a poetry background here and one thing I regularly need to do is upgrade multiple packages to the latest compatible version, while leaving others untouched. With poetry, this is <code>poetry show -o</code> to list packages where updates are available, and then I can <code>poetry add {package}@latest</code> to upgrade the ones I want to upgrade - after each upgrade, I then run the test suite to make sure nothing has broken (so I definitely don&#x27;t want to upgrade everything all at once).</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to do this on a project I&#x27;ve converted to <code>uv</code> but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a simple way to do this. These are what I&#x27;ve found in the docs...</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv add &#x27;httpx&gt;0.1.0&#x27; --upgrade-package httpx</code> is incredibly verbose and requires me to look up what bounds I want to give it - ie: <code>uv add httpx --upgrade-package httpx</code> does nothing. Doing this for a lot of packages takes <em>considerably</em> longer than the poetry way.</li>
<li><code>uv lock --upgrade-package requests</code> only works with loose constraints in the pyproject.toml so I&#x27;m having to go in and hand edit the pyproject.toml in order to test the project with the latest version</li>
</ul>
<p>Have I missed something in the docs? Is support for <code>uv add {package}@latest</code> or similar on the roadmap at all?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you explain why <code>uv lock --upgrade-package requests</code> isn&#x27;t working here? Do you have an upper-bound on your package or something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @charliermarsh - yes, exactly that. The pyproject.toml had, if I remember correctly,<code>~=</code> some version. I&#x27;m bound to be doing the above flows while switching another project over to <code>uv</code> soon so I&#x27;ll post a more concrete example soon.</p>
<p>PS. Thank you so much for <code>ruff</code> and <code>uv</code>, they&#x27;re the most exciting things to happen to Python in years.</p>
