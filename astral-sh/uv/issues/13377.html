            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a pyproject.toml like the one below. It does not have dependencies but has dev dependencies for the documentation and tests. I would be able to install them in a dev environment, but I could not get it. I tried with <code>uv sync</code>, <code>uv sync --dev</code> but that is not working. Am I missing something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We'd need an MRE to help here, I've never seen the development dependencies not sync.</p>
<p><code>dev</code> is included in the <code>default-groups</code> so it's included during <code>uv sync</code> without <code>--dev</code>.</p>

<p>How are you concluding that it isn't working? Can you provide a clear list of reproduction steps that we can run on our own machine?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After I deleted the venv and created again with <code>uv sync</code> I cannot reproduce the issue. The dev dependencies are installed as expected with <code>uv sync</code>.
My guess is that I entered into a non-uv venv, created with <code>python -m venv</code>, and for that reason it didn't work properly, does it makes sense? (I'm testing migrating a repo from pip to uv, for that reason I had venvs created in different ways).
Closed since there is no issue anymore.</p>
