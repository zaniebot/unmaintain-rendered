# uv installer erroneously complains about shadowed commands

---

_Issue opened by @thatch on 2025-03-10 17:48_

### Summary

Apologies for the vague bugreport now -- I intend to try on more Linux docker images tonight and see if there's more of a pattern to where this shows up.

On a fresh Raspbian 12 install, using the installer command at
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

prints this at the end

```
WARNING: The following commands are shadowed by other commands in your PATH: uv uvx
```

However, I don't think that's true -- `which -a uv` and trying to run it directly don't seem to indicate that it's currently available on $PATH (and notably, `~/.local/bin` is not on my path in that shell session yet).

### Platform

Raspbian 12

### Version

0.6.5

### Python version

Python 3.11.2

This has been fixed by https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1735, we need to update the uv installer to pull that fix in.

@Gankra adding you to this per our previous discussion

This should ideally be fixed the next time we release uv, as astral-sh/cargo-dist has the patch.

I just installed uv on MacOS Sonoma and got this same error message:

WARN: The following commands are shadowed by other commands in your PATH: uv uvx

Just installed using sh script on arch linux and got the warning that uv and uvx are being shadowed.
I checked all dirs on my PATH and I don't find any other uv or uvx.
Should this be fixed or do I perhaps indeed have multiple uv and uvx binaries?

What does `where uv` show?

---

_Comment by @aquacode on 2025-08-29 12:39_

uv: /usr/include/uv /home/mike/.local/bin/uv

Looks like the /usr/include/uv is libuv, but it's not on my PATH

I couldn't find any other references
