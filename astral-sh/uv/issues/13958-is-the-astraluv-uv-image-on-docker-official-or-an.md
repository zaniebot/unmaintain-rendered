# Is the astraluv/uv image on Docker official or an imposter?

---

_Issue opened by @gnowland on 2025-06-10 22:05_

### Question

I know `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv` is the official channel for getting docker images, but noticed `astraluv/uv` was added to docker hub 17 days ago. Is this associated with the official project, or an imposter?

https://hub.docker.com/r/astraluv/uv

### Platform

### Version

That is not official.

We'll look into contacting them and DockerHub.

It doesn't look malicious, but I would not recommend using it.
