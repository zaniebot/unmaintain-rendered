Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>When a package uses <a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools-scm">setuptools-scm</a>, the version is not correctly retrieved if reinstalling in editable mode after new release.</p>
<p><code>uv 0.4.3 (Homebrew 2024-09-02)</code> on macOS</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
Let's take the <a href="https://github.com/pypsa/pypsa">PyPSA</a> package for example.
Works fine initially and retrieves correct version (<code>0.30.0.post1.dev2+g191bea7c</code> currently):</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA.git
cd PyPSA
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
</code></pre>
<p>But when coming back to the repo at a later stage after a new release  (let's say <code>0.30.1</code> as an example)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git pull --tags
&gt; From https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA
&gt; * [new tag]           v0.30.1    -&gt; v0.30.1
</code></pre>
<p>uv will not retrieve the new version (<code>v0.30.1</code>) but will just add a new dev version to the previous one (e.g. <code>v0.30.0.post1.devx+x</code>).</p>
<p>You have to remove the env and install without cache to retrieve the correct version again. Just deleting the env or just ignoring the cache will not work.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rm -r .venv
uv venv
uv pip install -e . -n
</code></pre>
<p>While <code>pip</code> installs the correct version immediately, without ignoring the cache or creating a new environment.</p>
<p>This is a made up case. To reproduce you need a cloned repo with the package installed and wait for a new release to see the behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like you're working with a package with dynamic metadata? If you want it to be reinstalled, you should mark it as such via <code>reinstall-package</code>: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#dynamic-metadata.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, thanks!
Isn't it a bit counterintuitive that local editables need to be uncached and explicitly reinstalled to update their dynamic metadata? I guess you have your reasons and it makes sense with the aggressive caching. But only after reading <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/">Caching | uv</a> and <code>pip</code> is behaving very differently.</p>
<p>To get the same behaviour of <code>pip install -e .</code>, I need to run</p>
<pre><code>uv pip install -e . -n --reinstall-package package_name
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a tradeoff but non-dynamic, non-extension modules never need to be rebuilt, and unfortunately we can't reliably know when a local editable with dynamic metadata would need to be rebuilt. We have commands like <code>uv run</code> that automatically keep the user's environment in-sync with their dependencies, without the need to explicitly lock, sync, or activate an environment. If we always rebuilt dynamic modules in that context, you'd get a rebuild on every command, so we made the decision to require explicit opt-in for rebuilds.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's an interesting suggestion here (#6255) to allow users to mark certain files as part of the cache key (e.g., if they read from <code>requirements.txt</code>); we could probably also extend that to reading from Git.</p>
