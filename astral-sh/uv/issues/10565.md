# Name discrepancy in pip install --config-setting / --config-settings

---

_Issue opened by @cpburnz on 2025-01-13 14:53_

Regular `pip install` has the option `--config-settings` (note that "settings" is plural) to pass settings to the build backend. Under the `uv pip install` "Build options" help section, the option is named `--config-setting` (note that "setting" is singular). After some experienting, uv appears to accept `--config-settings` despite it being undocumented. It would be helpful if the alternative name `--config-settings` in `uv pip install --help` was mentioned for pip compatibility.

We do this for a variety of settings since it's a common footgun (same for `--constraint` and `--constraints`), but candidly I don't think it's worth including it in the command-line help for every setting. It's precious real estate and we already have a lot to show. \cc @zanieb in case you disagree.

I'd be okay with rendering aliases in the CLI reference / long-help  e.g. `uv help`
