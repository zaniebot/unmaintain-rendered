            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uv version: 0.1.24
Platform: WSL on Windows 11
uv was installed by <code>pipx</code></p>
<p>I&#x27;m using <code>uv pip compile</code> to generate a <code>requirements.txt</code> file from a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. Based on version requirements in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, one of the dependencies of my dependencies appears to require a prerelease version. I set the <code>--prerelease=if-necessary-or-explicit</code> flag (which says it&#x27;s the default anyway), but the compile fails, saying that <code>--prerelease=allow</code> is required. If I use <code>--prerelease=allow</code>, the compile does indeed work. However, if I use <code>--prerelease=allow</code>, uv eagerly sets other dependencies to prerelease versions that don&#x27;t need to be prerelease, which I don&#x27;t want.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a bug? Should <code>--prerelease=if-necessary-or-explicit</code> resolve dependencies as I&#x27;d expect in this case?</li>
<li>If it isn&#x27;t a bug, is there a way to do what I want? i.e., only resolve prerelease versions if it is absolutely needed to resolve my dependencies?</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#x27;s a simplified <code>pyproject.toml</code> file that reproduces my problem:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;example&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.10&quot;
dependencies = [
    &quot;azure-cli&gt;2.50.0&quot;,
    &quot;beautifulsoup4&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#x27;s the command that produces the error:</p>
<pre><code>$ uv pip compile --generate-hashes --upgrade --prerelease=if-necessary-or-explicit --output-file=requirements.txt pyproject.toml
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of azure-keyvault-keys==4.8.0b2 and azure-cli&gt;=2.51.0,&lt;=2.53.1 depends on azure-keyvault-keys==4.8.0b2, we can conclude that azure-cli&gt;=2.51.0,&lt;=2.53.1 cannot
      be used.
      And because only the following versions of azure-cli are available:
          azure-cli&lt;=2.50.0
          azure-cli==2.51.0
          azure-cli==2.52.0
          azure-cli==2.53.0
          azure-cli==2.53.1
          azure-cli==2.54.0
          azure-cli==2.55.0
          azure-cli==2.56.0
          azure-cli==2.57.0
          azure-cli==2.58.0
      we can conclude that azure-cli&gt;2.50.0,&lt;2.54.0 cannot be used. (1)

      Because there is no version of azure-keyvault-administration==4.4.0b2 and azure-cli&gt;=2.54.0 depends on azure-keyvault-administration==4.4.0b2, we can conclude that azure-cli&gt;=2.54.0 cannot
      be used.
      And because we know from (1) that azure-cli&gt;2.50.0,&lt;2.54.0 cannot be used, we can conclude that azure-cli&gt;2.50.0 cannot be used.
      And because example depends on azure-cli&gt;2.50.0, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.

      hint: azure-keyvault-keys was requested with a pre-release marker (e.g., azure-keyvault-keys==4.8.0b2), but pre-releases weren&#x27;t enabled (try: `--prerelease=allow`)

      hint: azure-keyvault-administration was requested with a pre-release marker (e.g., azure-keyvault-administration==4.4.0b2), but pre-releases weren&#x27;t enabled (try: `--prerelease=allow`)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, with the <code>--prerelease=allow</code> flag, the command works, but then <code>beautfulsoup4</code> resolves to <code>beautifulsoup4==4.13.0b2</code>. Without the <code>--prerelease=allow</code> flag beautifulsoup4 resolves to <code>beautifulsoup4==4.12.3</code>, the version I would like it to resolve to.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think uv supports what you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s described in more detail here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md#pre-release-compatibility. The core idea is that we need to know upfront which packages are <em>allowed</em> to use pre-releases, because changing the set of <em>allowed</em> packages over the course of resolution creates a lot of complexity.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No prob! I&#x27;m hoping to expand pre-release support at some point but it&#x27;s tricky and the spec needs to evolve a bit to make the expectations clear for tools.</p>
