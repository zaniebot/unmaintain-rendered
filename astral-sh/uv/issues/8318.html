            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had installed <code>uv</code> from <code>brew</code> and was trying to run <code>uv self update</code>. However, that won't work (and it shouldn't, so kudos)!
The only thing was that the error message could be improved a bit.</p>
<pre><code>mahyar@lioness vivaldi % uv self update
error: unrecognized subcommand 'self'

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] &lt;COMMAND&gt;

For more information, try '--help'.
mahyar@lioness vivaldi % uv --version
uv 0.4.18 (Homebrew 2024-10-01)
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to see something along the lines of &quot;Hey, it looks like you're trying to self-update. However, <code>uv</code> was installed from <source> and cannot be updated in this way. Please use your package manager to update.&quot; or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Thanks for a great and fast tool.</p>
