            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p><strong>Describe the bug</strong>
When declaring a dependency with an environment marker in pyproject.toml—for example:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;example&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;==3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
  &quot;tensorrt-cu12==10.3.0; sys_platform == &#x27;linux&#x27; and platform_machine == &#x27;x86_64&#x27;&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>uv should evaluate the environment marker (sys_platform == &#x27;linux&#x27; and platform_machine == &#x27;x86_64&#x27;), skip the tensorrt-cu12 dependency on ARM64, and successfully complete uv sync without error. Instead, on an ARM64 (Jetson Orin) environment, <code>uv sync</code> still tries to build tensorrt-cu12, resulting in a build error.</p>
<p><strong>Minimal reproduction</strong>
Use the following Dockerfile and run docker build .:</p>
<pre><code>FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.6.0-debian-slim

COPY &lt;&lt;EOF /mre/pyproject.toml
[project]
name = &quot;example&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;==3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
  &quot;tensorrt-cu12==10.3.0; sys_platform == &#x27;linux&#x27; and platform_machine == &#x27;x86_64&#x27;&quot;
]
EOF

WORKDIR /mre
RUN uv sync
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Error output on ARM64 (Jetson Orin)</strong></p>
<pre><code>× Failed to build `tensorrt-cu12==10.3.0`
├─▶ The build backend returned an error
╰─▶ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel` failed (exit status: 1)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe this is correct, because <code>uv sync</code> needs to determine the dependencies of <code>tensorrt-cu12==10.3.0</code>, and that package only publishes a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tensorrt-cu12/10.3.0/#files">source distribution</a>. So, to get the dependencies, we need to run a build step, regardless of what platform you&#x27;re on.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I’m aware that the <code>tensorrt-cu12</code> package is only available as a source distribution and cannot be built for ARM64. Therefore, I’d like the resolver to simply skip any dependency resolution for <code>tensorrt-cu12</code> on ARM64 as described in <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#platform-specific-dependencies">platform-specific-dependencies</a></p>
<p>I’m trying to set up an environment where TensorRT can run on both x86 and Jetson platforms. In this setup, I need to include <code>tensorrt-cu12</code> as a dependency for x86, but on Jetson I’m using a self-hosted TensorRT package that works standalone, so there’s no need to add <code>tensorrt-cu12</code> as a dependency there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Totally, I understand. What you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t compatible with <code>uv.lock</code>, though. <code>uv.lock</code> resolves for all environments, so we need to know the dependencies. And that package doesn&#x27;t declare them statically. So we need to get them somehow. Otherwise, how can we produce a lockfile that works on x86 and ARM? We have to be able to resolve.</p>
<p>(If they release with a newer version of <code>setuptools</code>, then we could extract them statically and it wouldn&#x27;t be necessary to build the package, even if they don&#x27;t ship a wheel.)</p>
<p>(If you resolve on x86 and commit the <code>uv.lock</code>, that&#x27;s another valid answer, since we won&#x27;t need to build the package on ARM if the lockfile already exists.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I fully understand. Thank you. When I run <code>uv sync</code>, it needs to generate uv.lock, and to do so—even on an arm64 platform—it still tries to build <code>tensorrt-cu12</code> in order to fetch its metadata.</p>
<p>I also now see why uv sync began failing on arm64 in version 0.6.0. When I unpacked the tensorrt-cu12 package from PyPI, I found its metadata stored inside the <code>.egg-info</code> files. In the commit <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11395">astral-sh/uv#11395</a> between uv 0.5.31 and 0.6.0, those <code>.egg-info</code> contents are no longer referenced, so the metadata can’t be retrieved anymore.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah right, that makes sense. We removed that behavior since it was non-standard and problematic in some cases. Source distributions built with newer versions of <code>setuptools</code> should have reliable static metadata which solves this problem going forward.</p>
