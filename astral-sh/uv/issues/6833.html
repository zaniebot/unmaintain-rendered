Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

<p>uv 0.4.0 (d9bd3bc7a 2024-08-28)</p>
<p>After one of the previous releases (I believe after 0.4.0) FastAPI docs on initailizing a project looks a little bit ouf of date https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/fastapi/#initializing-a-fastapi-project</p>
<p>After some experimenting I noticed that initializing a project with one of the following two commands doesn't create <code>src</code> directory with <code>uv 0.4.0</code>.</p>
<p><code>uv init app</code> (default)
<code>uv init --app app</code> (App project)</p>
<p>Currently FastAPI integration docs linked above say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>uv uses a <code>src</code> layout for newly-created projects</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it only seems to be true for commands like <code>uv init --lib app</code>  which doesn't look applicable.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the tree structure example
/https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blame/main/docs/guides/integration/fastapi.md#L100-L115</p>
<p>and the command
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blame/main/docs/guides/integration/fastapi.md#L119-L121</p>
<p>seem to also need to be adjusted for the current <code>uv init</code> behaviour</p>
<p>Initially I tried to follow the FastAPI integration guide exclusively. When I couldn't make it work as described I tried to reference other parts of docs (<code>uv init</code> reference and Projects section). Although I didn't find any incositencies, it felt like the behavior around <code>src</code> directory could be documented a little bit more explicitly (for us <code>uv</code> newcomers), especially after adding <code>--app</code> and <code>--lib</code>.</p>
<p>I would like to create a PR for FastAPI integration docs, and optionally for clarifying directory structure behaviour.</p>
