# With Docker, why bind mount pyproject.toml+uv.lock instead of COPYing them?

_Issue opened by @quinn-soartech on 2025-09-09 14:57_

### Question

[The documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#intermediate-layers) recommends bind mounting `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` when installing dependencies:
```Dockerfile
# Install dependencies
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    --mount=type=bind,source=uv.lock,target=uv.lock \
    --mount=type=bind,source=pyproject.toml,target=pyproject.toml \
    uv sync --locked --no-install-project
```

Question 1: what's the rationale for doing that instead of:
```Dockerfile
# Install dependencies
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --locked --no-install-project
```

Asking because the bind-mount happened to cause a permissions issue in a Dockerfile of mine where the `uv sync` command was being run as a non-`root` user.

Question 2: those bind mounts can be `readonly`, right?

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.8.15
```

You can copy them, but then they're present in the layer which increases the size of the image. It's not really a big deal, but people like tiny images and there's no need for them to be present at container run time. 

They should be fine as read only.

Makes sense, thanks.
