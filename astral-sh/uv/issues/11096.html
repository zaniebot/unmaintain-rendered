            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm trying to install a package from a local repo via a redirector proxy, which authenticates to AWS Code Artifact (a local Python repository, which can only be used with authentication).
Here's how the proxy works (only the relevant parts):</p>
<ol>
<li>if it gets a <code>GET</code> request with the <code>{path}</code> ending in <code>/</code>, it does a <code>HEAD</code> to https://pypi.org/simple/{path}
1.1. if pypi returns 2xx, the proxy redirects uv to https://pypi.org/simple/{path}, so uv will get the package from pypi
1.2. otherwise it redirects uv to https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{path}, so uv should get the package from Code Artifact</li>
</ol>
<p>uv is instructed to use the proxy with <code>--extra-index-url {proxy_url</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Installing local packages through this proxy and pip works fine, but fails with uv.</strong>
Installing local packages with the authenticated Code Artifact URL ( https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/) in <code>--extra-index-url</code> with uv works.</p>
<p>So it seems when I return a HTTP 302 redirect to an authenticated URL, uv fails to fetch that. I've tried http:// and https:// as the proxy URL (the redirect URL is always https), both fail, so it doesn't seem to be a &quot;https redirect is not followed from a http site&quot; issue.
The domains are different though, but I can't see any errors related to that.</p>
<p>Running uv with <code>RUST_LOG=uv=trace uv pip install --extra-index-url http://{proxy_url}</code> gives:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Between <code>{}</code> the values are redacted and replaced with a sensible name.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be this line:</p>
<pre><code>TRACE Attempting to retry error: Error { kind: WrappedReqwestError(Url { scheme: &quot;http&quot;, cannot_be_a_base: false, username: &quot;&quot;, password: None, host: Some(Domain(&quot;localhost&quot;)), port: None, path: &quot;/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/{AWS_REGION}/{DOMAIN}/python/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/&quot;, query: None, fragment: None }, WrappedReqwestError(Reqwest(reqwest::Error { kind: Status(404), url: &quot;https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/&quot; }))) }
</code></pre>
<p>It says the URL https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/ is 404, although if I do a <code>curl</code> to it, it loads fine.
As it's a 404 and not a 403, basic auth seems to be passed, but the URL might be mangled internally (it must not be the same as the printed one, as it exists).</p>
<p>If I return the package's page directly (proxying it, instead of a redirect to the backend URL), uv gets through it, then fails when trying to download packages (with redirects).
This actually logs an error and the 404 is not just in the TRACE logs:</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to fetch: `http://localhost/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/{AWS_REGION}/{DOMAIN}/python/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}/0.0.10/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}-0.0.10-py3-none-any.whl#sha256=d30cafa1864a752939ec5ad6a56245ed8f78f3f87827e3aa78e09ddeb9023ca4`
  Caused by: HTTP status client error (404 Not Found) for url (https://aws:{TOKEN}@{DOMAIN}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.d.codeartifact.{AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/pypi/python/simple/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}//0.0.10/{INTERNAL_PACKAGE_NAME}-0.0.10-py3-none-any.whl)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, if I try this URL with <code>curl</code>, it just loads fine.</p>
