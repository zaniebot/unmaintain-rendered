            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, feature request: Poetry has commands for managing the version of the project in the pyproject.toml file. I am able to execute a Poetry command to bump the version in pyproject.toml and then read that value into an environment variable and use that to label a docker image build. There doesn't seem to be any project version management in UV as yet. See Poetry Documentation at <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version">https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version</a></p>
