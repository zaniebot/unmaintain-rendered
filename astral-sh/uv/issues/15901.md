# Preparing packages slow while install flash-attn

_Issue opened by @MrHandsomeljn on 2025-09-17 02:23_

### Question

I installed flash-attn in a relatively closed network environment, only able to use the given index-url. I had no problem installing other packages quickly, but got stuck in the preparing package step while installing flash-attn
```
# uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
warning: The `extra-build-dependencies` option is experimental and may change without warning. Pass `--preview-features extra-build-dependencies` to disable this warning.
Resolved 24 packages in 47ms
   Building flash-attn==2.8.3
⠋ Preparing packages... (0/1)    
```
like this, 20 mins. I would like to ask if there is independent network access for this step? This information can help me debug it. Thanks!

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04.3

### Version

uv 0.8.17

It has to download PyTorch and all of its dependencies, which is several gigabytes. It can take a while depending on your network.

You can use `uv pip install -v` to get more information about what's happening.
