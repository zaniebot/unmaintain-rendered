<p>Any cibuildwheel project building PyPy 3.8(+?) on Windows should show it; the three github.com/pybind/*_example repos for example.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking at it, I wonder if the fact it's using the python executable with PyPy is the issue? Did the logic change recently to assume the executable name for PyPy has pypy in it?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PyPy provides a python executable too.</p>

<p>I think it worked up to 3 weeks ago and started failing 2 weeks ago. Another example is boost-histogram: https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram/actions/runs/10204535828/job/28250894947?pr=947</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We could see if we can use the pypy executable instead of the python one when setting up the environment with cibuildwheel, but they are supposed to be interchangable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahh, this is what I was remembering: https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/pull/1941. Next release of cibuildwheel will just ignore uv on PyPy 3.8 (and I guess this means it works fine for 3.9+). uv 0.2.25+ seems to be the issue.</p>
