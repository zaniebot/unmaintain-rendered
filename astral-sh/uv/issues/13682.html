            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I am not sure whether it's a good suggestion to compare the pipenv workflow and uv, please correct me if i am off the track.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As in case of pipenv, if there's isn't venv created for the project, invoking <code>pipenv shell</code> will create the venv automatically and activates it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do we have any plan / existing command to remove venv post de-activation?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Linux 5.14.0-427.40.1.el9_4.x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.6.17</p>

<p>What's the use-case for deleting the environment post-activation?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I mean't deletion of venv directory post &quot;deactivation&quot;.</p>
<p>Context: Pipenv has the command like &quot;pipenv --rm&quot; when executed post exiting the virtual environment, will remove the venv directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It helps to clean up the .venv atleast in case of dev environment, for a quicker cleanup. I agree that we can manually delete perfrom <code>rm -rf .venv</code>, Yet Just out of curiosity, querying if we have any plans to have an --rm flag to clean up the venv as like pipenv and venv activation command.</p>
<p>Eg :</p>
<ul>
<li>uv rm [ Removing the venv directory associated with a pyvenv.cfg file.</li>
<li>uv activate - Activates the venv.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand it helps clean it up, but.. why do you need to clean it up?</p>
<p>See the aforementioned issue for details on why activation is complicated. I don't think we can implement a meaningful <code>--rm</code> flag without the <code>uv shell</code> command.</p>
<p>I don't think we'll add a dedicated <code>uv rm</code> flag for deleting environments without strong motivating use-cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed, my only thought is to have an option that allow me to start from scratch if my current venv has been messed up with multiple packages.</p>
<p>Lets say I am working on venv &quot;A&quot; - where I have messed with with some misc, Instead of doing rm -rf .venv, Just thought If we could have an command just &quot;uv rm' which will clean up <strong>pycache</strong>, egg-info, .venv.</p>
