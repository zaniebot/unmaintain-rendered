Problem description
<p>However, let&#x27;s say we run <code>uv tool install pxpx</code> and forget that we did so.</p>
<p><code>uvx</code>&#x27;s behavior becomes quite confusing. Note that, even with verbose output, it looks exactly as if the <code>px</code> package version 0.2.2 provided the <code>px</code> binary that <code>uvx</code> ran (this output is nearly identical to the one in the fold above):</p>

</code></pre>
<p>When I looked at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/px/">the <code>px</code> package</a> and realized that this is not supposed to happen, I was quite scared for a hot second that this was a typosquatter that hacked my machine by providing me with a trojan that pretends to be the <code>px</code> I expected. But actually, <code>uvx</code> just ran the installed version of <code>px</code> from <code>pxpx-3.6.5</code> without telling me[^1] (not even in verbose logs!).</p>
<p>I think that, ideally, <code>uvx px</code> should consistently fail, and perhaps give people a friendly message if it can detect that some of the installed tool on the system provide a <code>px</code> binary.</p>
<p>[^1]: Or, maybe, the trojan is so good to take over my web browser and make me believe this is what happened. 😛</p>
