# uv for debian

### Question

Hi! I maintain several Debian packages of tools I use and are not in the official debian mirror.
Some time ago I decided to package and publish UV
The packaging is in this repo
https://github.com/dariogriffo/uv-debian
Would you consider add this to the docs?
In the readme is explained how to install it from apt

### Platform

### Version

Nice to see a debian package! Unfortunately, for policy and security reasons, we only include installers in the docs that are either maintained by us or by a well established organisation (such as homebrew).
