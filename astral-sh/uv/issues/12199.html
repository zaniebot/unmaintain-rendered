            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The more I suggest people to use uv the more I hear they accidentally installed package globally instead of virtualenv because they either copypasted some  &quot;pip install foo&quot; instruction or some super new ai library have `os.system(&quot;pip install foo&quot;)</p>
<p>why can uv just put alias inside .venv  pip -&gt; uv pip ?</p>

<p>I see there lot of issues reported this - but I still cannot fully understand why approach above would break things ?</p>

<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1657</li>
</ul>
<p>From my personal perspective, I don't think it's a good idea for pip to be an alias for uv pip, because they are not fully compatible.
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/</p>
<p>Speaking of the latest version of uv, do you think any of the previous discussions are now outdated?</p>

<p>Does it solve the issue when some have <code>os.system(&quot;pip install huggingface&quot;)</code> inside python code?</p>
<p>If uv wants to get rid of pip - maybe alias inside venv should throw an error like - &quot;hey do not use pip - use uv pip/add)&quot; (when -- seed was not used)</p>
<p>That way people will slowly abandon the mussel memory of using pip</p>

<p>Should uv be trying to solve libraries which have bad code in them? That's not even a good way to call pip, and may result in random errors on different users machines.</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather uv try to push standard dependency management, through pyproject.toml or scripts with in line metadata. Not preempting bad code.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I don't think that's an explicit goal of astral. Pip will likely remain the core bootstrapping library for the foreseeable future, and in many environments be the packaging installer available to use.</p>

<p>Sure - getting rid of pip should not be the goal</p>
<p>What I see as a problem that uv venv does not seed pip by default</p>
<p>And once venv initialized there is no way to tell if pip was seeded or not</p>
<hr />
<p>Now imagine you are a fresh python developer - some one suggested you to use uv - you initialized it and forgot about it</p>
<p>Next day ChatGPT gives you instructions to run 'pip install foo' - and you got it in global python library (why would you care to read history of all 20 package installers and their behavior)</p>
<p>Thats not good DX - and with LLMs it will keep suggesting pip the same for very long  time</p>
