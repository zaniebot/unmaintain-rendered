            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to start small (as in, a small dependency tree) but with a project that benefits from having a platform independent lock file. So probably a project that utilizes the universal locking of Poetry or PDM.</p>
<p>I'd also like to try locking packse's <code>pyproject.toml</code> and see what happens.</p>
<p>The idea is to see what issues arise with our universal locking implementation in real projects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://github.com/jab/bidict">bidict</a> has a pretty small dependency tree (no runtime deps, and just a <a href="https://github.com/jab/bidict/blob/main/dev-deps/test.in">handful of test deps</a>), in case it's a good candidate for testing this with -- it would exercise resolving different dependencies for different versions of python as well as for different dependency groups all into the same lockfile. It currently uses <code>uv pip compile</code>-<a href="https://github.com/jab/bidict/blob/bf916bd/dev-deps/update_dev_dependencies#L48">generated</a> requirements files (rather than Poetry or PDM). Looking forward to simplifying all those test.txt requirements files (under the <a href="https://github.com/jab/bidict/tree/main/dev-deps">dev-deps/*</a> subtree) that have been required without this feature.</p>
