            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is where UV isn't working and python is
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89aca3de-c037-47d3-bf6c-bb7a99d731d6" alt="Image" />
This is where python gives an error yet Uv can create brotli file which if I remember correctly just brotli's the python file itself I think

<p>This is where seemingly  both work
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/532ad357-687c-463c-a6db-b2aa1592a9de" alt="Image" /></p>
<p>I can provide non visual scripts as well if that could help , I used it because as you can see replicating things caused multiple bugs (where one worked and other didn't so I thought of recording the terminal )</p>
<h3>Platform</h3>
<p>ArchLinux</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>uv 0.5.25 (9c07c3fc5 2025-01-28)</p>
<h3>Python version</h3>
<p>Python 3.12.8</p>

Could you provide a sequence of commands (as text) that I can use to reproduce, along with any test files you're using and a description of the expected behavior vs. the experienced behavior?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/SerJaimeLannister/uv-bug</p>
<p>Created a repository for this.</p>
<p>Try to run each of them by
A) Installing python &amp; brotli &amp; urllib3 (In my case , since I am on archlinux , I did it by sudo pacman -S python-brotli python-urllib3 &amp; run them directly via python 1.py or 2.py and so on
B) Try running them via uv run --with=urllib3 brotli <python filename>.py</p>
<p>Also note that there is a certain example (2.py) where you don't need urllib3 , so maybe if you face an error with this uv command try removing urllib3 from uv run command</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like you're running <code>uv run --with=brotli urllib main-bug.py</code> in which case we think the command is <code>urllib</code> and fail.</p>
<p>You need to repeat <code>--with</code></p>
<pre><code>❯ uv run --with brotli --with urllib3 python -c &quot;import urllib3; import brotli&quot;
Installed 2 packages in 8ms
</code></pre>
