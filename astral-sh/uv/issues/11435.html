            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv tool install glances</code> and <code>uv tool install ipython</code> make those tools generally available in my shell, and they are isolated from each other.</p>
<p>What if I want to install libraries, like numpy or requests, in the same env that ipython is installed in? Or many other libraries? If I recall, I could do this with rye or pipx, but I've looked and talked to a few others, and can't figure it out in uv - so I think this ability doesn't exist yet. If it does, how do I do it?</p>
<p>I'm not asking to put all tools in one env, but to optionally install more than one tool in a shared env.</p>
<p>I toyed with making a uv env in my home directory and using <code>uv add</code> rather than <code>uv tool install</code>, but that changes how all of the projects under my home directory are treated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Although this is marked as closed, I enconted that jupyter-nbconvert comes from nbconvert, while jupyter itself comes from jupyter-core, so I haven't found a way to get both jupyter and jupyter-nbconvert to come from the same venv, since</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv tool install nbconvert --with jupyter</code> makes jupyter-dejavu, and jupyter-nbconvert available</li>
<li><code>uv tool install jupyter-core --with jupyter --with nbconvert</code> make jupyter, jupyter-migrate, and jupyter-troubleshoot available.</li>
