            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've just upgrade to <code>uv==0.3.0</code> and was happy to see a tip about caching in Github actions in the documentation.</p>
<p>Although, by applying what is described in the docs, and running <code>uv cache prune --ci</code>, my entire cache is pruned and I'm left with  a 240KB cache, which is far too small for the dependencies that I have.</p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding how this command should work?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For some use cases, we will prune nearly the entire cache. The details are described <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache/#caching-in-continuous-integration">in the docs</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, it's strange, but it turns out that it's actually (a lot) faster to just re-download from the registry than it is to upload and then re-download from GitHub Actions (which is roughly what happens when you cache the wheels that came from the registry). So counterintuitively, our <code>uv cache prune --ci</code>, removes any <em>wheels</em> that were downloaded from a registry, but keeps any <em>source distributions</em> that you built locally (since those tend to be costly).</p>
