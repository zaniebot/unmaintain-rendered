# Should --exclude-newer warn on "impossible" Python versions?

---

_Issue opened by @mitsuhiko on 2024-11-14 16:53_

Today I was presented with a problem that `--exclude-newer` managed to resolve.  The package was unmaintained for two years, and entirely unpinned.  It was impossible to install without `--exclude-newer`.  However what also was needed is that an older Python version was required as some of the dependencies did not run on 3.12.

I was thinking at that moment that it would have been nice if `uv` would have warned me that I'm using a Python that did not exist at that timestamp yet.

(Also slightly related, the primary user of that problem was not me, but my wife and she was unaware of `--exclude-newer`.  I am also curious if when presented with build/install errors and largely unconstrained source dependencies and some inkling that the package is really old, could suggest to the user that `--exclude-newer` might be a way to make an old package installable)
