            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>My team uses a certain project structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code is divided into python packages (each with its own pyproject.toml) inside a source directory.</li>
<li>The (pytest) tests are their own module, just like pytest likes it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently, we have a PowerShell installation script that installs all those packages in editable mode, and that&#x27;s the way we work.</p>
<pre><code>- source:
  - package_1:
    - pyproject.toml
    - package_1:
      - __init__.py
      - py.typed
      - ...
  - package_2:
    - pyproject.toml
    - package_2:
      - __init__.py
      - py.typed
      - ...
- test:
  - __init__.py
  - conftest.py
  - unit:
    - __init__.py
    - test_something.py
    - ...
</code></pre>
<p>I created an <a href="https://github.com/omer54463/example">example</a> of the same structure, and added my <a href="https://github.com/omer54463/example/tree/refactor/uv">attempt</a> at converting it into a uv workspace.</p>
<p>I encountered two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can&#x27;t install development dependencies. <code>uv pip install .[dev]</code> fails with &quot;Failed to parse metadata from built wheel&quot;.</li>
<li>I am not sure if there&#x27;s an automatic way I can tell uv to install all my workspace packages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated. uv is awesome and incredibly fast, and I would love to use it!</p>

<p>Your root pyproject.toml doesn&#x27;t belong to a package, so <code>uv pip install .</code> falls back to a bogus setuptools build, I opened <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11382">astral-sh/uv#11382</a> to show a better error message here.</p>
<p>In your example, are you looking for the dev group instead of the dev extra?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>You can do that with <code>uv sync --all-packages</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @konstin!</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I want the dev group, since I want development dependencies there. According to the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-tables">documentation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#project-dependencies">project.dependencies</a>: Published dependencies.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#optional-dependencies">project.optional-dependencies</a>: Published optional dependencies, or &quot;extras&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-groups">dependency-groups</a>: <strong><em>Local dependencies for development.</em></strong></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-sources">tool.uv.sources</a>: Alternative sources for dependencies during development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are global to the workspace, where would you put those instead of that workspace-level pyproject.toml (which cannot be installed)?</p>
<p>Also, about that <code>sync</code> thing, I just tried it out, and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it installed my packages:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; uv sync --all-packages
&gt; uv pip list
Package           Version

mypy-extensions   1.0.0

<p>As you can see, no editable (or otherwise) installations <code>calculator</code> and <code>calculator-backend</code>.
Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Placing dependency groups in the root is also what I&#x27;d recommend here. Dependency groups are subtly different from the other dependency kinds, as you can have <code>[dependency-groups]</code> without a <code>[project]</code> table, and you can install groups without installing (or building) any project. The project root <code>pyproject.toml</code> in your example looks correct for the structure you&#x27;re trying to achieve.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s somewhat unintuitive: The packages aren&#x27;t synced since they don&#x27;t declare a <code>[build-system]</code>, so uv assumed they can&#x27;t be build. Adding a build system entry, such as uv&#x27;s default, will make the packages be installed with <code>uv sync --all-packages</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]
requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;]
build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>(You can of course use any build backend, not just hatchling)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This worked for me!
I have one more question - I want to enforce a minimal version of <code>mypy</code>.
Is there a way to control the version of a tool installed by <code>uvx</code> in the workspace level?
Otherwise, I&#x27;d have to resort to installing the tools like my example currently does and use <code>uv run mypy .</code> (or have a lame setup script that does <code>uv tool install mypy==1.14.0</code> and use <code>uvx mypy .</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, nvm. <code>mypy</code> and <code>ruff</code> won&#x27;t work well anyway in a monorepo when they aren&#x27;t running in a <code>venv</code> that has those packages installed (I imagine you&#x27;d get something along the lines of &quot;what the hell is this package my-local-dependency&quot; from either of them).
Thanks @konstin!</p>
