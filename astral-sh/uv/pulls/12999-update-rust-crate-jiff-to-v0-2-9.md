### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.2.9`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#029-2025-04-19)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.8...0.2.9)

\==================
This release includes a bug fix that, in debug mode, could result in datetime
types having different hashes for the same value. This could cause problems,
for example, if you are using datetimes as keys in a hash map. This problem
didn't exist when Jiff was compiled in release mode.

This release also improves the panic message shown when the `js` feature isn't
enabled and the current time is requested on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` targets.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;296](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/296):
    Provide a better panic message when `Zoned::now()` fails on WASM.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;330](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/330):
    Fix bug where `Hash` on datetime types could yield different hash values for
    the same underlying date/time.
