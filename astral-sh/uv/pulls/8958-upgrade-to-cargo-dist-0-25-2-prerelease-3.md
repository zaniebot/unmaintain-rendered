# Upgrade to cargo-dist `0.25.2-prerelease.3`

---

_@zanieb_

Gets us the upstream fix (https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1538Z) for https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/issues/210 so we don't need to patch releases manually for self update to work.

Includes a few other changes, i.e., they validate checksums now.
