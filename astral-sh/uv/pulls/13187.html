            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR adds <code>.env</code> files to the default <code>.gitignore</code> template that's generated when initializing a new uv project.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><code>.env</code> files typically contain environment-specific configuration and secrets that shouldn't be committed to version control. The uv project already has support for <code>.env</code> files in the <code>uv run</code> command, so adding this to the default <code>.gitignore</code> aligns with best practices and the existing functionality.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>.env</code> to the <code>GITIGNORE</code> constant in <code>crates/uv-configuration/src/vcs.rs</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Bro! Who wants to commit a <code>.env</code> file? I always have to add <code>.env</code> to the <code>.gitignore</code> file. I'm facing this problem, which is why I think it's necessary to include it.</p>

<p>Not everyone is aware of global <code>.gitignore</code> setup, around 80% of developers might not know about it. Adding <code>.env</code> to the project's default <code>.gitignore</code> ensures better security and aligns with common practices.</p>
