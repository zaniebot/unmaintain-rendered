            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR re-arranges our logic for emitting an <code>sdist</code> field such that
it is only done when it is non-redundant with data included in the
<code>source</code> field.</p>
<p>At first, I thought this meant it could be omitted in all cases except
for when the source is <code>registry</code>. But it turns out that the direct
URL source includes a hash, which is (and should not be) included in
<code>source</code>. So we still continue to emit an <code>sdist</code> field in the case of
direct URL dependencies, even though this means that the URL is itself
repeated. I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do in that case. There are a few
options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the redundancy as-is. Maybe it&#x27;s okay because they&#x27;re rare.</li>
<li>Omit <code>sdist</code> for direct URL dependencies and add a new
<code>distribution.direct-hash</code> field to capture the hash.</li>
<li>Keep the <code>sdist</code> field for direct URL dependencies but omit the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, if we do decide to change the status quo for direct URL
dependencies, I think that can be done in a follow-up PR.</p>
<p>I did some refactoring in this PR but tried to isolate it into
particular commits. So review by commit is encouraged!</p>
