# Filter flaky counts in `sync_build_isolation_extra`

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-09-19 02:18_

I've seen this flake several times now, e.g., https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/10933201998/job/30351289277?pr=7530

I don't quite understand why, but we have a standard filter for this.
