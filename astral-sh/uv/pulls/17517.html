<p>What I've seen in other projects is having an <a href="https://agents.md/">AGENTS.md</a> and saying <code>@AGENTS.md</code> in <code>CLAUDE.md</code>, can we use that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'd rather just have one file than two and I think organizationally we're focusing on Claude. Wdyt? I don't have strong feelings.</p>
<p>I sort of don't trust the agent to follow a link to another file. The contents of <code>CLAUDE.md</code> are added to each prompt but it doesn't do that if it just points to a file.</p>
