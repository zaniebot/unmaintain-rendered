            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR makes <code>cargo test | windows</code> faster in CI.</p>
<h3>Before</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dd9c619-9b7b-4ebd-a027-56e7967b6d34" alt="Windows tests take 5m44s" /></p>
<h3>After</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7702fdba-3034-4db8-b211-85207a1feffa" alt="Windows tests take 5m12s" /></p>
<h2>Also</h2>
<p>This PR disables the <code>brotli</code> feature of <code>async-compression</code> since it's not strictly needed, but this has little to do with the improvements (it's still less code to build).</p>
<p>This PR introduces additional code in uv tool uninstall to ignore errors (that only seem to happen on ReFS, ie. on Dev Drives) akin to &quot;the thing we're trying to delete cannot be deleted because it's already being deleted&quot;.</p>
<p>If <code>raw_os_error</code> was stable we could do u32 matching instead of that <code>.to_string().contains()</code> abomination.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@fasterthanlime Curious, it seems <code>tempfile::tempdir</code> seems to ultimately leverage <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppath2a">GetTempPath2</a> which has the following rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For non-system processes, the GetTempPath2 function checks for the existence of environment variables in the following order and uses the first path found:
The path specified by the TMP environment variable.
The path specified by the TEMP environment variable.
The path specified by the USERPROFILE environment variable.
The Windows directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would this have work if <code>TEMP</code> env var was set instead to a directory inside the dev drive location? I wonder if that approach may simplify this by quite a bit.</p>
