### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>andrewhickman/fs-err (fs-err)</summary>

### [`v3.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#300)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/compare/2.11.0...3.0.0)

-   Error messages now include the original message from `std::io::Error` by default ([#&#8203;60](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/pull/60)). Previously this was exposed through the [`Error::source()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.source) method. For example, previously a message would look like:

        failed to open file `file.txt`

    and you would have to remember to print the source, or use a library like `anyhow` to print the full chain of source errors. The new error message includes the cause by default

        failed to open file `file.txt`: The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)

    Note that the original error is no longer exposed though [`Error::source()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.source) by default. If you need access to it, you can restore the previous behaviour with the `expose_original_error` feature flag.

-   The `io_safety` feature flag has been removed, and this functionality is now always enabled on Rust versions which support it (1.63.0 and greater).

-   Removed deprecated APIs: `File::from_options`, `tokio::symlink`

It looks like the message format meaningfully changed here (check out the expanded summary), so we should just make sure it's compatible with our `anyhow` use.

Updated the snapshots — need to do so on Windows still.

Is this necessary?

Aside: I bet this can be simplified now that we do https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8606
