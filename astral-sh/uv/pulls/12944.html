<p>I&#x27;ve addressed the first example in your linked issue (<code>Updating ...</code>) but I think it&#x27;s worth a more thorough audit of how we&#x27;re handling URLs. I suggest we merge this PR first because it&#x27;s critical and then I can do the audit separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel like we may want to introduce a wrapper type for this, like <code>ObfuscatedUrl</code> with a different display? It feels weird both to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutate the given URL</li>
<li>Return a type that does not encode that there&#x27;s obfuscation</li>
</ul>
<p>It feels like too much of a footgun.</p>

<p>I&#x27;d argue we shouldn&#x27;t provide the option to log secrets, though admittedly that&#x27;s pretty strict. That could be part of a bigger conversation. Since this PR doesn&#x27;t mask usernames (avoiding the other question you raise in your linked comment), I&#x27;d say we merge it as is.</p>

<p>Yeah I agree it’s helpful. But it’s the kind of option that can be accidentally left on. Do other tools in the space provide flags to log secrets?</p>
<p>For debugging purposes we could consider opt in logging of the salted hash of the secret.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure about other tools in the space. I looked around a little, but didn&#x27;t find clear answers. However, I don&#x27;t really feel concerned about the situation where someone explicitly enables showing secrets in order to debug something then leaves it on by accident? It feels fairly contrived. We could even call it <code>UV_UNSAFE_SHOW_SECRETS</code> or whatever, but authentication is a complicated part of uv and we have spent a great deal of time debugging it — I&#x27;m very hesitant about losing the ability to get any insight into what credentials are used. I think a salted hash sounds pretty overkill for something like this, I worry it&#x27;d just be more confusing.</p>

<p>If careless developers want to log secrets in production, they&#x27;ll do so regardless of uv&#x27;s security posture. We usually design to be secure by default, but trust users to make insecure choices if they need to, e.g., <code>--insecure-host</code> and <code>--index-strategy</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Regarding password logging - what about a password masking option instead?  Logs are nearly impossible get rid of at a big company due to centralized logging with long retention policies and shared widely to aid multiple levels of support.   I suggest instead of an option to log passwords at any log level (outside of some extreme trace level)  you add an option to only log the first N characters and the total length.  You could add some logic to reduce N further when the length is short.   Also add something grep-able in the string so centralized loggers could mask it out.  The benefit is companies could just leave the option on in at least a quality environment.   For example if my secret was PASSWORD123 it could show {SEC:11}&#x27;PA&#x27;   - that&#x27;s enough to be useful for debugging in a broad set of cases.</p>
