# Fix typo in projects.md

---

_Pull request opened by @hallmark on 2024-07-28 19:48_

Fixes typo: `.venv/bin/active` -> `.venv/bin/activate`


## Summary

It's a quick documentation typo fix!

## Test Plan

I read it over, twice. And checked my own `.venv/bin/` directory to ensure it does not contain an unexpectedly spelled `active` file or symlink.
