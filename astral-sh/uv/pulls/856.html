<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>biggest improvement is 20% on black.txt</li>
<li>small regression on &quot;only boto3&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes sense. In theory, the only case when this should be slower than main is when there&#x27;s more network throughput than we have unzipping troughput on 1 thread. Worth checking if that&#x27;s the case for &quot;only boto3&quot;</p>
<p>If that&#x27;s a real scenario, then we can combine the two approaches - add a separate download task that writes to a buffer, and if it gets too far ahead, stop the async unzipping and process the rest of the files in rayon. But that&#x27;s complicated, hopefully there&#x27;s no need for it, or there&#x27;s another workaround.</p>
<p>Anyway, next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>I should re-test <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/pull/859">this</a> one since I was probably running a debug build there too</li>
<li>It seems worth investing a bit in test setup to make it less error prone. I&#x27;ll integrate my workflow into the bench script and get statistically more significant data too. Once we have a script it would be easier to test on different machines so we&#x27;re not making a decision based on my hardware only</li>
<li>We evaluate if &quot;unzipping slower than downloading&quot; is a real scenario to worry about</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, I&#x27;m only here until friday and if yall want me to do things in different order (or do something else) let me know :)</p>

<p>So this PR is 0-10% improvement (on my machine, with low statistical confidence). The zlib-ng PR is noise, and maybe worth reverting because it adds a dependency on cmake.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From the singular value i find it hard to decide if the changes are significant or noise (sorry - my bioinformatics background compels me to be pedantic here). Could you run with hyperfine or a criterion benchmark or some other way that gives us an average and standard error (or a range)? The short benchmarks might pair well with criterion, the longer ones with hyperfine, but would need an extra entrypoint i guess.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you think this is worth productionizing based on the above benchmarks? I only see one regression (<code>boto3==1.34.14</code>), but otherwise seems like a clear win in those cases. I wonder if there&#x27;s any sense in doing this only for larger zips, and otherwise fetching into memory and then unzipping to disk?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The old solution would be faster if the wheel is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">zip bomb</a>. It&#x27;s possible that there exist very compressible packages that take more time to decompress than to download. In that case the &quot;best of both worlds&quot; solution would be to have separate downloader and unzipper tasks and a buffer between them that can grow and spill onto disk if necessary. If the downloader gets too far ahead and the unzipper is not keeping up, we stop the zipper, and unzip the remaining files using rayon. Though this is a complicated solution and I wouldn&#x27;t code it without evidence that it matters.</p>
<p>IMO right now the more important thing is testing infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li>More requirements.txt files</li>
<li>Tests with emulated bad network</li>
<li>Tests on different machines</li>
</ol>
<p>Before that infrastructure exists we shouldn&#x27;t get too attached to any particular implementation.</p>
<p>The +10% speedup from this PR is not huge, but productionizing isn&#x27;t difficult so I&#x27;ll finish it up. I&#x27;ll leave the current unzipper there so that we can switch to it if needed, and benchmark again with better test infra in the future.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is the thinking behind leaving the dead code below? Is it so the code can be changed back to the old strategy easily? I think I&#x27;d prefer just deleting the dead code. It can always be revised from source history if necessary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO best practice would be to <em>either</em>: (1) remove, since we can always restore from source control; or (2) retain, but thread through a CLI flag (could be user-hidden) to let us toggle, and ensure there&#x27;s test coverage. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very likely to grow stale while still requiring some amount of maintenance, which is kind of the worst of both worlds.</p>
