<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This is a follow-up to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13033#discussion_r2137343801.</p>
<p>The goals of this PR include:</p>
<ol>
<li>applying a consistent memory ordering for (simple) use cases that doesn't involve synchronization/interaction with other data structures (i.e. atomics in <code>uv-warning</code> and the one introduced in #13033)</li>
<li>relaxing the memory ordering from the strictest <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html#sequentially-consistent"><code>Ordering::SeqCst</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/atomics.html#relaxed"><code>Ordering::Relaxed</code></a> for such use cases.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Unsure of how to test here.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] #13033 merged</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice, I've thought about doing the same the last time I looked at this code. (Which was also the first time :smile:) What do you think about making the same change to <code>uv_configuration::RAYON_PARALLELISM</code> in this PR? (That is, <code>crates/uv/src/lib.rs</code> and <code>crates/uv-configuration/src/threading.rs</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>RAYON_PARALLELISM</code> can be set to <code>Ordering::Relaxed</code> as well.</p>
<p>Here's my thinking (feel free to correct me):</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv_configuration::RAYON_PARALLELISM.store</code> in <code>lib.rs</code> is an independent storing of user configuration</li>
<li>It is stored at the start of program execution, much earlier than when the rayon thread pool is created.</li>
