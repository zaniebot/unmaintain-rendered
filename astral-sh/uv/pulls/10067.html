            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR revives <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10017">astral-sh/uv#10017</a>, which might be viable now that we <em>don&#x27;t</em> enforce any platforms by default.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that users can mark certain platforms as required (empty, by default). When resolving, we ensure that the specified platforms have wheel coverage, backtracking if not.</p>
<p>For example, to require that we include a version of PyTorch that supports Intel macOS:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;project&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11&quot;
dependencies = [&quot;torch&gt;1.13&quot;]

[tool.uv]
required-platforms = [
    &quot;sys_platform == &#x27;darwin&#x27; and platform_machine == &#x27;x86_64&#x27;&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>Other than that, the forking is identical to past iterations of this PR.</p>
<p>This would give users a way to resolve the tail of issues in #9711, but with manual opt-in to supporting specific platforms.</p>

<p>(What I tend to do in docs is to mention the other in the docs and contrast them. e.g., mention <code>environments</code> in this section and <code>required-platforms</code> in the <code>environments</code> section. That way, users see the contrasting doc regardless of where they look.)</p>

<p>Required platform linux</p>
<p>Choose A 2, with <code>A -&gt; B; windows</code>, <code>A -&gt; C</code>
Choose B 2. B 2 does have only a mac wheel but that&#x27;s fine because it&#x27;s only required on windows, so our required linux is coverd.
Choose C 2, with <code>C -&gt; B</code></p>
<p>Try to install on linux. We try to install A 2, C 2 and B 2, but B 2 fails since it has no wheel.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin -- I think this would actually work as-is, though for &quot;bad&quot; reasons. Basically, when we visit <code>B</code>, we won&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s &quot;only required for Windows&quot;, because we don&#x27;t do &quot;aggressive forking&quot; today, so we&#x27;d still try to solve for Linux. It might get filtered out later? I can&#x27;t quite remember.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb -- That&#x27;s true, although I&#x27;d read that setting as &quot;platforms on which building should be disabled&quot;, which isn&#x27;t quite the same. We&#x27;re not enforcing that all packages have wheels on these platforms. We&#x27;re enforcing that all packages have wheels <em>or</em> source distributions on these platforms (and so, building is considered ok).</p>

<p>My use case is that I work with dependencies that will sometimes (suddenly) drop publishing wheels for certain platforms (often something like ARM64 Linux) and it can become very challenging to detect this. What happens is that we&#x27;ll <code>poetry update</code> or similar on, say, macOS ARM and that will resolve to the latest version that is missing wheels for <em>other</em> platforms that we need.</p>
<p>A couple real-life examples;</p>
<ul>
<li>(Missing Linux ARM wheels): https://pypi.org/project/ai-edge-litert-nightly/1.1.2.dev20250211/#files</li>
<li>(Now they&#x27;re back!): https://pypi.org/project/ai-edge-litert-nightly/1.1.2.dev20250216/#files</li>
</ul>
<p>We wouldn&#x27;t want to accidentally lock to the version that is missing Linux ARM wheels while locking from macOS.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.18 has Linux ARM wheels: https://pypi.org/project/open3d/0.18.0/</li>
<li>0.19 does not have Linux ARM wheels: https://pypi.org/project/open3d/0.19.0/#files</li>
</ul>
<p>Our current workaround is to pin versions in <code>pyproject.toml</code> after we either hit issues later (for trying to <code>poetry sync</code>  in a Linux ARM64 container on an ARM64 macOS host).</p>
<p>Being able to express our platform needs so that the resolver can make this work properly would be great.</p>
<p>I hope this feedback helps!</p>

This also helps me massively at work because I can at least ensure that my team only adds packages that have wheels for <code>{x86_64, aarch64} x {linux, macos}</code>. The only thing that&#x27;s missing for us is to ensure that there are wheels for macos 10.15 (for x86_64) and 11.0 (for aarch64) because these are the minimum macos versions we have to support.
