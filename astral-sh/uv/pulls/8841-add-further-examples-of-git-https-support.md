# Add further examples of git+https support

---

_Pull request opened by @mrchrisadams on 2024-11-05 19:54_

This pull request includes updates to the `docs/guides/tools.md` file to provide more detailed instructions on how to pull from a git repository using different options, using the `git+https` scheme support.

It follows [asking a question in the Discord chat](https://discord.com/channels/1039017663004942429/1060247592765759518/1303270516588806214) and getting some useful guidance that was not in the docs, but makes some very useful features of `uv` easier to discover.

## Summary

Tweaks to documentation:

* Added instructions on how to pull the latest commit from a specific named branch.
* Added instructions on how to pull a specific tag.
* Added instructions on how to pull a specific commit.
