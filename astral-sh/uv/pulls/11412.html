            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I believe these are not necessary... They're currently used in two places:</p>
<ol>
<li>When building wheels. But that's already wrapped in an in-flight map, which does the same thing.</li>
<li>When fetching source distribution metadata. But every route there uses it's own <code>flock</code> to coordinate across processes, so this seems redundant?</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>LGTM. It's hard to follow along if we covered all paths since we have no api-level connection between acquiring a lock and doing operations that need that lock acquired</p>
