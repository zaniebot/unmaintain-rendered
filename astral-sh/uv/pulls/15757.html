            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hii @zanieb
I see your point about my current implementation not addressing the core issue. To solve the issue , I am thinking to approach it like this -
For the <code>--force</code> flag approach:
I can set the ValidatedLock to Preferable/Versions to use existing versions but force a rewrite when <code>--force</code> flag is used.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>When validation succeeds and we reach this section:</p>
<pre><code>Some(ValidatedLock::Satisfies(lock)) =&gt; {
    // Print the success message after completing resolution.
    logger.on_complete(lock.len(), start, printer)?;
    Ok(LockResult::Unchanged(lock))
}
</code></pre>
<p>Should I add format checking here? If there's a format mismatch (missing revision = 3, missing upload-time fields, etc.),</p>
<p>How should I apprach format detection ?
I saw the implementation of <code>Lock</code> &amp; it has this revision field,
does checking revision field would work ?
Also is there a suggested way to detect missing upload-time fields or other format indicators?</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any pointers to help me move forward. Also, could you point me to resources about uv lockfile format internals?</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience as I work through this : )</p>
