Thank you for contributing to uv! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

- Does this pull request include a summary of the change? (See below.)
- Does this pull request include a descriptive title?
- Does this pull request include references to any relevant issues?
-->

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Current documentation requires contributors to have Node.js/npm installed locally to format Markdown files. This might be problematic for users who don't work with JavaScript ecosystem or users who want to avoid toolchain setup.</p>
<p>This change adds docker-based alternative:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --rm -v .:/src/ -w /src/ node:alpine npx prettier --prose-wrap always --write &quot;**/*.md&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Which mounts current working directory into /src/ inside of a container and also sets working directory (-w)  to /src/ so prettier loads .editorconfig.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Both commands should produce the same output</p>
<details>
<summary>Native Prettier</summary>
