Thank you for contributing to uv! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

- Does this pull request include a summary of the change? (See below.)
- Does this pull request include a descriptive title?

-->

<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>We are using UV as a library and we would like to provide an custom reqwest client to the <code>RegistryClient</code>/<code>BaseClient</code>. We have a central place in our repo where we configure the reqwest client to our needs (certs, proxy, ...) and it is safer for us to just pass the same client to UV rather than trying to reproduce the same client config with the APIs that UV exposes.</p>
<p>Are you ok with that change?</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm pretty wary of this change but I don't have a strong reason to deny it. I'm mostly worried about the increased complexity in a very critical component of uv. Perhaps we could refactor this to avoid the big <code>if / else</code> branch somehow?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I moved the logic of creating the <code>raw_client</code> and <code>raw_dangerous_client</code> into a separate function.</p>
<p>I totally see your point. This would make our life much easier, but I would absolutely understand if you do not feel comfortable maintaining this change.</p>
