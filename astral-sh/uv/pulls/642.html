            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This allows us to enforce type safety within the resolver. For example, in the index, we can remove <code>String</code> as a key type and enforce that callers <em>must</em> present us with a <code>PackageId</code>. (This actually caught one bug, where we were using the SHA rather than the package ID. That bug shouldn't have had any effect given where it was, since those are 1:1, but it's still problematic.)</p>
