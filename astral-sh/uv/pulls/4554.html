            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For consistency, syncing a workspace should involve syncing all members. Perhaps we revisit this in the future -- it may be possible to skip work here when you're operating on a single package.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Run <code>cargo run sync</code> from <code>./scripts/workspaces/albatross-root-workspace/packages/seeds</code>. Verify that all packages are installed, rather than just <code>seeds</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like this behavior might be intentional because there are some tests for it. I'll wait for @konstin to review before merging.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My guess is that the intent with the current behavior is to enforce package isolation... Like, if Package A doesn't depend on Package B, don't install Package B into the environment. Otherwise, Package A will be able to import it, and the dependencies between the projects become meaningless.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll try to sketch out an example of why it might matter...</p>
<p>Assume we have Package A and Package B in the workspace. Package A doesn't depend on Package B.</p>
<p>Package A depends on WerkZeug, and Package B depends on Flask.</p>
<p>We do uv run --package package-b, and it installs Package B and Flask.</p>
<p>We then bump the WerkZeug version in the pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>We do uv run --package package-a, and the lockfile upgrades WerkZeug; upgrading WerkZeug then forces us to upgrade Flask (let's assume).</p>
<p>So now we have a virtual environment with... Package A, Package B, the new WerkZeug, and the old Flask. Package B and its dependencies are out of sync.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess this also makes <code>uv run --package</code> redundant, since there's no concept of running a command &quot;in a package&quot; -- it's always running in the full workspace.</p>
