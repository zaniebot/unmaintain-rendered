<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

\===================
This release updates Jiff's bundled copy of the \[IANA Time Zone Database] to
`2025a`. See the [`2025a` release announcement][2025a release announcement] for more details.

### [`v0.1.23`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0123-2025-01-13)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.22...0.1.23)

\===================
This release includes some bug fixes, particularly for compilation on
`aarch64-linux-android`. There are also some minor enhancements, such as making
`Zoned::iso_week_date` a convenience function for `civil::Date::iso_week_date`,
in line with similar functions.

My current plan is to make a reasonably quick transition to `jiff 0.2` with a
few pending breaking changes. I will be making some `jiff 0.1` releases with
deprecations in order to make the transition as smooth as possible. If all goes
well with `jiff 0.2`, then my plan is still to do a Jiff 1.0 release in the
Summer of 2025.

Deprecations:

-   [#&#8203;197](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/discussions/197):
    `Date::to_iso_week_date` has been deprecated in favor of `Date::iso_week_date`.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;196](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/discussions/196):
    Improve ISO week date documentation regarding weekday offsets.
-   [#&#8203;197](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/discussions/197):
    Add `Zoned::iso_week_date`, `DateTime::iso_week_date` and
    `Date::iso_week_date`.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;200](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/200):
    Fix compilation failure on Android in a Termux shell.
-   [#&#8203;202](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/202):
    Re-add license files to crate artifact.
