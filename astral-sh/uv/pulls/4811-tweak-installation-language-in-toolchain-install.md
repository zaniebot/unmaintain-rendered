# Tweak installation language in toolchain install

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

Like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4808 but with a few more changes. I suspect this will require some bikeshedding but I find the use of "installation" and "installed" in the same sentence to be kind of a lot.
