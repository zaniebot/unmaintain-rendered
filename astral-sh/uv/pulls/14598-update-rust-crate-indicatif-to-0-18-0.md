### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>console-rs/indicatif (indicatif)</summary>

### [`v0.18.0`](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/indicatif/releases/tag/0.18.0)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/indicatif/compare/0.17.12...0.18.0)

Unfortunately [0.17.12](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/indicatif/releases/0.17.12) had to be yanked because the console upgrade was a semver-incompatible change. Rerelease as 0.18.0 instead.
