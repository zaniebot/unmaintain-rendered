            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In particular, I added this as a hack to avoid a kinda of
instability that was caused by our marker code not correctly
detecting markers that were always false. But that has since
been fixed.</p>
<p>Removing this code doesn't change any tests. Arguably it
should be possible to come up with a test that failed with
this hack inserted but succeeded without it. In particular,
with this hack, new forks were being prevented from being
added even when they ought to be added, e.g., when preferences
get updated.</p>
