            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So I think this mostly looks good to me, but <a href="https://docs.rs/jiff/latest/jiff/struct.Timestamp.html#parsing-and-printing">uv does technically accept a superset of RFC 3339</a>. I think we should still <em>say</em> RFC 3339 because that's what most users know, but the reality is actually an amalgamation of RFC 3339, RFC 9557 and ISO 8601. (Where the precise details are specified by <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#sec-temporal-iso8601grammar">Temporal's ISO 8601 grammar</a>.)</p>
<p>For example, <code>--exclude-newer '2024-06-19T15:22:45-04[America/New_York]'</code> is valid and perfectly cromulent despite it not being RFC 3339.</p>
<p>But saying &quot;Temporal's ISO 8601 format&quot; is probably not meaningful to most end users.</p>
<p>So for now, I think just saying &quot;accepts a superset of RFC 3339&quot; is fine. That's what most users will want. So just a small tweak in the wording. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi thanks for the feedback! I tweaked the wording. Would it be useful to link to the Temporal grammar in the superset? E.g.,</p>
<p>&quot;Accepts a <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/#sec-temporal-iso8601grammar">superset</a> of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html">RFC 3339</a>&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This LGTM. I might suggest waiting on linking to Temporal until we have a more stable link for it (which will probably happen once it's officially part of ECMAScript.)</p>
