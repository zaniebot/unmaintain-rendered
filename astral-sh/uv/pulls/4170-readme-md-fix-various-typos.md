nit: this line's quite long; I'd split it up:

```suggestion
as an [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html) timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or
UTC date in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`).
```

I'm following [ISO 31-0 guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31-0#Expressions), second bullet:
> - Numerical value and unit symbol are separated by a space. [...]

As far as personal preference... That's not for me to decide.
