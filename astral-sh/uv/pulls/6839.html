            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(This is a suggestion that was easy for me to make a PR for; if other approaches are considered better, feel free to consider this as a FR for those instead)</p>
<p>I&#x27;d feel more comfortable using the installer with the instructions in this commit, since I&#x27;m uncomfortable with random scripts trying to modify my system config (PATH in this case).</p>
<p>Currently, the installer seems to be the best way to install <code>uv</code> that allows updating it on a system without Homebrew or <code>pipx</code>. I hope somebody will provide similar instructions for Windows.</p>
<p>I considered recommending saving the script to a file and then running that, but I think it&#x27;s better to have fewer options in the instructions. Most people who&#x27;d want to save the file would figure it out.</p>
<p>As an aside, I would personally appreciate if <code>uv</code> could be installed easily with <code>cargo install</code> or <code>cargo binstall</code>, but a friendly script that acts predictably is probably more useful for more people.</p>
Test Plan
<p>I tested the command on my machine, but I did not test compiling the docs (yet). If the CI does not compile the docs, I could test this a bit later, or perhaps this would be easier for somebody who already has a dev environment set up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thinking some more about my motivations: if <code>uv self update</code> worked for downloads from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases, there would be less need for using the installation script at all (though this PR might be useful even in that case).</p>
<p>One more thing I tested is that if I run</p>
<pre><code> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.3.0/install.sh | CARGO_HOME=~/.local sh -s -- --no-modify-path -v</code></pre>
<p>and then run <code>uv self update</code>, it correctly updates the <code>uv</code> binary in ~/.local/bin, even though CARGO_HOME is not set during the self-update. This is great!</p>
<p>Given that, getting the regular <code>uv</code> download to self-update seems like it should be quite possible (though I might of course be missing something).</p>
