            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! It looks like this uses some of the code from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4835">astral-sh/uv#4835</a> without crediting it? Did you try to address some of the open comments there?</p>
<p>Also note this makes a bunch of code changes unrelated to the goal which will prevent us from reviewing it.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn&#x27;t know about giving credits.
Updated the message and gave credits.</p>
<p>I will update the code as soon as possible and remove the unrelated code changes. Well these changes I had to make so run the test cases, as I was not able to run them.</p>
