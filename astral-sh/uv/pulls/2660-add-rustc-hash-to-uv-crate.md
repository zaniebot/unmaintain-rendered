_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-03-25 20:02_

## Summary

This is required as of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2589, but isn't a direct dependency. I'm not sure how that PR passed CI exactly.

Edit: it looks like the dependency was removed between the time the PR was opened and merged (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2609).
