### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/regex (regex)</summary>

### [`v1.12.2`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1122-2025-10-13)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.12.1...1.12.2)

\===================
This release fixes a `cargo doc` breakage on nightly when `--cfg docsrs` is
enabled. This caused documentation to fail to build on docs.rs.

Bug fixes:

- [BUG #&#8203;1305](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1305):
  Switches the `doc_auto_cfg` feature to `doc_cfg` on nightly for docs.rs builds.

### [`v1.12.1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1121-2025-10-10)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.12.0...1.12.1)

\===================
This release makes a bug fix in the new `regex::Captures::get_match` API
introduced in `1.12.0`. There was an oversight with the lifetime parameter
for the `Match` returned. This is technically a breaking change, but given
that it was caught almost immediately and I've yanked the `1.12.0` release,
I think this is fine.

### [`v1.12.0`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1120-2025-10-10)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.11.3...1.12.0)

\===================
This release contains a smattering of bug fixes, a fix for excessive memory
consumption in some cases and a new `regex::Captures::get_match` API.

Improvements:

- [FEATURE #&#8203;1146](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1146):
  Add `Capture::get_match` for returning the overall match without `unwrap()`.

Bug fixes:

- [BUG #&#8203;1083](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1083):
  Fixes a panic in the lazy DFA (can only occur for especially large regexes).
- [BUG #&#8203;1116](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1116):
  Fixes a memory usage regression for large regexes (introduced in `regex 1.9`).
- [BUG #&#8203;1195](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1195):
  Fix universal start states in sparse DFA.
- [BUG #&#8203;1295](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1295):
  Fixes a panic when deserializing a corrupted dense DFA.
- [BUG 8f5d9479](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/8f5d9479d0f1da5726488a530d7fd66a73d05b80):
  Make `regex_automata::meta::Regex::find` consistently return `None` when
  `WhichCaptures::None` is used.

### [`v1.11.3`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1113-2025-09-25)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.11.2...1.11.3)

\===================
This is a small patch release with an improvement in memory usage in some
cases.

Improvements:

- [BUG #&#8203;1297](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1297):
  Improve memory usage by trimming excess memory capacity in some spots.
