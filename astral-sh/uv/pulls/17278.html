            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Upon recently using uv in CICD in CodeBuild and wanting to use a private pypi repo in AWS CodeArtifact, I noticed the documented method with the given env vars was producing a 401 &quot;Unauthorized&quot; error when connecting to the repository. After debugging and referencing the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/python-configure-pip.html#python-configure-without-pip">AWS docs</a> I tried passing the token via the URL and it worked just fine.</p>
<p>Decided to include this working method and improve the code snippets to be easy to copy over if someone else needs this.</p>
<p>Also, first contribution, happy to amend and take on-board recommendations.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Implemented the code snippet in my CICD pipeline and successfully authenticated to my private pypi-compatible repo.</p>
