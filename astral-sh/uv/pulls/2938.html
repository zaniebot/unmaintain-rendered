            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This updates to the version of axoupdater used in cargo-dist 0.13.0&#x27;s own selfupdate command, with all relevant fixes for platforms. It also tentatively introduces a mildly dangerous self-runtest that runs <code>uv self update</code> and checks that the binary is installed and executable.</p>
<p>I <em>believe</em> some adjustments need to be made to your CI to have this new test run, because it requires the <code>self-update</code> feature to be enabled, and I didn&#x27;t want to just start messing with how you do feature coverage in your CI. <strong>As a result I haven&#x27;t yet had a chance to actually fully run this in CI</strong>, though I&#x27;ve locally tested it on windows (with the guard disabled).</p>
Test Plan
<p>Most of the machinery here is provided by axoupdater itself (cargo-dist also includes a variant of these tests in its codebase). This initial implementation has a couple major limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is For Reals modifying the system that runs the test (so it&#x27;s off unless it detects it&#x27;s running in CI, and if you want variations on this test they&#x27;ll need to be <a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/blob/5e7826f7b09a64e5ba9edc16dab8cee7b13daa27/cargo-dist/tests/cli-tests.rs#L235">run in serial</a>). Since many of the testing issues were surrounding precise details of Actual Deployed Executions, this seemed worth the tradeoff.</li>
<li>The actual installer <em>script</em> it&#x27;s ultimately invoking is the one you last published, and <em>not</em> the one that cargo-dist will make when you next publish.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#x27;re already working on implementing some logic for &quot;get cargo-dist to generate a fresh installer script too&quot;, which is in fact the basis of a huge amount of cargo-dist&#x27;s own testsuite. Now that we&#x27;re dogfooding this stuff, it should be quite hard for this stuff to break without cargo-dist&#x27;s own codebase noticing it first.</p>
