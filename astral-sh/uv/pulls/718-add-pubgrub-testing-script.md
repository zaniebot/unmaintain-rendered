# Add pubgrub testing script

_@konstin_

I'm using this script to provide feedback to pubgrub changes, and it's better to have it in tree than only on my machine, even if i made it with the intent of being the only user.

I have a slight bias towards just having this in Git (here) than checking it in. If we check it in, we either maintain it, or it gets stale and causes confusion.

I have a preference for a gist or a branch here. Can we close the PR?
