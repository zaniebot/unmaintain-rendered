# Replace mocked server with 'real' integration tests

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-12 17:23_

We can always restore these from history, but right now, it feels a lot more productive to just hit PyPI directly for our integration tests, since we don't have to spend time figuring out mocks.
