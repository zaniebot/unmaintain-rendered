            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR consolidates the concurrency limits used throughout <code>uv</code> and exposes two limits, <code>UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS</code> and <code>UV_CONCURRENT_BUILDS</code>, as environment variables.</p>
<p>Currently, <code>uv</code> has a number of concurrent streams that it buffers using relatively arbitrary limits for backpressure. However, many of these limits are conflated. We run a relatively small number of tasks overall and should start most things as soon as possible. What we really want to limit are three separate operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>File I/O. This is managed by tokio's blocking pool and we should not really have to worry about it.</li>
<li>Network I/O.</li>
<li>Python build processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the current limits span a broad range of tasks, it's possible that a limit meant for network I/O is occupied by tasks performing builds, reading from the file system, or even waiting on a <code>OnceMap</code>. We also don't limit build processes that end up being required to perform a download. While this may not pose a performance problem because our limits are relatively high, it does mean that the limits do not do what we want, making it tricky to expose them to users (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1205, https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3311).</p>
<p>After this change, the limits on network I/O and build processes are centralized and managed by semaphores. All other tasks are unbuffered (note that these tasks are still bounded, so backpressure should not be a problem).</p>
<hr />
<p>The terminology here is a little weird. From https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3311, what we want is to expose a way to limit the overall concurrency of downloads. However, for builds, we're really only limiting the number of parallel python processes we spawn. Technically those two are different, but I think sticking to one of concurrency vs. parallelism would be less confusing. Maybe these should be <code>UV_PARALLEL_*</code> instead?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is one seemingly important limit left in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/crates/uv-resolver/src/resolver/mod.rs#L323, from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1163. In practice this bound is quite large compared to our concurrent downloads and should not be a source of contention, it's mainly there to allow us to use a bounded channel and avoid starving the prefetcher.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>LGTM! There's maybe one other thing we care about here: the number of concurrent <em>installs</em> (which, today, is controllable by <code>RAYON_NUM_THREADS</code>). Once we've downloaded and built all the wheels, we then have to install them into the virtual environment, and we do this with Rayon. I think it's fine <em>not</em> to add a setting for that, but we <em>could</em>.</p>

<p>We almost might want a way to limit the size of tokio's blocking threadpool for fs operations (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3311). Ideally those options could be combined. Installs are fs bound so maybe we should just use tokio's blocking pool instead of rayon for that as well?</p>
<p>Either way I think I'll keep this PR limited to network and build limits.</p>
