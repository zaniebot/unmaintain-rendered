<p>This reverts commit 7d92915f3dec3e7e76fa4c5ec5af7c17e3ca176c.</p>
<p>I thought this would be a net performance improvement, but we've now had multiple reports that this made locking <em>extremely</em> slow. I also tested this today with a very large codebase against a registry that does not support range requests, and the number of downloads was sort of wild to watch. Reverting the reduced resolution time by over 50%.</p>
<p>Closes #6104.</p>
