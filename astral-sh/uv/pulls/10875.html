            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When I first added conflicting extras, I made <code>package[foo]</code> a hard
error during resolution whenever <code>foo</code> was declared as a conflicting
extra. This was a conservative approach meant to prevent cases where
conflicts occurred non-locally throughout the dependency tree.</p>
<p>However, as #9942 and #10590 seem to suggest, this ends up making
some use cases impossible. For example, it prevents the ability
to encapsulate the conflicting extras of a package from a parent
dependent. This overall makes conflicting extras much less flexible.</p>
<p>So in this PR, we remove that error checking. But doing so ends up
making it possible to install multiple versions of the same package
into the same environment. So we &quot;recapture&quot; the error check at
installation time instead of resolution time. This affords us more
flexibility, but it now means that we can generate lock files that will
<em>always</em> fail to install.</p>
<p>This is best reviewed commit-by-commit.</p>
<p>Fixes #9942, Fixes #10590</p>
