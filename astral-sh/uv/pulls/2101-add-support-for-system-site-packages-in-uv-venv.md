# Add support for `--system-site-packages` in `uv venv`

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-03-01 03:35_

## Summary

Adds support for `--system-site-packages`. Unlike `pip`, we won't take the system site packages into account in subsequent commands. I think this is ok.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1483.
