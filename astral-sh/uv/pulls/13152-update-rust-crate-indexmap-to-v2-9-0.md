### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>indexmap-rs/indexmap (indexmap)</summary>

### [`v2.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/blob/HEAD/RELEASES.md#290-2025-04-04)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/compare/2.8.0...2.9.0)

-   Added a `get_disjoint_mut` method to `IndexMap`, matching Rust 1.86's
    `HashMap` method.
-   Added a `get_disjoint_indices_mut` method to `IndexMap` and `map::Slice`,
    matching Rust 1.86's `get_disjoint_mut` method on slices.
-   Deprecated the `borsh` feature in favor of their own `indexmap` feature,
    solving a cyclic dependency that occured via `borsh-derive`.

### [`v2.8.0`](https://redirect.github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/blob/HEAD/RELEASES.md#280-2025-03-10)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/compare/2.7.1...2.8.0)

-   Added `indexmap_with_default!` and `indexset_with_default!` to be used with
    alternative hashers, especially when using the crate without `std`.
-   Implemented `PartialEq` between each `Slice` and `[]`/arrays.
-   Removed the internal `rustc-rayon` feature and dependency.
