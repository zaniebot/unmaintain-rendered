_@slhck_

## Summary

Adds a hint to the scripts documentation on how to use shebang lines to invoke uv automatically.

(Supersedes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12912, where I messed up commit hisotry.)

I think this is superseded by the now merged https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11553

Let me know if you think more changes are needed there.
