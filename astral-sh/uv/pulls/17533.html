            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The test script interpreter is the one whose parent directory I am putting in <code>UV_TEST_PYTHON_PATH</code>. Although I agree it's kind of jank in retrospect. It could hide a bug in our path parsing.</p>
<p>As an alternative we could prepend to <code>$env:PATH</code> [^gh-path] before running the script.</p>
<p>I think the real weird thing here is that there's no actual guarantee that <code>py -3.9</code> would pick the chocolatey version if some other 3.9 was installed, but I couldn't find any good way to verify this invariant.</p>
<p>But at least I feel that setting <code>$env:PATH</code> prior to running the verification script would at least ensure that the script and uv both use the same python version.</p>
<p>Lastly, I could try to investigate why chocolatey's path changes aren't being picked up although I have a feeling that the answer is going to be either: &quot;the registry changes can't be propagated to the runner without restarting the runner&quot; or &quot;github runners explicitly sanitize that somehow so the environment change doesn't persist&quot;.</p>
<p>[^gh-path]: GITHUB_PATH seems to be for appending only, which isn't helpful here.</p>
