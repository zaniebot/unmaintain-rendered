## Summary

Docs at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/ still say:

> the future, uv will also support persistent configuration in its own configuration file format (e.g., pyproject.toml or uv.toml or similar). For more, see [#651](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/651).

I think that's done now (?), so updated these to link to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/files/
