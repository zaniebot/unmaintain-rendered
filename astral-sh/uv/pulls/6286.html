<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I think it's important to clarify that <code>uvx</code> is simply an alias for <code>uv tool run</code>. This distinction helps avoid confusion about when to use <code>uv</code> versus <code>uvx</code>.  I thought the <a href="https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging">blog post</a> explained this well.</p>
<p>Just something that I ran into, I understand others may have a different perspective!</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
