#  Build backend: Add source tree -> source dist -> wheel tests

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2024-11-13 16:53_

A first milestone: source tree -> source dist -> wheel -> install works. This PR adds a test for this.

There's obviously a lot still missing, including basics such as the Readme inclusion.
