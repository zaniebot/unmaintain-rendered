# Remove `uv pip sync` suggestion with `pyproject.toml`

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-07-08 20:02_

## Summary

I think doing this would almost always be a mistake, since it won't install any transitive dependencies. Instead, I took the opportunity to mention the `pylock.toml` format.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14507#issuecomment-3050083116.
