### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action (EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action)</summary>

### [`v2.0.15`](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action/releases/tag/v2.0.15): Release 2.0.15 - cargo-deny 0.19.0

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action/compare/v2.0.14...v2.0.15)

##### Changed

- [PR#802](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/802) made relative paths passed to `--config` be resolved relative to the current working directory (rather than the resolved manifest path's directory).
- [PR#825](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/825) updated `gix`, `reqwest`, and `tame-index` to newer versions. The `reqwest` 0.13 changes means it is no longer possible to choose the source of root certificates for `gix`, so that decision is now left to `rustls-platform-verifier`. The `native-certs` feature has thus been removed, and `cargo-deny` no longer defaults to using `webpki-roots`.

##### Fixed

- [PR#802](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/802) fixed path handling of paths passed to `--config`, resolving [#&#8203;748](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/krates/issues/748).
- [PR#819](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/819) added locations to all SARIF results since that's mandatory for valid SARIF.
- [PR#821](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/821) fixed compilation on an Alpine host.

##### Added

- [PR#795](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/795) added `[bans.allow-workspace]` to allow workspace crates while denying all external crates.
- [PR#800](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/800) added `[licenses.include-build]` to toggle whether build dependencies are included in the license check.
- [PR#823](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/823) added `[advisories.unused-ignored-advisory]` to disable the warning when an advisory is ignored but not encountered in the crate graph.
- [PR#826](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/826) added `[advisories.unsound]` to determine which crates can show `unsound` advisories, similarly to the `unmaintained` field. Defaults to `workspace` crates, ignoring `unsound` advisories for transitive dependencies, resolving [#&#8203;824](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/824).
