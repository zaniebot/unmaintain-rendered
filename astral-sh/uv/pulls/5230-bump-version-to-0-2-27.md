I was surprised to see a Friday release, as I'd noticed they aren't as common. Last one was on 2024-05-24, statistics of releases per day of the week (as measured in America/New_York):

```
15  Monday
15  Tuesday
18  Wednesday
13  Thursday
 6  Friday
 3  Saturday
 4  Sunday
```

We vaguely try to avoid it to reduce weekend churn but I didn't even think about it today :)

A couple of times you've fixed bugs for me late Thursday, and I've been impatiently checking till Monday or Tuesday before updating to the latest release version. 😆 

**Edit:** To be clear though, I don't reccomend releasing more often, just sometimes uv releases so fast I get a fixed version before I've had time to check if someone replied to my issue.

Needed #5233 to fix Windows builds and I added #5232.
