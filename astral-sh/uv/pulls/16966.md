Was unsure if this was a good idea or not, but it means that if someone passes one of the known `pip debug` options, they won't get an unknown option error.

I know normally things would call e.g. `commands::pip_debug()` but it seemed like a lot of unnecessary boilerplate to achieve this result.

I think we should use `error: ...` instead of a warning.

We might want to match the message of the pip compat args?

Ah, I did not find those when I grepped.

What should be the suggested alternative? Just normal `pip debug`?

I don't think we have a great alternative. I guess we could recommend `uvx pip debug`?

I might couch it with "consider using" instead of saying "use ..."

I've decided to steal the approach from the compat args which does indeed produce an error.
