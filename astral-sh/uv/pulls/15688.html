            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>pyx access tokens are valid for an hour at a time, so our current default tolerance of 5m means that we pessimistically refresh the access token up to 12 times per hour.</p>
<p>This increases to tolerance to 30m, meaning that we'll now pessimistically refresh only twice an hour. This has two main benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>End users should see slightly faster average requests, since they'll do implicit token refreshes less often;</li>
<li>The pyx backend sees less chaff volume from token refreshes (these aren't a load issue at the moment, but in the distant future they could be at current tolerances).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Backend testing in pyx only, most likely? I'm not sure there's a great way to test this (ATM) in uv itself.</p>

<p>Yeah, turns out I completely misread the tolerance condition -- I read it backwards as &quot;time <em>from</em> issuance&quot;, not &quot;time <em>from</em> expiry&quot; 🤦</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm gonna go ahead and close this -- I don't think it makes sense in any current iteration. 5m tolerance strikes me as reasonable in terms of the actual behavior here.</p>
