# docs: use `python` to highlight requirements and use more content tabs

_Pull request opened by @mkniewallner on 2024-08-23 21:38_

## Summary

It appears that using `python` for code blocks containing requirements works quite well.

Also using more content tabs for cases where we need to differentiate macOS/Linux from Windows.

## Test Plan

Local run of the documentation.

Unrelated, but made those specific changes to be more consistent with the usage of "Linux" in other parts of the documentation.
