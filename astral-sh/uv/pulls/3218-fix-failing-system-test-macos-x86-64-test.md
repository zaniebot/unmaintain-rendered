# Fix failing `system-test-macos-x86_64` test

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

GitHub recently changed `macos-latest` to `macos-12`, so the x86 test started failing. I've migrated the tests to use dedicated labels, rather than the aliases.

See: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-30-github-actions-macos-14-sonoma-is-now-available/
