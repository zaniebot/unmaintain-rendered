_@AucaCoyan_

## Summary

After I did #2612 , broke the badge and #2613 fixed it (thanks konstin!)
I return the functionality to go to the actions tab when you click the badge:

[![Actions status](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions)
