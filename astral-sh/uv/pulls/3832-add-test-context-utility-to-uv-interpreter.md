# Add test context utility to `uv-interpreter`

---

_@zanieb_

Follow-up to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3797 to clean up the test isolation in `uv-interpreter`.

I still want to expose a CLI at some point like `uv python <...>` for discovery and test from there, hopefully this will make that transition simpler.

The diff is basically unreadable, I'd recommend just giving the new file a brief read.
