            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p><code>--upgrade</code> isn't useful, since it's the default. So it's now hidden, but continues to warn if you enable it.</p>
<p><code>--no-upgrade</code> isn't useful, since it panics. So it's now removed entirely. This isn't breaking, since it already didn't work.</p>
<p><code>--upgrade-package</code> actually <em>is</em> useful, because it turns out it allows things like: <code>uv tool upgrade babel --upgrade-package &quot;babel&lt;0.2.14&quot;</code> to constrain the upgrade.</p>
<p>I left this in place but hid it... I think we should provide a better workflow for this, like <code>uv tool upgrade &quot;babel&lt;0.2.14&quot;</code>? It's strange to specify the package twice, and that <code>uv tool upgrade</code> has an <code>--upgrade-package</code> flag.</p>
