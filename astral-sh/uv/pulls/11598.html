<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Just to add the section for installing and upgrading uv tool, specifying the Python version, in the document.
Originally, it was planned to add a markdown block (header) for representation, but it was felt to be a bit redundant, so it ended up being like this.</p>
<p>close https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11536</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Run doc server with strict mode in local. (<code>mkdocs serve -f mkdocs.public.yml --strict</code>)

<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Yes, but should I put two commands (<strong>install</strong> and <strong>upgrade</strong>), or just put the <strong>install</strong> command?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it can be added, but perhaps it's only necessary to mention the minor differences and then point to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/ .</p>

Regarding the concept, to avoid misunderstanding it, I will refrain from modifying it for now. However, I have linked the guides to it.</p>
