<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Follow on to #11706. In the original PR, I tried to solve the issue by getting rid of the <code>ctrlc::set_handler</code> call. Unfortunately, this didn't work on windows due to an issue with the console crate. console 0.15.11 includes https://github.com/console-rs/console/pull/235, which resolves the issue, so now we can get rid of the call.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This change is not super important but I still think it's worthwhile. For one, spinning up a background thread to handle <code>SIGINT</code>s when we're going to be raising the <code>SIGINT</code> from within the function is more technical complexity than needed, now that there's an easy way to explicitly catch the Ctrl-C from the terminal input. Secondly, <code>ctrlc::set_handler</code>'s <a href="https://docs.rs/ctrlc/3.4.5/ctrlc/fn.set_handler.html">docs</a> advise that you set the handler just once, at the beginning of the program, so this use seems somewhat error prone. In fact, uv already has a second <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/461f4d9007160f7061a4fc0c4a5a84c613fdbff7/crates/uv/src/commands/project/add.rs#L596-L611">callsite</a> for this function (though I'm not sure if the two callsites could currently ever both occur on the same run of uv)</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I've tested this manually on linux (WSL ubuntu) and windows, though not on aarch64-apple-darwin as I don't have a machine running that. I would appreciate if someone would double-check that it works on such machines.</p>
<p>As discussed in the original PR, this change is pretty hard to test due to the fact that the behavior only occurs if stderr is connected to a tty. I experimented with using pseudoterminals to test this but it's still quite tricky due to the lack of x-platform non-blocking reads on the pty.</p>
<!-- How was it tested? -->
