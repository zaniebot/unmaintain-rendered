### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.2.8`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#028-2025-04-13)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.7...0.2.8)

\==================
This release fixes a bug where the constructors on `SignedDuration`
for floating point durations could panic (in debug mode) or produce
incorrect results (in release mode). This bug only impacts users of
the `try_from_secs_{f32,f64}` and `from_secs_{f32,f64}` methods on
`SignedDuration`.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;326](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/326):
    Add an alternate `Debug` impl for `SignedDuration` that only shows its second
    and nanosecond components (while using only one component when the other is
    zero).

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;324](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/324):
    Fix a bug that could produce a panic or incorrect results in
    `SignedDuration::(try_)?from_secs_{f32,f64}`.

### [`v0.2.7`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#027-2025-04-13)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.6...0.2.7)

\==================
This release includes a bug fix that changes how an empty but set `TZ`
environment variable is interpreted (as indistinguishable from `TZ=UTC`).
This also includes a new enabled by default create feature, `perf-inline`,
which allows toggling Jiff's use of `inline(always)`. This may help improve
compile times or decrease binary size.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;320](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/320):
    Remove some internal uses of generics to mildly improve compile times.
-   [#&#8203;321](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/321):
    Add `perf-inline` crate feature for controlling `inline(always)` annotations.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;311](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/311):
    Make `TZ=` indistinguishable from `TZ=UTC`.

### [`v0.2.6`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#026-2025-04-07)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.5...0.2.6)

\==================
This release includes a few bug fixes and support for discovering the IANA Time
Zone Database automatically on Illumos.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;315](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/315):
    Add support for automatically finding the tzdb on Illumos.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;305](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/305):
    Fixed `Zoned` rounding on days with DST time zone transitions.
-   [#&#8203;309](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/309):
    Fixed bug where `TimeZone::preceding` could omit historical time zone
    transitions for time zones that have eliminated DST in the present.
-   [#&#8203;312](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/312):
    Fixed `nth_weekday_in_month`, where it would sometimes incorrectly return an
    error.
