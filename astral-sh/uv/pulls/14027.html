<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This change is an improvement on the <code>dry_run</code> functionality introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9829. It now shows the version that would be upgraded to.</p>
<p>Note that despite its name, <code>updater.is_update_needed()</code> does not only check the version numbers, but it also checks if the executable can be actually upgraded. This is reflected in the wording of the new message. See https://docs.rs/axoupdater/0.9.0/axoupdater/struct.AxoUpdater.html#method.is_update_needed</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Tested locally</p>
<pre><code>info: Current version: v0.7.13
info: Checking for updates...
info: Latest/requested version: v0.7.13
info: Would not update uv. Already on the latest/requested version of uv.
