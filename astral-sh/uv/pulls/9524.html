Summary
<p>While working on potential bug fixes with temporary files on Windows (I think I am currently ecountering the same issue as #2810)
I noticed that sub-workspaces were not all having the same <code>tempfile</code> version. And they were not relying on the cargo root project dependency. I don&#x27;t know at all if it was done on purpose or not.
(I also wanted to override the root dependency with a local source but it was not possible due to sub-workspaces not relying on the same).</p>
<p>The root lockfile already pinned to the <code>3.14.0</code>. Some sub-workspaces were depending on the <code>3.12.0</code>, some others on the <code>3.14.0</code>. So I updated the root <code>Cargo.toml</code> to the <code>3.14.0</code>.</p>
<p>Feel free to decline if it was done on purpose! No worries at all :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>


Test Plan
<p>All units tests are still passing on my side. Let&#x27;s see with the pull-request CI :smile:</p>
