            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a minimal redux of #10861 to be compatible with <code>uv pip</code>.</p>
<p>This implements the interface described in: https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13065#issuecomment-2544000876 for <code>uv pip install</code> and <code>uv pip compile</code>. Namely <code>--group &lt;[path:]name&gt;</code>, where <code>path</code> when not defined defaults to <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>In that interface they add <code>--group</code> to <code>pip install</code>, <code>pip download</code>, and <code>pip wheel</code>. Notably we do not define <code>uv pip download</code> and <code>uv pip wheel</code>, so for parity we only need to implement <code>uv pip install</code>. However, we also support <code>uv pip compile</code> which is not part of pip itself, and <code>--group</code> makes sense there too.</p>
<hr />
<p>The behaviour of <code>--group</code> for <code>uv pip</code> commands makes sense for the cases upstream pip supports, but has confusing meanings in cases that only we support (because reading pyproject.tomls is New Tech to them but heavily supported by us). <strong>Specifically case (h) below is a concerning footgun, and case (e) below may get complaints from people who aren't well-versed in dependency-groups-as-they-pertain-to-wheels.</strong></p>
<h2>Only Group Flags</h2>
<p>Group flags on their own work reasonably and uncontroversially, except perhaps that they don't do very clever automatic project discovery.</p>
<p>a) <code>uv pip install --group path/to/pyproject.toml:mygroup</code> pulls up <code>path/to/project.toml</code> and installs all the packages listed by its <code>mygroup</code> dependency-group (essentially treating it like another kind of requirements.txt). In this regard it functions similarly to <code>--only-group</code> in the rest of uv's interface.</p>
<p>b) <code>uv pip install --group mygroup</code> is just sugar for <code>uv pip install --group pyproject.toml:mygroup</code> (<strong>note that no project discovery occurs</strong>, upstream pip simply hardcodes the path &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; here and we reproduce that.)</p>
<p>c) <code>uv pip install --group a/pyproject.toml:groupx --group b/pyproject.toml:groupy</code>, and any other instance of multiple <code>--group</code> flags, can be understood as completely independent requests for the given groups at the given files.</p>
<h2>Groups With Named Packages</h2>
<p>Groups being mixed with named packages also work in a fairly unsurprising way, especially if you understand that things like dependency-groups are not really supposed to exist on pypi, they're just for local development.</p>
<p>d) <code>uv pip install mypackage --group path/to/pyproject.toml:mygroup</code> much like multiple instances of <code>--group</code> the two requests here are essentially completely independent: pleases install <code>mypackage</code>, and please also install <code>path/to/pyproject.toml:mygroup</code>.</p>
<p>e) <code>uv pip install mypackage --group mygroup</code> is exactly the same, but this is where it becomes possible for someone to be a little confused, as you might think <code>mygroup</code> is supposed to refer to <code>mypackage</code> in some way (it can't). But no, it's sourcing <code>pyproject.toml:mygroup</code> from the current working directory.</p>
<h2>Groups With Requirements/Sourcetrees/Editables</h2>
<p>Requirements and sourcetrees are where I expect users to get confused. It behaves <em>exactly</em> the same as it does in the previous sections but you would absolutely be forgiven for expecting a different behaviour. <em>Especially</em> because <code>--group</code> with the rest of uv <em>does</em> do something different.</p>
<p>f) <code>uv pip install -r a/pyproject.toml --group b/pyproject.toml:mygroup</code> is again just two independent requests (install <code>a/pyproject.toml</code>'s dependencies, and <code>b/pyproject.toml</code>'s <code>mygroup</code>).</p>
<p>g) <code>uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --group mygroup</code> is exactly like the previous case but <em>incidentally</em> the two requests refer to the same file. What the user wanted to happen is almost certainly happening, but they are likely getting &quot;lucky&quot; here that they're requesting something simple.</p>
<p>h) <code>uv pip install -r a/pyproject.toml --group mygroup</code> is again exactly the same but the user is likely to get surprised and upset as this invocation actually sources two different files (install <code>a/pyproject.toml</code>'s dependencies, and <code>pyproject.toml</code>'s <code>mygroup</code>)! I would expect most people to assume the <code>--group</code> flag here is covering all applicable requirements/sourcetrees/editables, but no, it continues to be a totally independent reference to a file with a hardcoded relative path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I implemented/pushed the following changes, because I needed to wrap my head around them in code/tests to think them through semantically:</p>
<ul>
<li>totally unrestrict <code>--group</code> from all other sources in <code>uv-pip-install</code><ul>
<li>semantically i still have it that <code>--group</code> just installs that group in a pyproject.toml (still hardcoded ./pyproject.toml default for now, see below). All the following cases are accepted:<ul>
<li>&quot;unrelated&quot;: <code>uv pip install somepackage --group bar</code> (essentially sugar for two separate <code>uv pip install</code> invocations as it is in upstream <code>pip install</code>)</li>
<li>&quot;nice&quot;: <code>uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --group bar</code> (installs both the package's deps and its group bar) (but this is the user of the cli potentially getting &quot;lucky&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;confusing&quot;: <code>uv pip install -r foo/project.toml --group bar</code> (installs <code>foo/pyproject.toml</code>'s deps and <code>./pyproject.toml:bar</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>implementation-wise this was a bit hairy as we have to kind of detect if we're doing <code>--group</code> or <code>--only-group</code> by looking at all the other inputs, but it ends up making sense (really it's always <code>--only-group-but-additive-only</code>... it's just an artifact of the internal source_tree stuff and wanting to dedupe files that we need to do anything complex).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>enable the same semantics for <code>uv-pip-compile</code><ul>
<li>...this one I &quot;implemented&quot; and then I went to test it and realized that the semantics for pip-install are absolute nonsense here, i think? i think the old-old-old impl from last month where the --group just applies to every selected source is what you want here..? I'm not totally sure, I don't have a good intuition of what uses of this would look like... but I get the impression that <code>uv pip compile --group pyproject.toml:foo</code> is essentially gibberish? Or am I wrong?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>did not add project discovery in lieu of hardcoding <code>pyproject.toml</code> -- I was <em>going</em> to do this but then I realized that nowhere in the pip interface do we ever seem to invoke project discovery? Which was surprising. This seems like a big semantic departure if we start doing that? At very least needs to be discussed more.</li>

<p>We should add this to the documentation at</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/</li>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/</li>
</ul>
<p>We may want to mark <code>--group</code> on <code>uv pip compile</code> as &quot;in preview&quot; until support lands in <code>pip-tools</code>. See https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/2062. It looks like they're just considering using <code>::</code> instead of <code>:</code> as a separator? Moving this to preview would involve a runtime warning and a note in the doc.</p>

<p>I have a few stylistic nits remaining and want to see more user-facing documentation explaining how <code>--group</code> interacts with other options and how it differs from the rest of the uv interface. We can push that into a separate pull request, but it's very important. I'm happy to help with that if you need it.</p>

<p>A <code>--group</code> flag has not yet been implemented in <code>pip-tools</code> and we may change our semantics to match the upstream behavior when it is finalized. The upstream behavior can be tracked in ...</p>
