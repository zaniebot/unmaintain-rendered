<hr>
<p>If you install <code>black</code> from PyPI, then <code>-e ../black</code>, we need to uninstall the existing <code>black</code>. This sounds simple, but that in turn requires that we <em>know</em> <code>-e ../black</code> maps to the package <code>black</code>, so that we can mark it for uninstallation in the install plan. This, in turn, means that we need to build editable dependencies prior to the install plan.</p>
<p>This is just a bunch of reorganization to fix that specific bug (installing multiple versions of <code>black</code> if you run through the above workflow): we now run through the list of editables upfront, mark those that are already installed, build those that aren&#x27;t, and then ensure that <code>InstallPlan</code> correctly removes those that need to be removed, etc.</p>
<p>Closes #676.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin - All good but in the future I might recommend using a merge commit to avoid the force-push, so retain the PR but also the history.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem is a bit more complex here: #677 has two commits, one from #682 and one of its own. Since #682 had changes the first commit was clashing with main. I used graphite locally (cherry-pick would have also done) to smartly rebase the old first commit out and only keep the second, so i didn&#x27;t do any merge at all. I&#x27;m not sure how to emulate that with a merge commit.</p>
