<p>A couple of times you've fixed bugs for me late Thursday, and I've been impatiently checking till Monday or Tuesday before updating to the latest release version. 😆</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To be clear though, I don't reccomend releasing more often, just sometimes uv releases so fast I get a fixed version before I've had time to check if someone replied to my issue.</p>
