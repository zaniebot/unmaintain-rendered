            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, it's possible to break our test suite by having an env var set that influences uv, either a <code>UV_*</code> var, or something more generic such as the XDG env vars. We previously fixed them env-var-by-env-var as we discovered. By clearing uv-specific env var for subcommands, we can invert this.</p>
<p>We intentionally avoid clearing all env vars as some of them, especially on Windows, are system env vars required for basic operations.</p>
<p>Notable limitations are that this only affects tests that use <code>TestContext::add_shared_env</code> (default, can be opted-out).</p>
<p>Fixed #9873</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, it would definitely break some stuff.</p>
<p>https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/tree/dev-python/uv/uv-0.7.13.ebuild#n132</p>
<p>It's possible that some of them are no longer necessary, and others could be replaced by better fixes on uv's end (for example, by not looking at system configuration files when testing). However, my general feeling is that clearing the environment is a very bad idea, because you can't know what internal variables are needed for programs in that environment to run correctly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the code you linked, it would actually fix those cases: We don't read <code>COLUMNS</code> anymore (we're already overriding it in tests) and we fix all XDG problems including <code>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code>; <code>PATH</code> we'll continue to pass in. Re <code>PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE</code>, do you know why it's in there? Bytecode compilation is something we've put some effort in cause it's a big performance factor.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm still in favor of this approach, I think.</p>
<p>We can always add a <code>UV_TEST__NO_CLEAR_ENV=....</code> option if we need to.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It works for Unix, it's currently stuck on figuring out what env vars we need to pass through for Windows, CI should show what fails with the current generated list. Last time I tried a long list of env vars we pass through on Windows but got some unclear failures that I didn't get to investigate yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure yet. I thought about passing the same env vars through on Windows and on Unix, to minimize the cases where something works locally but then fails in CI for the opposite platform.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Purely offering an alternative approach as I'm maybe misunderstanding the goal of this PR. Would leveraging the EnvVars struct to label test environment variables to keep be sufficient? (at least that was on my mind originally back then).</p>
<p>This way you have a list of all the env vars you should remove, and all the ones you should keep supporting rather than clearing them all and spend significant amount of time figuring out which one to proxy / add back to satisfy all build environments.</p>
<p>e.g. <code>#[test_allow_override]</code> similar to attr_hidden for testing, with an additional exposed helper method like <code>EnvVars::list</code> to get all the test and non-test enablement ones. It also from my perspective would make it easier for contributions as there's less sources of truth.</p>
