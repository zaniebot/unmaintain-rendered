### [`v6.4.1`](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/releases/tag/v6.4.1): 🌈 Hotfix: Ignore deps starting with uv when finding uv version

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/compare/v6.4.0...v6.4.1)

##### Changes

Thank you [@&#8203;phpmypython](https://redirect.github.com/phpmypython) for raising a PR to fix this issue!

##### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Ignore deps starting with uv when finding uv version [@&#8203;eifinger](https://redirect.github.com/eifinger) ([#&#8203;492](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/issues/492))

### [`v6.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/releases/tag/v6.4.0): 🌈 Add input `version-file`

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/compare/v6.3.1...v6.4.0)

##### Changes

You can now use the `version-file` input to specify a file that contains the version of uv to install.
This can either be a `pyproject.toml` or `uv.toml` file which defines a `required-version` or
uv defined as a dependency in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.

```yaml
- name: Install uv based on the version defined in requirements.txt
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
  with:
    version-file: "requirements.txt"
```
