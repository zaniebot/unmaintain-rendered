Do we want to highlight anything other than "fast" (maybe powerful/comprehensive?)?

Not strongly opposed but what's the problem with this? I feel like it's nice to have consistency in this copy across various sources.

I agree consistency seems nice, but I'm kind of against having this marketing copy in the documentation and CLI descriptions. We already dropped this in the CLI:

```
❯ uv help
An extremely fast Python package manager.
```

I think it makes more sense in blog posts and the README?

Okay, cheesy I know but let's bias towards retaining this — if we had a marketing team they'd probably make us :)
