<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR implements automatic cache cleanup that runs in the background during normal
uv operations. This addresses issue #5731 by preventing unbounded cache growth
without requiring user intervention.</p>
<p>The autoprune task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spawns as a fire-and-forget background task when the cache is initialized</li>
<li>Removes unreferenced archives older than 1 hour (grace period for in-flight ops)</li>
<li>Requires no exclusive lock since archives are immutable and uniquely identified;
if there's no symlink referencing an archive, no process can be using it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I've added unit tests for this feature. Having said that, I'm new to this project, so I'd appreciate any suggestions for testing more thoroughly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do I understand it correctly that this doesn't remove old unpacked wheels generally, just archives having no symlinks pointing to them?</p>
<p>I do think that needs to lock, there can be multiple uv versions running on a system and it's generally safer to lock than to use time based approaches.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin That's a very good catch! I've updated this PR to take the safer approach of only removing archives that are unreferenced.</p>
