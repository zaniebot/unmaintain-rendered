# Remove insta_cmd

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2024-02-01 14:45_

We need more flexible filters than those `inta` offers, and `insta_cmd` makes it impossible to plug in programmatic filters. At the same time we use barely any of `insta_cmd`'s features. We can replace the subset we need in about 50 loc.
