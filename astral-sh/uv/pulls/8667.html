            <div class="timeline-body"><p>See https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/262 for prior discussion.</p>
<p>In most parts of uv, we don't want to depend on pubgrub, but we want to use its powerful version ranges arithmetic. https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/262 split out the ranges into a separate, small crate (that can be published separately to crates.io) that contains just the <code>Ranges</code> type.</p>
<p>With this first in a series of changes, we only depend on pubgrub in the uv-resolver crate. This enables us to directly depend on <code>Ranges</code> in the pep440 and pep508 crates without blocking downstream consumers (direct or through the crates.io versions), and also merging uv-pubgrub into the pep440 crate.</p>
<p>Note that the name is now <code>Ranges</code>, since the type formerly known as <code>Range</code> was a misnomer, it contains multiple ranges.</p>
