# infra: source github templates

---

_Pull request opened by @JacobCoffee on 2024-02-16 04:28_

## What

- Adds PR and Issue templates.


## Meta
What do you think about vendoring some of the general things from ruff and other repos into a `.github` repo. This way one change against a "generalized template" or config would propagate to all repos in the org.



Mainly thinking about issue/pr templates and other common [community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) ([example](https://github.com/litestar-org/.github))
