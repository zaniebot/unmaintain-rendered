# Rust 1.75

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2023-12-28 18:36_

The `async fn` and return-position `impl Trait` in traits improve `BuildContext` ergonomics. The traits use `impl Future` over `async fn` to make the send bound explicit (https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits.html).

The remaining changes are due to clippy.
