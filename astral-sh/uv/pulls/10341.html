<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/fn.from_reader.html suggests that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reading from a source against which short reads are not efficient, such as a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html">File</a>, you will want to apply your own buffering because serde_json will not buffer the input. See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html">std::io::BufReader</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without this buffering, we observe a sequence of single byte reads which can be quite inefficient depending on the underlying filesystem.</p>
<p>This adds buffering with <code>std::io::BufReader</code> to resolve this.</p>
