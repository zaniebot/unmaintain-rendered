### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>Pr0methean/zip (zip)</summary>

### [`v1.1.2`](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/releases/tag/v1.1.2)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Pr0methean/zip/compare/1.1.1...v1.1.2)

##### Added

-   `index_for_name`, `index_for_path`, `name_for_index`: get the index of a file given its path or vice-versa, without
    initializing metadata from the local-file header or needing to mutably borrow the `ZipArchive`.
-   `add_symlink_from_path`, `shallow_copy_file_from_path`, `deep_copy_file_from_path`, `raw_copy_file_to_path`: copy a
    file or create a symlink using `AsRef<Path>` arguments

##### Changed

-   `add_directory_from_path` and `start_file_from_path` are no longer deprecated, and they now normalize `..` as well as
    `.`.
