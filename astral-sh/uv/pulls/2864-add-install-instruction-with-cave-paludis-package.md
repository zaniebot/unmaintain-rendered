We're hesitating to merge because we're not familiar with this package manager (although I learned about it now via Google) — can you explain the importance of adding this? We need our README to remain relatively concise to avoid overwhelming people.

It's the package manager of Exherbo Linux, we use as a main distribution as a cloud provider. I've recently added the `uv` package in the official rust repository, so added it to the documentation. I let you decide to merge or close.

I think we're explicitly not going to add more package managers at this time. Maybe when we have a dedicated documentation website we'll list more.
