# Add issue template for pip works, uv fails cases

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2024-02-26 14:20_

In cases where uv doesn't work on something where pip succeeds, it often took us some back-and-forth to get the relevant information. I want to improve this with this issue template, especially asking early about their python setup. Feel free to add fields you find relevant.
