# Use a custom pubgrub report formatter

---

_@zanieb_

Uses https://github.com/zanieb/pubgrub/pull/10 to drastically simplify our reporter implementation. This will allow us to make use of upstream improvements to the reporter e.g. https://github.com/zanieb/pubgrub/pull/8 without multiple duplicative pull requests.
