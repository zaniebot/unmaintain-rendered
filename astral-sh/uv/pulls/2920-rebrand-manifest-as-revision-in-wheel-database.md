# Rebrand `Manifest` as `Revision` in wheel database

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-08 23:55_

## Summary

I think this is a much clearer name for this concept: the set of "versions" of a given wheel or source distribution. We also use "Manifest" elsewhere to refer to the set of requirements, constraints, etc., so this was overloaded.
