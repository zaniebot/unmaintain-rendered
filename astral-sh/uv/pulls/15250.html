Summary
<p>This MR implements the shorthand option <code>-C</code> for <code>--project</code>, so you can call</p>
<pre><code>uv -C my/project/ run python
</code></pre>
<p>Many other prominent tools use this, like <code>make</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>cargo</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>meson</code>, <code>ninja</code> etc., and it would be great to see <code>uv</code> follow that convention, as proposed in #12040.</p>
<p>However, there is one small-ish technical hurdle: <code>-C</code> was recently also picked up as a shorthand for <code>uv pip install --config-settings</code> (#1460). These two options clash, because <code>clap</code> cannot disambiguate between global and subcommand options.</p>
<p>I could not find a way to deprecate <code>clap</code> options, so I simply removed the other occurrences for now, just to get started. Please understand that this was only done to get this MR out, and I see this MR as a conversation starter, not a s a finished proposal.</p>
<p>If you would like to adopt <code>-C/--project</code> (and I 100% think you should), what would be the best way forward to integrate this feature? I&#x27;d be happy to amend this MR to implement them.</p>
Test Plan
<p>The corresponding tests strings were adjusted, no additional tests were added.</p>
