# Rename `--raw-sources` to `--raw`

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2025-05-08 16:58_

This also omits bounds on constraints, and is useful for that. This retains `--raw-sources` as an alias. I've had this on my mind for a while, but https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12946 reminded me of it again.
