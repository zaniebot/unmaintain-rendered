# Show fully-resolved URLs in non-resolution contexts

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-18 17:40_

We now show the fully-resolved URL, rather than the URL as given by the user, _everywhere_ except for the output resolution file (which should retain relative paths, unexpanded environment variables, etc.).

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/issues/687.
