# Add a note to say that dependencies between workspace members are editable

---

_@ReinforcedKnowledge_

Just a small note to say that dependencies between workspace members are editable as shown in #9362 

(This might be obvious since if dependencies between workspaces members are not editable then every time a workspace member is update it has to be manually reinstalled but since it's in the concepts documentation and since I see a lot of issues about workspaces, that little note might help newcomers a little bit)
