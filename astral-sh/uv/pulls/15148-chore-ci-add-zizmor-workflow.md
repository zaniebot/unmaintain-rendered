# chore(ci): add zizmor workflow

---

_@woodruffw_

## Summary

Adds a zizmor workflow, similar to the one in python-build-standalone.

I'm still triaging the findings manually locally, but this will also have them show up in the security dashboard so others can see what's going on.

## Test Plan

No functional changes; new workflow only.
