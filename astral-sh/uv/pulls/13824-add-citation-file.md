I'm not sure if this is applicable to us since we don't have a publication for uv.

I think it's still reasonable to cite a project on GitHub directly. I looked into Zenodo (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13822#issuecomment-2940242926) but it seems like a bit more work than it's worth right now. Maybe I could manually upload a placeholder.
