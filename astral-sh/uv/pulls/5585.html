<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>If I’ve correctly analyzed the file <code>crates/uv-extract/src/vendor/cloneable_seekable_reader.rs</code> as vendored and forked from https://github.com/google/ripunzip/blob/v0.4.0/src/unzip/cloneable_seekable_reader.rs, then this PR adds the corresponding license text from https://github.com/google/ripunzip/blob/v0.4.0/LICENSE.</p>
<p>This would therefore fix https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5584.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>N/A; inspect for appropriate contents.</p>
