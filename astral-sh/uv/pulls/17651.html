            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m picking up some pretty old work here prompted by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/pull/737">astral-sh/setup-uv#737</a> and a desire to be able to fetch newer <code>python-build-standalone</code> versions.</p>
<p>Previously, we only supported a static version which means we can construct a known GitHub asset URL trivially. However, to support the &quot;latest&quot; version or version constraints, we need a registry with metadata. The GitHub API is notoriously rate limited, so we don&#x27;t want to use that. It&#x27;d be great to use PyPI (and more broadly, the resolver), but I don&#x27;t want to introduce it in this code path yet. Instead, this hits https://github.com/astral-sh/versions in order to determine the available versions. We stream the NDJSON line by line to avoid downloading the whole file in order to read one version.</p>
<p>Loosely requires <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17648">astral-sh/uv#17648</a> to reach production and be ported to <code>ruff</code>, though it&#x27;s not a blocker.</p>
