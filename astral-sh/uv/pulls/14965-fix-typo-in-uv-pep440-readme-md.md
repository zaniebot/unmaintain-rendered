# Fix typo in uv-pep440/README.md

---

_@cbscsm_

## Summary

I noticed what appears to be a small typo in the documentation. In the section describing dev versions, it says `sbpth table releases`. I believe this was meant to be `both stable releases`, to match the structure of the previous sentence about post versions.
