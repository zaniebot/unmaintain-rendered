# Add brew installation instructions to README.md

---

_@rec_

Brew is a popular MacOS package manager, and as I write this, `brew install uv` installs the most recent `uv` version 0.7.5.

Thanks, but this is already available in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#homebrew and we'd like to keep the README slim as there are a bunch of ways to install uv :)

As zanie said, we want to keep the quickstart guide as concise as possible, showing only a small selection of installers.
