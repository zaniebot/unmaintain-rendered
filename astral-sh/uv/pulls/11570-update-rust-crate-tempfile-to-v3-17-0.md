### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>Stebalien/tempfile (tempfile)</summary>

### [`v3.17.0`](https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#3170)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/compare/v3.16.0...v3.17.0)

-   Make sure to use absolute paths in when creating unnamed temporary files (avoids a small race in the "immediate unlink" logic) and in `Builder::make_in` (when creating temporary files of arbitrary types).
-   Prevent a theoretical crash that could (maybe) happen when a temporary file is created from a drop function run in a TLS destructor. Nobody has actually reported a case of this happening in practice and I have been unable to create this scenario in a test.
-   When reseeding with `getrandom`, use platform (e.g., CPU) specific randomness sources where possible.
-   Clarify some documentation.
-   Unlink unnamed temporary files on windows *immediately* when possible instead of waiting for the handle to be closed. We open files with "Unix" semantics, so this is generally possible.
