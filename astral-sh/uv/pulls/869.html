            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These are useful for benchmarking <code>pip-sync</code>. Committing them in the repo makes results stable over time, and makes it easier to talk about perf experiments (you can say &quot;I got this result with input compiled/all-kinds.txt&quot;, etc. and people will know what you mean)</p>
<p>Some of them failed compilation (maybe they're tests that are supposed to fail) and some failed install (maybe I'm missing system dependencies). If I was here for longer I'd investigate but for now just testing the ones that work</p>
