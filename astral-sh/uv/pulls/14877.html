<p>In addition to copying entry points and rewriting their shebangs, if we encounter entry points that do not have shebangs (e.g., binaries), we'll symlink (or copy, on Windows) them into the directory.</p>
<p>I'm uncertain if this is the correct approach or if we should change binary discovery in Ruff to account for this case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One think to think about with a copy is that executable-relative dependencies will break. This will be fine for symlinks, and so in particular <code>$ORIGIN</code>-relative dependencies will be fine... but is there an equivalent on Windows? I believe Windows executables load .dlls out of their current directory, do people rely on that in stuff shipped in wheels?</p>
