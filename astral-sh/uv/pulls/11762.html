            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This would introduce the ability to log traces to a log file for a user to view later - closes #9850 .</p>
Test Plan
<p>I have done manual testing to check the log file against the trace output on terminal. I have also added some snap shot tests to ensure the <code>--log</code> invocation and the subsequent &quot;See &lt;log_file&gt; for details&quot; message behaves as intended.</p>
Requirements Discussion
<p>There are some requirements and implementation details that need to be discussed as they depend on users would want to use this. As a lot of people who would use this feature are contributors, trying to log while testing it would great to get their input on how they would like to use this. I have added comments that start with &quot;Discuss&quot; to indicate these but here are some things that need to be discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li>If user specifies a log file that already exists, should that result in failure, overwrite existing content or append to it (current implementation.</li>
<li>Should the log file also contain print statements - user facing output or only logs from <code>tracing</code> crate (current)</li>
<li>Should the log file also contain color just like the logs to terminal or no color (currently this and I lean towards this as text editors that I use to view logs (VI and console on mac both don&#x27;t support ansi be default)</li>
<li>Should the hierarchical tree logs and the level of logs that are written to file logs be separated - introduce the equivalent of <code>RUST_LOG</code> for file logs, currently they are determined the count of <code>--log_verbose</code> flag ranging from 0 to 3</li>
<li>Should the &quot;See &lt;log_file&gt; for detailed logs&quot; appear on every invocation where <code>--log</code> is set or only on errors and failure exits.</li>
</ol>
