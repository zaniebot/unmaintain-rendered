            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Adds persistent file logs to snapshot testing that can be viewed later.  This builds on to #11762  and attempts to resolve #8351 . This introduces a dedicated log directory that keeps logs from test runs, unless another directory is specified.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I have manually checked if there is a log file for each test file after running the tests. I do believe testing should be a bit more robust, however i am unsure how can that be done - check file logs against cli logs is not easily possible because of print statements in cli.</p>
<h2>Discuss</h2>
<p>I wanted to get more input on whether there should be log file per command invocation or other other frequency. Currently there is a log file for each test file. To implement one log for each test is quite simple but it requires tediously adding a <code>--log</code> flag to each test.</p>
