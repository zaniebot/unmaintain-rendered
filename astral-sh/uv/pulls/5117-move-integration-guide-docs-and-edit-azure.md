Personally would drop "Using in" from all of these.

What's "artifactories" here? Isn't Artifactory a specific product from JFrog?

Yeah I'm using it as a drop-in term for all such things but maybe there's a better one? We can use "Custom package indexes" but they're not really custom? "Commercial package indexes"?

I've been considering dropping the "Using in" too... can't remember where I saw that style.
