# chore(docs): update wording and add `alt` tag

---

_Pull request opened by @JacobCoffee on 2024-02-16 04:16_

Small grammar updates for word flow

I believe the "Support for a wide range of advanced..." section could also be changed to a sub-bullet list if this is more preferred?

Feel free to close :)

Should we omit the "Badge" part?
