            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PEP 639 does not allow any characters that aren't in either their limited glob syntax or the alphanumeric Unicode characters. This means there's no way to express a glob such as <code>**/@test</code> for the excludes.</p>
<p>We extend the glob syntax from PEP 639 by introducing backslash escapes, which can escape all characters but path separators (forward and backwards slashes) to be parsed verbatim.</p>
<p>This means we have two glob parsers: The strict PEP 639 parser for <code>project.license-files</code>, and our extended parser for <code>tool.uv</code>, with a slight difference if you need to use special characters, to both adhere to PEP 639 and to support cases such as #13280.</p>
<p>Fixes #13280</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is the thing that perplexes me the most here. Are you doing things this way because of PEP 639? But since you're already going beyond PEP 639 by introducing escaping, does it make sense to only <em>require</em> escaping for meta characters?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this probably LGTM. The requirement to escape characters like <code>@</code>, even though they aren't glob meta characters, is somewhat odd. Although I defer to your judgment here based on PEP 639. And I agree with you that it should be somewhat rare to need to do this.</p>
<p>For additional context, the &quot;traditional&quot; way of escaping things in some glob syntaxes (which don't have backslash escaping mechanisms) is to put them in a character class. So e.g., <code>[@]</code> or <code>[*]</code> for example. IDK if that helps with respect to PEP 639.</p>
<p>In PEP 639, requiring all globs to only consist of alphanumerics, underscores, hypens, dots and the meta-characters and making literally everything else illegal seems rather odd. Do you know why they did that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We've decided to go ahead with this solution from two considerations:</p>
<p>Usually, <code>[…]</code> is used as escape as backslashes are reserved for Windows paths, but PEP 639 and our portable paths (just like URLs) both only use forward slashes.</p>
<p>Using backslashes, and applying them conservatively for now allows evolving the rules: We can add more meta characters and allows more characters without escape later, without breaking existing globs.</p>
