Honestly not in love with the look, seems like it'd need a tweak to the size.

Moving from 1.2 -> 1.0 rem

Yeah I prefer uv logo to Astral logo. Would be nice to add more Astral to the footer if possible but not sure.

Think I should shrink it a little as in the later comment?

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-24 20:44_

I slightly prefer the larger version but I'm fine with either.

Note we use the lightning bolt logo in Ruff (which looks pretty nice).
