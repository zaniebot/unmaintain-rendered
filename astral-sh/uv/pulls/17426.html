<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This fixes issue with installing packages that contain URLs without explicit file extensions</p>
<p>The example are GitHub releases that can be references with URLs like https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/tarball/dev (real example at https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro-api/blob/master/setup.py#L36).</p>
<p>If extension is not specified, we assume it is a tar.gz file, as it's a common pattern for GitHub.</p>
<p>Fixes: 17425

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I added test with installing a package without file extension..</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Appreciate the contribution! Unfortunately I don't think it's correct to assume <code>.tar.gz</code> for extension-less URLs. I think the right fix here is that we need to respect <code>Content-Disposition</code> headers in these cases.</p>

<p>What if I update the code to use headers for deciding the content type?</p>

<p>If you get content-disposition header specifying a filename with extension, is it not enough?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think it's not enough -- at the moment a disposition of <code>tar+gz</code> is a decent proxy for a &quot;source archive,&quot; but as @konstin notes we can't clearly distinguish that from a well-formed sdist (and in the future, <code>tar+gz</code> could potentially signal a wheel or other distribution format as well).</p>
<p>I think as a workaround, you could use one of GitHub's other archive endpoints, i.e. one that provides a suffix. For example, this should work:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/archive/refs/heads/dev.zip
</code></pre>
<p>(I believe that that endpoint is also recommended in general, since I <em>think</em> it's not subject to the same global IP restrictions as the <code>api.github.com</code> ones.)</p>
<p>This is potentially something that uv could provide a hint/suggestion on 🙂</p>

<p>But we would have exactly the same problem for URLs with file extension - you don't really know what is behind tar.gz file. So using content disposition would just make it behave the same as URL with file extension. Also, content-disposition is not a mime-type/content-type, it's a filename with extension. So it's not <code>tar+gz</code> but rather <code>file.tar.gz</code> or <code>package-1.0.sdist</code>.</p>
<p>And, for the particular package I'm showing as an example, this is not a problem at all. The no-extensions URLs are used for testing dependencies, that we don't even plan to install. Just having them in metadata prevents uv from installing package that is otherwise perfectly installable/usable.</p>

<p>Yeah, but this is an issue at a different layer: PEP 625 says that an sdist has the <code>.tar.gz</code> extension, so that's an initial check. If the retrieved content then isn't actually a valid tarball, we'd fail subsequently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, content-disposition is not a mime-type/content-type, it's a filename with extension. So it's not <code>tar+gz</code> but rather <code>file.tar.gz</code> or <code>package-1.0.sdist</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, yeah, this was my misunderstanding. I think it'd be reasonable for uv to handle URLs that don't have an extension but that <em>do</em> have a valid <code>.tar.gz</code> filename in their <code>Content-Disposition</code> header's filename field. One nuance there is that it's unclear what uv should do in this case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-http">GET /foo/bar/abc-1.2.3.tar.gz

200 OK
...
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;def-4.5.6.tar.gz&quot;
...
</code></pre>
<p>i.e., whether we should prefer the filename inferred from the URL or from the <code>Content-Disposition</code> header. I suspect the HTTP specs say the latter, but we should see what pip and other tools do (if anything) in this case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like pip handles <code>Content-Disposition</code> and gives it precedence, at least: https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/545eda389c41478e2f99d23212254d757d8c2cef/src/pip/_internal/network/download.py#L105-L117</p>
