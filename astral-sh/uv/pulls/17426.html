Thank you for contributing to uv! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

- Does this pull request include a summary of the change? (See below.)
- Does this pull request include a descriptive title?
- Does this pull request include references to any relevant issues?
-->

<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This fixes issue with installing packages that contain URLs without explicit file extensions</p>
<p>The example are GitHub releases that can be references with URLs like https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/tarball/dev (real example at https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro-api/blob/master/setup.py#L36).</p>
<p>If extension is not specified, we assume it is a tar.gz file, as it's a common pattern for GitHub.</p>
<p>Fixes: 17425

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I added test with installing a package without file extension..</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Appreciate the contribution! Unfortunately I don't think it's correct to assume <code>.tar.gz</code> for extension-less URLs. I think the right fix here is that we need to respect <code>Content-Disposition</code> headers in these cases.</p>

<p>Note that source tarballs from GitHub are not proper source distributions. They happen to work in pip and uv, but at least in uv that's more accidental than a proper feature and should not relied upon.</p>

<p>What if I update the code to use headers for deciding the content type?</p>

<p>If you get content-disposition header specifying a filename with extension, is it not enough?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think it's not enough -- at the moment a disposition of <code>tar+gz</code> is a decent proxy for a &quot;source archive,&quot; but as @konstin notes we can't clearly distinguish that from a well-formed sdist (and in the future, <code>tar+gz</code> could potentially signal a wheel or other distribution format as well).</p>
<p>I think as a workaround, you could use one of GitHub's other archive endpoints, i.e. one that provides a suffix. For example, this should work:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/archive/refs/heads/dev.zip
</code></pre>
<p>(I believe that that endpoint is also recommended in general, since I <em>think</em> it's not subject to the same global IP restrictions as the <code>api.github.com</code> ones.)</p>
<p>This is potentially something that uv could provide a hint/suggestion on 🙂</p>
