<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This fixes issue with installing packages that contain URLs without explicit file extensions</p>
<p>The example are GitHub releases that can be references with URLs like https://api.github.com/repos/pyro-ppl/pyro/tarball/dev (real example at https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro-api/blob/master/setup.py#L36).</p>
<p>If extension is not specified, we assume it is a tar.gz file, as it's a common pattern for GitHub.</p>
<p>Fixes: 17425
