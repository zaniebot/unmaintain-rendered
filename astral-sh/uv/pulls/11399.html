<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This adds <code>NO_BINARY</code> and <code>NO_BINARY_PACKAGE</code> environment variables to the uv CLI, allowing the user to specify packages to build from source using environment variables. Its not a complete fix for #4291 as it does not handle the <code>pip</code> subcommand.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>This was tested by running <code>uv sync</code> with various <code>UV_NO_BINARY</code> and <code>UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE</code> environment variables set and checking that the correct set of packages were compiled rather than taken from pre-built wheels.</p>
