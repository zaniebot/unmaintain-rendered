# Explain build frontend vs. build backend

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2025-01-30 13:05_

We regularly get questions why `uv build` is missing certain files or using the wrong build tag, when that's done by the build backend and part of the build backend's docs. I tried to clarify this difference and to redirect users to look at the tool's docs instead of wondering why uv's docs don't explain that.
