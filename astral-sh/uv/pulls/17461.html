<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>When a project requests a newer Python version than the current UV version knows about, the existing error message isn't all that useful. Suggesting updating <code>uv</code> seems like a good hint for humans (and future LLM overlords) alike.</p>
<p>I just ran into this with some colleagues of mine. I upgraded a project to 3.14. They pulled and did a <code>uv sync</code>, but it failed. It turned out that their uv installation was at 0.5. Running a <code>uv self update</code> to update to 0.9.x made it work again.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: No interpreter found for Python ==3.14.* in managed installations or search path</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: No interpreter found for Python ==3.14.* in managed installations or search path</p>
<p>hint: No Python download is available for Python 3.14. This version might be newer than your uv. Update uv and retry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current idea for the hint does not explicitly mention running <code>uv self update</code>. That's because I felt like this wouldn't be a good idea due to the various ways uv could be installed. If you say <code>uv self update</code> is always safe, I'd be happy to adjust the hint and explicitly mention that command.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p><code>cargo nextest</code> as laid out in the contributing docs.</p>
