<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>When a project requests a newer Python version than the current UV version knows about, the existing error message isn't all that useful. Suggesting updating <code>uv</code> seems like a good hint for humans (and future LLM overlords) alike.</p>
<p>I just ran into this with some colleagues of mine. I upgraded a project to 3.14. They pulled and did a <code>uv sync</code>, but it failed. It turned out that their uv installation was at 0.5. Running a <code>uv self update</code> to update to 0.9.x made it work again.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: No interpreter found for Python ==3.14.* in managed installations or search path</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: No interpreter found for Python ==3.14.* in managed installations or search path</p>
<p>hint: No Python download is available for Python 3.14. This version might be newer than your uv. Update uv and retry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current idea for the hint does not explicitly mention running <code>uv self update</code>. That's because I felt like this wouldn't be a good idea due to the various ways uv could be installed. If you say <code>uv self update</code> is always safe, I'd be happy to adjust the hint and explicitly mention that command.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p><code>cargo nextest</code> as laid out in the contributing docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should say something closer to:</p>
<p>&quot;This version of uv is unaware of a managed Python download for {request}. Consider updating uv if the requested version is newer.&quot;</p>
<p>Or something like that, I'm not 100% on the wording.</p>
<p>&quot;no ... is available&quot; implies it's unavailable which we're contradicting by suggesting</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Use <code>.with_filtered_python_sources()</code> on the context instead. i.e. <code>let context = TestContext::new_with_versions(&amp;[&quot;3.12&quot;]).with_managed_python_dirs().with_filtered_python_sources()</code>.</p>
<p>Then you can drop this.</p>

<p>This uv release may not support managed Python 3.100 yet. Update uv and retry.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this reads a lot better!</p>
<p>I'm curious to learn your reasoning for not explicitly using the word &quot;update&quot;, i.e. &quot;Consider updating to a newer version of uv&quot;?</p>
