            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR adds a new integrations doc page for using uv with <a href="https://coiled.io/">Coiled</a>. It's a slightly adapted version of this blog post https://docs.coiled.io/blog/uv-coiled-cloud-scripts.html</p>
<p>Side note: it's been really pleasant using uv and Coiled together recently</p>

<p>I also wasn't sure how to get the logs for the job. I eventually found it with
<code>uvx coiled batch logs 1067394</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that's exactly where to go for getting logs programatically. The other, less programatic, way is to look at logs in the Coiled UI. We output the link to view the batch job in the Coiled UI in the terminal output from <code>coiled batch run</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>if the user experience for running the script locally is that it waits for execution
and shows the output, then we need to address that difference in user experience here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a fair point. I went ahead an made a small update here https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14430/commits/109a0992ddd5d14dd258b01e8768f692cab8b064 that hopefully helps address this. Let me know what you think -- happy to update again</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It looks like <code>uvx coiled batch run -- uv run process.py</code> isn't supported (using the <code>--</code> as a
separator), I wanted to use that for a single-line command that still separated the <code>uv run</code>
command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm that's supposed to work and I'm not able to reproduce an issue -- what error are you seeing?</p>
