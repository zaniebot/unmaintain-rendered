# Fix typos in docs, error messages and comments

---

_Pull request opened by @edmorley on 2024-09-01 11:30_

What started off as spotting/fixing a user facing docs typo turned into a bit of a yak shave with my local spell-checker, as part of [upstreaming](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/1090#issuecomment-2323281389) improvements to `crate-ci/typos` (which runs in this repo's CI already, but [by design](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos?tab=readme-ov-file#why-was--not-corrected) uses a known-typos strategy rather than a purely dictionary based approach).
