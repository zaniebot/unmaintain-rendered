# puffin-cli: fix botched merge

---

_Pull request opened by @BurntSushi on 2024-01-04 16:58_

This fixes a compilation error with tests on current `main`. I didn't
track down the exact provenance, but I'd guess it's the result of a
botched merge. (i.e., Two or more PRs that pass CI independently, but
when merged cause failures.)
