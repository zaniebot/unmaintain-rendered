### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.2.3`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#023-2025-03-07)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.2...0.2.3)

\==================
This is a small release that fixes a bug in the handling of POSIX time zones
in some cases. Specifically, the implementation of `Date::yesterday` was wrong
when the date was the first of the month. This was a regression introduced in
`0.2.2` and was not present in older releases. More test coverage has been
added.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;290](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/290):
    Fix bug in implementation of `Date::yesterday`.

### [`v0.2.2`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#022-2025-03-06)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.1...0.2.2)

\==================
This release of Jiff includes a new opt-in proc macro for embedding a
`TimeZone` into your binary. Just enable Jiff's `static` feature, and this will
print the current time in the `America/New_York` time zone:

```rust
use jiff::{
    tz::{self, TimeZone},
    Timestamp,
};

fn main() {
    static TZ: TimeZone = tz::get!("America/New_York");
    let zdt = Timestamp::now().to_zoned(TZ.clone());
    println!("{zdt}");
}
```

This enables `TimeZone` to be meaningfully used in core-only environments,
even when dynamic memory allocation isn't available.

This release also features a number of performance improvements for time zone
lookups. In some cases, the improvement is significant (by an order of
magnitude).

Additionally, the IANA Time Zone Database embedded into `jiff-tzdb` now
uses "rearguard" semantics. This means that the boolean flag indicating
whether daylight saving time is active or not (only accessible via
`TimeZone::to_offset_info`) will respect the actual definition of
daylight saving time. (This is relevant, for example, for time zones like
`Europe/Dublin`, where their summer time is *legally* known as their standard
time, but is in effect daylight saving time.)

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;256](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/256):
    Add `tz::{get,include}` macros for time zone support in core-only environments.
-   [#&#8203;258](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/258):
    Switch to `rearguard` tzdb data in `jiff-tzdb` and document it.
-   [#&#8203;259](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/259):
    De-duplicate TZif data in `jiff-tzdb`.
-   [#&#8203;273](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/273):
    Add "crate features" documentation to `jiff-sqlx` and `jiff-diesel`.
-   [#&#8203;277](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/277):
    Document semver guarantee for error conditions on `Timestamp` constructors.
-   [#&#8203;277](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/287):
    Greatly optimize time zone lookups (for both timestamps and civil datetimes).

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;261](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/261):
    Improve the documentation for `ZonedWith::nanosecond` and
    `ZonedWith::subsec_nanosecond`.
