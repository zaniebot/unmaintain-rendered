            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR gets rid of the manifest that we store for source distributions. Historically, that manifest included the source distribution metadata, plus a list of built wheels.</p>
<p>The problem with the manifest is that it duplicates state, since we now have to look at both the manifest and the filesystem to understand the cache state. Instead, I think we should treat the cache as the source of truth, and get rid of the duplicated state in the manifest.</p>
<p>Now, we store the manifest (which is merely used to check for cache freshness -- in future PRs, I will repurpose it though, so I left it around), then the distribution metadata as its own file, then any distributions in the same directory. When we want to see if there are any valid distributions, we <code>readdir</code> on the directory. This is also much more consistent with how the install plan works.</p>
