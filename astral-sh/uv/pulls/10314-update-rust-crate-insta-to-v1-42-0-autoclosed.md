### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>mitsuhiko/insta (insta)</summary>

### [`v1.42.0`](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1420)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/compare/1.41.1...1.42.0)

-   Text snapshots no longer contain `snapshot_type: text` in their metadata.  For
    context, we originally added this in the prior release (1.41.0) to support
    binary snapshots, but some folks disliked the diff noise on any snapshot
    changes, and the maintainers' weighted votes favored reverting.  I apologize
    that this will cause some additional churn for those who used `cargo test --force-update-snapshots` to update their snapshots to the 1.41 format;
    running this again with 1.42 will remove those metadata entries.  To confirm:
    this doesn't affect whether snapshot tests pass or fail — the worst impact is
    some additional diffs in metadata.  [#&#8203;690](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/690)
-   Pending snapshots are no longer removed throughout the workspace by
    `cargo-insta` before running tests.  Instead, running a test will overwrite or
    remove its own pending snapshot.  To remove all pending snapshots, use `cargo
    insta reject` or run tests with `--unreferenced=delete`.  [#&#8203;651](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/651)
-   `insta::internals::SettingsBindDropGuard` (returned from
    `Settings::bind_to_scope`) no longer implements `Send`. This was incorrect and
    any tests relying on this behavior where not working properly. Fixes [#&#8203;694](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/694) in
    [#&#8203;695](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/695) by [@&#8203;jalil-salame](https://redirect.github.com/jalil-salame)
