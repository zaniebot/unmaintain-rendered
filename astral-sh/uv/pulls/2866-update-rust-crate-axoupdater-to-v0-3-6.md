[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/compare/v0.3.5...v0.3.6)

This is a minor bugfix release. It updates the ordering of axo releases queries to reflect changes to the deployed API.

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/compare/v0.3.4...v0.3.5)

This is a minor bugfix release. It makes us try to temporarily rename the current executable on windows, in case we're about to overwrite it.

### [`v0.3.4`](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-034-2024-04-04)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/compare/v0.3.3...v0.3.4)
