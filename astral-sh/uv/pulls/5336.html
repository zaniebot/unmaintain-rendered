            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Adds an IPA pronunciation to the very top of the README, for the sake of clarity. This is a minor thing, but it&#x27;s nice to know that there&#x27;s a &#x27;standard&#x27; pronunciation for uv.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether this will seem like a &quot;reasonable&quot; place to put this; I looked over the README and didn&#x27;t see any obviously more appropriate places to put it. Maybe this is unobtrusive enough that it&#x27;s fine where it is; maybe there should be a new section added somewhere; maybe somebody who has a better feel for the project goals will have a clever suggestion.</p>
<p>Closes #5309</p>

<p>@charliermarsh thoughts on where to sneak this in? :) space on the README is contentious.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m hoping to find room for this by doing some changes like <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7445">astral-sh/uv#7445</a></p>
<p>Sorry this has languished, I just don&#x27;t really know how to incorporate it in a pretty way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be cool if there was an official/canonical description or definition of what &quot;uv&quot; actually means or at least why it&#x27;s called that. Personally, I can live perfectly well with simply accepting it, but my experience over the last few weeks has shown me that this is one of the first questions customers ask about what &quot;uv&quot; actually stands for. And unless I&#x27;m blind, there&#x27;s nothing about this in the documentation. 😄</p>
