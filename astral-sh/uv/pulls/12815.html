            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am hesitant about two important blocks in a row. I also find a couple things confusing, like we haven&#x27;t really discussed &quot;development-only features&quot; and I don&#x27;t know what &quot;building your project in development mode&quot; means.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d probably just add a new paragraph above like...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since sources are specific to uv, they are also not propagated to package distributions, such as when using <code>uv build</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm right I did look at that test before and convinced myself it was something else but no that is what it&#x27;s doing... now I&#x27;m confused again.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To me, it feels coherent to add support for sources in build requirements in git dependencies, to make the build requirements work in the same way as other the other dependency categories already work with git dependencies. For comparison, cargo has a similar behavior (path vs. crates.io) which I find useful when having to patch dependencies or use a development version of a git commit, where I want to use all packages of the workspace from the git repo, instead of only using the single package that is referenced directly.</p>
