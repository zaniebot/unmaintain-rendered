# Move introduction to the "Getting started" section index

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-31 20:38_

We have an index for nearly every section. Should we have one for "Getting started"? Should it be this page?

Also solves https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5671 but I fixed that in #5676
