            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>(Related PR: #13438 - would be nice to have it merged as well since it touches on the same globwalker code)</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a few issues with <code>cache-key</code> globs, which this PR attempts to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>As of the current state, parent or absolute paths are not allowed, which is not obvious and is not documented. E.g., cache-key paths of the form <code>{file = &quot;../dep/**&quot;}</code> will be essentially ignored.</li>
<li>Absolute glob patterns also don&#x27;t work (funnily enough, there&#x27;s logic in <code>globwalk</code> itself that attempts to address it in <a href="https://github.com/Gilnaa/globwalk/blob/8973fa2bc560be54c91448131238fa50d56ee121/src/lib.rs#L415"><code>globwalk::glob_builder()</code></a>, which serves as inspiration to some parts of this PR).</li>
<li>The reason for parent paths being ignored is the way globwalker is currently being triggered in <code>uv-cache-info</code>: the base directory is being walked over completely and each entry is then being matched to one of the provided match patterns.</li>
<li>This may also end up being very inefficient if you have a huge root folder with thousands of files: if your match patterns are <code>a/b/*.rs</code> and <code>a/c/*.py</code> then instead of walking over the root directory, you can just walk over <code>a/b</code> and <code>a/c</code> and match the relevant patterns there.</li>
<li>Why supporting parent paths may be important to the point of being a blocker: in large codebases with python projects depending on other local non-python projects (e.g. rust crates), cache-keys can be very useful to track dependency on the source code of the latter (e.g. <code>cache-keys = [{ file = &quot;../../crates/some-dep/**&quot; }]</code>.</li>
<li>TLDR: parent/absolute cache-key globs don&#x27;t work, glob walk can be slow.</li>
</ul>
Solution
<ul>
<li>In this PR, user-provided glob patterns are first clustered (LCP-style) into pattern groups with longest common path prefix; each of these groups can then be walked over separately.</li>
<li>Pattern groups do not overlap, so we would never walk over the same directory twice (unless there&#x27;s symlinks pointing to same folders).</li>
<li>Paths are not canonicalized nor virtually normalized (which is impossible on Unix without FS access), so the method is symlink-safe (i.e. we don&#x27;t treat <code>a/b/..</code> as <code>a</code>) and should work fine with #13438.</li>
<li>Because of LCP logic, the minimal amount of directory space will be traversed to cover all patterns.</li>
<li>Absolute glob patterns will now work.</li>
<li>Parent-relative glob patterns will now work.</li>
<li>Glob walking will be more efficient in some cases.</li>
</ul>
Possible improvements
<ul>
<li>Efficiency can be further greatly improved if we limit max depth for globwalk. Currently, a simple &quot;.toml&quot; will deep-traverse the whole folder. Essentially, max depth can be always set to either N or infinity. If a pattern at a pivot node contains <code>**</code>, we collect all children nodes from the subtree into the same group and don&#x27;t limit max depth; otherwise, we set max depth to the length of the glob pattern. This wouldn&#x27;t change correctness though and can we done separately if needed.</li>
<li>If this is considered important enough, docs can be updated to indicate that parent and absolute globs are supported (and symlinks are resolved, if the relevant PR is algo merged in).</li>
</ul>
Test Plan
<ul>
<li>Glob splitting and clustering tests are included in the PR.</li>
<li>Relative and absolute glob cache-keys were tested in an actual codebase.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you document the contract for this function? In particular, I think it is necessary that this always return true if the given part returns something different if it&#x27;s interpreted as a glob versus if it was interpreted as a literal. But that it can also return true in cases even when the result is identical. That is, this routine allows false positives but not false negatives.</p>
<p>I think this is how it&#x27;s used too. That is, if you interpret a path component as a glob when it isn&#x27;t, then I think the worst thing that happens is that you traverse more of the directory tree? (i.e., You lose on perf but not correctness.)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m thinking about components like <code>foo{bar</code> or <code>foo[bar</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>@BurntSushi - thanks again for taking a look.</p>
<p>I think PR title/description might be a bit confusing - sorry about that and let me try to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main point (and the blocker we are currently facing in a production codebase) is being able to use relative/parent paths in cache-key globs, to define dependencies on local folders that are not descendants of the current python project.</li>
<li>The way globwalk is currently being used, it&#x27;s being called with project directory as the base, and simply traverses all of it. Of course, this will not catch any entries outside of CWD.</li>
<li>In order to cover patterns that may contain (or start with) <code>..</code>, we would have to:<ol>
<li>do multiple globwalks</li>
<li>figure out which base directories to use for those globwalks</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Point (ii) is the reason for <code>split_glob()</code> to exist (which is somewhat similar to <code>glob_builder()</code> in globwalk crate).</li>
<li>As for (i), if we simply kick off a globwalk for each glob entry, we will traverse the same folders multiple times. In order to not do that, we need some LCP logic - which is the reason for <code>cluster_globs()</code> to exist.</li>
<li>Finally, - and it just happens so, coincidentally and automatically, - we also happen to make the general use case more efficient in case your CWD has a deep tree and many entries but globs only point to particular parts of it. This is not the main intent of this PR, but more of a side bonus. There should be no perf regressions but sometimes there will be random perf wins.<ul>
<li>As mentioned above, if we really want to make it as efficient as possible, we can also set max depth based on glob patterns and not always walk through the entire directory tree with infinite depth (this will also change the way globs are grouped into clusters). If need be, it can be implemented as a separate PR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, we&#x27;re currently facing a pretty heavy blocker because of the lack of relative/parent glob support in a big production codebase, where we have lots of pyo3/maturin python packages that depend on both pure-rust crates and/or static content that may affect the builds. In order to track freshness, we&#x27;d like to use relative globs like</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
cache-keys = [
    { file = &quot;../../crates/foo/**&quot; },
    { file = &quot;../some/files/**.txt&quot; },
]
</code></pre>
<p>which uv currently doesn&#x27;t support because of the way globwalk is being used.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t find any glob-specific LCPs/tries... there&#x27;s some generic trie crates but that sounds like an overkill and they provide too much functionality for what&#x27;s needed here (also LCP grouping here is a bit special to globs - i.e. handling normal/non-normal edges differently).</p>
<p>Technically, it could be either</p>
<ul>
<li>slammed into the globwalk crate itself, although it wouldn&#x27;t be my preference since (a) it would change its core logic in an incompatible way and/or complicate its api and (b) it&#x27;s marked by author as &#x27;in perpetual maintenance, use other crates&#x27;.</li>
<li>made into a globwalk2 crate with default support for trie-based glob clustering, base dir inference, relative/absolute globs, max depth limiting, skipping irrelevant dirs, etc... although then it would have to copy/paste lots of code from walkdir/ignore to be self-sufficient.</li>
<li>a separate crate that takes (base, patterns) and returns vec&lt;(base, patterns)&gt;.</li>
<li>integrated into <code>ignore</code> crate?.. but it&#x27;s used by ripgrep, plus globs outside of base dirs don&#x27;t really match what it&#x27;s doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess one of the latter is doable and I can take on that but is quite a lot more work, and if you have a strong preference to not have this code inside uv, wonder if it makes sense to get this merged into uv first to unblock and pull it out next? Btw globwalk is currently only being used in uv-workspace and uv-cache-info.</p>

<p>Would that be acceptable here? (cc @konstin) If yes, I can open a separate PR replacing globwalk. Feature-wise, I think it covers all the bases except ignore files (e.g. .gitignore), is it needed as of right now? (in which case I can try to quickly add it as well)</p>
<p>@BurntSushi would really appreciate if you could take a brief look, because it basically joins two crates of your authorship, in a somewhat obscure way 🙂 <a href="https://github.com/aldanor/multiglob/pull/1">aldanor/multiglob#1</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin Let me try to clarify some of the points:</p>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Is the blocker specifically that the lack relative references requires manual rebuilds, or is there also a performance problem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Primarily the lack of relative references. In large codebases I think disallowing relative references in cache keys is a restriction way too harsh.</p>
<p>Performance-wise - it&#x27;s just if you allow relative/absolute references and you have multiple base folders, so if you have 10 glob patterns and if you don&#x27;t want to kick off 10 full glob walks, you might have to think of how to do it efficiently, see similar problems in e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Gilnaa/globwalk/issues/29">Gilnaa/globwalk#29</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Gilnaa/globwalk/pull/31">Gilnaa/globwalk#31</a>, etc). These problems are addressed in uv-globfilter but will pop back up if you allow multiple bases / rel paths.</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Specifically, have you seen the uv-globfilter crate? It implements optimizations very similar to the ones you describe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yea, I&#x27;ve seen it; it&#x27;s somewhat close but would not work out of the box with relative paths because again, essentially there will be many overlapping bases.</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>For Rust projects specifically, have you seen https://github.com/PyO3/maturin-import-hook?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yea I&#x27;m aware of that, but doesn&#x27;t quite suit our use case (&gt; 100 crates, many dozen pyo3 projects, cross compilation required, not for &#x27;local development&#x27;). We are looking for a clean way for uv to figure when particular packages need to get rebuilt if their dependencies changes (whether rust dependencies of pyo3 crates like <code>../dep-1/**</code> or static files like protobuf schemas).</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>as we&#x27;re using both glob and globset</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m wondering if we can have less of that complexity in uv itself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial reason I spent considerable amount of time pulling it into a separate crate (multiglob) was you suggesting uv shouldn&#x27;t have this complexity internally :) Given that there&#x27;s no working options supporting relpaths neither in uv nor in crates.io, I went with a new standalone crate which should now be pretty well tested; it&#x27;s based on walkdir+globset, somewhat similar to uv-globfilter (but can be further aligned to uv-globfilter behaviour if need be, if there&#x27;s any particular points).</p>
</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>this is already non-ideal as we&#x27;re using both glob and globset, but we shouldn&#x27;t add yet another implementation, rather reduce the differences</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion here is to remove one dependency (globwalk) and replace it with another (multiglob) which is also based on walkdir+globset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like this <code>Trie</code> implementation makes pretty heavy use of recursion. And the call depth is in turn proportional to the length of data controlled by end users. That&#x27;s generally something I think we should try to avoid. Although, in this case, paths are likely limited in length in most cases to a point where the call depth isn&#x27;t going to get deep enough to overflow the stack. But I&#x27;m a little uneasy about relying on such things since that&#x27;s more of a platform restriction as opposed to something we check and enforce ourselves.</p>

<p>(fixed in that <a href="https://github.com/aldanor/multiglob/pull/1">PR</a> because there&#x27;s some edge cases fixed there and lots of tests, including multi-platform ones)</p>
<p>// Apologies for all the confusion, I decided to pull it out into a standalone crate after @konstin asked if we can have less complexity in uv itself; but this also allowed to thoroughly go through all the multi-platform edge cases and write tons of tests. If uv requires this crate under its control I&#x27;m ok with passing ownership or whatever else you guys want (although it may be pretty useful for general public).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Personally, I&#x27;d rather the small targeted change you have in this PR. Maintaining a whole other crate for this is a lot to ask.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not keen on depending on a crate made <em>just</em> so that the code doesn&#x27;t live in uv proper. Its long term maintenance story isn&#x27;t clear to me. I can&#x27;t speak for @konstin, but &quot;off the shelf components&quot; to me means <em>existing</em> components. Sorry about the confusion here.</p>

<p>@BurntSushi I think it would be pretty close to being identical, except in multiglob there&#x27;s no recursion (that you mentioned above in a comment), a few parts are cleaned up and lots more tests for the whole thing. But functionally, from uv&#x27;s standpoint, there&#x27;s not going to be much of a difference I guess. There may appear to be lots of code in multiglob PR because it has to replicate all the outer walkdir API plus there&#x27;s tests boilerplate.</p>
<p>If this PR is looking more or less ok, my personal suggestion would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>try to get this pr over the line (unless there&#x27;s any other feedback?), it&#x27;s more self-contained</li>
<li>I should probably just publish multiglob separately, may be useful to other people in the ecosystem? (as an alternative to globwalk)</li>
<li>if you guys ever feel like switching off from globwalk that would be always doable</li>
</ul>
