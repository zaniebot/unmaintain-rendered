# Refactor code blogs in README for copy/pasting & uniformity

---

_@ryanjhermes_

Allows readers to copy/paste commands from the README.md file by:
1. Changing code blocks to from "console" to "bash".
2. Commenting out the outputs from the code block.

This prevents excess "command not found" errors and enables quicker configuration.

We've discussed similar things before, e.g., https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9685 and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8853

We are optimizing for space here and these are demos, not intended to be copied. I don't think we want to change their style.
