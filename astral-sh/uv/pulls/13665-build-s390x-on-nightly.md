---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2025-05-26 20:02_

Build s390x on nightly due to llvm performance regressions see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/141287. To be undone when the llvm fixes land on stable.

This should fix the timeouts in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/15259826631/job/42915439608?pr=13576
