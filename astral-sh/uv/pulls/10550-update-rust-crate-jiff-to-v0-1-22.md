### Release Notes

<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.1.22`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0122-2025-01-12)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.21...0.1.22)

\===================
This release adds support for Android. This support means that Jiff will
automatically read its special concatenated time zone database, and will
read the `persist.sys.timezone` property to determine the system's current
time zone.

See \[PLATFORM] for more specific information about Android support.

-   [#&#8203;140](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/140):
    Add support for the Android platform.
