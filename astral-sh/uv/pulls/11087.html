            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was added in 93d606aba20c39149390a9191879e82194ea4e91 when <code>Url::set_password</code> (and username) were unwrapped but now we just ignore those errors (those functions require the URL to have a host).</p>
<p>Removed this to see if it changed any tests and figured I'd commit it, @charliermarsh is poking at it so maybe he's changing behavior that relies on removing this to allow canonicalization of <code>file://</code> URLs (which don't have a host).</p>
