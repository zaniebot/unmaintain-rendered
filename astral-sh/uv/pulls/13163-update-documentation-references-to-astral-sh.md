Mh while this still works and might be a valid usecase in an exotic usecase (make sure ONLY the lock file invalidates the cache) I think it would be better if we remove examples involving `cache-dependency-glob`.

The new default should be sufficient for most users and I don't think examples should contain edge cases most users will never need to think about.

For those edge cases the README in `setup-uv` still contains the information
