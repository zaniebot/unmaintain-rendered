### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --workspace
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for `schemars`.
    ... required by package `uv-dev v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv-dev)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.9.0` are: 0.9.0

the package `uv-dev` depends on `schemars`, with features: `url` but `schemars` does not have these features.


failed to select a version for `schemars` which could resolve this conflict

```
