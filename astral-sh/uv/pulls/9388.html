<p>Could we set up a packse like the example given in the issue (see https://github.com/PhilipVinc/uvtest/tree/dab673b4ad5c6f1335c491baf49ad4965562e876)?</p>
<p>Also, I generally am pretty clueless about uv's testing story (I know it's snapshot based, but that's about it) but would be eager to learn by writing some tests here</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand the issue here though.</p>

<p>That could be helpful. I take it that'd be easier than getting packse to serve git repos? One maybe relevant question here is whether we can use <code>git+</code> with file-scheme urls?</p>

<p>Yeah this would probably be a pain.</p>

<p>I don't quite follow, perhaps you should tell me what a test case would look like given a <code>uv</code> binary and I can help construct it? Perhaps as an answer to your question, a test could just clone a repository to a temporary directory then pass that path to uv?</p>

<p>For sure, I just wasn't at my computer earlier. I just confirmed that using <code>git+</code> with <code>file://</code> urls works, though unfortunately testing this with @PhilpVinc's test repository (see linked issue) had the conflicting URL issue reoccur 😞</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Apologies for not getting to this, I had to get ready for a vacation. I’m out of the country without my personal computer right now so I think the chances I can do this today are pretty low.</p>
