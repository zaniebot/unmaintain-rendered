            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>uv run --directory <path> means that one doesn't have to change to a
project's directory to run programs from it. It makes it possible to use
projects as if they are tool installations.</p>
<p>To support this, first the code reading .python-version was updated so that
it can read such markers outside the current directory. Note the minor
change this causes (if I'm right), described in the commit.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>One test has been added.</p>
<h2>--directory</h2>
<p>Not sure what the name of the argument should be, but it's following uv
sync's directory for now.</p>
<p>Other alternatives could be &quot;--project&quot;. Uv run and uv tool run should
probably find common agreement on this (relevant for project-locked tools).</p>
<p>I've implemented this same change in Rye, some time ago, and then we went
with --pyproject <code>&lt;</code>path to pyproject.toml file<code>&gt;</code>. I think using
pyproject.toml file path and not directory was probably a mistake, an
overgeneralization one doesn't need.</p>
