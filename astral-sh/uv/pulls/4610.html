            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>A basic implementation for #4574.</p>
<p>This introduces <code>private-members</code> to <code>[tool.uv.workspace]</code>.
Private members are not included in the workspace <code>uv.lock</code> and <code>.venv</code>, but have their own instead.</p>
<p>The code could use some polish, and we&#x27;d need to make sure pip commands and workspace commands work consistently.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think it&#x27;s good enough to review.</p>
<p>The basic implementation is in <a href="https://github.com/idlsoft/uv/blob/private_locks/crates/uv-workspace/src/workspace.rs">workspace.rs</a>.
There is a new <code>private_lock</code> field in <code>WorkspaceMember</code>.
The following functions moved from <code>Workspace</code> to <code>VirtualProject</code> and depend on <code>private_lock</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn venv(&amp;self) -&gt; PathBuf
pub fn lockfile(&amp;self) -&gt; PathBuf
pub fn members_as_requirements(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;Requirement&gt;
pub fn constraints(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;Requirement&gt;
pub fn overrides(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;Requirement&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The rest is some refactoring to make the calls possible.
These include changing the <code>Workspace</code> argument to <code>VirtualProject</code> for the following functions in <a href="https://github.com/idlsoft/uv/blob/private_locks/crates/uv/src/commands/project/mod.rs">mod.rs</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>find_environment</code></li>
<li><code>FoundInterpreter::discover</code></li>
<li><code>get_or_init_environment</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I split it in a few commits to make following the changes easier.</p>
Test Plan
<p>A sample workspace and unittest.</p>

<p>In the meantime... the intent is that you should be able to create a project outside of a workspace, and then use a path dependency to point to a member of a workspace that&#x27;s it <em>not</em> part of, and it should &quot;just work&quot; -- which IIUC should achieve the same thing here? Since that separate project would get its own lock, venv, etc. Though not certain if we finished implementing that yet.</p>

<p>I just confirmed that this <em>does</em> work by creating <code>foo/pyproject.toml</code> in the uv root with:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;foo&quot;
version = &quot;0.0.0&quot;
dependencies = [
  &quot;bird-feeder&quot;,
]
[tool.uv.sources]
&quot;bird-feeder&quot; = { path = &quot;../scripts/workspaces/albatross-root-workspace/packages/bird-feeder&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Which does correctly include the workspace dependencies.</p>

<p>It does work. I actually checked a few days ago, and closed two other PRs, because<code>{path=... editable=true}</code> solved the use-case perfectly.
And while you&#x27;re right, path dependencies is a solution, I would still like to keep this one for future consideration.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s a valid use-case, and I like that <code>members</code> and <code>projects</code> are defined next to each other without a clear preference which one is the right approach, the choice being left to the developer.</p>
<p>Workspaces, among other things, are a good way to share metadata, like default constraints, default versions etc. It would be nice if projects, even they&#x27;re independent from each other, could take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Will it still run CI if we mark it as draft?
Also I can stop resolving conflicts for a while, it won&#x27;t run builds then.</p>

<p>@charliermarsh  any chance to giving this another look?</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been resolving conflicts periodically in another branch, so can bring the PR up to date easily.</p>
<p>A couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>about the user-facing naming conventions: <code>projects</code> was first neutral term that came to mind, <code>private_members</code> may be more consistent/easier to explain?</li>
<li>the 1st commit can be merged with no side-effects in case you&#x27;d like to postpone the actual implementation till later</li>
</ul>

<p>@zanieb Made a minor change, <code>projects</code> has been renamed to <code>private-members</code>, I think it makes sense to use existing terms.</p>
<p>Also the implementation will support intersecting globs for <code>members</code> and <code>private-members</code>. Private takes precedence.</p>
