            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just a small note to say that dependencies between workspace members are editable as shown in #9362</p>
<p>(This might be obvious since if dependencies between workspaces members are not editable then every time a workspace member is update it has to be manually reinstalled but since it's in the concepts documentation and since I see a lot of issues about workspaces, that little note might help newcomers a little bit)</p>
