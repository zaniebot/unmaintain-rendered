# docs(settings): bunch of fixes and improvements

---

_Pull request opened by @mkniewallner on 2024-07-18 03:55_

## Summary

Spotted some issues in the settings documentation, and room for small improvements by linking to PEPs/RFCs.

Also updating contribution documentation to mention that it's necessary to enable the virtual environment before running `mkdocs serve`.

## Test Plan

Running documentation locally.

In markdown, it doesn't matter which number you use for ordered lists, as using "1" for multiple consecutive items will still generate a numerically ordered list: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#ordered-lists
