# Clippy pedantic

---

_Pull request opened by @danieleades on 2024-02-25 07:58_

Address a few pedantic lints

lints are separated into separate commits so they can be reviewed individually.

I've not added enforcement for any of these lints, but that could be added if desirable.

failed on the windows build - "thread 'main' has overflowed its stack". Doesn't *sound* like something introduced by the minor changes in this PR...
