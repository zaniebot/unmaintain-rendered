            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our current handling of <code>--find-links</code> merges the entries in each index. As a result, we can end up with <code>AnnotatedDist</code> entries that reference distributions across indexes.</p>
<p>I'd like to change <code>--find-links</code> such that each <code>--find-links</code> entry is just treated as its own index (so, e.g., if <code>requests</code> exists in the first <code>--find-links</code> entry, we don't even check the registry by default), which would <em>also</em> fix this problem automatically. But that's a behavior change... So for now, in the lockfile, we filter distributions that don't match the source index URL.</p>
<p>There are two cases to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a source distribution. Then, for the ID to reference the <code>--find-links</code> registry, the source distribution <em>must</em> have come from the <code>--find-links</code> entry, so it's fine to discard any wheels from the &quot;wrong&quot; registry without breaking any compatibility guarantees.</li>
<li>There's no source distribution. Then the best wheel must come from the <code>--find-links</code> registry. We might lose some platform coverage by discarding the other wheels, but it shouldn't break any of the &quot;guarantees&quot;, since we have at least one wheel that fits in the version range.</li>
</ul>
