<p>NOTE: The PRs that were merged into this feature branch have all been independently reviewed. But it's also useful to see all of the changes in their final form. I've added comments to significant changes throughout the PR to aid discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This PR introduces transparent Python version upgrades to uv, allowing for a smoother experience when upgrading to new patch versions. Previously, upgrading Python patch versions required manual updates to each virtual environment. Now, virtual environments can transparently upgrade to newer patch versions.</p>
<p>Due to significant changes in how uv installs and executes managed Python executables, this functionality is initially available behind a <code>--preview</code> flag. Once an installation has been made upgradeable through <code>--preview</code>, subsequent operations (like <code>uv venv -p 3.10</code> or patch upgrades) will work without requiring the flag again. This is accomplished by checking for the existence of a minor version symlink directory (or junction on Windows).</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>New <code>uv python upgrade</code> command to upgrade installed Python versions to the latest available patch release:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code># Upgrade specific minor version 
uv python upgrade 3.12 --preview
# Upgrade all installed minor versions
uv python upgrade --preview
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Transparent upgrades also occur when installing newer patch versions:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>uv python install 3.10.8 --preview
# Automatically upgrades existing 3.10 environments
uv python install 3.10.18
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Support for transparently upgradeable Python <code>bin</code> installations via <code>--preview</code> flag</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>uv python install 3.13 --preview
# Automatically upgrades the `bin` installation if there is a newer patch version available
uv python upgrade 3.13 --preview
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Virtual environments can still be tied to a patch version if desired (ignoring patch upgrades):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>uv venv -p 3.10.8
</code></pre>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Transparent upgrades are implemented using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor version symlink directories (Unix) or junctions (Windows)</li>
<li>On Windows, trampolines simulate paths with junctions</li>
<li>Symlink directory naming follows Python build standalone format: e.g., <code>cpython-3.10-macos-aarch64-none</code></li>
<li>Upgrades are scoped to the minor version key (as represented in the naming format: implementation-minor version+variant-os-arch-libc)</li>
<li>If the context does not provide a patch version request and the interpreter is from a managed CPython installation, the <code>Interpreter</code> used by <code>uv python run</code> will use the full symlink directory executable path when available, enabling transparently upgradeable environments created with the <code>venv</code> module (<code>uv run python -m venv</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>New types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PythonMinorVersionLink</code>: in a sense, the core type for this PR, this is a representation of a minor version symlink directory (or junction on Windows) that points to the highest installed managed CPython patch version for a minor version key.</li>
<li><code>PythonInstallationMinorVersionKey</code>: provides a view into a <code>PythonInstallationKey</code> that excludes the patch and prerelease. This is used for grouping installations by minor version key  (e.g., to find the highest available patch installation for that minor version key) and for minor version directory naming.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supports virtual environments created with:<ul>
<li><code>uv venv</code></li>
<li><code>uv run python -m venv</code> (using managed Python that was installed or upgraded with <code>--preview</code>)</li>
<li>Virtual environments created within these environments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Existing virtual environments from before these changes continue to work but aren't transparently upgradeable without being recreated</li>
<li>Supports both standard Python (<code>python3.10</code>) and freethreaded Python (<code>python3.10t</code>)</li>
<li>Support for transparently upgrades  is currently only available for managed CPython installations</li>
</ul>
<p>Closes #7287
Closes #7325
Closes #7892
Closes #9031
Closes #12977</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In a sense, the core of the implementation. We use this to derive a symlink directory name from a full Python installation path, to create such a directory (or junction on Windows), and to check for the existence of such a directory. This is also where the preview gating happens (EDIT: if preview is disabled and the symlink doesn't exist already, the constructor will return <code>None</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Will this also be available for the <code>tool</code> subcommand that internally relies on virtualenvs. Specifically, will it be possible to say <code>uv tool update -p &lt;something&gt;</code>, or <code>uv tool update -p &lt;something&gt; --all</code>?</p>
<p>Even more interesting: in case you upgrade a managed python minor version (e.g <code>uv python install 3.15.3</code> and then <code>uv python uninstall 3.15.2</code>) will it then be possible to have <code>uv tool update --all</code> update all the virtualenvs using the not-anymore-existing minor python version to the newer one?</p>
