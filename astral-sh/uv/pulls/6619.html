            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a minor documentation update to a recently added section &quot;Package priority&quot; in the pip compatibility guide. The aim of this PR is clear up two things which I think the current paragraph implies but I don&#x27;t think are (always) true:</p>
<ol>
<li>That pip doesn&#x27;t use provided order to prioritize resolution</li>
<li>That uv relies solely on provided order to prioritize resolution</li>
</ol>
<p>What is true, at least for now, is pip has more heuristics than uv to prioritize during resolution, and so I&#x27;ve tried to rework this to make it clear why changing the order might help uv come to a different resolution whereas for pip it might not make a difference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could we perhaps clarify that uv does use <em>some</em> other prioritization? E.g., direct URLs and exactly-pinned versions are solved first? (Same is true of pip, pip just has a few more.)</p>

<p>I thought I was clarifying that, I&#x27;ve updated the language to be more assertive.</p>
