            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Previously, we were always asking Cargo to rebuild <code>uv-cli</code> if
<code>.git/HEAD</code> had changed. But in a worktree, <code>.git</code> is a file, not a
directory. And the file contains the path to git's internal worktree
state, which also has its own <code>HEAD</code> file. So in the case of a worktree,
we read the file and tell Cargo to watch the worktree-specific <code>HEAD</code>
file instead of <code>.git/head</code>.</p>
<p>The main thing this fixes is that, previously, in a worktree, <code>cargo build</code> would <em>always</em> re-compile <code>uv</code> even if nothing changed.</p>
<p>This doesn't impact or fix anything in &quot;typical&quot; clones of uv though.
Only in worktrees.</p>
<p>Closes #6196, Closes #6197</p>
