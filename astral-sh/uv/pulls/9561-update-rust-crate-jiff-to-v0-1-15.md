### Release Notes

<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.1.15`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0115-2024-11-30)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.14...0.1.15)

\===================
This release fixes a bug where Jiff would sometimes fail to parse TZif files
(found, typically, in `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on Unix systems). This occurred
when the TZif file contained a time zone transition outside the range of Jiff's
`Timestamp` type (which is `-9999-01-01` to `9999-12-31`). The bug fix works by
clamping the out-of-range transitions to Jiff's supported range.

This bug only seems to occur in some environments where their TZif files
contain more extreme values than what is typically found.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;163](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/163):
    Fix a bug where Jiff would fail to parse some TZif files.
