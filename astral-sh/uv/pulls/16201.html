<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This pr started with me trying to replace <code>fs</code> with <code>fs_err</code> in a couple places (#14985). As @konstin pointed out, <code>fs</code> was actually just an alias for <code>fs_err</code>. This pr removes that alias so the code is easier to reason about when only looking at the isolated pieces of code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's some <code>use fs_err as fs;</code> renames in some of those files. We should probably use <code>fs_err::</code> directly instead of renaming, but it's relevant take those imports into account</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can not believe I missed that one 🤦, I should have been a little more thorough with this one.</p>
<p>I can pivot this pr to clean that up when I get back to my computer if you think that is a better approach. I found this stuff by running <code>rg &quot;:: remove_dir_all&quot;</code> on the code base and found these which seemed odd (see #14985).</p>
