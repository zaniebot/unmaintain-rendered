<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Adds Pixi as one of the tool benchmarked against uv.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pixi can generate multi-platform lock files. here, lock-files are limited to the platform the benchmark is executed on</li>
<li>Pixi can install packages from conda and/or pypi. here, packages are installed from pypi</li>
</ul>
<p>Still in draft as generating lock-files currently fails due to https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/issues/817</p>
