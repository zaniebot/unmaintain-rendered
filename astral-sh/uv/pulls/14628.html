            <div class="timeline-body"><p>+1 on my side.
I would change the default directory for the venv cache to be <code>UV_CACHE_DIR/venvs-v0/</code> because <code>ÙV_CACHE_DIR</code> already falls back to <code>XDG_CACHE_DIR</code>?</p>
<p>Setting the venv cache in the same filesystem of  the UV cache is what you want to do anyway to get decent performance.</p>
<p>I will also mention that the calculation of the path within the cache is a good idea in my opinion, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using for the past year or so.</p>

<p>Will do.  The XDG_CACHE_DIR in the spec was really a placeholder b/c I&#x27;m not sure what the uv internals look like.  I&#x27;m sure there is some kind of &quot;global&quot; or context object that takes all env vars and settings into account and provides a <code>cache_dir</code> variable that everything else then uses.  I really intend to reference that.  I&#x27;ll update the spec to clarify.</p>

<p>I understand this to mean that you affirm the &quot;Human‑readable slug + short hash&quot; approach.  Please correct my understanding if needed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>fwiw, my vote for a location would be to mirror the directory structure relative to home e.g.</p>
<p><code>~/foo/bar/baz/</code> -&gt; <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv/venvs/foo/bar/baz/$venvName</code> where $venvName defaults to <code>.venv-$pythonVersion</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>i think mirroring the path makes a lot of other things easier, like cleanup</li>
<li>having the final component be based on python version makes cross-version actions much faster by not clobbering the same venv for everything <code>uv run -p 3.10 pytest; uv run -p 3.11 pytest</code></li>

<p>(This is quite common in HPC where we have 3 file systems, one for HOME where we store few things, one WORK where we store projects but can’t store environments, and SCRATCH where we store environments…)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(i&#x27;m amending my above XDG_CACHE_DIR in light of the prior comment about UV_CACHE_DIR).</p>
<p>i&#x27;m not sure whether i fully grasp what this system looks like/expects, but i dont think different filesystems are inherently a problem.</p>
<p>You&#x27;d set e.g. <code>UV_CACHE_DIR=/scratch</code> i assume. Then i would expect the calculated path to be based off the least common ancestor of $HOME and the current project path. So in &quot;normal&quot; cases, <code>/home/foo</code> and <code>/home/foo/projects/bar</code> -&gt; <code>/scratch/venvs/projects/bar</code>. And in less normal cases (which maybe seems like what you&#x27;re suggesting) <code>/home/foo</code> and <code>/work/projects/bar</code> you instead get <code>/scratch/venvs/$root/work/projects/bar</code> (or whatever alternative to $root to disambiguate relative vs absolute paths) because there is no common root. Or ignore relativity to $HOME at all.</p>
<p>whether or not I&#x27;m correctly addressing your concerns, i think it would have the same issues (or lackthereof) for the other suggested option of basing it on a hashed version of the full path.</p>
<p>Much of the details of my long middle paragraph is not critically important, and there&#x27;s much to bikeshed there. The point is mostly to avoid losing the path information into a hash by way of actually using the known-unique original paths. And to make it intuitive to locally navigate to a venv without <strong>needing</strong> to run a <code>uv</code> command to calculate it for you (<strong>that</strong> is how <code>poetry</code> works and i find it quite annoying)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>or what about having something in pyproject.toml that specifies this behavior?  another option is in the venv folder having a special uv file that has a symlink back to the base folder it corresponds to, this should solve most problems as you can ensure the folder name is unique via the hashing, and have the required back references either in a symlink, or some custom meta file in the venv folder.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure always relative to home folder is a good idea, in our environment we often put the related pyproject.toml in a folder like /usr/fbn/foo/bar.  Another option is relative to the git root.  There are so many variants that make sense for different workflows it seems like this should be configurable and opt-in.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think we want to try to replicate the entire path into this centralized location, it sounds feasible to run into path length limits (which have a been a frequent problem on Windows) and it doesn&#x27;t match our typical patterns for storing paths.</p>
<p>It does seem annoying to need to use uv to discover an environment path, but wouldn&#x27;t something like using the project name as a prefix obviate that problem for most use-cases?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb for reference I use git worktree to have multiple versions of our git repo, comparatively pipenv&#x27;s default behavior is pretty annoying to me as I don&#x27;t know which worktree it belongs to.  In my ideal world there would be a setting in pyproject.toml saying something like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
venv_root_style = &quot;relative_to&quot;
venv_relative_root_path = &quot;/Users/user/dev&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>or something to that effect.  I mean or that could be like an opt-in suffix such that the root folder name is always the hash as discussed and that relative is appended to it just for reference, for when you&#x27;re trying to select the correct venv like in the pycharm interpreter selector.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>perhaps getting too complicated, but the config <em>could</em> allow a <code>venv_path_format =</code> option that&#x27;s essentially a format string allowing path/hash/python-version/whatever context to make it configurable. Then you can choose whatever default, and I can set <code>{project}-{hash}-{python_version}</code> or <code>{relative_path}/{project]/{python_version}</code> (or however it&#x27;d work)</p>
<p>not sure if the complexity is worth the squeeze, but it seems like it sidesteps displeasing anyone&#x27;s particular workflow, while letting you choose whatever default behavior you think is most foolproof/generally applicable.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned above, regardless of specific path impl, including the python version in the path (or at least ensuring the same project operating with different python versions doesn&#x27;t clobber the venvs) is main real concerning factor for at least myself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>honestly seems pretty elegant because it has no effect on anyone currently manually setting that value to a static value and handling any dynamism in their own tooling.</p>
<p>plus you can still (again at some point) if you want, ship a dedicated setting that&#x27;s either just this, or a <code>managed_venvs = true</code> or whatever with whatever semantic; but that&#x27;s still just a manipulation of the default <code>UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT</code>, if unspecified.</p>
<p>i was initially imagining the complexity of this would be getting python-style templating, but i suppose the more basic string replacement will serve here probably just as well since the values are still all owned by you.</p>

Hi Randy,</p>
<p>Regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14628</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry, but I&#x27;m not happy with your proposal, as it lacks clarity and I fail to see how it would help the current implementation. I&#x27;m also worried about the <code>cache</code> idea. For me anything that is in a <em>cache</em> can be discarded at any time without serious consequences, as it can be easily rebuilt. However, this is not the case for the venv &quot;repo&quot; directories we are talking about and discussing in #1495. Very often we have certain dependencies for HW related projects (like Nvidia, Nordic Semi, etc) that requires different package versions, and where nobody should be able to do a generic <em>&quot;clear cache&quot;</em> to wipe out all your venv&#x27;s. I&#x27;m sure (or at least I hope) that I have the wrong understanding of this.</p>
<p>Also, the  <code>&quot;Human‑readable slug + short hash&quot;</code> is just not a productivity improvement. I don&#x27;t want to have to look up and carefully type in any kind of hash in order to <em>activate, copy, move</em> or <em>duplicate</em> any venv. I&#x27;m certainly missing to see the use case for this?</p>
<p><strong>So can you please update us on what exactly is the new proposal and what functionality it provides that simplifies life to the user, via UX?</strong></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@eabase I can appreciate that you don&#x27;t prefer this proposal.  However, I did process your previous comments on this issue and I believe they are all addressed in the &quot;Out of Scope / Rejections&quot; section.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t plan on doing any additional work on this proposal until someone from Astral gives some definitive feedback.  While I think this PR/idea had some momentum originally, the momentum/interest has seemed to die.  And I don&#x27;t want to put more time into it unless there is the possibility of an implementation somewhere in the near-term.   If we get that feedback, and it aligns with your concerns/preferences, I&#x27;m happy to take another stab at revising the proposal.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>In the design doc, the final section of the document is &quot;Out of Scope / Rejections.&quot;  That section lists items that I considered but decided were out of scope or am rejecting for this proposal.  For example, I don&#x27;t think we should be concerned with the accidental deletion of virtualenvs in the cache and I give my reasoning in that section.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>They symlink the whole <code>node_modules</code> directory - and this also works on windows.
No clue HOW they do it exactly - but i think it&#x27;d allow for a global cache of installed modules - greatly reducing duplicate files on the system.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>2 bad ideas baked into 1.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using any symlinks in windows in general, is very rarely needed and if you use junctions, you can easily break your whole system. Very few people knows how to use those right, and any noob trying to delete one, can brick their OS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Having the venv &quot;point back to the project directory&quot;, defeats more solutions than it solves. Why would you need this? How, then, would you use multiple project directories sharing a venv?</p>

<p>accidental deletion of a venv is inconsequential since it will be recreated by any uv command that needs it.</p>

<p><strong>This is simply not true!</strong></p>
<p>If you got a bunch of LLM or Nvidia crap in your venv, you&#x27;re talking about ~ several GB of venv. Maybe even something you built/tweaked on your own for dev or private purposes. So, no the &quot;uv command&quot; is not gonna rebuild any of that, and at worst you may suffer substantial code/data loss.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Shared venvs are not the same as centralized venvs.  They are separate and distinct use cases.</p>
<p>Currently, uv always stores a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/">project&#x27;s</a> virtual env in the project&#x27;s root folder as <code>.venv</code>.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t like having those <code>.venv</code>s scattered all over my projects and want them in a central location.  For me, it&#x27;s just file/directory hygiene.  But for others working on other platforms, it might be because their project folders are on network shares and they need the venvs on local disks for performance reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Marking these conversations as resolved while conversation is still ongoing is an absolutely inpolite approach. @rsyring You should unresolve them until the discussion is <strong>actually</strong> resolved for <em>both parties</em>. Otherwise it&#x27;s a &quot;thanks for the feedback, but i&#x27;d rather ignore it&quot; - which i don&#x27;t think is what you&#x27;re trying to imply.</li>
<li>for the topic at hand (@eabase ):<ul>
<li>with the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#link-mode">symlinking</a> <code>uv</code> does - your &quot;actual&quot; files live in some random cache file (i don&#x27;t think a central location would necessarily change this). so deletion of the venv won&#x27;t delete several GB of data - it&#x27;ll just remove the symlink of it. You&#x27;ll hence not lose the downloaded data - just the venv - which i guess a new &quot;uv venv&quot; and &quot;uv pip install &quot; can now pretty easily bring back.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve not looked into how uv handles the shared cache in Windows.  If the symlink equivalent works there, then having a symlink back to the project directory is feasible.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d still argue a text file with the path as it&#x27;s content is simpler and has less edge cases and therefore is the more appropriate solution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>to be quite honest - i&#x27;m against this proposal.
It&#x27;s designed for your specific need, with all comments that don&#x27;t fit your exact idea as &quot;marked as out of scope&quot;.
While i think it&#x27;s good that other things have been considered and marked as out of scope - i think <em>what</em> is out of scope should be up for discussion.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll take a step back from this discussion - as it&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re not open for this (the topic of marking points as resolved immediately makes this VERY clear).
that&#x27;s unfortunately then an &quot;enhancement&quot; that won&#x27;t really enhance UV - not in a way that would suit more than a handful of people.</p>

<p>I agree that would be preferable.</p>
<p>However, in this iteration, I specifically didn&#x27;t address this because I wanted to avoid specifications that would lead to additional debate or work and, perhaps, delay the initial implementation.</p>
<p>IMO, there are two functions that uv could provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>clean: completely delete all centralized venvs</li>
<li>prune: delete any centralized venv where the venv&#x27;s project directory (which is tracked in <code>$venv_dir/uv-project-path.txt</code>) no longer exists</li>
</ul>
<p>Where in the CLI those functions live is what I thought could lead to delay.  Options I&#x27;ve considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uv venv --cache-clean</code></li>
<li><code>uv venv --cache-prune</code></li>
<li><code>uv cache clean --venvs/--no-venvs</code></li>
<li><code>uv cache prune --venvs/--no-venvs</code></li>
<li><code>uv cache venvs clean</code></li>
<li><code>uv cache venvs prune</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With my preference being the last two.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure i agree on your &quot;delay implementation&quot; stance - the current proposal to overload an existing command (without optionality, from the proposal) can have the adverse effect and (at least in my opinion / view) can/could lead to more discussions.</p>
<p>I think these options could be listed as &quot;alternatives&quot; at least - giving astral folks the option to pick the one they prefer&quot;?
Currently it&#x27;s &quot;we&#x27;ll use <code>uv cache clean</code>.&quot; - if that doesn&#x27;t fit their plans / UX view - there&#x27;s no considered alternatives listed (outside of the above comment).</p>
