# Add new `PythonRequest::Any` and `VersionRequest::Any` variants

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-09-18 20:08_

Follow-up to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7514 and #7526 adding the `Any` variants again with slightly different semantics (i.e., they allow pre-releases)

We'll be able to use this in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7508 to avoid querying a bunch of alternative interpreters unnecessarily in the non-list case.
