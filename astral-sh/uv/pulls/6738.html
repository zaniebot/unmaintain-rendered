            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Reading about this in https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/176235/fork-and-how-signals-are-delivered-to-processes</p>
<p>Seems like both the child and parent should receive the signal already? That's why above we say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>// Ignore signals in the parent process, deferring them to the child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And just eat all the SIGINT we receive in the parent process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that when the CLI receives a signal which is customarily used to ask processes to gracefully terminate, the CLI should oblige; but it's been pointed out that if the CLI were to forward signals to its children (which would be the easiest solution), then plugins would receive two signals in cases where the signal is sent to the entire process group (such as when pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal) - which would break the existing and, as I understand it, desirable behaviour of plugins (shutdown gracefully on first signal, shutdown fast on second).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @charliermarsh , I have tested this PR the same way as I stated in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6724 and sadly it doesn't seem to actually fix the issue 😬
The service still takes 10 seconds to stop, for some reason.</p>
<p>Maybe it's not about sigterm after all? I can't really say. All I know is that the service doesn't stop when you Ctrl+C the service started with docker compose</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh</p>
<p>I wonder if it wouldn't be better to replace the current process completely (a la <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html"><code>exec</code></a>).  That would remove the need of meddling the signals.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm not sure the about the overall design of <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<p>I see that <code>rye</code> used this exec approach (not using <code>tokio</code>, though):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">/// Spawns a command exec style.
pub fn exec_spawn(cmd: &amp;mut Command) -&gt; Result&lt;Infallible, Error&gt; {
    // this is technically only necessary on windows
    crate::disable_ctrlc_handler();

    #[cfg(unix)]
    {
        use std::os::unix::process::CommandExt;
        let err = cmd.exec();
        Err(err.into())
    }
    #[cfg(windows)]
    {
        cmd.stdin(Stdio::inherit());
        let status = cmd.status()?;
        std::process::exit(status.code().unwrap())
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>What would be the pros/cons of not using Tokio's <code>Command</code> and use the stdlib?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was pointed here from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7343">another issue</a> with something that might be related. So just to leave it here, did you consider how a Uvicorn (or other webservers) deployed application might be used with uv? In the context of signal control of the server that is. <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/deployment/#built-in">Sending SIGHUP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU to your container to scale Uvicorn</a> to the container from it's orchestration layer like Docker Swarm has meaning as only the PID 1 process in the container will receive the signal, in the case of <code>uv run</code> uv is running as PID 1 and would need to propagate at least as few signals to it's subprocess webserver for it to for example gracefully shut down.</p>
<p>Here's some context: https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/best-practices-for-propagating-signals-on-docker</p>
<p>Anyway I don't think it's something I can help with but wanted to point it out - maybe it's a separate issue, don't know how you guys would rather track that but I think it's an important thing to consider. Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello all, wondering what's missing here for this to be folded into the next release? I see some checks are failing but also that it was approved. If this ensures some propagation it would be super helpful for my team to have as right now we see the same behavior in the original reference issue re: dockerized processes and we depend on being able to properly gracefully shutdown rather than have a forced kill after the sigterm wait period.</p>

<p>jupyter-client also sends signals to the process group, so I'm worried about that one too if running the ipykernel using <code>uv run</code>. I'm available to test any proposed changes for that scenario though. jupyter-client tells ipykernel (on non-windows) about the user desire to stop current computation using SIGINT by default.</p>

<p>took another look at this and I also confirmed that when sending a signal it was not passed to the underlying process as expected. I now see what @zanieb mentioned with some interactive shells passing signals directly when done from an interactive context but I'm still not convinced that's a big deal really. at this point I'd rather receive double the signals than the current behavior</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A few things after exploring where things are going wrong. Keep in mind I do not know rust and am only looking at it because this tool is written in it; may need some help to confirm my findings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Regarding why some of us see signals not being passed<ul>
<li>this is because the change was applied only to the <code>tool/run.rs</code> file and is also needed in the <code>project/run.rs</code> file as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why we still see issues with process behavior when signals get handled<ul>
<li>this seems to be because afaict this tokio library does not care about proper signal handling and only exposes a kill API method which does exactly that. Not great, but I see some workarounds around the rust community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when point 2 is addressed this code still assumes too much on handling only one signal ever then exiting<ul>
<li>and would need to change to have some sort of looping to readily handle more than one signal when initial signals do not result in child termination</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am slow in rust as mentioned but I have been looking at this with earnest, though I recognize someone that actually knows this language will be much faster to take them if indeed these are the right things to address</p>
