            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As @zanieb has pointed out in chat, moving file locks around makes us vulnerable to races between different versions of <code>uv</code> that don&#x27;t agree on the file lock path. I&#x27;m comfortable ignoring that as rare enough not to matter, but I&#x27;m curious what other folks think.</p>
<p>Atomically creating a directory with universal write permissions also turned out to be surprisingly complicated, requiring us to spawn a shell command that first sets <code>umask</code>. My instinct is that this command will be portable to all flavors of Unix, but if we&#x27;d rather skip shelling out and tolerate the extremely brief mkdir-then-chmod race, that could also make sense. Feedback needed.</p>
<p>This PR sits on top of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14174">astral-sh/uv#14174</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m closing this for now. Ad-hoc proxy file locking is done in a lot of different ways, e.g.: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/4b348512c270d4fc45d4c5ab55df0bae4e2d93cd/crates/uv/src/commands/project/mod.rs#L721-L746</p>
<p>It might be nice to refactor that (and <code>interpreter.rs</code> and others) to use a common abstraction, but playing with that made it clear that it&#x27;s going to grow the scope of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14174">astral-sh/uv#14174</a> more than I&#x27;d prefer.</p>
