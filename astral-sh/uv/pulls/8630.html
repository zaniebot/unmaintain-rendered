            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It came up for me on a docker container without curl and I created the PR because there wasn't any existing documentation on it. Up to you on if you want to close it or not - at least if someone else faces the same problem as me they'll be able to search &quot;wget&quot; and find this solution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@joshmcorreia Indeed, I think it's still worth adding possibly as a note in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/docs/configuration/installer.md">installer.md</a> instead of the repo's <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/README.md">README</a>.</p>
