<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16523/">this PR</a>, which added SBOM export functionality, we decided to add a synthetic root when using the <code>--all-packages</code> flag to ensure that there were no dangling workspace packages (i.e. workspace components that were not reachable from the root component). However, there is a bug here when not exporting a workspace, as the synthetic root does not depend on the project root. This PR fixes that and adds a test to verify the fix.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Both tested manually and using the automated test added.</p>
