Do we also use authentication for `--requirement https://...` and `foo@https://...`?

We do not do this yet for `--requirement` files, still checking on the other

Sorry to do this but elsewhere I always write this like `The URL, e.g., `. Can we just keep that for consistency even if you don't agree?

We don't for requirement files. That's tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2357.

For `foo@https://...` I would expect that we do, yes.
