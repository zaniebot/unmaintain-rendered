            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR fixes a bug where it was possible for dependencies to be
included in a final resolution with markers that always evaluate to
false. Specifically, <code>python_version &lt; &#x27;0&#x27;</code>.</p>
<p>While we do filter based on Python markers during forking, it turns out
that the markers for each fork are &quot;combined&quot; <em>after</em> this filtering
step. But the process of combination can result in a more specific
marker that is always false for the configured Python requirement. This
could result in dependencies with markers that are always false (like
<code>python_version &lt; &#x27;0&#x27;</code>) appearing in the resolution.</p>
<p>The first commit in this PR adds a regression test (with an undesirable
result), and the second commit fixes the regression and updates the
test.</p>
<p>Fixes #8676</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s a darn good question. You&#x27;re instinct is right. We are actually combining markers in forks <em>after</em> doing a filtering step based on the Python requirement. I added a second filtering step in this PR to fix the bug in the short term. I&#x27;ll see about cleaning this up as part of my conflicting groups work.</p>
