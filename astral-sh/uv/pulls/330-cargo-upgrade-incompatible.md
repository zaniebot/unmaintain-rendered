# `cargo upgrade --incompatible`

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2023-11-06 13:20_

Ran `cargo upgrade --incompatible`, seems there are no changes required.

From cacache 0.12.0:
>  BREAKING CHANGE: some signatures for copy have changed, and copy no longer automatically reflinks

`which` 5.0.0 seems to have only error message changes.
