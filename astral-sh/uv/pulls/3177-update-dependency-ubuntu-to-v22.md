Is there a reason these were pinned to an older version?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-22 14:23_

I think there are arguments in favor of both, but I don't mind bumping.

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-04-22 14:28_

I'm not familiar with why v20 would be better for releases, can you give some quick points?

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-22 14:29_

Oh I thought this was in the system install tests. We should definitely be using whatever cargo-dist outputs here. My uneducated guess is that it ensures better compatibility by compiling against an older glibc or something similar.

### Renovate Ignore Notification

Because you closed this PR without merging, Renovate will ignore this update. You will not get PRs for *any* future `22.x` releases. But if you manually upgrade to `22.x` then Renovate will re-enable `minor` and `patch` updates automatically.

If you accidentally closed this PR, or if you changed your mind: rename this PR to get a fresh replacement PR.
