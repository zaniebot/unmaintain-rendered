            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR is adding <code>UV_CONSTRAINT</code> environment variable as analogous to <code>PIP_CONSTRAINT</code> to allow providing constraint file via environment variable. Implementing this will simplify adoption of uv in testing procedure in projects that I'm involved (testing using tox).</p>
<p>This was my motivation for opening #1841 that is closed in favor of #1789 which was closed without implementing this feature.</p>
<p>In this implementation, I have used space as a separator as analogous to <code>pip</code>. This introduces an obvious problem if the path contains space. Another option could be to use standard separator (<code>:</code> - UNIX like, <code>;</code> - Windows). Which one did you prefer?</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>It is my first contribution and first rust coding experience. It will be nice if one could point how I should implement testing this.</p>
