This change might be controversial, as maybe we actually prefer to rely on a named stage?

"organisation" is valid in UK English, but I believe the documentation often uses US English, so switching to "organization" should improve consistency.

Besides the newline, there is one typo fixed here: "e.g." instead of "eg".
