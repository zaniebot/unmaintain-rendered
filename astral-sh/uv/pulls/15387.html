Summary


<p>This PR adds support for building loongarch64 binaries in CI. As uv itself runs perfectly well on loongarch64 and with the latter&#x27;s userbase steadily growing, it would be a good idea to ship prebuilt binaries to help them out.</p>
<p>Please note that as Ubuntu is not yet available for loongarch64, I have elected to use a Debian Trixie container maintained by community members. In addition, as Debian&#x27;s pip does not allow installing modules system-wide, the workflow for loongarch64 installs additional modules in a virtual environment.</p>
Test Plan


<p>Tests are included in CI and the loongarch64 artifacts built in <a href="https://github.com/SkyBird233/uv/actions/runs/17091637376/job/48466486690">this workflow</a> has been smoke tested.</p>

<p>Interesting... Just out of curiosity, what legal challenges/processes are we facing with this?</p>

<p>Same guess as mine but was wondering if they could just say it outright.</p>

<p>Technically the sanctions only affect the company entity, and LoongArch is just an abstract ISA, even though right now all readily available LoongArch CPU models are from Loongson.

<p>On the other hand, like it or not politics is not going anywhere, and not producing LoongArch binaries wouldn&#x27;t stop the community from doing so downstream, so maybe the net effect is just making community packagers&#x27; and LoongArch daily-drivers&#x27; lives harder. Is it possible to both keep being &quot;compliant&quot; and somehow not regress downstream UX when they want to just install <code>uv</code>, like allowing people to specify download mirrors or anything equivalent?</p>

<p>Before we do, I&#x27;m reflecting back on the RISCV changes that broke our release process, e.g., see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14009">astral-sh/uv#14009</a>. Do we need to do something here to prevent that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh that&#x27;s a point. Since there&#x27;s no official loongarch64 support in <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/blob/main/README.rst">pypa/manylinux</a> right now, I&#x27;m filtering it out from the PyPI publishing workflow.</p>
