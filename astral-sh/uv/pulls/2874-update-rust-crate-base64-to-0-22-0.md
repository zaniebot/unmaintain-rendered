### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>marshallpierce/rust-base64 (base64)</summary>

### [`v0.22.0`](https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/blob/HEAD/RELEASE-NOTES.md#0220)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64/compare/v0.21.7...v0.22.0)

-   `DecodeSliceError::OutputSliceTooSmall` is now conservative rather than precise. That is, the error will only occur if the decoded output *cannot* fit, meaning that `Engine::decode_slice` can now be used with exactly-sized output slices. As part of this, `Engine::internal_decode` now returns `DecodeSliceError` instead of `DecodeError`, but that is not expected to affect any external callers.
-   `DecodeError::InvalidLength` now refers specifically to the *number of valid symbols* being invalid (i.e. `len % 4 == 1`), rather than just the number of input bytes. This avoids confusing scenarios when based on interpretation you could make a case for either `InvalidLength` or `InvalidByte` being appropriate.
-   Decoding is somewhat faster (5-10%)

### ⚠ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update artifacts related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path crates/uv/Cargo.toml --package base64@0.21.7 --precise 0.22.0
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `base64 = "^0.21"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.22.0
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `reqwest v0.11.26`
    ... which satisfies dependency `reqwest = "^0.11.23"` (locked to 0.11.26) of package `uv-git v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv-git)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `uv-git` (locked to 0.0.1) of package `distribution-types v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/distribution-types)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?
