## Summary

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

The PyTorch guide page has this, but it's missing from this example (which is otherwise identical to the PyTorch guide page). I think it would be helpful to include it here too.

## Test Plan

Docs.
<!-- How was it tested? -->
