### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.2.13`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0213-2025-05-05)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.12...0.2.13)

\===================
This release fixes a bug in a corner case where `TimeZone::following` could
sometimes omit the last time zone transition. This could only happen in time
zones that once had daylight saving time, but ended it. This did not have an
impact on other Jiff APIs that handle daylight saving time.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;362](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/362):
    Fix a bug where `TimeZone::following` could omit the last historical time zone
    transition.

### [`v0.2.12`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0212-2025-05-03)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.11...0.2.12)

\===================
This release fixes a couple bugs in Jiff's parser. In particular, a regression
was introduced in `jiff 0.2.11` where its RFC 2822 parser could panic on some
inputs. Previous releases of Jiff are unaffected.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;357](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/357):
    Fix a bug where parsing `1970-06-01T00-00:45:00[Africa/Monrovia]` succeeded
    but it should fail.
-   [#&#8203;359](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/359):
    Fix a bug where the RFC 2822 parser could panic on some inputs.

### [`v0.2.11`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0211-2025-05-01)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.10...0.2.11)

\===================
This release includes new APIs for customizing Jiff's `strtime` behavior along
with a few minor bug fixes. Jiff's `strtime` formatting API has also been
optimized. It's about twice as fast as it was.

This release also coincides with the publication of `jiff-icu 0.2.0-beta.2`,
which has support for `icu 2.0.0-beta.2`.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;338](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/338):
    Add support for the `%c`, `%r`, `%X` and `%x` conversion specifiers.
-   [#&#8203;341](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/341):
    Add support for `%q` in `jiff::fmt::strtime` (prints quarter of year).
-   [#&#8203;342](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/342):
    Add support for `%::z` and `%:::z` in `jiff::fmt::strtime`.
-   [#&#8203;344](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/344):
    Add support for `%N` in `jiff::fmt::strtime` (alias for `%9f`).
-   [#&#8203;350](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/350):
    Add a "lenient" mode for `strtime` formatting APIs that ignores most errors.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;328](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/328):
    Document default precision behavior of `Display` impls for datetime types.
-   [#&#8203;340](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/340):
    Allow whitespace in more places in RFC 2822 parser (improves spec compliance).
-   [#&#8203;346](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/346):
    `TimeZone::get("UTC")` should now always return `TimeZone::UTC`.

Performance:

-   [#&#8203;338](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/338):
    Jiff's `strftime` APIs are now approximately twice as fast as they were.
    Performance should be comparable to `chrono` and `time`'s prebuilt APIs.
