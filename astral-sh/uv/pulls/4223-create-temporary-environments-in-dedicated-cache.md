# Create temporary environments in dedicated cache bucket

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

We may choose to persist these eventually, but for now, it's useful to have them colocated with the cache, and in their own dedicated bucket (so, at the very least, we can keep track of the use-cases).

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4219.
