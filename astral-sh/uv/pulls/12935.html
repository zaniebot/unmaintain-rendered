<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Motivation for this is to have ability to verify the artifacts downloaded from GH release, just like it is already possible for container images.</p>
<p>Tools such as <a href="https://aquaproj.github.io">aqua</a> and <a href="https://mise.jdx.dev">mise</a> (<a href="https://github.com/jdx/mise/discussions/4531">likely, later</a>) can make use of these and verify downloads automatically.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>This is untested by me. The CI setup is quite elaborate, not sure if I could get it to run properly in my fork with reasonable effort. But I suppose this <em>could</em> Just Work anyway :)</p>
