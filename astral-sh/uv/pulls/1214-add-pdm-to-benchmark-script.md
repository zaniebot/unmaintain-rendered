# Add PDM to benchmark script

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-01-31 20:27_

## Summary

Overall, similar to Poetry, with some simplifications (e.g., we don't need to translate to Poetry's dependency syntax), and the need to adjust how we manage the cache and virtual environment.
