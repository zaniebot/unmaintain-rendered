            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv python upgrade</code> had originally had a <code>--force</code> option, but we thought it probably didn't make sense. However, switching <code>uv python upgrade</code> behind the preview flag revealed a bad interaction: upgrading a minor version when a non-managed interpreter of that version exists in the <code>bin</code> directory displays an error recommending the use of <code>--force</code>.</p>
<p>This PR only warns if this case arises with <code>uv python upgrade</code>, noting that install <code>--force</code> can be used. It also includes a test for the case described above.</p>

<p>I ended up removing the <code>upgrade --force</code> option. In the test case, upgrade continues with a warning, hinting to use force install if you want to install over the non-managed <code>bin</code> installation.</p>
<p>I've updated the PR title and description.</p>
