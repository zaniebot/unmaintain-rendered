            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As I suspected quite some time ago (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6738#issuecomment-2315466033), it's problematic that we don't handle <em>every</em> signal here. This PR adds handling for all of the Unix signals except <code>SIGCHLD</code>, <code>SIGIO</code>, and <code>SIGPOLL</code> which seem incorrect to forward. Also notable, we <em>cannot</em> handle <code>SIGKILL</code> so if someone sends that to the PID instead of the PGID, they will leave dangling subprocesses.</p>
<p>Instead, we could use <code>exec</code> and avoid this handling. However, we'd lose the ability to add nice error message on failure (e.g., as someone is trying to add in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12201) and, more critically, we'd need to figure out how to clean up resources properly (i.e., temporary directories) which currently happens on <code>Drop</code>. In the long-term, we'll probably want an option to use <code>exec</code> — but we'll need to figure out when to clean up resources or accept that they will dangle. This was last discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3095 — discussion on that approach should continue there.</p>
<p>A note on the implementation: I spent time time trying to write the handler using a tokio stream, so we could dynamically iterate over a list of signals instead of copy/pasting the implementation — I couldn't get it to work though and it didn't seem critical.</p>
