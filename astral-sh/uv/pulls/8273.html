            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The hack in pip itself only modifies entry points called <code>pip&lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;</code> and <code>easy_install-&lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;</code>, uv previously dropped too many items including any of the form <code>foo.&lt;number&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Found while trying to install <code>memray</code> which somewhat notably does not provide an abi3 wheel, so the installed, suffixed script matches.  At a minimum, this makes the installed files match the <code>entry_points.txt</code> more than it did previously, which makes <code>pickley</code> happy.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>New test provided for previously-untested code.</p>

<p>Right, <code>bin/memray3.13</code> was previously being skipped (and not replaced with anything), but the installed <code>entry_points.txt</code> still referenced it.</p>
