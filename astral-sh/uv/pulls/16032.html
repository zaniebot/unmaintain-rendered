            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not strongly opposed but it does seem like <code>du -sh $(uv cache dir)</code> might be equally sufficient here? In the linked issue, the idea is raised that we might track the cache size within the cache (to make reporting faster). That seems quite difficult, but if we <em>aren't</em> doing that, is there a good reason to support this over <code>du -sh</code>?</p>

<p>I think the main reasons is:</p>
<p>Cross-platform consistency: eliminating the need to call different command-line tools depending on the platform, <code>du</code> in Linux/macOS,  but Windows doesn't have <code>du</code>(use <code>Get-ChildItem</code> in Windows). I think use the same code to handle is more elegant and maintanble than call different command-line tools</p>
