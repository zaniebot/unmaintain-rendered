---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-28 20:44_

Ok, this leads to a breaking change because `pip compile` uses `-p` for `--python-version`.

Isn't that okay because `--python-version` is basically a subset of `--python`? I guess the discovered interpreter could have different markers?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-28 23:45_

`--python-version` works even if we can't discover an interpreter with the version, I think?

Example:

```
❯ echo "flask" | uv pip compile -p 3.8 -
warning: The requested Python version 3.8 is not available; 3.11.8 will be used to build dependencies instead.

    #   werkzeug
werkzeug==3.0.3
    # via flask
zipp==3.19.0
    # via importlib-metadata
```

I think we should change it to require `--python-version` instead of `-p` but it is breaking.

I have similar opinion on https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3864:
> Add a `--package` option that allows switching the current project in the workspace. Wherever you are in a workspace, you should be able to run with any other project as root. This is the uv equivalent of `cargo run -p`.
> 
> I don't love the `--package` name, esp. since `-p` is already taken and in general to many things start with p already.


What I can suggest is to use `--py` alias instad of `-p` short at there.
for _short_, I think we could rename the args to `python_toolchain` and use `-t` for _short_ usage.

It's breaking but we can also continue without _short_ at this point.

@zanieb -- Am I right that we no longer want to do this, because we want separate documentation for `--python` for each command?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-09-24 13:42_

I think so? Though we can always just shadow it in a specific command to overwrite the docs right?
