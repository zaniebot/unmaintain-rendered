# docs: env var doc improvements

---

_Pull request opened by @samypr100 on 2024-11-03 17:16_

## Summary

* Env docs now support anchors, which allows sending a link to someone with a direct reference to an env var or cross-reference them in the docs.
* Marked additional env vars as hidden from the docs due to their internal use
* Updates some tests still using literals to use the static env vars

## Test Plan
