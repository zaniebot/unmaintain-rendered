# Use `anstream` to avoid writing colorized output

---

_@charliermarsh_

A more robust solution to avoiding colorized output by ensuring we write to `stdout` and `stderr` via the [`anstream`](https://docs.rs/anstream/latest/anstream/) crate.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/issues/393.
