            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This fixes installations using git which involved submodules declared through relative paths, fixes #9822 .</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I did testing using a private gitlab server that I was running locally, to recreate the issue. I have also added tests that involve installing from a repository that I created on my GitHub. Adding that repository and it's accompanying submodule to uv-test (I see there is already a repository - <code>uv_submodule_pypackage</code>  that tests submodule installation but that doesn't use relative path) should work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks reasonable and I greatly appreciate the test. My only concern is that Cargo does it in the order we have here 🤔 Can you briefly check if there are any such issues reported in Cargo?</p>

<p>I looked into Cargo’s implementation and found that their tests do not fail due to differences in how submodules are updated.</p>
<p>Currently, uv relies on the Git CLI (<code>git submodule update --recursive</code>) to update submodules, whereas Cargo passes the remote URL to a submodule function that fetches each submodule individually using either git_cli, gitoxide, or libgit2. This means that when git reset breaks the link to the remote origin, Cargo’s implementation remains unaffected.</p>
<p>One key reason Cargo seems to run reset first is their guard mechanism, which helps mitigate interruptions while updating submodules and uv's guard mechanism is not affected by this change.</p>
<p>I did think of scenarios where updating submodules before a reset could cause issues - for example, in a local repository with uncommitted changes affecting submodules. To address this, I implemented the fix so that reset is performed before updating submodules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh hey wanted to check in again. I see there are some conflicts with main I think they are caused by merges after my PR if that is the reason for the holdup for your review I would be happy to work on resolving the conflicts</p>
