Summary
<p>Sometimes I would like to have per-venv <code>uv.toml</code> so that there could be e.g. multiple venv&#x27;s with different constraints where different projects are run/tested. System/user wide configuration forbids doing many venv&#x27;s and project settings doesn&#x27;t allow running with different set of constraints.</p>
<p>Having configuration files within the venv is also a feature that pip supports: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/#location</p>
Test Plan
<p>Manually tested by creating venv and adding <code>uv.toml</code> there -&gt; constraints were resolved correctly.</p>

<p>We have some &quot;fixed&quot; python production environments. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>prod-env0 -&gt; python==3.8, numpy==1.17.0, pandas==0.24.0, ...</li>
<li>prod-env1 -&gt; python==3.10, numpy==1.24.4, pandas==1.4.4, ...</li>
<li>prod-env2 -&gt; python==3.12, numpy==2.13.0, pandas==2.2.2, ...</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>And then we have e.g. python package <code>foo</code> that we ci-test and guarantee to run smoothly in e.g. env1 and env2.</p>
<p>That means that we want to give some set of hard constraints while installing <code>foo</code>, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>They cannot be in <code>pyproject.toml</code> as the constraints are different based on the env we are testing/running the package</li>
<li>They cannot be in <code>~/.config/uv.toml</code> as the same user might want to test in different venv&#x27;s</li>
</ul>
<p>So for our use case it is better to have venv-specific configs, that can be generated (with script, <code>prod-env init 0</code>) after I create new venv. Currently we have that kind of script for <code>pip</code>, but I would definitely like to switch to <code>uv pip</code> if pip-like venv specific uv.toml would be possible.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn&#x27;t maybe fit nicely to <code>uv sync</code>/<code>uv lock</code> way of working, but having this in <code>uv pip</code> would be nice</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think we want to do this, it&#x27;s a core principle that virtual environments are ephemeral and disposable. Maybe we can find some other way for you to override settings per target environment. It sort of overlaps with #5903</p>

<p>Is the problem then that as <code>uv</code> may delete and recreate the virtual environment at any time there is no guarantee that the constraints will be recreated at the right time and thus considered when doing installs?</p>
<p>Our current steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>create venv</li>
<li>install package with all possible environmental constraints</li>
<li>run <code>initialize environment X</code></li>
<li>pip install the rest of the packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas with <code>uv</code> that&#x27;s all one step?  <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5903">astral-sh/uv#5903</a> looks quite different to me. Although there is mention of <code>environment</code> people seem to focus on running scripts. What we are looking for is more like composing constraints from different environments with project specific constraints.</p>
