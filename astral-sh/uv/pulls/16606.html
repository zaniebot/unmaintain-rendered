<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>When <code>exclude-newer</code> filters out all candidates for a package, the debug output doesn't indicate that the date filter was applied. This makes it difficult to diagnose why no compatible versions are found. Issue described here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16485</p>
<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>User pins <code>mlx==0.29.3</code> (published on 2025-10-18)</li>
<li>User sets <code>exclude-newer = &quot;2025-10-11T00:00:00Z&quot;</code></li>
<li>Resolution fails silently as there is no matching version found for mlx.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>DEBUG Searching for a compatible version of mlx (&gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+)
DEBUG Excluding candidates for mlx published after 2025-10-11T00:00:00Z
TRACE Exhausted all candidates for package mlx with range &gt;=0.29.3, &lt;0.29.3+ after 1 steps
DEBUG No compatible version found for: mlx
</code></pre>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Tested with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = [&quot;mlx==0.29.3&quot;]

[tool.uv]
exclude-newer = &quot;2025-10-11T00:00:00Z&quot;  
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>uv lock -vvv</code> now shows the exclude-newer debug message.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is this being logged if exclude newer is set and we visit this package? That seems misleading? Shouldn't we only log it if we actually filtered a distribution due to exclude newer?</p>
<p>Why should we have this in a debug log rather than a hint on failed resolution?</p>
