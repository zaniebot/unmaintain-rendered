<p>Previously tested in #2515 to no effect, maybe better now that we have a development drive?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From 9m 21s to 6m 17s, nearly entirely in the <code>cargo test</code> step. The runner is twice as expensive, moving from $0.064 to $0.128 per minute. Since we've saving time, it'll be less than 2x expensive, but still more costly. Seems very worth it.</p>
<p>Note that 9m is one of the jobs on <code>main</code>, we've seen times as low as 7m.</p>
