# Support `cp3-none-any`

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2025-12-10 10:06_

According to https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/, `cp3-none-any` is a valid tag, even though you shouldn't use it. We should accept it.

@BurntSushi Is that a forward-compatible change with rkyv?

I don't know off the top of my head, but the [docs suggest it isn't](https://docs.rs/rkyv/latest/rkyv/#compatibility) in the sense that "any change is possibly breaking." There [isn't much more about it in the book](https://rkyv.org/format.html).

I don't know enough about rkyv internals to know whether this is _actually_ breaking or not. I can imagine both worlds. e.g., A scheme based on knowing there are `N` total variants may not be compatible with something when there are `N+1` variants. Particularly if `N+1` causes the size of the tag used by the `enum` to increase.
