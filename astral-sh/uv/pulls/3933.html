            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We retry several kinds of network request failures, but it&#x27;s often unclear whether a request was retried or not (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3514">astral-sh/uv#3514</a>#issuecomment-2105485773). This PR adds a small intermediary layer that logs all transient request failures, adding the <code>DEBUG Transient request failure</code> lines:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I decided for multi-line logging to show the complete error trace since only <code>Transient request failure for https://pypi.org/simple/tqdm/, retrying: Request error: error sending request for url (https://pypi.org/simple/tqdm/)</code> doesn&#x27;t tell you the actual problem (a dns error).</p>
<p>Note that running with <code>-v</code> will not show messages about retry backoff timing, but running with <code>RUST_LOG=debug</code> now shows a complete picture:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG starting new connection: https://pypi.org/
DEBUG resolving host=&quot;pypi.org&quot;
DEBUG Transient request failure for https://pypi.org/simple/tqdm/, retrying: Request error: error sending request for url (https://pypi.org/simple/tqdm/)

<p>Fixes #3572</p>
