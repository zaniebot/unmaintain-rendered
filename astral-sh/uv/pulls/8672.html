            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Previously, when doing a <code>uv pip</code> resolution, we would only return the
first entry in the map. But there should only ever be one entry, or else
we would have incompatible dependencies. So we can collapse the case
with the &quot;one universal fork&quot; case.</p>
<p>(I found this while doing some refactoring of how we handle forking, and
collapsing these cases simplifies some of that refactoring work.)</p>
