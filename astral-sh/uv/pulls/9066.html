            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This restores behavior previously removed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7649.</p>
<p>I thought it'd be clearer (and simpler) to have a consistent Python executable name ordering. However, we've seen some cases where this can be surprising and, in combination with #8481, can result in incorrect behavior. For example, see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9046 where we prefer <code>python3</code> over <code>python3.12</code> in the same directory even though <code>python3.12</code> was requested. While <code>python3</code> and <code>python3.12</code> both point to valid Python 3.12 environments there, the expectation is that when <code>python3.12</code> is requested that the <code>python3.12</code> executable is preferred. This expectation may be less obvious if the user requests <code>python@3.12</code>, but uv does not distinguish between these request forms. Similarly, this may be surprising as by default uv prefers <code>python</code> over <code>python3</code> but when requesting <code>python3.12</code> the preference will be swapped.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The Windows failures are due to the switched preference for <code>python3</code> and <code>python</code>. For some reason, both exist on Windows. Perhaps we should always prefer <code>python3</code> over <code>python</code>. More complexity, but... we don't want Python 2 anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I fixed the Windows failures by switching the test from 3.11/3.12 to 3.12/3.13 since 3.12+ seem to use <code>python3.exe</code> consistently on the GitHub runners but 3.11 used <code>python.exe</code>.</p>
