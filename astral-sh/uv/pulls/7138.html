            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I find this more readable; it also no longer requires bash (thought just replacing <code>bash</code> with <code>sh</code> would achieve that much).</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, <code>env</code> is not necessary on most shells, but I find it makes things clearer.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Ran the command locally, did not try compiling the docs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aside, loosely related (and hopefully helpful) suggestions:</p>
<p>I'm hoping you will also explain in the docs how to install to <code>~/.local/bin</code>, with the same goal as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6839. Using environment variables for that is fine.</p>
<p>Another minor FR I'd have is to mention these environment variables in the help message of the installer script, especially if you want to encourage people to use them.</p>
<p>Thank you for working on the installation script! It helps me feel more comfortable about eventually asking that people install <code>uv</code> to compile docs on my project, hopefully helping people who don't have a Python environment already installed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks this seems reasonable to me! I recently put up https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7107 — https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6839 which looked a bit too complicated for users and I've been working with the upstream team to make configuration of the installer simpler / clearer.</p>

<p>Can you open an issue for this so we can track it?</p>
