            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This test started failing, and it fails at least back to v0.6, so I don't think it's on our end. I'm wondering if all the wheels here were yanked? They're visible in the lockfile, but not on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/av/9.2.0/#files. So to get this passing, let's just unpin it.</p>
<p>Edit: Ahh, ok. It looks like the project ran out of space, so they removed wheels for all the older versions: https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV/issues/1879.</p>
