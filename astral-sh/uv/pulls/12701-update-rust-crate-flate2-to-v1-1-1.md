### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/flate2-rs (flate2)</summary>

### [`v1.1.1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/flate2-rs/releases/tag/1.1.1)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/flate2-rs/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1)

This release should be smaller and thus faster to download.
Additionally, when using the `zlib-rs` backend, duplicate symbol issues shouldn't occur anymore.
