            <div class="timeline-body"><ul>
<li>Adds a collapsible section for the project concept</li>
<li>Splits the project concept document into several child documents.</li>
<li>Moves the workspace and dependencies documents to under the project section</li>
<li>Adds a mkdocs plugin for redirects, so links to the moved documents still work</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempted to make the minimum required changes to the contents of the documents here. There is a lot of room for improvement on the content of each new child document. For review purposes, I want to do that work separately. I'd prefer if the review focused on this structure and idea rather than the content of the files.</p>
<p>I expect to do this to other documentation pages that would otherwise be very nested.</p>
<p>The project concept landing page and nav (collapsed by default) looks like this now:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think splitting larger pages into does make sense. We should enable <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/?h=breadc#navigation-path"><code>navigation.path</code></a> (navigation path breadcrumbs) so that it's easy to understand where the user is currently at. It might be problematic because of the &quot;Introduction&quot; page that exists currently but that can possibly be solved.</p>
<p>I'm still a big fan of having a third dimension to navigation aka tabs where the top level sections go but that's an unrelated discussion.</p>

<p>Agree, it just makes it a lot harder to incrementally add more sections because it's a weird experience to switch to tabs without creating and populating a lot of child pages.</p>

<p>I feel the same. In my larger reorg, I actually implemented this in an attempt to show more of the nav</p>

<p>However, this requires JS to dynamically move the element by editing the DOM (you can't style it up into the content).</p>
<p>I think we either need to fork our own theme and change it there, or... idk.</p>
<p>Edit: I had another idea that should solve this in the meantime — https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9153</p>

<p>This seems to have no effect locally for me, which is surprising. I agree it'd be nice to have — I think I tried turning it on previously but was annoyed by the &quot;Introduction&quot; page as you mentioned.</p>

<p>Oh interesting. The following diff seems to be showing the breadcrumbs for me locally:</p>

<p>This looks good. Is this a mockup or is the &quot;reorg&quot; a code change? I'm curious to look at the diff if it's available.</p>
