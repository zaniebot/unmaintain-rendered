            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Previously, we couldn't use a DevDrive (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3522#issuecomment-2111448930) because our Windows version was not sufficient.</p>
<p>Recently, I upgraded our larger runners to Windows 2025 preview (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10298) which I presume has support for this.</p>
<p>I removed ReFS in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10651/commits/953c3535c3754f580ecd8da55637756f58606567 which didn't seem to do anything to performance.</p>
<p>I also found some notes on &quot;trusted&quot; DevDrives and &quot;disabling anti-virus filtering&quot; which I simply have to try.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe this has a minor performance improvement. It's more visible in #10662</p>
<p>I think this might get us more consistency / seems fine to merge regardless of a lack of clear improvement.</p>
