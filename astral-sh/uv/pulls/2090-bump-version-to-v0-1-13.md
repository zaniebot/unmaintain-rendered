_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `CHANGELOG.md`:7 on 2024-02-29 17:12_

Maybe give a bit more information about the impact of this change:

```suggestion
- Prioritize `PATH` over `py --list-paths` in Windows selection ([#2057](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2057)).
  This fixes an issue where the `--system` flag would not work correctly on Windows in GitHub Actions.
```
