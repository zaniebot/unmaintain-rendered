# Use Python 3.12 in benchmarks

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-01-31 20:47_

I originally used Python 3.10, since 3.10 and 3.11 are by far the most common (at least for [Ruff](https://pypistats.org/packages/ruff)). But 3.12 should give Python tools the most favorable benchmarks.
