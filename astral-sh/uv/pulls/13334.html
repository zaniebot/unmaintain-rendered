<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The prior implementation only looks for dependencies which are sorted by name then specifier.</p>
<p>I knew uv was meant to preserve sorted dependencies, but it never seemed to work for me.</p>
<p>I've always used the &quot;sort lines&quot; feature of PyCharm/Sublime to sort these lists, and I guess I'm not the only one. In such a case, <code>flask-wtf&gt;=1.2.1</code> is sorted before <code>flask&gt;=3.0.2</code>.</p>
<p>After digging into the code I realised what was happening, hence this merge request.</p>
<p>Maybe there's a tool I'm not aware of that people are using to sort dependencies &quot;properly&quot;, or are doing it by hand, but I think this is worth supporting.</p>
<p>Relevant issues: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9076, https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10738</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo test</code></p>
