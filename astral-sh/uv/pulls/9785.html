            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This optimization isn't quite right, because we can successfully extract metadata without having to build from source. (The builder itself will error if we reach the point at which we need to build, but builds are disabled.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I traced it back, and it looks like this code was added at the point in time when we <em>always</em> ran PEP 517 build hooks. Now, we can't know if we have to run hooks until we've downloaded the distribution -- so it's correct to continue, and fail later.</p>
