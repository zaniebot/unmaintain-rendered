# Use distribution hash over registry hash

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-05 01:50_

## Summary

We need to prioritize hashes for the distribution over hashes for the related packages.

I think this needs to be redone entirely though. I can see other issues with the current approach.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7059.
