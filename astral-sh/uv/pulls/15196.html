            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>As new environment variables get introduced (e.g. <code>UV_EDITABLE</code>) I thought it would useful to start tracking which release they were introduced. I think its a common workflow to navigate to the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment">env var documentation</a> to know what the env var for something is but then end up in a situation where one is using an environment variable with the wrong version of uv and not notice immediately that its not compatible and therefore ignored.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing tests.</p>
<p>The versions in <code>since</code> have all been manually reviewed to the best of my ability for correctness.</p>

<p>Could we add some a standard stub e.g.  <code>Upcoming Release</code> and have rooster (or other tooling) look for that on a release to replace with?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah Rooster could do a replacement for that, seems reasonable. We probably need that before merging. Even if we don&#x27;t have 1.x.y versioning, there&#x27;s no way to know which version your PR will land in when you create it.</p>

<p>There isn&#x27;t any new &quot;unreleased&quot; environment variables as part of this PR, so I don&#x27;t think we have that risk in this PR. All the environment variables here already been released and are documented for previous releases. I can make a follow up PR with rooster integration for when we do add new env vars? Would that be reasonable? Or did I misunderstand your concern?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb this should be ready for another look (sorry forgot to mark it as draft during the back and forth)</p>
<p>I went with a macro approach on the second commit as I thought it&#x27;d be better Dev Ex.</p>
<p>Note, the OIDC errors are unrelated to this PR but likely due to the OIDC setup related to my fork and depot.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another thought. We could also change pretext <code>Since</code> for <code>Added in</code>, that allows us to use a more natural reading placeholder like <code>&quot;Next Release&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;Upcoming Release&quot;</code> ... e.g. <code>Added in &quot;Next Release&quot;</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I like &quot;Added in&quot; more, I was actually exploring that separately.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m trying to futz with the styling</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/commit/719d2d0343e41e8b0525ade87a59468bc4036a49</p>
<p>I tried including it on the same line (as in that commit) and also tried applying some styling to the h3 / p elements to reduce the vertical margin between the heading and this notation. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s best. I don&#x27;t love any of the styles yet.</p>
