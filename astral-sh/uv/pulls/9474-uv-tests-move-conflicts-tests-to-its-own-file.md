# uv/tests: move `conflicts` tests to its own file

---

_Pull request opened by @BurntSushi on 2024-11-27 15:34_

There are already a fair number and I'm planning to add more. And
`lock.rs` is already quite big.

There aren't any new tests or other changes here. This is just moving
tests and trimming down the function names to avoid redundancy in the
names.
