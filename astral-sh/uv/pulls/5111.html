            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I messed up the order of checks in #5033, due to which it failed to exclude the case of <code>-P package</code>, as <code>arg.startswith(&quot;-P&quot;)</code> check came first and skipped only the first argument.</p>
<p>That means that, in the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">uv pip compile --output-file pip_compile_uv_header.txt unpinned_uv.in -P attrs==18.1.0
</code></pre>
<p>The generated header would exclude <code>-P</code>, but keep <code>attrs==18.1.0</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext"># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile --output-file pip_compile_uv_header.txt unpinned_uv.in attrs==18.1.0
</code></pre>
<p>But we want to check for an exact match first and then only check for the case when option and value are together.</p>
<p>This also affected <code>--find-links</code> short option of style <code>-f &lt;uri&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Hopefully, third times going to be a charm. 😳</p>

<p>I tested locally, and also changed one snapshot test to use <code>-P</code> for variation. I don't think it's worth an extra test, but can do that for sure.</p>
