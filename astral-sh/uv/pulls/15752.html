<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This PR replaces the crate fs2 by fs2.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Crate fs2 is unmaintained for a long time now and has unfixed issues. Especially it doesn't build on AIX, which is the reason I started fixing it.</p>
<p><em>How?</em></p>
<p>I replaced fs2 by fs4. fs4 is fork of fs2. And I adapted fs4 related code having incompatibilities.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<ul>
<li>I built it on Windows and AIX only.</li>
<li>I did not test the artifacts.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.lock">File::lock</a> is stable in Rust 1.89, I think we can wait when we've bumped MSRV to 1.89 and remove fs2.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb OK, I already created a Branch removing fs2 and useing std::fs::File methods. But this would update Rust to 1.89. Would a PR be accepted or is this something you do internally with more critical relations?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would be great! There's one caveat, our N-2 minimal Rust policy, so we have to wait until the release of 1.91.0 stable to actually merge it.</p>
