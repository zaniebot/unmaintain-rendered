            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, and thanks for contributing to uv!</p>
<p>There&#x27;s some extra complexity here for us to determine what should be part of this feature. For example, <code>uv pip install -r https://.../requirements.txt</code> supports having <code>-e ..</code> in that remote file and will use the local parent directory. We support it because <code>pip install -r https://.../requirements.txt</code> does the same, otherwise we likely wouldn&#x27;t allow this (a remote file shouldn&#x27;t be able to browse the local file system). For <code>uv pip install -r https://.../pyproject.toml</code> it&#x27;s unclear how many pyproject.toml features we want or should support. It&#x27;s also unclear if pip will support this in the future and if we need to ensure we will be compatible with pip (or pip with uv, which would cause a different form of problem). For example, if you had <code>path = &quot;..&quot;</code> in <code>tool.uv.sources</code>, should we install from the local parent directory, should we look in the parent path in the URL of the <code>pyproject.toml</code> or should we error? What about other features such as workspace and dependency groups? We currently have only a single use case for this in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15508">astral-sh/uv#15508</a>, which makes it hard to design something, we&#x27;re missing sufficient motivation to design around.</p>
<p>We do think it makes sense to support remote <code>pyproject.toml</code> similar to remote <code>requirements.txt</code> in general, and we appreciate PRs to uv, but I&#x27;m afraid we currently have a hard time reviewing and merging this PR due to difficulties above.</p>
