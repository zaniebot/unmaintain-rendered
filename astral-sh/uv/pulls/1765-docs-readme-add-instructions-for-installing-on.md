# docs(readme): add instructions for installing on Arch Linux

---

_Pull request opened by @orhun on 2024-02-20 16:25_

## Summary

I packaged `uv` in the official repositories: https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/uv/

This PR simply updates README.md to add the instructions to install the package.

## Test Plan

None.

I also recommend adding a [repology badge](https://repology.org/) for easily seeing available distro packages. I can submit a PR to add it if you think it is feasible. LMK!
