<p>Can you open a new PR for that? I think it&#x27;s out of scope of this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I’m undecided on whether I want to do this. But we should either (1) do this and omit all the non-musl release targets (this would now be considered a breaking change), (2) do this but copy the musl to the non-musl targets (sort of strange IMO), or (3) re-add the GNU dynamically linked build (but keep the dual-tagged wheel).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For ripgrep, I don&#x27;t really have a consistent philosophy here. I&#x27;m pretty reactive and add things that people request (or submit), and will generally remove artifacts if they become too burdensome to maintain. With that said, if I were to clean things up, I&#x27;d probably bias toward using musl for everything where I could, and not offer anything that is dynamically linked to glibc. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever offered a glibc release artifact for Linux x86-64, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard anyone complain about it. Using musl is just more convenient and doesn&#x27;t really confer any downsides for ripgrep specifically. (Its allocator tends to be slower than glibc, but I mitigate that by using a different allocator. I think we do the same for <code>uv</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I think for now, my preference is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep these builds.</li>
<li>Re-add the dynamically-linked GNU variant to the release pipeline.</li>
<li>...but dual-tag our wheels, and upload the dual-tagged wheels.</li>

<p>Correct, according to blog post with mimalloc it&#x27;d be even faster than linux-gnu target. We currently use jemalloc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I&#x27;m ultimately a bit torn but it doesn&#x27;t really cost us much to continue shipping the dynamically-linked versions, so I have a slight preference towards doing so.</p>

@charliermarsh feel free to close it since you agreed continuation with both static and dynamic libc releases in the pipeline.</p>
