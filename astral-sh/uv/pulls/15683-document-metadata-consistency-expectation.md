# Document metadata consistency expectation

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2025-09-04 15:22_

An opinionated write-up on why Python packaging needs metadata consistency, and that we need to extend metadata to accommodate ML and scientific users.

I didn't add a paragraph related to CUDA or accelerators in general and wheel variants, as this is currently support neither by wheel tags nor by PEP 508 markers, so it's not a strict metadata consistency concern, plus this would get outdated quickly as wheel variants progress.
