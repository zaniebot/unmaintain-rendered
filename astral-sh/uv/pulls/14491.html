<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>I got a bit stuck today trying to specify an environment for resolution - to resolve a PyPy/CPython conflict, as suggested by a hint in the CLI - but wasn't sure on the grammar.</p>
<p>I am sure I missed a doc somewhere, but I was surprised details on the grammar weren't at the obvious place.</p>
<p>So, I thought to add it quickly!</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I run the npx prettier command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We probably could do it, but they'll be broken links in the Rust doc so we'd need to somehow repair them during generation? We just haven't invested in the infrastructure.</p>
