### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>andrewhickman/fs-err (fs-err)</summary>

### [`v3.2.2`](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#322)

- Add wrappers for `File::set_modified` and `File::set_times` ([#&#8203;84](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/pull/84))

### [`v3.2.1`](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#321)

- Rename parameters of `symlink`, `soft_link` and `hard_link` functions to match `std` ([#&#8203;83](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/pull/83))

### [`v3.2.0`](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#320)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/compare/3.1.3...3.2.0)

- Introduce `debug` and `debug_tokio` feature. Debug filesystem errors faster by exposing more information ([#&#8203;81](https://redirect.github.com/andrewhickman/fs-err/pull/81)). Without this feature on, errors might look like this:

  ```
  failed to open file `file.txt`: The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)
  ```

  With this feature on, it will include additional information. For example:

  ```
  failed to open file `file.txt`: The system cannot find the file specified. (os error 2)

  Path does not exist `file.txt`
  - Absolute path `/path/to/dir/file.txt`
  - Missing `file.txt` from parent directory:
    `/path/to/dir`
      └── `file.md`
      └── `different.txt`
  ```

  It's suggested to enable this feature in `dev-dependencies` for security and performance reasons.
