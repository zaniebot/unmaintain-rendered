# Remove the configuration section in favor of concepts / reference

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2025-06-04 16:09_

Extends https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13841 — I'll drop that commit later after that pull request merges but it's small.

I find the split into a "Configuration" section awkward and don't think it's helping us. Everything moved into the "Concepts" section, except the "Environment variables" page which definitely belongs in the reference and the "Installer" page which is fairly niche and seems better in the reference.

Before / After
