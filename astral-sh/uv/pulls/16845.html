            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This removes executable permissions while retaining global read / global write.</p>
<p>It's been suggested we should use 0o644 instead, dropping the global write permissions (i.e., just the owner can write), but since we're taking an exclusive lock I don't think that would work and we'd regress the issue that was solved by updating the permissions. I think we'll need to revisit the locking scheme if that's the goal, but regardless, this seems like a net improvement.</p>
