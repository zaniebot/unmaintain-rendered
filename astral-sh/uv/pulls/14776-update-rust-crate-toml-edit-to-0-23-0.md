### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package toml_edit@0.22.27 --precise 0.23.2
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `toml_edit = "^0.22.27"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.23.2
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `toml v0.8.23`
    ... which satisfies dependency `toml = "^0.8.19"` (locked to 0.8.23) of package `uv v0.8.0 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv)`
