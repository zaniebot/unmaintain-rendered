            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Passing <code>pyproject.toml</code> or <code>setup.py</code> to <code>pip uninstall</code> is a bit strange, since it will often require running a resolution to resolve the dependencies (e.g., build the project), which means we also need to accept <code>--index-url</code> and friends.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm open to allowing it for <code>pip uninstall</code> if there's pushback. It's more work and I'll need to wire up all the arguments, but it's doable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uninstall</code> seems like a really weird use case..</p>
<p><code>sync</code> seems reasonable if we performed resolution... seems better for a future interface though.</p>
