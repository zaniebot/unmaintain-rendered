            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In some cases, it's possible for the marker expressions on conflicting
dependency specification to be disjoint but <em>incomplete</em>. That is, if
one unions the disjoint markers, the result is not the complete set
of marker environments possible. There may be some &quot;gap&quot; of marker
environments not covered by the markers.</p>
<p>This is a problem in practice because, before this commit, we only
created forks in the resolver for specific marker expressions. So if a
dependency happened to fall in a &quot;gap,&quot; our resolver would never see
it.</p>
<p>This commit fixes this by adding a new split covering the negation of
the union of all marker expressions in a set of forks for a specific
package.</p>
<p>Originally, I had planned on only creating this split when it was
known that the gap actually existed. That is, when the negation of the
marker expressions did <em>not</em> correspond to the empty set. After a lot
of thought, unfortunately, this (I believe) effectively boils down to
3SAT, which is NP-complete.</p>
<p>Instead, what we do here is <em>always</em> create an extra split unless we
can definitively tell that it is empty. We look for a few cases, but
otherwise throw our hands up and potentially do wasted work.</p>
<p>This also updates the lock scenario tests to reflect the actual bug fix
here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One interesting consequence of this PR is that, even in very basic forks, this will create an additional fork covering the rest of the universe. For example:</p>
<pre><code>requires = [
  &quot;a&gt;=2 ; sys_platform == 'linux'&quot;,
  &quot;a&lt;2 ; sys_platform == 'darwin'&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>While those marker expressions are disjoint, they do not cover everything. So this PR will result in an additional fork with <code>sys_platform != &quot;linux&quot; and sys_platform != &quot;darwin&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>We do try to avoid creating forks if we know the marker expressions can never be true, but after some thought, I believe that's equivalent to solving 3SAT.</p>
