### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>mitsuhiko/insta (insta)</summary>

### [`v1.38.0`](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1380)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/compare/1.37.0...1.38.0)

-   `Filters` is now constructible from `IntoIterator`.  [#&#8203;400](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/400)

-   Change `std` macro calls to be fully qualified.  This fixes issues where
    the prelude was not used or the macros were overridden.  [#&#8203;469](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/469)

### [`v1.37.0`](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1370)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/compare/1.36.1...1.37.0)

-   All macros for file snapshots should now handle trailing commas (but not yet inline snapshots)

-   Vendored old `yaml-rust` dependency to avoid rustsec warnings.  [#&#8203;465](https://togithub.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/465)
