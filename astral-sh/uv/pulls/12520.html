            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As it stands right now, if you click &quot;copy to clipboard&quot; for 1. Clean up stored data, you will paste the following:</p>
<p>uv cache clean
rm -r &quot;$(uv python dir)&quot;
rm -r &quot;$(uv tool dir)&quot;</p>
<p>Great, this is easy to drop into a terminal.</p>
<p>The section 2. Remove the uv and uvx binaries will give the following for Windows:
$ rm $HOME.local\bin\uv.exe
$ rm $HOME.local\bin\uvx.exe</p>
<p>The $ at the beginning of lines breaks copy and paste.</p>
<p>I believe this change will fix.</p>
<p>EDIT: testing is showing this change isn't sufficient to fix the problem, so I'm playing with additional changes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems there is no good solution that I can easily find to keep the $ on the webpage but have to copy/paste function correctly.</p>
<p>I think we could remove the $, as other examples of powershell do not have lines starting with $. Updating the PR to reflect this suggestion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The leading <code>$</code> works elsewhere, we have some JS to strip it on copy. The solution is probably to find out why that's not working here instead of just removing it from this one spot.</p>

<p>Are we thinking there's something going on with the JS?</p>
