<p>On linux, it would be &quot;Temporary failure in name resolution&quot; instead of &quot;No such host is known. (os error 11001)&quot;.</p>
<p>The implementation checks for &quot;dne error&quot; stringly as hyper errors are opaque. The danger is that this breaks with a hyper update. We still get the complete error trace since reqwest eagerly inlines errors (https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2147).</p>
<p>No test since i wouldn't know how to simulate this in cargo test.</p>
<p>Fixes #1971</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, will switch. The feature i really want is to attach hints to error messages that are shown below the error chain themselves. I also want that for build errors (#2108). We could do that by defining our own <code>ErrorHint</code> trait and downcasting when we print the chain in main.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've switched the error hierarchy, it's verbose again.</p>
<p>I've experimented a bit with adding help messages but i don't think it's possible without either adding that trait to our entire error hierarchy (the miette approach) or losing the error type in a <code>struct ErrorWithHelp { help: String, source: Box&lt;dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static&gt; }</code>.</p>
