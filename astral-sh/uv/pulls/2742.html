            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We iterate over the project &quot;requirements&quot; directly in a variety of places. However, it's not always the case that an input &quot;requirement&quot; on its own will <em>actually</em> be part of the resolution, since we support &quot;overrides&quot;.</p>
<p>Historically, then, overrides haven't worked as expected for <em>direct</em> dependencies (and we have some tests that demonstrate the current, &quot;wrong&quot; behavior). This is just a bug, but it's not really one that comes up in practice, since it's rare to apply an override to your <em>own</em> dependency.</p>
<p>However, we're now considering expanding the lookahead concept to include local transitive dependencies. In this case, it's more and more important that overrides and constraints are handled consistently.</p>
<p>This PR modifies all the locations in which we iterate over requirements directly, and modifies them to respect overrides (and constraints, where necessary).</p>
