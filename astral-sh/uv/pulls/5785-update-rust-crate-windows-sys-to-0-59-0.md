### Release Notes

<summary>microsoft/windows-rs (windows-sys)</summary>

### [`v0.59.0`](https://togithub.com/microsoft/windows-rs/releases/tag/0.59.0)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/microsoft/windows-rs/compare/0.52.0...0.59.0)

This release includes an update to the [windows-sys](https://crates.io/crates/windows-sys) crate only. The `windows-sys` crate is updated very infrequently and only when there is an explicit need to do so. The 0.59.0 release includes a rollup of API fixes, updates, and additions since the [0.52.0](https://togithub.com/microsoft/windows-rs/releases/tag/0.52.0) release nine months ago. Notably:

-   This update introduces support for Arm64EC ([#&#8203;2957](https://togithub.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/2957))
-   Updated bindings for the latest APIs https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs/tree/0.59.0/crates/libs/bindgen/default
-   Derive standard traits ([#&#8203;3041](https://togithub.com/microsoft/windows-rs/issues/3041))
-   Updates to code generation to handle newer Rust warnings and lints
-   Overall smaller crate and more efficient code gen to reduce build time
-   Support for feature search https://microsoft.github.io/windows-rs/features/#/0.59.0
-   MSRV is updated to 1.60
