### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/futures-rs (futures)</summary>

### [`v0.3.31`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0331---2024-10-05)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/compare/0.3.30...0.3.31)

-   Fix use after free of task in `FuturesUnordered` when dropped future panics ([#&#8203;2886](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2886))
-   Fix soundness bug in `task::waker_ref` ([#&#8203;2830](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2830))
    This is a breaking change but allowed because it is soundness bug fix.
-   Fix bugs in `AsyncBufRead::read_line` and `AsyncBufReadExt::lines` ([#&#8203;2884](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2884))
-   Fix parsing issue in `select!`/`select_biased!` ([#&#8203;2832](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2832))
    This is technically a breaking change as it will now reject a very odd undocumented syntax that was previously accidentally accepted.
-   Work around issue due to upstream `Waker::will_wake` change ([#&#8203;2865](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2865))
-   Add `stream::Iter::{get_ref,get_mut,into_inner}` ([#&#8203;2875](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2875))
-   Add `future::AlwaysReady` ([#&#8203;2825](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2825))
-   Relax trait bound on non-constructor methods of `io::{BufReader,BufWriter}` ([#&#8203;2848](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs/issues/2848))
