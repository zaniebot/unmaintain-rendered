### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>GREsau/schemars (schemars)</summary>

### [`v1.0.4`](https://redirect.github.com/GREsau/schemars/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#104---2025-07-06)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/GREsau/schemars/compare/v1.0.3...v1.0.4)

##### Fixed

- Fix `JsonSchema` impl on [atomic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/) types being ignored on non-nightly compilers due to a buggy `cfg` check ([https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/453](https://redirect.github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/453))
- Fix compatibility with minimal dependency versions, e.g. old(-ish) versions of `syn` ([https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/450](https://redirect.github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/450))
- Fix derive for empty tuple variants ([https://github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/455](https://redirect.github.com/GREsau/schemars/issues/455))
