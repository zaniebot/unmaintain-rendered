            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We're seeing reports that Sonatype Nexus isn't working with cached data. Users are reporting 304 responses that show &quot;Found modified response...&quot; path in the logs. I can't reproduce this on latest Sonatype Nexus, but my best guess is that there's a 304 response that is failing our validators, and we try to use that as if it's a &quot;complete&quot; response?</p>
