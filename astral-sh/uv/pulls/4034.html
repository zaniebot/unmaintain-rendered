            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This meta-PR includes some suggestions for the docs on installing into arbitrary Python environments.</p>
<p>It targets the branch in #4031 and is a response to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3951#issuecomment-2148595865.</p>
<p>Specifically, it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moves mention of <code>--python=$(which python)</code> out of the <code>--system</code> paragraph, as the two are no longer equivalent</li>
<li>Adds additional notes on how, currently, to install for the current interpreter. This section should be updated once #4009 is implemented :)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wasn't sure how to interpret this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the <code>--system</code> flag is provided, uv will ignore any interpreters that are not in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/#specification">PEP 405 compliant</a> virtual environments. Similarly, if the <code>--system</code> flag is not provided, uv will ignore any interpreters that are in not virtual environments.</p>

<p>This paragraph is a guess, but it may not be correct.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm hesitant to suggest this since it's slower than using <code>uv</code> directly (you need to pay the cost of Python interpreter startup). Might be worth saying something about which interpreter is used in this case regardless though.</p>

<p>Sure, I get that. I guess what was confusing for me was than in uv&lt;0.2, <code>--system</code> seemed more or less equivalent to <code>--python=$(which python3)</code>, whereas in uv&gt;=0.2, this was no longer the case, at least for my use-case. Moreover, it's not currently clear in the text on <code>main</code> under which conditions the equivalence holds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it's rare that your <code>python</code> is a shim which automatically activates environments on invocation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, as a pyenv-virtualenv user, this is always the case for me, but I'm not sure how prevalent this is, writ large.</p>
<p>I guess the main suggestion here is to provide clarity as to what <code>--system</code> does: perhaps including how it may be similar to <code>--python=$(which python3)</code> and how it differs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, since I didn't understand your version, I figured it must have included a misstatement :)
My text was an attempt to rephrase yours under the assumption it was correct as written, which means mine is also wrong. I'll revert and let you patch your version.</p>
