            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Redacts a <code>Url</code> by transforming it into a <code>DisplaySafeUrl</code> before logging. This requires a clone, since <code>DisplaySafeUrl</code> is owning. Note that this doesn't use <code>DisplaySafeUrl::parse</code>, so it doesn't include the ambiguity detections we normally perform. I could add that, although that would mean inserting a fallible API on the path here.</p>
<p>Ideally we'd have a lint for these -- we should flag any dataflow where a <code>Url</code> value flows into an output sink (like <code>trace!</code>). Not sure how easy this would be to add, but I can look into it.</p>
<p>See #17343.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I'm not sure what the best way to test this is -- maybe a mock server that intentionally flakes the first request to exercise the logic? Consequently I haven't added a new test yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A lint would be nice, but I'm not sure if clippy can do that much indirection. For the cloning, I think that's totally fine here. We could do testing by capturing logs (<code>-vv</code>), and we also have the testing for network retries with test servers that fail, but I'm not sure how much reassurance they would actually provide.</p>
