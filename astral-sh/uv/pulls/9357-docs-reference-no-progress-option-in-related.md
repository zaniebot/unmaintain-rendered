# docs: reference `--no-progress` option in related environment variable

---

_Pull request opened by @MatthijsKok on 2024-11-22 14:24_

## Summary

Aligns the description of `UV_NO_PROGRESS` with other env vars that also have a related flag.

`--no-progress` is a "global option" and exists in every command.

Np! Thanks for contributing.

For future reference, we generate the reference documentation like that from the code so usually you want to change the code then run `cargo dev generate-all`
