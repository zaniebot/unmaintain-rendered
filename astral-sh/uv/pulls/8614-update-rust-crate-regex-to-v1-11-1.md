### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/regex (regex)</summary>

### [`v1.11.1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1111-2024-10-24)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/compare/1.11.0...1.11.1)

\===================
This is a new patch release of `regex` that fixes compilation on nightly
Rust when the unstable `pattern` crate feature is enabled. Users on nightly
Rust without this feature enabled are unaffected.

Bug fixes:

-   [BUG #&#8203;1231](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1231):
    Fix the `Pattern` trait implementation as a result of nightly API breakage.
