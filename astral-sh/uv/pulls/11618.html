            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In #6827, we switched the uv-dev binary to not being built by default. As an unintended side effect, we were also stopping to run the tests that ensured the schema was up-to-date.</p>
<p>To fix this, we split uv-dev into an unconditional library, with only the binary being a conditional build. This way, <code>cargo test</code> and <code>cargo nextest</code> pick those tests up again.</p>
<p>An alternative would be running tests with the <code>dev</code> feature, with the side effect of always building the uv-dev binary, too.</p>
