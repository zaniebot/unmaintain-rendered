            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14919 it was reported that uv's behavior differed after the first invocation. I noticed we weren't copying entrypoints after the first invocation. It turns out the shebangs were written with <code>.../python</code> but on a subsequent invocation the <code>sys.executable</code> was <code>.../python3</code> so we didn't detect these as matching.</p>
<p>This is a pretty naive fix, but it seems much easier than ensuring the entry point path exactly matches the subsequent <code>sys.executable</code> we find.</p>
<p>I guess we should fix this in reverse too? but I think we might always prefer <code>python3</code> when loading interpreters from environments.</p>
<p>See #14790 for more background.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks right to me!</p>
<p>To confirm my understanding, here's the old behavior:</p>
<pre><code># OK, rewritten correctly
# previous_executable: /some/random/python3
#!/some/random/python3

# BUG, not rewritten correctly
# previous_executable: /some/random/python3
#!/some/random/python
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas the new behavior would rewrite both of these to <code>/some/new/python3</code>, correct?</p>
