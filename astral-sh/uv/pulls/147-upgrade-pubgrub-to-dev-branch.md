# Upgrade PubGrub to dev branch

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-20 03:18_

Updates to `29c48fb9f3daa11bd02794edd55060d0b01ee705` from the `pubgrub-rs` dev branch. This lets us reduce the number of changes we've made to PubGrub itself (now, only changing visibility to export a few things from the `solver.rs` module).
