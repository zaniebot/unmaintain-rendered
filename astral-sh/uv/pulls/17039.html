            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Remove duplication in <code>report_dry_run</code> by making <code>Changelog</code> support both local and remote dists. This is in support of #16653 and will form a new basis for #16981.</p>
<p>This also involved refactoring <code>InstallLogger</code> and its implementations to support dry run logging.</p>
<p>Additionally includes some minor refactoring in <code>SummaryInstallLogger</code> and a fix to <code>InstalledVersion</code>.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/tk/dry-run-refactor for an alternative approach (although obviously comes with some caveats).</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>There are already quite a few tests which cover the output and they pass. Manual testing was used to ensure styling stayed consistent.</p>
