            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This fixes a bug introduced by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/5232">astral-sh/uv#5232</a>. It turns out that the <code>universal_disjoint_base_or_local_requirement</code> test does not actually do what it was meant to because of the incorrect python requirement. With a valid python requirement, it fails on <code>main</code>. The problem is that we try to exclude the original base version from the range of allowed versions to try and prefer local versions. However, in the test, there is a branch that depends on the non-local version, with no applicable local in its fork. We should remove this exclusion as prioritization is handled by the candidate resolver.</p>
