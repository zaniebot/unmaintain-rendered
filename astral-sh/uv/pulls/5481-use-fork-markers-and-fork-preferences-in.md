# Use fork markers and fork preferences in resolution with lockfile

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2024-07-26 13:18_

By resolving for each fork from the lockfile individually and by adding using preferences for the current fork, we solve the instability #5180. I've tested the locally and will add the packse test scenarios upstack.
