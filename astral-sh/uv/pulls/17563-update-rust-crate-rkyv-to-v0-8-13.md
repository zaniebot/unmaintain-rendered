Supposedly
                           
>  - #[allow(clippy::struct_field_names)] applies to the original struct (WheelTagSmall)     
>  - #[rkyv(attr(allow(...)))] applies to the generated struct (ArchivedWheelTagSmall)       
>                                                                                            
>  Without the rkyv attr, clippy complains about the generated archived struct's field names.
>   I tested removing it and clippy failed.
