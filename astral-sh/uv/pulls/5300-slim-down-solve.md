# Slim down `solve`

---

_@konstin_

Our everything-method `solve` tends to grow large, so before i'm adding more logic, i'm moving some code and some logging statements around to keep it manageable.

I made minor changes to the logging, otherwise no logic changes, only refactoring.

As long as there are no behavior changes, seems fine to me.
