            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This pull request adds an example of a GitLab release job to the integration docs.</p>
<p>How to publish to the GitLab registry with <code>uv publish</code> was discussed in issue <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9195#issuecomment-2483840918">#9195</a>, including a suggestion to show an example in the docs, which has not happened yet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it took a bit of effort to combine the following for a uv workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish all packages to GitLab PyPI registry (as explained in the issue linked above)</li>
<li>Create one release item (using the GitLab CI release block)</li>
<li>Link wheel files in PyPI registry to the release using assets-links (<code>uv publish</code> knows, but does not provide those links)</li>
</ul>
<p>An example in the docs might be very helpful for others who want to publish and use code from their GitLab registry.</p>
