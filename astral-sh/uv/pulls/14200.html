            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, this fell of my review queue.</p>
<p>I fixed a bug when there's both a trailing comment on the last item and on the array, but there's still a bug with complex comments (<code>remove_handle_oddly_placed_trailing_comma</code>). I don't really understand where it comes from, it works in a scratch project with only <code>prepare_comments_for_removal</code>.</p>
