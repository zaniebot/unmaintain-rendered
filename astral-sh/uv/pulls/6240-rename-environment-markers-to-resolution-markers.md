# Rename `environment-markers` to `resolution-markers`

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

I probably won't land https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6210 for the release, but I do want to make one breaking change to prep for it: renaming `environment-markers` to `resolution-markers` (or `solution-markers`?) so that it's delineated from the user-defined markers in that PR.

Makes sense to me, but I'm probably not the relevant stakeholder.

Konsti gave it a thumbs-up in the other PR so I feel alright with it. But I kind of feel like "solution-markers" is more accurate.
