            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe the PubGrub &quot;root&quot; package is intentionally <code>None</code> when you're working in a project. Instead, the root has a dependency on all of the workspace members. This modeling is important for the resolver in some ways I don't fully understand, but we workaround this in the error reports:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/5e1b9b196495aea2f0f39fdd4a016471c440bba7/crates/uv-resolver/src/pubgrub/report.rs#L361-L368</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/4ff057e108a50b2c82dba3c8bf6e38e1c74bc006/crates/uv-resolver/src/error.rs#L619-L626</p>
<p>I think adding the name here would be confusing, since we'd have <code>Root(&quot;my-project&quot;) -&gt; Package(&quot;my-project&quot;)</code> in the tree?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What you say makes plenty of sense in the context of workspaces with packages, and I'm inclined to drop this PR as it may have some side-effect implications that I currently can't fully evaluate.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is notable that this is the only invocation of <code>pip::operations::resolve()</code> explicitly without a project.
All the other 5 occurrences do forward a project name, and in virtually all the cases it seems that the source of that value can be traced back to this:
