            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This adds a deprecation warning for source distributions that don't follow the PEP 625 filename scheme, which requires a <code>.tar.gz</code> suffix. I've also updated the docs with a warning about behavior + deprecation notice.</p>
<p>Towards #16911.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>The only functional change here is a user-level warning. I'll bump the snapshots that change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Noting: I put this warning at the sdist filename parsing layer to start, but that's going to be <em>way</em> too noisy since it'll ding on every legacy sdist on PyPI (and there are a lot of them in the tail of popular projects). I think the better place to put this is in the installation planner, and limit it to just to-be-fetched remote dists.</p>
<p>Edit: more precisely, <code>build_wheel</code> seems like the right place, since it's where we actually use a given selected sdist and materialize it into a wheel.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One option is to warn specifically when we unpack an xz/lzma source dist, where we could also do this for xz/lzma wheels, another is checking after resolution or after loading a lockfile for the files in the resolution type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have it in <code>build_wheel</code> locally ATM, just waiting for tests for complete. Does that seem like a reasonable place to you? My intuition is that that's a good place in terms of balancing noise/actionability (and making it clear that this specific deprecation is about sdists), but I could move it to the unpacking or lockfile layers if you think that makes more sense!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh, I didn't realize we actually allowed wheels to also be xz/lzma 😅 -- I was looking at <code>WheelFilename</code> and could only find <code>.whl</code>, which should always imply ZIP unless we're doing something more nuanced under the hood?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>zips can use a number of compression options, such as stored (no compression), DEFLATE (the default) but also LZMA. There's a list unter &quot;Compression method&quot; in https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html. There's nothing that says what kind of zips the wheel are, but generally, they are either DEFLATE (basically all published zips) or stored (e.g. for editables).</p>

<p>Ah yeah, sorry -- I misunderstood you to be saying that <code>.whl</code> could sometimes by a <code>.tar.xz</code>, not a ZIP with a different interior compression for a specific entry.</p>
<p>So, there are two distinct things we want to warn on/deprecate:</p>
<ol>
<li>We want to deprecate non-PEP 625 sdists</li>
<li>We want to deprecate non-DEFLATE/stored file entries in ZIPs (which will typically be wheels, but could also be sdists right now)</li>
</ol>
<p>This PR is focusing on (1) right now, but I could also do (2) (or in a follow-up).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(1) is definitely a good unit to merge on it's own. I'm mainly bringing up (2) cause we also need it to remove the xz/lzma dependencies.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was thinking about that, and I think the filename might not be super useful information to a user who sees this: the average sdist consumer is <em>probably</em> getting one via an index resolution, so showing them <code>wsgiref-0.1.2.zip</code> isn't going to mean much to them (whereas <code>wsgiref==0.1.2</code> at least tells them that it's a post-resolution candidate, so they could change it by updating their constraints).</p>
<p>But I'm speculating, if you think the filename is helpful here I'll change!</p>

<p>Unless you want to change the error in the case where the user has not requested a file directly, which may be better. In that case, I think we'd change the whole error message to be something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{package}=={version} uses a legacy source distribution format (<code>.zip</code>) that is not compliant with the specification in PEP 625. A future version of uv will .... Consider upgrading to a newer version of {package}</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah yeah, that's a good point. I'll add the filename.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to keep it as a single warning for both direct and indirect resolved candidates, since I think in both cases it's not super directly actionable. Although now that I say that I guess it <em>is</em> actionable when the user does e.g. a GitHub zipball, so maybe that deserves a discrete warning. I'll look at that tomorrow.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, there's lots of potential nuance. The &quot;good&quot; news is that the legacy sdists on the index <em>should</em> generally be pretty old (as in 2016 or earlier), meaning that they shouldn't be selected as candidates super often. <code>wsgiref==0.1.2</code> is from 2006, for example -- I'm actually shocked that installs at all 😅</p>
