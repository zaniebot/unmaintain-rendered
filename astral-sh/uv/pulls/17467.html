            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This adds a deprecation warning for source distributions that don't follow the PEP 625 filename scheme, which requires a <code>.tar.gz</code> suffix. I've also updated the docs with a warning about behavior + deprecation notice.</p>
<p>Towards #16911.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>The only functional change here is a user-level warning. I'll bump the snapshots that change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Noting: I put this warning at the sdist filename parsing layer to start, but that's going to be <em>way</em> too noisy since it'll ding on every legacy sdist on PyPI (and there are a lot of them in the tail of popular projects). I think the better place to put this is in the installation planner, and limit it to just to-be-fetched remote dists.</p>
<p>Edit: more precisely, <code>build_wheel</code> seems like the right place, since it's where we actually use a given selected sdist and materialize it into a wheel.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One option is to warn specifically when we unpack an xz/lzma source dist, where we could also do this for xz/lzma wheels, another is checking after resolution or after loading a lockfile for the files in the resolution type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have it in <code>build_wheel</code> locally ATM, just waiting for tests for complete. Does that seem like a reasonable place to you? My intuition is that that's a good place in terms of balancing noise/actionability (and making it clear that this specific deprecation is about sdists), but I could move it to the unpacking or lockfile layers if you think that makes more sense!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh, I didn't realize we actually allowed wheels to also be xz/lzma 😅 -- I was looking at <code>WheelFilename</code> and could only find <code>.whl</code>, which should always imply ZIP unless we're doing something more nuanced under the hood?</p>
