# Refactor `uv-toolchain` types

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-06-07 00:09_

Extends #4120 
Part of #2607 

There should be no behavior changes here. Restructures the discovery API to be focused on a toolchain first perspective in preparation for exposing a `find_or_fetch` method for toolchains in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4138.
