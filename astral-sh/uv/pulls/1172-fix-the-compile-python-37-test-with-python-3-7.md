# Fix the `compile_python_37` test with python 3.7 installed

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2024-01-29 16:41_

Make the test `compile_python_37` pass whether python 3.7 is installed or not by muting the warning for a missing 3.7. The resolution error is independent of whether 3.7 is installed or not.
