### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>hyperium/http (http)</summary>

### [`v1.1.0`](https://togithub.com/hyperium/http/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#110-March-4-2024)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/hyperium/http/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)

-   Add methods to allow trying to allocate in the `HeaderMap`, returning an error if oversize instead of panicking.
-   Add `Extensions::get_or_insert()` method.
-   Implement `From<Uri>` for `uri::Builder`.
-   Fix `HeaderName::from_lowercase` that could allow NUL bytes in some cases.

### [`v1.0.0`](https://togithub.com/hyperium/http/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#100-November-15-2023)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/hyperium/http/compare/v0.2.12...v1.0.0)

-   Implement `Clone` for `Request`, `Response`, and `Extensions`. This breaking change requires
    that all extensions now implement `Clone`.
-   Add a default-on `std` feature. Disabling it currently is not supported.
-   Fix MIRI warnings in `HeaderMap::iter()`.

</details>

### ⚠ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package http@0.2.12 --precise 1.1.0
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `http = "^0.2"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 1.1.0
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `reqwest v0.11.26`
    ... which satisfies dependency `reqwest = "^0.11.23"` (locked to 0.11.26) of package `uv-git v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv-git)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `uv-git` (locked to 0.0.1) of package `distribution-types v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/distribution-types)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

```
