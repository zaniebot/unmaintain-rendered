            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The docs for <code>requirements.in</code> currently wrongly refer to <code>requirements.txt</code> in the first sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Using requirements.in</h3>
<p>It is also common to use a lightweight <strong>requirements.txt</strong> format to declare the dependencies for the project. Each requirement is defined on its own line. Commonly, this file is called requirements.in to distinguish it from requirements.txt which is used for the locked dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The occurrence in bold should be <strong>requirements.in</strong> instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is actually intentional -- <code>requirements.txt</code> refers to both the conventional filename <em>and</em> the name of the format itself, so what the docs are saying is that there's a file named <code>requirements.in</code> that's in <code>requirements.txt</code> format.</p>

<p>I can see how it could be intended to read like that, but when I read this paragraph the first time that's definitely not how it parsed for me. In this part of the docs, there has also been no prior explanation about the &quot;requirements.txt format&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe the text could still be updated somehow to avoid confusion. Maybe something like</p>

<p>It is also common to use a lightweight <code>requirements.txt</code>-like format</p>

<p>Anyway, feel free to close if you want to keep as-is, ofc!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I completely agree it's confusing 😅 -- maybe we could link to pip's documentation for this, since I think that's the canonical source for the format:</p>
<p>https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/</p>
<p>Also, I apologize -- I thought the actual name of the format was <code>requirements.txt</code>, but pip calls it the &quot;requirements file format&quot; or &quot;requirements file&quot;. My bad!</p>
<p>I'll make a suggestion on top of your PR for that.</p>
