# Add Python 3.13 system test for Linux

---

_@zanieb_

Previously we only had coverage on Windows

e.g. for more test coverage in cases like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7300#discussion_r1755343870

I picked Linux over macOS because the 3.13 prereleases are not available via HomeBrew?
