### [`v0.13.3`](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0133---2025-12-17)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/compare/0.13.2...0.13.3)

##### Changed

- [PR#90](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/pull/90) changed this crate to default to `no_std`, unless the `detection` feature is enabled, closing [PR#89](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/pull/89). Thanks [@&#8203;so-rose](https://redirect.github.com/so-rose)!
- [PR#91](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/pull/91) changed the license terms from `MIT OR Apache2.0` to just `Apache-2.0`, as [PR#84](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/pull/84) merged external code that was only licensed under `Apache-2.0`. See [#&#8203;88](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/spdx/pull/88) for the original raising of this mismatch.
