<p>Improve the docs and make getting started easier. Move the comments on which environment/tool to use out of the code blocks so you can copy and paste directly into the terminal</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Retried and it worked. Looked at the previous failure and I had a lingering character that I missed. I prefer to copy/paste without the comment, but that's just personal preference. It's your repo, so happy to close this</p>
