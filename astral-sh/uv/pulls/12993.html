            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It <em>seems</em> like this should be composable using a single error variant and an enum for displaying the names, but... it's also fine if you think that's not worth it since these should be static. I do think if we want to handle this error downstream at some point, it'll be annoying it's not a single error variant.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I did consider this... Basically, we'd use a different representation for the <code>pylock.toml</code> types, and treat the current representations as &quot;wire&quot; types. So we'd do all this validation at deserialization time, and we'd never have to do this kind of thing in our own code. That's roughly what we do in our own <code>uv.lock</code> logic. But... it's kind of a lot of work, and it didn't really seem worth it honestly. There's also some benefit to having a single set of structs that exactly match the spec.</p>
