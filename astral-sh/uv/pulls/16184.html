<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Opening this as more of a discussion. A friend of mine (who is not super familiar with programming) started using <code>uv</code> and for his project he is using inline metadata in every script, presumably because this feature is mentioned in the documentation first.</p>
<p>Personally I do not think you should use this, except in niche use cases (like downloading a single script from the internet). Mainly because VSCode does not support it, whereas a regular project's <code>.venv</code> is automatically recognized. I would propose moving the discussion about projects earlier in the documentation, to indicate that this is the recommended path in most use cases.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Not relevant.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I understand the idea, but I do not think 'increasing complexity' is the right sort order here. In my experience, users do not read the documentation back to back, they read until they find what they <em>think</em> are looking for and then close it. The best practice should be first, the rest might as well not exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're hoping widespread editor support for inline metadata isn't far off!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the present moment this is not supported. The current situation already led to a concrete user doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>uv add --script foo.py requests</code> because it is mentioned first in the documentation</li>
<li>Open the folder in VS Code</li>
<li>Complain that the dependencies are not detected correctly</li>
<li>Create their own venv or doing some other blind workarounds until the editor works, completely defeating the point of using <code>uv</code> in the first place</li>
</ol>
<p>I honestly have no idea how VSCode will ever support <code>uv</code>here (since there is no mention of <code>uv</code> in the script and there is no project), but I digress...</p>

<p>The metadata format in the script is a Python standard that was approved in Jan 2024 https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/</p>
<p>Editor support <em>is</em> coming — we're working with the VS Code team.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think inline metadata is the current best practice for scripts. I think we'll just continue to invest in improving the editor experience then document that.</p>
