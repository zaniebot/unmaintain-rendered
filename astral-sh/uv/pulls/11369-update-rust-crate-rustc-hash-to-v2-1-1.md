### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/rustc-hash (rustc-hash)</summary>

### [`v2.1.1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#211)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1)

-   Change the internal algorithm to better accomodate large hashmaps.
    This mitigates a [regression with 2.0 in rustc](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/135477).
    See [PR#55](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash/pull/55) for more details on the change (this PR was not merged).
    This problem might be improved with changes to hashbrown in the future.

#### 2.1.0

-   Implement `Clone` for `FxRandomState`
-   Implement `Clone` for `FxSeededState`
-   Use SPDX license expression in license field

#### 2.0.0

-   Replace hash with faster and better finalized hash.
    This replaces the previous "fxhash" algorithm originating in Firefox
    with a custom hasher designed and implemented by Orson Peters ([`@orlp`](https://redirect.github.com/orlp)).
    It was measured to have slightly better performance for rustc, has better theoretical properties
    and also includes a significantly better string hasher.
-   Fix `no_std` builds

#### 1.2.0 (**YANKED**)

**Note: This version has been yanked due to issues with the `no_std` feature!**

-   Add a `FxBuildHasher` unit struct
-   Improve documentation
-   Add seed API for supplying custom seeds other than 0
-   Add `FxRandomState` based on `rand` (behind the `rand` feature) for random seeds
-   Make many functions `const fn`
-   Implement `Clone` for `FxHasher` struct
