Let's just say "installed projects into". The "such projects" seems overkill.

Should we say "build and install" here? We don't talk about "packaging" much above anymore.

Should we clarify in a bullet that we still install the projects dependencies?

"Previously, uv required that all projects could be built into distributable Python packages, and installed them into the virtual environment"

Just feeling around here.. should probably drop the virtual workspace root thing too confusing now.
