### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>ibraheemdev/boxcar (boxcar)</summary>

### [`v0.2.13`](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar/releases/tag/v0.2.13): 0.2.13

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar/compare/v0.2.12...v0.2.13)

-   Fix a bug where `T: !Send` elements could inadvertently be transferred across threads through a `&boxcar::Vec<T>`. This release adds a `T: Send` requirement to `Vec<T>: Sync`, which is technically a breaking change, but required for soundness ([https://github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar/pull/34](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar/pull/34)).
-   Fix a bug where iterator over a `Vec` could sometimes stop early and break linearizability. `Iter` is now documented to be fused on creation and will not continue to yield concurrently inserted elements ([https://github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar/pull/33](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/boxcar/pull/33)).
