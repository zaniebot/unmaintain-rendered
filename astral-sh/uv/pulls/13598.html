            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Ephemeral environments created by <code>uv run --with</code> extend a parent (virtual or system) environment by adding a <code>.pth</code> file to the ephemeral environment&#x27;s <code>site-packages</code> directory. The <code>pth</code> file contains Python code to dynamically add the parent environment&#x27;s <code>site-packages</code> directory to Python&#x27;s import search paths in addition to the ephemeral environment&#x27;s <code>site-packages</code> directory. This works well at runtime, but is not currently understood by static analysis tools like ty.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/320">astral-sh/ty#320</a>, ty <em>could</em> implement support for these virtual environments by attempting to parse the Python code uv is writing into these <code>.pth</code> files. This has many disadvantages however:</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems somewhat error-prone. The specific Python code uv is writing into the <code>.pth</code> files could change at any time -- and if another tool implements a similar ephemeral-environment feature, it could use different Python idioms.</li>
<li>It would not be particularly efficient for ty to have to attempt to parse Python snippets in every <code>.pth</code> file in the <code>site-packages</code> directory (it could hurt our ability to effectively implement a persistent cache even if it doesn&#x27;t cost that much in wall time, since we need to know the import search paths very early on).</li>
<li>Philosophically, it feels out of spirit with the kind of analysis a static type checker should be expected to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, this PR implements a feature where uv additionally writes the <code>sys.prefix</code> of the parent environment to a new <code>extends-environment</code> key of the ephemeral environment&#x27;s <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file. This should make it much easier for ty -- and potentially other static-analysis tools -- to statically and reliably understand the relationship between the two environments. If ty sees that a <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file has a <code>uv</code> key in it and also has a <code>extends-environment</code> key in it, it will be able to easily add the <code>site-packages</code> directory of the parent environment to its resolved search paths as well as the <code>site-packages</code> directory of the ephemeral child environment.</p>
<p>A question was raised in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/320">astral-sh/ty#320</a>#issuecomment-2877865480 about whether it was standards-compliant to add new keys to <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> files created by uv. I think it is. <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> files are in general very under-specified: only a small handful of keys are currently consistent between virtual-environment creation tools. Different tools already often add bespoke keys to their <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> files -- see <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/320">astral-sh/ty#320</a>#issuecomment-2877881334 for some comparisons between uv, the virtualenv Python library, and the standard-library <code>venv</code> module.</p>
Test Plan
<p>I added a test that demonstrates that the <code>extends-environment</code> key is written with the correct value to the <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file of an ephemeral environment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Argh, well, it seems I need some help with getting the venv directory filtering to work on Windows. (I haven&#x27;t actually changed anything to do with the filtering there -- not sure why it&#x27;s not working on this snapshot?)</p>
<p>Other than that, this is ready for review!</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever filtered <code>escape_for_python</code> paths (which I guess differ on Windows).</p>
