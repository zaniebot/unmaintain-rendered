<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a proof of concept for updating uv installations that were installed using the system default pip. e.g. <code>pip install uv</code>.</p>
<p>Code is a little rough right now and is not implemented for pipx installations. I wanted to first discuses this implementation before going forward. So thorough review is appreciated!</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I was unsure how to make a unit test for this but currently tested using the following commands:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">pip install .
uv self update
</code></pre>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, and sorry for not looking at this earlier! In general, we don't want to self-modify uv in an environment that is not managed by us. If you install uv with e.g. poetry, poetry has a lockfile with the version of uv to be installed and we should not self-update and create a mismatch with the lockfile. For e.g. <code>pipx install uv</code>, pipx has it's own upgrade mechanism and we shouldn't interfere with that. Thanks for contributing, but i'm afraid it's not something we can merge.</p>
