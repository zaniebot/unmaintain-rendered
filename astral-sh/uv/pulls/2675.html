Summary
<p>This is a proof of concept for updating uv installations that were installed using the system default pip. e.g. <code>pip install uv</code>.</p>
<p>Code is a little rough right now and is not implemented for pipx installations. I wanted to first discuses this implementation before going forward. So thorough review is appreciated!</p>


Test Plan
<p>I was unsure how to make a unit test for this but currently tested using the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>pip install .
uv self update
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, and sorry for not looking at this earlier! In general, we don&#x27;t want to self-modify uv in an environment that is not managed by us. If you install uv with e.g. poetry, poetry has a lockfile with the version of uv to be installed and we should not self-update and create a mismatch with the lockfile. For e.g. <code>pipx install uv</code>, pipx has it&#x27;s own upgrade mechanism and we shouldn&#x27;t interfere with that. Thanks for contributing, but i&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s not something we can merge.</p>
