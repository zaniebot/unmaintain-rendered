            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Add a script and associated CI check that checks whether a new uv build can use the cache of the previous uv version. This prevents accidental changes to cache keys, e.g. by changing nested data structures.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve tested the script by using a previous change of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16143">astral-sh/uv#16143</a>.</p>
<p>The check can be disabled with a PR label for PRs that change the cache layout. What&#x27;s missing here is that the base is the last release, meaning that once a PR with that label merges, all following PRs will fail this check, as we currently don&#x27;t have a good way to ask whether there was a change previously or to download the latest build binary from main as baseline.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m taking suggestions if someone has ideas how we can solve the previously-PR-changes the cache problem.</p>
<p>We can check the GitHub API if any PR merged between last release and base had the cache-change label, but that sounds complex, and doesn&#x27;t capture repeat changes in other PRs. Another option is storing the latest binary builds from main as nightly somewhere.</p>

<p>I kinda like this. Also independently useful.</p>
<p>Another idea: what about cloning current <code>main</code> in this CI job and building a <code>debug</code> binary of uv on-the-fly to test against?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>CI performance mainly, but you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s a very straightforward solution.</p>
