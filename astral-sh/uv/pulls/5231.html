            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The current code was checking every constraint against every requirement, regardless of whether they were applicable. In general, this isn't a big deal, because this method is only used as a fast-path to skip resolution -- so we just had way more false-negatives than we should've when constraints were applied. But it's clearly wrong :)</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>uv venv</code></li>
<li><code>uv pip install flask</code></li>
<li><code>uv pip install --verbose flask -c constraints.txt</code> (with <code>numpy&lt;1.0</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to this change, Flask was reported as not satisfied.</p>
