            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Create a newtype <code>struct PubGrubRange(pubgrub::range::Range&lt;Version&gt;)</code> to avoid overriding the <code>Display</code> implementation on <code>Range</code> in pubgrub itself, reducing our diff with upstream. Used methods taking an <code>&amp;Self</code> or returning <code>Self</code> were overridden, the rest of the methods succeeds through deref.</p>
<p>An additional advantage is that we can start using the range type in more places without depending on pubgrub directly (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4041">astral-sh/uv#4041</a>).</p>
<p>The alternative would be moving range formatting into the error formatter, but this would make pubgrub&#x27;s api strange, deviating from rust&#x27;s <code>Display</code> standard.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We discussed this in Discord and we both think this is a lot of boilerplate and a bit of an ugly solution but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better way if you want the ergonomics of <code>Display</code>. The alternative is probably relying on a PubGrub formatter method that we call into explicitly? I am not sure resolving this divergence from upstream is necessarily worth the added code here. It seems like we&#x27;d be taking on <em>more</em> maintenance burden to keep our wrapper type up to date. However, @konstin mentioned wanting to use PubGrub ranges outside the resolver which may justify the effort?</p>

<p>cc @BurntSushi I feel like we were recently talking about using <code>Range</code> outside the resolver</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I hadn&#x27;t seen this PR before.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the added code here is fine and I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to reduce our pubgrub diff as much as possible with upstream.</p>
<p>With that said, my understanding is that we want to use <em>something like</em> a pubgrub <code>Range</code> outside of <code>uv-resolver</code> in <code>uv-pep508</code> for the <code>MarkerTree</code> implementation. I believe there was talk of making a new crate that both upstream pubgrub depends on and we depend on that exposes a <code>Range</code> type.</p>
