### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.1.10`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0110-2024-08-23)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.9...0.1.10)

\===================
This release features a small bug fix where Jiff will detect an IANA time
zone identifier in some cases where it wouldn't before. While Jiff would
previously read the symlink metadata on `/etc/localtime` by default to discover
the system configured time zone on Unix systems, it *wouldn't* do so when
`TZ=/etc/localtime`. There's really no reason not to, so this release of Jiff
is fixed to use symlink sniffing on file paths provided by thw `TZ` environment
variable.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;113](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/113):
    When `TZ=/etc/localtime`, use symlink metadata to detect IANA identifier.

### [`v0.1.9`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#019-2024-08-23)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.8...0.1.9)

\==================
This release introduces new options for controlling the precision
of fractional seconds when printing `Zoned`, `Timestamp`,
`civil::DateTime` or `civil::Time` values. This is principally exposed
via `jiff::fmt::temporal::DateTimePrinter::precision`, but it's also
available via the standard library's formatting machinery. For example,
if `zdt` is a `jiff::Zoned`, then `format!("{zdt:.6}")` will format
it into a string with microsecond precision, even if its fractional
component is zero.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;92](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/92):
    Support setting the precision of fractional seconds when printing datetimes.

### [`v0.1.8`](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#018-2024-08-19)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.7...0.1.8)

\==================
This releases fixes a build error in Jiff's `alloc`-only configuration. This
regression was introduced in `jiff 0.1.6`.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;108](https://togithub.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/108):
    Use `core::time::Duration` everywhere instead of `std::time::Duration`.
