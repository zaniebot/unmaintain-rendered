<p>Nobody seems to have a good idea about how to spell this. &quot;not free-threaded&quot; would be the most technically correct, but I think &quot;gil&quot; will be more intuitive.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems fine. I think there is no obviously good syntax for this and we do need <em>something</em>, and this seems like the least annoying one / closest to what we already do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the best name, since the GIL can be enabled in free-threaded Python during runtime and is enabled when importing C-API extension modules. Maybe <code>+default</code> might be a good name?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s why I said &quot;not free-threaded&quot; would be the most technically correct in the pull request body.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think <code>+default</code> works, it&#x27;s not specific enough. e.g., imagine a world where the free-threaded builds become the default and there&#x27;s a legacy GIL-enabled build around. I guess we could have the <code>+default</code> modifier change its meaning depending on the Python version, but that seems questionable.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d love a better name, but I can&#x27;t really think of one and want to ship something to unblock users. I think <code>+gil</code> is the most obvious name that someone would look for, even if there&#x27;s some technical nuance.</p>
<p>I tried asking the free-threaded development group and didn&#x27;t really get anywhere.</p>
