            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't fully follow the distinction you're referencing but we never pass the <code>--prerelease</code> flag to source distribution builds. Specifically, when we resolve <code>build-system.requires</code>, we don't propagate <code>--prerelease</code>, <code>--resolution</code>, or <code>--no-deps</code>. That applies to <em>all</em> source distribution builds (but <em>only</em> to the <code>build-system.requires</code>, like <code>requires = [&quot;setuptools&gt;=40.8.0&quot;]</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the linked issue, we failed to resolve <code>requires = [&quot;setuptools&gt;=40.8.0&quot;]</code> when building some package. We then recommended passing <code>--prerelease=allow</code>, but doing so has no effect.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We removed that propagation in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1607 if you want to see a few linked issues. I think it's unclear whether <code>--prerelease</code> should be propagated (<code>--resolution</code> definitely should not, I think that one is much clearer), but it's reasonable for it <em>not</em> to be IMO.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah thanks for clarifying. I somehow missed that we're talking about an error when resolving <em>build requirements</em>. Hence my extreme confusion and dumb questions. This change makes a ton of sense. Can you rephrase the title to make it a bit more obvious? Like...</p>

<p>Don't recommend <code>--prerelease=allow</code> during build requirement resolution errors</p>
