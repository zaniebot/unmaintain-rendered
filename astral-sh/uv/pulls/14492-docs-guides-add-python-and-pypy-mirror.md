# docs(guides): Add Python and PyPy mirror configuration

---

_Pull request opened by @FishAlchemist on 2025-07-07 19:58_

## Summary

Adds a new section to `guides/install-python.md` explaining how to configure alternative download sources (mirrors) for Python and PyPy distributions. 
I considered including examples, but ultimately chose to use a link pointing to a centralized example.

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan
Running a document server locally in strict mode.
