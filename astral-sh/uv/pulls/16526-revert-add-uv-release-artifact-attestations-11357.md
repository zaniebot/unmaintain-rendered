# Revert "Add uv release artifact attestations (#11357)"

_@Gankra_

This reverts commit f3d3203734436d5cbc2e539d2e2c7c672b9274e3.

A new cargo-dist release is needed to fix this functionality, which I'll do later tonight.

closing in favour of upstream cargo-dist fixes (we manually finished up the broken release)
