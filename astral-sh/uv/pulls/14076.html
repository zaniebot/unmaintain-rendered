            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When using <code>uv lock --upgrade-package=python</code> after changing
<code>requires-python</code>, it was possible to get into a state where the fork
markers produced corresponded to the empty set. This in turn resulted in
an empty lock file.</p>
<p>There was already some infrastructure in place that I think was perhaps
intended to handle this. In particular, <code>Lock::check_marker_coverage</code>
checks whether the fork markers have some overlap with the supported
environments (including the <code>requires-python</code>). But there were two
problems with this.</p>
<p>First is that in lock validation, this marker coverage check came
<em>after</em> a path that returned <code>Preferable</code> (meaning that the fork markers
should be kept) when <code>--upgrade-package</code> was used. Second is that the
marker coverage check used the <code>requires-python</code> in the lock file and
<em>not</em> the <code>requires-python</code> in the now updated <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>We attempt to solve this conundrum by slightly re-arranging lock file
validation and by explicitly checking whether the <em>new</em>
<code>requires-python</code> is disjoint from the fork markers in the lock file. If
it is, then we return <code>Versions</code> from lock file validation (indicating
that the fork markers should be dropped).</p>
<p>Fixes #13951</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, are you sure this should be a user-facing warning? I don’t think any of the other lockfile-invalidation messages are user-facing. They just go through tracing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I didn&#x27;t do that. That&#x27;s what is on <code>main</code>: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/5c1ebf902bad2ed8058b57deaca9645de1286eca/crates/uv/src/commands/project/lock.rs#L1026-L1034</p>
<p>It looks like it was a user facing warning from the beginning: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10682">astral-sh/uv#10682</a></p>
<p>I in turn copied this to the disjoint <code>requires-python</code> check as well. Do you want me to make both of them traces instead?</p>
