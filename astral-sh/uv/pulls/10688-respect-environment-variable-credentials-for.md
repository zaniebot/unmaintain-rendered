# Respect environment variable credentials for indexes outside root

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-01-16 17:37_

## Summary

We now respect environment variable-based authentication when the explicit index is defined outside of the workspace root. This applies to both local and Git-based projects.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10680.
