# Add transformers `pyproject.toml` to test requirements

---

_@konstin_

This `pyproject.toml`, translated from https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/0e4a1c3401421d3342938a183c7b021cdac6fd79/setup.py, has found a number of bugs in blue jay, so i'm adding it to uv as a development test case. (The file is too large to make it a test by itself.)
