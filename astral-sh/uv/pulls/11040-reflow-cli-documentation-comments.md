# Reflow CLI documentation comments

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2025-01-28 20:52_

I'm sorry, but I was writing some new content here and the inconsistent wrapping was very hard to maintain and I didn't want to muddy the diff there with reflowing.

I don't think we need to be strict about the reflow (I'm not sure we even can be) but some of these were very far off from our typical wrap length.
