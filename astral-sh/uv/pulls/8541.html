            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p><code>uv sync</code> CLI command now respects <code>UV_SYNC_ALL_EXTRAS</code> environment variable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is can also add a config option if you think it makes sense to have one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why are you making multiple invocations where <code>--all-extras</code> matters? Just trying to understand the use-case because this isn't the kind of thing we've been exposing as an environment variable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think the use cases are super solid. It's more like a nice to have feature.</p>
<p>Imo ideally all CLI arguments should have corresponding env variables. Is your opinion different or you are just looking for clarification?</p>
<p>This just make usage easier in some (probably rare) cases: doing multiple invocations with other arguments varying in docker/CI, controlling this behavior in CI pipelines without changing the CLI command (CI pipelines often pass env variables to each other), setting a development default for a project (what actually made me start this PR).</p>
<p>The latter should really be a config parameter tho, but as a Rust newbee I decided to start from something more straightforward like an env variable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is actually against our philosophy. I don't think every CLI argument should have a corresponding variable — only ones that configure something you'd commonly want to set as persistent state.</p>
<p>It sounds more like your use-case here would be solved by a <code>default-extras</code> setting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think so --- originally I needed this when building a docker image for a uv workspace with multiple internal extras. So I didn't want this to be a part of the global config, but rather a one time settings just for the docker image.</p>
