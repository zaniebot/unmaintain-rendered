            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Was reading this code while looking at adding PEP 792 support and noticed these: by using the borrowing deserializer instead of the owning one, we can probably save a good number of small-ish String allocations in the <code>PypiFile</code> and <code>PyxFile</code> deserializers.</p>
<p>(These deserializers in turn are probably pretty hot, since large installations/resolutions require pulling lots of candidates from indices.)</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>No functional change expected; I'm not sure what the best way to microbenchmark this is. I'll try and contrive something locally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note: I realized after-the-fact that this <em>could</em> be subtly incorrect. For example, sometimes serde can't borrow a string because it needs to de-escape it from its JSON or other serialized form.</p>
<p>In <em>practice</em> that's probably fine in this context, since we don't really expect any weird escaping to happen on these key names. But it means that we can't just go around swapping <code>&lt;String&gt;</code> for <code>&lt;&amp;str&gt;</code> with full generality.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that would be the most correct/general solution! I think we could probably do the same for every callsite of <code>String::deserialize</code> as well, although some of those may not meaningfully benefit from saving a copy if we need an owned String anyways.</p>
<p>For example, <code>impl&lt;'a&gt; serde::Deserialize&lt;'a&gt; for PythonRequest</code> can probably be cow'd.</p>
