            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When adding a local package with an absolute path like <code>uv add /path/to/package</code>, keep it absolute instead of converting to relative. Relative paths stay relative.</p>
<p>Fixes #17307</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given that we now have 4 places where we are doing this, I think it&#x27;s may be a candidate for just having a function. Something which also incorporates this logic:</p>
<pre><code>if was_absolute_path(&amp;url) {
    std::path::absolute(&amp;install_path)
} else {
    relative_to(&amp;install_path, root)
        .or_else(|_| std::path::absolute(&amp;install_path))
}
</code></pre>
<p>So the call sites can just become <code>absolute_or_relative_to(instal_path, root, url).map_err(...)?</code>.</p>
<p>Not sure about the name or location, will get back to you on that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve had a look around / and manually tested some corner cases and it seems like this approach should work for the forward path. But...</p>
<p>There&#x27;s places where we make up a <code>PathBuiltDist</code> on the spot e.g.:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/cd55d1ce120f3c4dfe37a9df563e97e25914e1ba/crates/uv-resolver/src/lock/mod.rs#L2805-L2809</p>
<p>And it seems like this change might end up with us getting absolute paths in places where previously we would want relative ones.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t found a case like that yet, but it may be worth changing the tests where the snapshots have changed to using relative paths instead, just to see if it shakes out a case like this.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#x27;m not experienced enough in this area of the code to be sure if this is the best approach for this. I&#x27;ll let others comment though.</p>
