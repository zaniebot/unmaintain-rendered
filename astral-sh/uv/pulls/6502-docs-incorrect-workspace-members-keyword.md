# docs: Incorrect workspace members keyword

---

_Pull request opened by @aborgna-q on 2024-08-23 09:41_

## Summary

Small keyword fix. In the `concepts/dependencies` documentation, the workspace example listed members under an invalid `tool.uv.workspace.include` field.

This PR changes the key to [`tool.uv.workspace.members`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#workspace_members) instead.
