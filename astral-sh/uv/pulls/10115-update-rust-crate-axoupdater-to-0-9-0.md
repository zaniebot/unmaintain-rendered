### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>axodotdev/axoupdater (axoupdater)</summary>

### [`v0.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-090-2024-12-19)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/compare/v0.8.2...v0.9.0)

This release adds support for `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` as the location for install
receipts. If this variable is set and the receipt is located within this path,
it overrides the default location of `$HOME/.config` (Mac and Linux) or
`%LOCALAPPDATA%` (Windows). Install receipts will be created in this path when
running installers created by dist 0.27.0 or later if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set.

This release also adds infrastructure to support app renaming when running as
a library. There are two new features:

-   It's now possible to load receipts for alternate app names, not just the one
    that a given instance of `AxoUpdater` was instantiated for. This can be done
    by running `AxoUpdater::load_receipt_for(app_name)`.
-   It's now possible to change the name a given `AxoUpdater` instance is for.
    This can be done by running `AxoUpdater::set_name(app_name)`. This can
    override the name that was loaded from an app receipt.

For example, if your app is changing from `oldname` to `newname`, you might set
up `AxoUpdater` like this:

```rust
// Instantiate the updater class with the new app name
let mut updater = AxoUpdater::new_for("newname");

// First, try to check for a "newname" receipt
// (this might be a post-rename release)
if updater.load_receipt_as("newname").is_err() {
    // If that didn't work, try again as "oldname"
    if updater
        .load_receipt_as("oldname")
        .map(|updater| updater.set_name("newname"))
        .is_err()
    {
        eprintln!("Unable to load install receipt!");
    }
}
```

</details>
