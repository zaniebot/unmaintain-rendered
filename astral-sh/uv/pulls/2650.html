            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While writing tests for a new flag (<code>--emit-marker-expression</code>) for <code>uv pip compile</code>, I noticed that one of my test cases (<code>pendulum 3.0.0</code>)
was published in Dec 2023. I wanted to include this package in my
tests, but since it comes after our <code>EXCLUDE_NEWER</code> constant, it wasn&#x27;t
visible to <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>In this PR, I chose to resolve this by bumping <code>EXCLUDE_NEWER</code> to
<code>2024-03-25T00:00:00Z</code>. I also considered a couple other options:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a specific test, override and provide a custom <code>--exclude-newer</code>
flag. I felt like this would maybe be okay, but we could easily wind
up in a situation where we do this a lot and have a bunch of different
<code>--exclude-newer</code> flags in our tests. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a huge
problem in practice. Maybe it&#x27;s fine.</li>
<li>Find another package (or invent one) with a similarly interesting
configuration. It seemed easier to just bump <code>EXCLUDE_NEWER</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I did this was to run <code>cargo insta test</code> after bumping <code>EXCLUDE_NEWER</code>.
I then reviewed the snapshot diffs, and if they looked reasonable, I accepted them.
There was only one case where I changed the test to preserve what I thought it
was trying to test. That&#x27;s isolated in its own commit.</p>
