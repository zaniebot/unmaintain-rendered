## Summary

This PR updates the documentation on Dependabot for `uv` since [Dependabot now supports it](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-13-dependabot-version-updates-now-support-uv-in-general-availability/).

Ref: [dependabot/dependabot-core#10478](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10478#issuecomment-2722722972)
Ref: [Updated JSON schema on SchemaStore](https://json.schemastore.org/dependabot-2.0.json)

## Test Plan

This is documentation so no code was touched.
