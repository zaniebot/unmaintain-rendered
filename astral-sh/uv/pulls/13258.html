<p>Closes: #13253</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>(Very) small change to refer to update command <code>uv self update</code> when the uv version is mismatched.</p>
<p>I found only this one occurrence where a reference is suitable. Only other contenders are here
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/21b9f62dbf0901e6ff453f11afb79a7ab89f1af1/crates/uv/src/commands/project/mod.rs#L81-L85
But I think this would rather convolute the message and they will run into the other message when running <code>uv sync</code>.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Happy to also try my look with implementing your feedback on #11869 if that's ok for you, @aarondobbing?</p>
