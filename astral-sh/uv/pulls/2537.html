            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In reality, there's no such thing as the <code>site-packages</code> directory for a given virtualenv. Rather, Python defines both <code>purelib</code> and <code>platlib</code>, where the former is for pure-Python packages and the latter is for packages that contain native code. These are almost always set to the same thing... but they don't <em>have</em> to be, and in fact of Fedora they are not.</p>
<p>This PR changes the <code>site_packages</code> method to return an iterator of directories.</p>
<p>Note that the system tests introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2535, which failed on the PR itself, now pass.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2527.</p>
