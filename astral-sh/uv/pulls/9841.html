            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like styling both columns in each line the same -- that strengthens the relationship.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> I like sorting available-but-not-yet-installed to the bottom, but that will be a &quot;visually breaking change&quot;.</p>
<p>This discussion is helping me focus on what my main root issue is with <code>uv</code> installations. <code>uv</code> divides the python-sources into two worlds (managed &amp; system), but &quot;system&quot;, to me (and I think a lot of prior python install discussions), means &quot;installed &amp; managed by the OS&quot;. (This was certainly true during the python 2 to 3 migration era.)</p>
<p>So, where does that leave the user installed versions, such as those handled by <code>pyenv</code> or manual installs from <code>python.org</code>?</p>
<p>Which is a long winded way of saying that, on reflection, I think the &quot;does uv consider this installed python managed or system&quot; question is more important than &quot;is this installed yet&quot;. Knowing that distinction is a requirement to choosing the correct <code>--python-preference</code> option for my current use case. (I&#x27;m unaware of any other command that shows that information. afaik, you have to guess, then confirm, by setting an option to <code>uv python list</code>)</p>
<p>Even more succinct, I would prefer addressing the (just opened) #9847 to this issue. (Sorry for the churn, but thanks for helping me think this through.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like keeping them sorted as-is. I think it&#x27;s easy to be disoriented if there are two different groups, each sorted, in the output.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t mind using color to dim things that are uninstalled. From the screenshot, I wonder if the color here is a little too dim. But I like the idea.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like separate &quot;installed&quot; and &quot;download available&quot; sections, this would make it easier to skim what is actually installed and what&#x27;s only in the list.</p>

<p>For reference, that&#x27;s what my list currently looks like:</p>

<p>This is intentional though, like, you can <em>use</em> those versions automatically even if they&#x27;re not explicitly installed yet. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re listed in the first place. There&#x27;s <code>--only-installed</code> if you don&#x27;t want to see them.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is also intentional, so you can see what each executable on your path refers to. If we collapsed these, you&#x27;d lose that <code>python</code> and <code>python3</code> are aliases for <code>python3.12</code>.</p>
