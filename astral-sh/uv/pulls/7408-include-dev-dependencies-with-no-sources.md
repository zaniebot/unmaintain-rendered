# Include `dev-dependencies` with `--no-sources`

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-15 16:46_

## Summary

Running `uv lock --no-sources` should still include dev dependencies, since dev dependencies are defined separately from sources.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7406.
