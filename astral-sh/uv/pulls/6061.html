            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This example came up in discussion and it was initially unclear whether
we should try to support it. Specifically, by automatically assuming
that the <code>datasets &lt; 2.19</code> dependency had a marker corresponding to the
negation of the conjunction of the other sibling markers for that same
package. But this was deemed, I think, a little too magical.</p>
<p>This in turn implies that whenever there are sibling dependencies with
overlapping marker expressions, their version constraints also need to
be overlapping. Otherwise, for any marker environment that matches both
marker expressions, it would be impossible to select a single version.</p>
