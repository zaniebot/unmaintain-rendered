Summary
<p>hey! I was poking around with the tool support for exclude newer in juv (think this would be awesome to use to make Jupyter notebooks more standalone/reproducible) and ran into an issue.</p>
<p>The settings documentation for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#exclude-newer"><code>exclude-newer</code></a> says that it supports both dates and timestamp.</p>
<p>However, with uv v0.4.26:</p>
<pre><code>uv init foo
cd foo
echo &quot;[tool.uv]\nexclude-newer = &#x27;2022-01-01&#x27;&quot; &gt;&gt; pyproject.toml
uv run hello.py
#  warning: Failed to parse `pyproject.toml` during settings discovery:
#   TOML parse error at line 9, column 17
#     |
#   9 | exclude-newer = &quot;2022-01-01&quot;
#     |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
#   failed to find time component in &quot;2022-01-01&quot;, which is required for parsing a timestamp
</code></pre>
<p>I believe this is because the derive&#x27;d Deserialize from jiff only supports timestamps and doesn&#x27;t use the more flexible FromStr implemention implemented for <code>ExlcudeNewer</code></p>
Test Plan
<p>Added a test with a date string</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is quite the same, but we discussed something like this in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6562">astral-sh/uv#6562</a> and decided against the change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., 2006-12-02T02:07:43Z) and local dates in the same format (e.g., 2006-12-02) in your system&#x27;s configured time zone.</p>

<p>So I&#x27;m guessing whatever the system&#x27;s time zone is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at the <code>from_str</code> implementation for ExcludeNewer, it looks like that way:</p>
<pre><code>            .and_then(|date| date.to_zoned(TimeZone::system()))

<p>If that&#x27;s not the intention, than maybe we should change <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#exclude-newer">the example</a> in the docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think we might want to change the docs or, if we want to accept a simple date, use UTC. I think the intent is that we want a stable time in <code>exclude-newer</code> encoded in files. For example, if someone clones your repository they shouldn&#x27;t get a different resolution because they have a different system time.</p>
<p>@BurntSushi has the most context on this though.</p>

<p>Makes total sense. I&#x27;m thinking the main &quot;push&quot; for flexibility here (as mentioned in #6562) is convenience (i.e., actually typing out the timestamp is annoying), but not that someone adamantly wants ambiguity. Maybe something to consider is just a convenient high-level API for adding this setting correctly:</p>
<pre><code>uv add --timestamp
uv add --script foo.py --timestamp
uv add --timestamp=2024-01-01 
</code></pre>
<p>General idea is that you could have something conveniently resolve the users local time to something correct, keeping strictness with the target. (Maybe <code>add</code> isn&#x27;t the right namespace but just first thing that came to mind).</p>
<p>EDIT: another idea</p>
<pre><code>uv init --with-timestamp --script foo.py
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I basically think that we probably should not support writing unadorned dates in a persistent configuration that is meant to be shared among folks that may be in different time zones. It just makes the date ambiguous. Even if we defaulted to UTC, it&#x27;s still not immediately obvious to someone reading the config file that it would be UTC. And it seems much more natural to <em>assume</em> it isn&#x27;t UTC but actually local, which would lead to folks reading the date incorrectly in some cases.</p>
<p>I think a hypothetical <code>uv config set</code> command that owns the &quot;interpretation of the date as local, but writes it as an unambiguous timestamp&quot; is a good idea.</p>
<p>There are other options for writing timestamps to config files that are maybe a little more user friendly. For example, we could support <code>2024-10-28T00:00:00-04[US/Eastern]</code>. But probably just writing out <code>2024-10-28T00:00:00Z</code> is the way to go.</p>

<p>Sounds good to me! Not something I&#x27;d considered and appreciate the thoughtfulness and explanation by you both.</p>
