### [`v8.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/harryfei/which-rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#800)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/harryfei/which-rs/compare/7.0.3...8.0.0)

-   Add new `Sys` trait to allow abstracting over the underlying filesystem. Particularly useful for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` targets. Thanks [@&#8203;dsherret](https://redirect.github.com/dsherret) for this contribution to which!
-   Add more debug level tracing for otherwise silent I/O errors.
-   Call the `NonFatalHandler` in more places to catch previously ignored I/O errors.
-   Remove use of the `either` dependency.

</details>
