            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It turns out we were omitting empty dependency groups from the lockfile metadata, which was then causing us to reject locks when empty groups were defined.</p>
<p>We now include them (that section of the lock is meant to be a true representation of the metadata, and an empty-but-defined group is different from an absent group), though we can ignore them for validation, since it doesn't affect any behavior.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8581.</p>
