# Rename `sourcedist` to `sdist` in lockfile

## Summary

I think this is more consistent with Brett's proposal and looks more natural to me as a user. What do you think, @BurntSushi?

I don't love abbreviations but I do think this is more consistent with the standards.

I actually like `sdist` better anyway. I went with `sourcedist` originally I think because I remembered you liked to bias toward longer variable names. :P But totally cool with either to be honest.
