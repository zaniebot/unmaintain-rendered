### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package winsafe@0.0.19 --precise 0.0.21
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `winsafe = "^0.0.19"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.0.21
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `which v6.0.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `which = "^6.0.0"` (locked to 6.0.1) of package `uv-python v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv-python)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `uv-python` (locked to 0.0.1) of package `bench v0.0.0 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/bench)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

```

### Renovate Ignore Notification

Because you closed this PR without merging, Renovate will ignore this update (`0.0.21`). You will get a PR once a newer version is released. To ignore this dependency forever, add it to the `ignoreDeps` array of your Renovate config.

If you accidentally closed this PR, or if you changed your mind: rename this PR to get a fresh replacement PR.
