<p>Yeah diff quality is one of the downsides of hard-wrap. Back in my days as an academic, when collaborating on a paper, we would always try to insert a line break after a sentence. (Although we still hard-wrapped at 80 columns.) This tended to help with diffs but it's difficult to automate.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of what soft-wrap looks like in my editor:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36dace28-3369-4b93-8002-3cc3f63eddbe" alt="soft-wrap-one-window" /></p>
<p>And here's what it looks like when I open a second window next to it. The text kinda smushes and runs together with no real smarts about where to insert breaks (vim will just happily insert breaks right in the middle of words):</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2681980a-b16f-4155-a63a-b2ebd4938327" alt="soft-wrap-two-window" /></p>
<p>And in particular, one of the very annoying things about soft-wrap, at least in vim, is that it <em>looks</em> like, at a glance, that, for example, &quot;Python does not publish&quot; and &quot;distributions&quot; are on two different lines. And so if your cursor is on &quot;publish,&quot; it's easy to be misled that moving down a line should have you land on &quot;distributions.&quot; But of course, it doesn't. And so navigating to different parts of the text winds up being really annoying.</p>
<p>And finally, compare the above with what hard-wrap looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f89f3524-9a56-4c7c-b9e2-767700efe098" alt="hard-wrap" /></p>
<p>Now the test is a bit easier to read (for me) even when I have one window stretched across the screen because the text is wrapped at a reasonable point. And moving the cursor around is consistent with the appearance. And words aren't split arbitrarily.</p>
<p>This is to some extent a tooling deficiency, but not <em>completely</em> so IMO.</p>
<p>This is also largely why I find long lines of code unwieldy as well.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.nicemice.net/par/"><code>par</code></a> for line wrapping. But I doubt you'd be able to run it on entire Markdown documents and have it produce a desirable result. I guess for that you'd either need a Markdown-aware line wrapper or something that knows how to parse Markdown and only asks the line wrapper to do its work for &quot;paragraph&quot; nodes or whatever.</p>

<p>Same, there's so much noise with the reflowing</p>
