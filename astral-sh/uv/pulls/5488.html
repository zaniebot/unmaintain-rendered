            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider the following packse scenario:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[root]
requires = [
  &quot;a&gt;=1.0.0 ; python_version &lt; '3.10'&quot;,
  &quot;a&gt;=1.1.0 ; python_version &gt;= '3.10'&quot;,
  &quot;a&gt;=1.2.0 ; python_version &gt;= '3.11'&quot;,
]

[packages.a.versions.&quot;1.0.0&quot;]
[packages.a.versions.&quot;1.1.0&quot;]
[packages.a.versions.&quot;1.2.0&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>On current <code>main</code>, this produces a dependency on <code>a</code> that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">dependencies = [
    { name = &quot;fork-overlapping-markers-basic-a&quot;, marker = &quot;python_version &lt; '3.10' or python_version &gt;= '3.11'&quot; },
]
</code></pre>
<p>But the marker expression is clearly wrong here, since it implies that
<code>a</code> isn't installed at all for Python 3.10. With this PR, the above
dependency becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">dependencies = [
    { name = &quot;fork-overlapping-markers-basic-a&quot; },
]
</code></pre>
<p>That is, it's unconditional. Which is I believe correct here since there
aren't any other constraints on which version to select.</p>
<p>The specific bug here is that when we found overlapping dependency
specifications for the same package <em>within</em> a pre-existing fork, we
intersected all of their marker expressions instead of unioning them.
That in turn resulted in incorrect marker expressions.</p>
<p>While this doesn't fix any known bug on the issue tracker (like #4640),
it does appear to fix a couple of our snapshot tests. And fixes a basic
test case I came up with while working on #4732.</p>
