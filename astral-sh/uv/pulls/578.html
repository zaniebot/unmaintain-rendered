            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Path distribution cache reading errors are no longer fatal.</p>
<p>We now invalidate the path file source dists if its modification timestamp changed, and invalidate path dir source dists if <code>pyproject.toml</code> or alternatively <code>setup.py</code> changed, which seems good choices since changing pyproject.toml should trigger a rebuild and the user can <code>touch</code> the file as part of their workflow.</p>
<p><code>CachedByTimestamp</code> is now a shared util. It doesn't have methods as i don't think it's worth it yet for two users.</p>
<p>Closes #478</p>
<p>TODO(konstin): Write a test. This is probably twice as much work as that fix itself, so i made that PR without one for now.</p>
