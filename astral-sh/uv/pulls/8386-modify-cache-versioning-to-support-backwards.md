# Modify cache versioning to support backwards compatibility

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

Going forward, we're going to provide better versioning guarantees around using the same cache across multiple uv versions, so this PR updates the docs to reflect that. It also bumps the `sdists-` version to fix the inconvenience demonstrated in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8367.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8367.
