<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Partially address https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5605#issuecomment-2447089161</p>
<p>It puts the use cases in its own section, so the <em>non</em> use cases are easier to find.</p>
<p>I still think more could be done to describe the usage of uv in non-workspace settings but I don't have specific examples at the moment, still exploring it.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->
