# Remove confusing punctuation in readme

admittedly, nitpick PR but i initially misread the trailing dot in

```
# Create a virtual environment at .venv.
```

as part of the directory name, i.e. that the env would be placed in `.venv.`

Thanks for the pull request! Hm unfortunately this doesn't match any of our other comments then. Could we use backticks instead?
