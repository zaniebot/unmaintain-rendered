            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We use filesystem locks in a variety of places. For example, we tend to lock a virtual environment if we're running a command that might modify it. Right now, those locks tend to be written in the same &quot;location&quot; as whatever they lock (e.g., we write a filesystem lock at <code>.venv/.lock</code>), unless we can't do that for whatever reason, in which case we write to a content-addressed path within the user's temporary directory. This causes a few problems: (1) we try to write to locations that the user may have marked as read-only (like a <code>.venv</code> with <code>uv run</code> or similar); (2) we leave <code>.lock</code> files allover user-space.</p>
<p>This PR instead moves all filesystem locks into a shared locks directory, which the user can also configure via <code>UV_LOCK_DIR</code>.</p>
<p>This is breaking in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If users use older uv versions with versions released after this change, the two versions won't be concurrency-safe with one another, since they'll use different locations with the locks. I think that's fine, but it is arguably breaking.</li>
<li>If users have marked certain directories under an allowlist (e.g., allow <code>.venv</code> to be written within an otherwise read-only filesystem), they'll now need to allow writes to the lock directory. Again, I think this is fine (and an improvement), but it may cause issues for some users in specific setups.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Regarding (2): such failures are now treated as non-fatal anyway.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Taking <code>self</code> here means that in some sense we need to reason about a <code>FilesystemLocks</code> instance that has not had <code>.init()</code> called on it.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Making this a <code>LazyLock</code> of <code>Result</code> makes it kind of awkward to access the value, especially because <code>io::Error</code> isn't <code>Copy</code>/<code>Clone</code>. <code>LazyLock</code> doesn't really let us initialize things fallibly, so sometimes I prefer a pattern like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Thing;

impl Thing {
    fn fallible_new() -&gt; io::Result&lt;Self&gt; {
        Ok(Self)
    }

    if let Some(thing) = THE_THING.get() {
        return Ok(thing);
    }
    // We need to initialize THE_THING.
    let new_thing = Thing::fallible_new()?;
    // Initialization succeeded, now set the OnceLock.
    // If some other thread raced with us to set it, that's fine.
    _ = THE_THING.set(new_thing);
    Ok(THE_THING.get().unwrap())
}
</code></pre>
<p>(I think it's fine for two threads to race to init here, but when it's not fine you can add a second function-local <code>static INIT_MUTEX: Mutex&lt;()&gt; = Mutex::new(())</code> that you double-check-lock whenever the first <code>get</code> returns <code>None</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, (3) happens in <code>StateStore::from_settings</code>. This is basically just a clone of <code>InstalledTools</code> but with less functionality and a different backing directory.</p>

<p>We might want to clear these out as part of <code>uv cache prune</code> or add periodic garbage collection. I think it's sort of fine for now, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah good point. I could imagine a routine that finds the longest path prefix that exists, canonicalizes <em>that</em>, and then appends the rest (and maybe asserts that there are no <code>.</code> or <code>..</code> components among the rest). But it's probably not worth the trouble? To care about this you'd have to like <code>mkdir foo &amp;&amp; ln -s foo bar</code> and then try to lock both <code>foo/doesnt_exist_yet</code> and <code>bar/doesnt_exist_yet</code>. You <em>could</em> but like, will anyone ever do it? Also even the &quot;perfect&quot; implementation could get confused if you raced it against that <code>ln</code> invocation.</p>
<p>Absolutifying sounds good if it's just a one line change?</p>
