## Summary

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7027

* When displaying the file structure of a uv-managed project show the `.python-version` file which is now created by default.
* Mention the purpose of the `.python-version` file in `Guides/Working on projects/Project structure`
* In `Concepts/Python versions/Project python versions`, changed sentence about `.python-version` file to reflect the fact it is included by default so is likely to be present.
