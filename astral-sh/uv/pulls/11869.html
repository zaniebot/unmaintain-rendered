<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>When a project has a required-version constraint in its pyproject.toml
that doesn't match the current uv version, automatically use <code>uv tool run</code>
to execute a compatible version instead of exiting with an error.</p>
<p>This allows developers with newer uv versions to still work with projects
that need older versions, without having to manually use <code>uv tool run</code>
for each command to ensure a consistent development experience.</p>
<p>:chef_kiss:</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Unit tests covering the cases described in issue #11065</p>
<p>Verified locally in sample python projects matching the described issues outlined by @mjpieters</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cool! I'll give this a look.</p>
<p>Did you explore calling into the <code>tool_run</code> implementation directly instead of spawning a subprocess?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn't explore it - Not familiar with the uv project in general, was just looking to pick a first issue that would support me in my day to day :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>Totally makes sense as an approach - Will give it a spin locally and throw in an update up if I can get something tenable together later.</p>
<p>Thanks for feedback :pray:</p>
