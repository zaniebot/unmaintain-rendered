<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We are using UV as a library and need to set <code>tls_built_in_root_certs</code> on the reqwest client.</p>
<p>This PR exposes this property in the <code>BaseClientBuilder</code> and in the <code>RegistryClientBuilder</code>. The default is set to <code>false</code>, so this does not change any behaviour unless you explicitly opt into it.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->
