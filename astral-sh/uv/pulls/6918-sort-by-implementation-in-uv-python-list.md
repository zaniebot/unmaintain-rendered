# Sort by implementation in `uv python list`

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-01 17:37_

## Summary

With #6917, there are a lot more PyPy downloads in `uv python list --all-versions`. I find it clearer to have all the CPython downloads listed, then all the PyPy downloads, rather than interspersing them. But this is subjective, feel free to push back!
