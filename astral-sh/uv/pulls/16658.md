### [`v0.2.16`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0216-2025-11-07)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.15...0.2.16)

\===================
This release contains a number of enhancements and bug fixes that have accrued
over the last few months. Most are small polishes. A couple of the bug fixes
apply to panics that could occur when parsing invalid `TZ` strings or invalid
`strptime` format strings.

Also, parsing into a `Span` should now be much faster (for both the ISO 8601
and "friendly" duration formats).

Enhancements:

- [#&#8203;298](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/298):
  Add Serde helpers for (de)serializing `std::time::Duration` values.
- [#&#8203;396](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/396):
  Add `Sub` and `Add` trait implementations for `Zoned` (in addition to the
  already existing trait implementations for `&Zoned`).
- [#&#8203;397](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/397):
  Add `BrokenDownTime::set_meridiem` and ensure it overrides the hour when
  formatting.
- [#&#8203;409](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/409):
  Switch dependency on `serde` to `serde_core`. This should help speed up
  compilation times in some cases.
- [#&#8203;430](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/430):
  Add new `Zoned::series` API, making it consistent with the same API on other
  datetime types.
- [#&#8203;432](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/432):
  When `lenient` mode is enabled for `strftime`, Jiff will no longer error when
  the formatting string contains invalid UTF-8.
- [#&#8203;432](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/432):
  Formatting of `%y` and `%g` no longer fails based on the specific year value.
- [#&#8203;432](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/432):
  Parsing of `%s` is now a bit more consistent with other fields. Moreover,
  `BrokenDownTime::{to_timestamp,to_zoned}` will now prefer timestamps parsed
  with `%s` over any other fields that have been parsed.
- [#&#8203;433](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/433):
  Allow parsing just a `%s` into a `Zoned` via the `Etc/Unknown` time zone.

Bug fixes:

- [#&#8203;386](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/386):
  Fix a bug where `2087-12-31T23:00:00Z` in the `Africa/Casablanca` time zone
  could not be round-tripped (because its offset was calculated incorrectly as
  a result of not handling "permanent DST" POSIX time zones).
- [#&#8203;407](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/407):
  Fix a panic that occurred when parsing an empty string as a POSIX time zone.
- [#&#8203;410](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/410):
  Fix a panic that could occur when parsing `%:` via `strptime` APIs.
- [#&#8203;414](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/414):
  Update some parts of the documentation to indicate that `TimeZone::unknown()`
  is a fallback for `TimeZone::system()` (instead of the `jiff 0.1` behavior of
  using `TimeZone::UTC`).
- [#&#8203;423](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/423):
  Fix a panicking bug when reading malformed TZif data.
- [#&#8203;426](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/426):
  Fix a panicking bug when parsing century (`%C`) via `strptime`.
- [#&#8203;445](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/445):
  Fixed bugs with parsing durations like `-9223372036854775808s`
  and `-PT9223372036854775808S`.

Performance:

- [#&#8203;445](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/445):
  Parsing into `Span` or `SignedDuration` is now a fair bit faster in some cases.
