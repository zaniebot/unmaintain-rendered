            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, this is a little nuanced, but it confused me a couple times and I'm poking around in this code so I figured I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>In the following:</p>
<pre><code>❯  uv pip install 'httpx&gt;9999'
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only httpx&lt;=9999 is available and you require httpx&gt;9999, we can conclude that the requirements are
      unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>We say <strong><code>only httpx&lt;=9999 is available</code></strong>, which <em>suggests</em> that <code>httpx 9999</code> is available — but it's not, and we know that. The problem is that we naively take the complement of the requirement (<code>httpx&gt;9999</code>).</p>
<p>Here, we special case inclusive bounds to check if the version in question is actually available — if not, we switch to an exclusive bound.</p>
<p>Note this also applies to the reverse case</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv pip install 'httpx&lt;0.000001'
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only httpx&gt;=0.1 is available and you require httpx&lt;0.1, we can conclude that the requirements are
      unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>However, for simplicity, I haven't tackled the case where we display multiple version segments yet. So for more complex requests, our messaging is still confusing:</p>
<pre><code>❯ uv pip install 'httpx&gt;99,&lt;999'
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because only the following versions of httpx are available:
          httpx&lt;=99
          httpx&gt;=999
      and you require httpx&gt;99,&lt;999, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
</code></pre>
<p>This will require further refactoring, which I'll track in a new issue.</p>
