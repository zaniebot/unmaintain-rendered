            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah sorry for the ambiguous language, I mean &quot;clear the environment&quot; as-in reset the virtual environment to an initial state not &quot;clear the entire folder&quot;.</p>
<p>e.g. <code>uv venv foo</code> fails if <code>foo</code> exists at all and <code>uv venv foo --force</code> updates <code>foo</code> to be a fresh virtual environment without removing unrelated files. I don't see a need for a way to <code>rm -rf foo</code> via a flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. I guess I'm not totally sold on changing the current overwrite behavior... I have a hunch that it's a difference in the API, and that leads to initial confusion, but that it's actually not a <em>bad</em> behavior.</p>

<p>Fwiw, I also think it's better to resolve #1472 first. Actually I expected to get error on continuous <code>uv venv</code>.
Then we can consider <code>--force-overwrite</code> and <code>--force-recreate</code> flags.</p>

<p>I expect it to remove all the packages and reset the virtual environment files (i.e. that it would create) not delete every file in the directory.</p>

<p>It's useful when an external tool adds its specified files to <code>.venv</code> directory. when use --clear/--reset it's better avoid using external tool again to create those files/folders. I don't know real world example for such case, but I think this is one of possible scenarios.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think they reuse the directory in that way, though. It sounds like they create a new directory, seed it, use it for a virtualenv, then move on. I imagine that they then repeat that entire process when they need a new virtualenv. So, I'm not sure it's worth designing around and supporting that workflow when we don't have a clear motivating use-case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think about it like this:</p>
<p>I use <code>uv venv</code> to clear an environment all the time. It's nice to reset the installed packages in a single command. We should provide a flag to toggle behavior when the directory exists already. I think this behavior should not be opt-out, but instead opt-in — manually managed environments are rarely disposable for real users. I would find it surprising that it performs <code>rm -rf .venv</code> and deletes files unrelated to the virtual environment itself. I cannot trivially clear packages from a virtual environment manually, as it can vary per platform. I can, however, trivially delete the folder. I'd like <code>uv</code> to take care of the non-trivial part of this workflow. I admit there is still value to performing the trivial part, i.e. it's a single invocation instead of <code>rm -rf .venv &amp;&amp; uv venv</code>. It seems rare that you would need to clean up other state in the directory though, in which case I think the two command invocation is clearer anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>:shrug: IDK, personally I would find it surprising if <code>--clear</code> or <code>--reset</code> left some random files in the virtualenv. I think it's likely that we eventually hear from a user that's confused that <code>--clear</code> or <code>--reset</code> doesn't fully clear or reset the virtual environment. We'll may also see some bug eventually around files that we can't track in our implementation but that &quot;should&quot; be cleared (e.g., what if <code>virtualenv</code> or <code>python -m venv</code> writes a file to the top-level, and a user runs <code>--clear </code>on one of those virtualenvs?). It feels like a hard behavior to explain and implement reliably for a use-case we don't know about.</p>
<p>If we can't agree, then should we at least move forward with <code>--force</code> as-described, that allows you to create a virtualenv ignoring any existing files?</p>
