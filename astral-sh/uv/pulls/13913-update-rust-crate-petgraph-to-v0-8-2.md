### [`v0.8.2`](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#082---2025-06-06)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/compare/petgraph@v0.8.1...petgraph@v0.8.2)

This minor release fixes several bugs, adds two new algorithms, slightly improves the performance of `maximum_matching`,
adds a tool for parsing graphs from Dot/Graphviz files, and improves the documentation, making it more complete and uniform, as well as clarifying several points.

##### Bug Fixes

-   Ford Fulkerson sometimes Panics on StableGraphs ([#&#8203;793](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/793))
-   Run Maximal Cliques Quickcheck only on Digraphs which are symmetrical ([#&#8203;800](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/800))
-   Run Steiner Tree Quickcheck on the connected components to properly support disconnected graphs ([#&#8203;801](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/801))
-   Quickcheck random01 function only outputs 0 ([#&#8203;798](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/798))

##### Documentation

-   Specify that Acyclic::try_udpate_edge may add an edge ([#&#8203;770](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/770))
-   Update remove_node doc comment in graphmap.rs ([#&#8203;663](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/663))

-   Add note about `StableGraph::edge_indices` behaviour ([#&#8203;812](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/812))
-   Clarification of references to nodes and V (refresh [#&#8203;358](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/issues/358)) ([#&#8203;814](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/814))
-   Fix link and mention Dfs and Bfs as special case in examples ([#&#8203;816](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/816))
-   Unify algo docs ([#&#8203;815](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/815))

##### New Features

-   *(parser)* allow parsing graphs from Dot/Graphviz files ([#&#8203;653](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/653))
-   Implement `DataMap` for `GraphMap` graphs ([#&#8203;776](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/776))
-   Add Johnson's algorithm ([#&#8203;741](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/741))
-   Add algorithm to find bridge edges ([#&#8203;590](https://redirect.github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/590))

##### Performance
