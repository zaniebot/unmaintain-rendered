### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.1.29`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0129-2025-02-02)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.1.28...0.1.29)

\===================
This release includes a few small enhancements and a bug fix. In particular,
there is now Serde support for `TimeZone` and the `ISOWeekDate` API has been
filled out a bit more.

Unless a serious issue is uncovered, my plan is that this will be the last
release before `jiff 0.2`.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;89](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/89):
    Opt-in support for using Serde with `jiff::tz::TimeZone` has been added.
-   [#&#8203;227](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/227):
    The `civil::ISOWeekDate` API has been beefed up with a few convenience methods.
-   [#&#8203;233](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/233):
    Add `tz::Offset::round` for rounding time zone offsets.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;231](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/231):
    Use more flexible offset equality when parsing offsets with fractional minutes.
