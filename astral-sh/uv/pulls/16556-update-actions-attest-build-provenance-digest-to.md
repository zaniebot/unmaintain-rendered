@woodruffw Is there a reason we're not using a release tag here?

@konstin I _think_ we are, at least based on the latest commit on the PR pointing to the latest release:

https://github.com/actions/attest-build-provenance/commit/00014ed6ed5efc5b1ab7f7f34a39eb55d41aa4f8

However, IDK why this doesn't have a version comment, which in turn would make the constraint explicit. I'll investigate that.

Oh, this is a cargo-dist interaction -- we pin these in `[dist.github-action-commits]`:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e006a69fe83808d5eaebaa27f535914cf1b36105/dist-workspace.toml#L82-L86

So really, we should probably ignore `release.yml` in the Renovate config 🙂
