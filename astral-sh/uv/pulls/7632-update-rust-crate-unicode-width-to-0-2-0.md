### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```

    ... which satisfies dependency `miette = "^7.2.0"` (locked to 7.5.0) of package `uv v0.6.13 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv)`

Looks blocked by update in [textwrap](https://github.com/mgeisler/textwrap)

---

_Comment by @konstin on 2025-03-03 13:43_

textwrap is already updated to unicode-width 0.2.0, but pending a new release (https://github.com/mgeisler/textwrap/issues/576)

---

_Comment by @konstin on 2025-04-08 12:39_

The textwrap update is published, it builds with a `cargo check` lockfile update

The unicode-width 0.2 changes all don't look like particularly applicable to uv.
