            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The spec requires normalizing the name and the version in distribution filenames (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#escaping-and-unicode). Missing normalization caused #8030, so we warn about it. Ideally, we would error, but this would break setuptools (<a href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/3777">pypa/setuptools#3777</a>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe it&#x27;s the only responsible course of action: It would be irresponsible to publish invalid wheels without comment, but given the setuptools bug, we can&#x27;t make it an error yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So what&#x27;s the exact course of events here. The user has a package with a dot in the name, <code>setuptools</code> creates a wheel with an invalid name (includes the dot), PyPI <em>accepts</em> it, and then what?</p>

<p>When I first hit the issue, my publish command failed and I was able to manually fix the folder name in the whl file to be normalized.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, PyPI accepts the legacy form with unnormalized wheel filenames. It seems to just split wheel filenames on dashes (https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/blob/50a58f3081e693a3772c0283050a275e350004bf/warehouse/forklift/legacy.py#L1133-L1155). This is a gap in PyPI&#x27;s wheel checking. PyPI regularly tightens their checks to follow the standards more closely, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/15795">pypi/warehouse#15795</a> fixed the check for the version in source dist filenames. We&#x27;re a bit ahead of the curve, but I&#x27;d rather emit warnings now than to quietly publish spec-breaking wheels and/or wait until PyPI starts rejecting such packages. I&#x27;d hope that setuptools fixes this on their end, which should unblock PyPI from adding such a check.</p>

<p>Good point, I&#x27;ve added a dedicated test case.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;ve added a workaround in #8204 that should fix publishing without manual edits. This PR is basically adding a mechanism of complaining that what #8204 does is a hack around missing standards compliance in the build backend.</p>

<p>But when PyPI accepts such a wheel, what&#x27;s the impact on consumers of the package?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, there is no impact that I&#x27;d know of, since all resolver and installers I&#x27;m aware of accept the legacy style, too (there are packages that were publish before these normlization rules were written, and the spec says tools need to take care of this legacy style). I had hoped that following the spec would be sufficient grounds to add a warning.</p>
