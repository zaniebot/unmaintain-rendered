<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Adds ability to use a script or program other than <code>keyring</code> with the same interface as <code>keyring</code> to get password.</p>
<p>Based on suggestion/request from https://github.com/vlad-ivanov-name in #2254</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I created a script: <code>my-keyring.sh</code> with a couple variants
First:  Wrap actual keyring</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
keyring get $2 $3
</code></pre>
<p>Second:  Wrap gcloud auth command</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# should verify domain here
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token --scopes=&quot;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform&quot; --quiet
</code></pre>
<p>and tested on a project I knew to be working by replacing <code>--keyring-provider subprocess</code> with <code>--keyring-provider custom --custom-keyring-command ./my-keyring.sh</code> for both variants</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe using the keyring namespace isn't the desired way to go and just having a &quot;custom auth script&quot; option is better?  But since it was requested, I figured I'd throw up this easy PR.</p>
<p>The gcloud auth command script in the PR description <code>Test Plan</code> shows how a custom script can be an easy/nice way to generate tokens for GAR without having to rely on the python keyring dependency for those looking to migrate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's an interesting idea but I think it's too soon to include something like this.</p>
<p>Maybe some sort of custom authentication script makes sense in the future? Not sure. There's also requests like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1369 I'd like to take into consideration for whatever workflow we come up with.</p>
