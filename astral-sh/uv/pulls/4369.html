<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This will make <code>uv lock</code> read <code>override-dependencies</code> from  the <code>[tool.uv]</code> section of <code>pyproject.toml</code>.
Resolves #4108</p>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4446">other</a>  implementation touches more code but seems more consistent.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Unit test</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, this can have effects on neighbouring packages: Say you have a non-project workspace root and in it two package foo, bar and baz.</p>
<p>foo has:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">tool.uv.override-dependencies = [
   &quot;anyio==4.3.0&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>bar has:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">dependencies = [
    &quot;anyio==4.4.0&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>baz has:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">tool.uv.override-dependencies = [
   &quot;lib_that_uses_anyio=1.2.3&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>This means foo changes the resolution of both bar and baz, once directly and once indirectly. Since overrides apply globally, i think we should only allow them in the workspace root.</p>

<p>I assume you mean <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> don't depend on each other.
You're right, but it's also not entirely new. The fact that one virtualenv is shared by all workspace members is bound to have side-effects.</p>
<p>As convinient as a shared virtualenv is, I kinda wish there was a way to require a private one per member.
As it stands right now dependency versions are negotiated by unrelated workspace members.
Also you can have a line in <code>bar</code> that references <code>lib_that_uses_anyio</code> or <code>foo</code>, and it'll work fine in the virtualenv, but not when <code>bar</code> is shipped as a standalone library.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, if someone could also take a look at https://github.com/astral-sh/rye/pull/1015 I'd appreciate it. I'm a bit stuck with one of my projects.</p>
