I have a semi related branch https://github.com/samypr100/uv/commit/43261645248065c18d3c68e1a7694ea8d4d9aba8 I started a while back (but forgot to upstream) to align versions and have less windows variants to compile. I'll promote it to a PR sometime this weekend if we want this alignment.

I'm looking for alignment so we can share utilities in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/17500
