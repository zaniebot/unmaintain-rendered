            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Due to recent instances in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12552#issuecomment-2764503857 mistakenly used the PyPI package <code>uvx</code> as the official package, it's worth mentioning in the documentation.
uvx on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/uvx/</p>
<p>The README currently includes pip installation instructions. However, due to uncertainty regarding the most concise way to present this information, it will be omitted for the time being.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Run docs server in local

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I opened an issue in https://github.com/robinvandernoord/uvenv/issues/5 to ask @robinvandernoord to transfer ownership of the PyPI <code>uvx</code> package to the <code>uv</code> maintainers. Hopefully, this issue can then be resolved in a more intuitive way 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @basnijholt</p>
<p>Let's see what the best path forward is here. I'm hesitant to add a warning to the install instructions like this, but it might be necessary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thanks for mentioning me here. Because of this naming collision, I changed the name from <code>uvx</code> to <code>uvenv</code> a few months ago.
I still had the package up on pypi during the transition but I've had adeprecation warning (both on pypi and in the tool itself) for a while so I think it would be fine to yank the package to prevent confusion.</p>
<p>Would you prefer I just take the pypi project down or should I transfer it to someone?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@robinvandernoord it seems best to transfer it so we can guard against dependency confusion attacks in the future. Want to send an email to <code>zanie at astral.sh</code> and we can coordinate?</p>

<p>I think this PR can be put on the agenda to decide if it's needed.</p>
