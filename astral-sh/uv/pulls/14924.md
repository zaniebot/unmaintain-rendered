### [`v6.4.2`](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/releases/tag/v6.4.2): 🌈 Interpret relative inputs as under working-directory

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/compare/v6.4.1...v6.4.2)

#### Changes

This release will interpret relative paths in inputs as relative
to the value of `working-directory` (default is `${{ github.workspace }}`) .
This means the following configuration

```yaml
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
   with:
     working-directory: /my/path
     cache-dependency-glob: uv.lock
```

will look for the `cache-dependency-glob` under `/my/path/uv.lock`

#### 🐛 Bug fixes

- interpret relative inputs as under working-directory [@&#8203;eifinger](https://redirect.github.com/eifinger) ([#&#8203;498](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/issues/498))
