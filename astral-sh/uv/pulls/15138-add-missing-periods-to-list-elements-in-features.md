# Add missing periods (`.`) to list elements in `Features` docs page

---

_Pull request opened by @yury-fedotov on 2025-08-07 15:17_

The [**Features**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/) page of docs contains a lot of markdown lists, elements of which end with `.`.

For example:

<img width="571" height="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b485f310-fece-4da4-acb9-ebc68b9df7d3" />

Out of tens of list elements, just two are outliers and do not use `.` at the end.

So this small PR fixes this little inconsistency :)
