### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>harryfei/which-rs (which)</summary>

### [`v7.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/harryfei/which-rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#700)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/harryfei/which-rs/compare/6.0.3...7.0.0)

-   Add support to `WhichConfig` for a user provided closure that will be called whenever a nonfatal error occurs.
    This technically breaks a few APIs due to the need to add more generics and lifetimes. Most code will compile
    without changes.
