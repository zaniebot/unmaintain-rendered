<p>Howdy Astral friends! This is a small PR which is a small user experience improvement for smooth installs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For some more context, in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5397 we made it so that the <code>$</code> is stripped from copied console commands in the documentation but that doesn't apply to the README. I think we'll need to move the comments and <code>$</code> out of the code blocks to achieve the desired effect here.</p>
<p>Nice to see you Carol! Thanks for taking the time to contribute :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure about the $. But I figured that I would mention it since the copy paste grabbed all of lines and made the shell grumpy. Good to see you virtually too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I gave it a try <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/7ab5f7676fa7533b2dbc124a8c8e25111b82302e/README.md#installation">in the preview</a> and we'll need to change that before we can merge. I can futz with it sometime soon if you don't want to.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It does fail if you keep the preceding <code>$</code>.  I've removed the <code>$</code> and switched the syntax highlighting to <code>bash</code>. I'm able to copy-paste fine on Mac. YMMV on Windows (I don't have a good test machine for that.) @zanieb</p>
