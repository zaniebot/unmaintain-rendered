<p>I had not seen this feature of docker before and it took a few minutes of reading the docker docs to clarify what it was doing. Hopefully this update makes it clear why a user would want to do this without duplicating the docker docs too much.</p>
<p>I also fixed the link to the docker docs, which was directing to the top of the page since the name of the anchor had changed.</p>
