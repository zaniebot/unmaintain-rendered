            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There's some inconsistent behaviour in handling symlinks when <code>cache-key</code> is a glob or a file path. This PR attempts to address that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When cache-key is a path, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html#method.metadata"><code>Path::metadata()</code></a> is used to check if it's a file or not. According to the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This function will traverse symbolic links to query information about the destination file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if the target file is a symlink, it will be resolved and the metadata will be queried for the underlying file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When cache-key is a glob, <code>globwalk</code> is used, specifically allowing for symlinks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">.file_type(globwalk::FileType::FILE | globwalk::FileType::SYMLINK)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>However, without enabling link following, <code>DirEntry::metadata()</code> will return an equivalent of <code>Path::symlink_metadata()</code> (and not <code>Path::metadata()</code>), which will have a file type that looks like</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">FileType {
    is_file: false,
    is_dir: false,
    is_symlink: true,
   ..
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Then, there's a check for <code>metadata.is_file()</code> which fails and complains that the target entry &quot;is a directory when file was expected&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>TLDR: glob cache-keys don't work with symlinks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>Option 1 (current PR): follow symlinks.</p>
<p>Option 2 (also doable): don't follow symlinks, but resolve the resulting target entry manually in case its file type is a symlink. However, this would be a little weird and unobvious in that we resolve files but not directories for some reason. Also, symlinking directories is pretty useful if you want to symlink directories of local dependencies that are not under the project's path.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>This has been tested manually:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    for follow_links in [false, true] {
        let walker = globwalk::GlobWalkerBuilder::from_patterns(&quot;.&quot;, &amp;[&quot;a/*&quot;])
            .file_type(globwalk::FileType::FILE | globwalk::FileType::SYMLINK)
            .follow_links(follow_links)
            .build()
            .unwrap();
        let entry = walker.into_iter().next().unwrap().unwrap();
        dbg!(&amp;entry);
        dbg!(entry.file_type());
        dbg!(entry.path_is_symlink());
        dbg!(entry.path());
        let meta = entry.metadata().unwrap();
        dbg!(meta.is_file());
    }

    let path = std::path::PathBuf::from(&quot;./a/b&quot;);
    dbg!(path.metadata().unwrap().file_type());
    dbg!(path.symlink_metadata().unwrap().file_type());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Current behaviour (glob cache-key, don't follow links):</p>
<pre><code>[src/main.rs:9:9] &amp;entry = DirEntry(&quot;./a/b&quot;)
[src/main.rs:10:9] entry.file_type() = FileType {
    is_file: false,
    is_dir: false,
    is_symlink: true,
    ..
}
[src/main.rs:11:9] entry.path_is_symlink() = true
[src/main.rs:12:9] entry.path() = &quot;./a/b&quot;
[src/main.rs:14:9] meta.is_file() = false
</code></pre>
<p>Glob cache-key, follow links:</p>
<pre><code>[src/main.rs:9:9] &amp;entry = DirEntry(&quot;./a/b&quot;)
[src/main.rs:10:9] entry.file_type() = FileType {
    is_file: true,
    is_dir: false,
    is_symlink: false,
    ..
}
[src/main.rs:11:9] entry.path_is_symlink() = true
[src/main.rs:12:9] entry.path() = &quot;./a/b&quot;
[src/main.rs:14:9] meta.is_file() = true
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>path.metadata()</code> for a non-glob cache key:</p>
<pre><code>[src/main.rs:18:5] path.metadata().unwrap().file_type() = FileType {
    is_file: true,
    is_dir: false,
    is_symlink: false,
    ..
}
[src/main.rs:19:5] path.symlink_metadata().unwrap().file_type() = FileType {
    is_file: false,
    is_dir: false,
    is_symlink: true,
    ..
}

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>Both points are valid and I had pretty much the same thoughts... a few notes though:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the current uv, you can essentially already escape the current CWD by specifying a non-glob symlink which would then follow a different code path. It's quite odd that <code>file = &quot;a/b&quot;</code> would work but <code>file = &quot;a/*&quot;</code> won't.</li>
<li>As it was written, the globwalk filter being used specifically allows for symlinks, so it seemed like the original intention was to support symlinks.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yea, it feels a bit inconsistent and may be even harder to explain/document - like, then we allow <code>a/b</code> when a is a symlink and/or b is a symlink, we allow <code>a/b/*</code> when <code>*</code> is a symlink and <code>a/*/b</code> when b is a symlink, but we don't allow <code>a/*/b</code> when <code>*</code> is a symlink... I think it might be easier to just say 'non-globs already follow symlinks; globs behave the same way'?</p>
<p>If you have a strong preference towards option 2 though, that should be easy to implement as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I agree it's non-ideal. Hmmmm.</p>
<p>Another option that comes to mind that is found in other glob implementations is <code>***</code>, as in, <code>foo/***/something.toml</code>. The triple star behaves like <code>**</code>, but follows symlinks. However, I don't think any of the Rust glob crates support this. It would be plausibly ideal here because it would let folks writing globs specifically opt into symlink traversal.</p>
<p>Yet another option is to add an opt-in configuration controlling whether symlinks are followed for glob walking. That feels not great though.</p>
<p>The reason why I am being super cautious here is that, in my experience, it's <em>very easy</em> for symlinks to blow up the size of a directory tree. I see this all the time with users of VS Code somehow finding that ripgrep is constantly re-traversing <code>node_modules</code> directories. Which can easily get to hundreds of thousands of directory entries when symlinks are followed. Now I don't think that's as common in Python ecosystem, but it's still something to be cautious about. Basically, I worry about merging this and it causing massive perf regressions for people using cache key globs.</p>

<p>In the former, you've explicitly requested we use &quot;a/b&quot; as a cache key whereas in the latter it's implicit.</p>
<p>Are there cases where you really need to follow a globbed symlink instead of specifying it explicitly?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb a real-world example: there's a proto/ folder with tons of *.proto symlinks to various proto schemas around the codebase. The package itself reruns protobuf codegen. If any of those symlinked schemas changes, we'd like to rebuild the package automatically.</p>
<p>It is possible to specify it all manually but then we're doing it twice.</p>
<p>One middle-ground solution here, I guess, is to not follow links in the walker, however always resolve the final DirEntry (i.e. via fs::metadata and not entry.metadata()). It's trivial to add if there's consensus.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb Thanks for replying. Do you think extra globbing syntax like <code>***</code> would be less intrusive than just resolving symlinks on the leaves of the walk? (i.e. not descend into symlinked dirs for walking but just query <code>fs::metadata()</code> instead of the current <code>fs::symlink_metadata()</code> for the entries yielded)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure, honestly. Is that equivalent to saying &quot;we don't follow symlinks for directories&quot; or would you still follow to a directory if it was a leaf? I worry that will be harder to teach than &quot;we only follow symlinks with <code>***</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that assuages @BurntSushi's performance concerns.</p>

<p>No you won't follow if it was a leaf (because that's it, it's a leaf). <code>walkdir</code> itself keeps its internal state where it doesn't follow symlinked dirs because we don't enable <code>follow_links</code> option. It's just that you can resolve those symlinks yourself post-factum without altering the walking behaviour, that's what I meant.</p>
<p>As for <code>***</code> - if there's consensus on adding it, if need be I can also add it to the crate proposed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13469.</p>

<p>That downside seems kinda unfortunate. I feel like <code>***</code> is the best solution here, but I don't know how willing we will be to switch to a brand new globbing crate. And yeah, adding <code>***</code> support otherwise is pretty tricky because it requires coupling between the glob syntax and directory traversal (which <code>globset</code> does not have yet).</p>

<p>@charliermarsh I see, thanks! Should be fixed now.</p>
