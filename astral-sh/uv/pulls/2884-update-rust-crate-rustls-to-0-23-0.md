### ⚠ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path crates/uv-client/Cargo.toml --package rustls@0.21.10 --precise 0.23.4
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `rustls = "^0.21.6"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.23.4
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `reqwest v0.11.26`
    ... which satisfies dependency `reqwest = "^0.11.23"` (locked to 0.11.26) of package `uv-git v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/uv-git)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `uv-git` (locked to 0.0.1) of package `distribution-types v0.0.1 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/uv/crates/distribution-types)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

```

### Renovate Ignore Notification

Because you closed this PR without merging, Renovate will ignore this update (`0.23.0`). You will get a PR once a newer version is released. To ignore this dependency forever, add it to the `ignoreDeps` array of your Renovate config.

If you accidentally closed this PR, or if you changed your mind: rename this PR to get a fresh replacement PR.

@zanieb Can this be reopened? Looks like #2817 has landed. 0.23 would be great to have because it contains [this fix](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/issues/1367#issuecomment-1984063081).

Thanks!

Ah yeah, I can do this upgrade now.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-23 22:17_

Actually, I think reqwest currently pins to 0.22.4?
