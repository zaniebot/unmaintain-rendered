</blockquote>
<p>Yes, sorry for the lack of clarity. The intent here is to provide multiple binaries on the <code>PATH</code> instead of a shim. Instead of placing these in some internal directory that we add to the <code>PATH</code>, we re-use our canonical location for installing executables. I think this provides a consistent experience with tool installation. And, since uv itself is moving here (#8420), installation should nearly always &quot;just work&quot; without further action.</p>
<p>There will probably be more work in the future to construct stable intermediary directories, e.g. solving for the problems raised in #8481 with an approach like Homebrew.</p>

I'd end up with a bunch of <code>python3.X</code> executables in <code>~/.local/bin</code>, without a clear connection to uv, and it would happen automatically, which some might argue is &quot;polluting the PATH&quot;.

<p>Perhaps there's some confusion around &quot;it would happen automatically&quot; — this is not the case. This should not happen during an implicit installation, e.g., <code>uv run -p 3.11 ...</code>, it should only happen during an explicit request to install, e.g., <code>uv python install 3.11</code>. I think this matches user expectations — a binary is placed on the <code>PATH</code> during a request to install Python. There will not be implicit pollution of the <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We'll only place versioned executables on the <code>PATH</code> without opt-in (i.e.,<code>--default</code> for an un-versioned Python), which I think reduces the cost of collisions. The alternative behavior we were considering was installation of a <code>python</code> shim executable in the <code>PATH</code> by default — I think this is significantly less problematic than that.</p>
<p>A separate directory for uv Python executables increases friction and is another thing we need to teach. My goal is to help beginners get going faster — I don't think power users have much difficulty getting Python on their <code>PATH</code>. I think removing the need to <code>source</code> or to otherwise update the shell is a big improvement in usability for beginners in particular. We'd also need to put it somewhere — probably in the <code>uv python dir</code>? I think installing executables in a consistent discoverable location instead is easier for users to understand.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of opportunity for users to configure this. They can set <code>UV_PYTHON_BIN_DIR</code> and avoid polluting their default bin directory. Additionally, I haven't mentioned this before, but I think we'll need to include an opt-out for this install behavior. I think that will further reduce downsides for power users that want to do something different.</p>

<p>Just to clarify: this is what I assumed, there wasn't any confusion here. I may just be anchored in the way things work today, whereby I can <code>uv python install</code> without affecting any global state.</p>
<p>I think I need to do some reading / thinking before responding to the rest.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah okay thanks for clarifying. Part of where I'm coming from is that I feel it's sensible for <code>uv python install</code> and <code>uv tool install</code> to have the same effect on global state.</p>
