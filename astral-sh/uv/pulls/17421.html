            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yet another attempt at #5714 to see if it improves CI times now that Windows test times have increased</p>
<p>I think this is worth it now</p>
<pre><code>main   (1 shard):  13m 46s
branch (2 shards): 10m 31s
branch (3 shards):  7m 34s
</code></pre>
<p>total time (a.k.a., cost increase)</p>
<pre><code>main   (1 shard):  13m 46s
branch (2 shards): 20m 18s
branch (3 shards): 21m 32s
</code></pre>
<p>As in #875, we could explore moving the build step before the sharded test runs. The build is 3m of the runtime, but I think artifact transfer and runner startup time was too expensive last time and I don't expect it to be faster.</p>
