            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The test creates a cache from multiple sources and injects faults (once using invalid data and once by making the files unreadable on the fs level), then resolves again.</p>
<p>I didn't test git because it has its own locking and correctness logic.</p>
<p>The main drawback is that this test is slow (2.5s for me), we could <code>#[ignore]</code> it.</p>

(I'm also not sure what setting both <code>write(true)</code> and <code>mode(0o000)</code> do.

<p>Mostly network i'd expect, the test run without a cache</p>
<p>I marked the test as <code>#[ignore]</code>,  i think of it as a script you can run if you want to.</p>
