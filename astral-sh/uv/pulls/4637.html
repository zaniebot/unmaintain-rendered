            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I started doing this because I wanted more control over the document but this ends up being useful for https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4638</p>
<p>I worry about the complexity of this implementation for a largely internal document (unlike the lock file which is very user facing). I think https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4638 might be better implemented by wrapping <code>PathBuf</code>. Then, in the future document could change to JSON with little effort. However, I think that we want tool definitions to be user-facing <em>eventually</em> so I'm unsure this is wasted effort or complexity.</p>
