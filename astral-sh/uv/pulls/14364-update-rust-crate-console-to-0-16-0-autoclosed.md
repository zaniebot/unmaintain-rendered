### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>console-rs/console (console)</summary>

### [`v0.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/console/releases/tag/0.16.0)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/console/compare/0.15.12...0.16.0)

#### What's Changed

The 0.15.12 release was yanked after it [turned out to be semver-incompatible](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/console/issues/264) with existing usage by several of the most popular dependent crates, because it introduced a `std` feature -- and those crates used `default-features = false` but relied on the `std`-guarded features.

The 0.16.0 API should be semver-compatible with the 0.15.x API except for the need for the `std` feature.

- Prepare 0.16.0 by [@&#8203;djc](https://redirect.github.com/djc) in [https://github.com/console-rs/console/pull/265](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/console/pull/265)

Refer to the [0.15.12 release notes](https://redirect.github.com/console-rs/console/releases/0.15.12) for more information.
