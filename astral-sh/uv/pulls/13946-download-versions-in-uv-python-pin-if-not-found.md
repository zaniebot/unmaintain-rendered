# Download versions in `uv python pin` if not found

---

_@zanieb_

As another follow-up in the vein of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13944, I noticed `uv python pin` doesn't download Python versions, which is a bit weird because we'll warn it's not found.

Seems reasonable, especially since there's settings to keep it in check.
