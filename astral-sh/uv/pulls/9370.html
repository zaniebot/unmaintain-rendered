            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR adds a notion of &quot;conflict markers&quot; to the lock file as an
attempt to address #9289. The idea is to encode a new kind of boolean
expression indicating how to choose dependencies based on which extras
are activated.</p>
<p>As an example of what conflict markers look like, consider one of the cases
brought up in #9289, where <code>anyio</code> had unconditional dependencies on
two different versions of <code>idna</code>. Now, those are gated by markers, like this:</p>
<pre><code>        [[package]]
        name = &quot;anyio&quot;
        version = &quot;4.3.0&quot;
        source = { registry = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot; }
        dependencies = [
            { name = &quot;idna&quot;, version = &quot;3.5&quot;, source = { registry = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot; }, marker = &quot;extra == &#x27;extra-7-project-foo&#x27;&quot; },
            { name = &quot;idna&quot;, version = &quot;3.6&quot;, source = { registry = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot; }, marker = &quot;extra == &#x27;extra-7-project-bar&#x27; or extra != &#x27;extra-7-project-foo&#x27;&quot; },
            { name = &quot;sniffio&quot; },
        ]
</code></pre>
<p>The odd extra values like <code>extra-7-project-foo</code> are an encoding of not just the conflicting extra (<code>foo</code>) but also the package it&#x27;s declared for (<code>project</code>). We need both bits of information because different packages may have the same extra name, even if they are completely unrelated. The <code>extra-</code> part is a prefix to distinguish it from groups (which, in this case, would be encoded as <code>group-7-project-foo</code> if <code>foo</code> were a dependency group). And the <code>7</code> part indicates the length of the package name which makes it possible to parse out the package and extra name from this encoding. (We don&#x27;t actually utilize that property, but it seems like good sense to do it in case we do need to extra information from these markers.)</p>
<p>While this preserves PEP 508 compatibility at a surface level, it does require utilizing this encoding scheme in order
to evaluate them when they&#x27;re present (which only occurs when conflicting extras/groups are declared).</p>
<p>My sense is that the most complex part of this change is not just adding conflict markers, but their simplification. I tried to address this in the code comments and commit messages.</p>
<p>Reviewers should look at this commit-by-commit.</p>

<pre><code>[[package]]

source = { registry = &quot;https://pypi.org/simple&quot; }

<p>Notice the new <code>conflict-marker</code> field. It doesn&#x27;t appear on any other entry in the lock file. (That was one of the hardest parts of this PR.)</p>

<p>If we can get some confidence in this technique with extras, then I&#x27;m pretty sure I know how to extend it to groups.</p>
<p>I think the main thing I&#x27;m worried about right now is that the logic in this PR might be treating extras as a global resource. So if your top-level package <code>foo</code> has an extra <code>x1</code> and some random transitive dependency <code>bar</code> also has an extra named <code>x1</code> that <em>isn&#x27;t</em> enabled (directly or indirectly by enabling <code>foo[x1]</code>), then I <em>think</em> my current logic will falsely assume that <code>bar[x1]</code> is active. So that could result in following dependency edges that aren&#x27;t actually activated.</p>
<p>I believe this can be resolved by enhancing conflict markers to include package names instead of just extra and group names. But this also doesn&#x27;t feel right to me, for reasons that I&#x27;m finding difficult to articulate. Another hiccup here is <code>ExtrasSpecification</code> and <code>DevGroupsManifest</code>. As far as I can tell, I am likely misusing it (in the last commit in this PR). It seems like it is only intended to be used with the root package, but in this PR, I am using it for any arbitrary dependency to check which extras are active or not. So there are probably still some knots here to untangle, but I think it&#x27;s probably an evolution on what I&#x27;ve done so far.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I think I found a case where treating extras as more &quot;global&quot; than they ought to be leads to incorrect behavior.</p>
<p>Consider this <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;project&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11,&lt;3.12&quot;
dependencies = [
  &quot;proxy1&quot;,
  &quot;anyio&gt;=4&quot;,
]

[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [&quot;proxy1&quot;]

[project.optional-dependencies]
x1 = [&quot;idna==3.9&quot;]

[tool.uv.sources]
proxy1 = { workspace = true }

[tool.uv]
conflicts = [
  [
    {package = &quot;project&quot;, extra = &quot;x1&quot;},
    {package = &quot;proxy1&quot;, extra = &quot;x2&quot;},
    {package = &quot;proxy1&quot;, extra = &quot;x3&quot;},
  ],
]
</code></pre>
<p>And this at <code>proxy1/pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[project]
name = &quot;proxy1&quot;
version = &quot;0.1.0&quot;
requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.11,&lt;3.12&quot;
dependencies = []

[project.optional-dependencies]
x2 = [&quot;idna==3.8&quot;]
x3 = [&quot;idna==3.7&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>And now do a <code>sync</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm -rf .venv uv.lock &amp;&amp; run-uv pr1 -- sync
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
Using CPython 3.11.9
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 7 packages in 13ms
Installed 3 packages in 2ms
 + anyio==4.6.2.post1
 + idna==3.7
 + sniffio==1.3.1
</code></pre>
<p>and notice that <code>idna==3.7</code> gets installed. I think it would be correct for <em>either</em> <code>idna==3.7</code> or <code>idna==3.8</code> to be installed here, but the point is to notice the version that gets picked. Now let&#x27;s watch what happens when we enable extra <code>x2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ rm -rf .venv uv.lock &amp;&amp; run-uv pr1 -- sync --extra x2
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
Using CPython 3.11.9
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 7 packages in 54ms
Installed 3 packages in 1ms
 + anyio==4.6.2.post1
 + idna==3.8
 + sniffio==1.3.1
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>idna==3.8</code> gets installed, because that&#x27;s the dependency attached to the <code>x2</code> extra in the <code>proxy1</code> package. But, crucially, notice that the top-level package does <em>not</em> have an extra named <code>x2</code>. So I believe <code>--extra x2</code> should have no effect whatsoever. So the fact that <code>--extra x2</code> influences which package is installed here seems wrong. I believe it should have no effect.</p>
<p>So I guess our conflict markers need to include not just the extra/group name, but the package activating it. I think that would solve this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I <em>finally</em> have #9289 fixed in this PR (including all examples in that issue and some other examples that I came up with). I do not believe there are any remaining <em>known</em> cases of ambiguity for extras (I haven&#x27;t handled groups yet), so if anyone is willing to try and &quot;break&quot; this PR with just conflicting extras, that would be great.</p>
<p>This PR is not in a mergeable state. So my next focus is to get it into one.</p>
<p>One major change in this PR is that, while the markers being written to the lock file are still PEP 508 compatible, they may now include some very odd <code>extra</code> values. I haven&#x27;t fully fleshed it out in this PR yet, but they will ultimately look something like <code>platform_system == &#x27;Darwin&#x27; and (extra == &#x27;extra-0-7-8-11-pytorch-cpu&#x27; or extra == &#x27;group-0-7-8-11-pytorch-wat&#x27;</code>. The reasoning for this (and the precise format shown here) is pretty complicated. There are other points in the design space, but I believe they all require abdicating PEP 508 for markers in the lock file. The high level reasoning here is that some edges in the lock file, when conflicting extras/groups are specified, must be <em>conditionally</em> walked at installation time depending on which extras/groups are activated. And that conditional logic can actually vary depending on platform, which means that the conditional logic for extras/groups has to be married to the conditional logic for the current platform.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To follow up here: when I wrote the above comment, I was still thinking we&#x27;d have &quot;normal PEP 508 marker&quot; and &quot;conflict marker&quot; as separate things in the lock file. And in that scenario, it seemed more justifiable to have our own little custom syntax for the conflict marker that we mapped back to PEP 508 markers <em>internally</em>. But since then, I&#x27;ve come to understand that these markers need to be combined since the conflict markers themselves can be dependent on the PEP 508 markers.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t want to make the markers no longer parseable by PEP 508... Maybe that&#x27;s something we should do in the future, but I felt it was good not to break that property at least for now. But that does mean that we end up with some funny looking markers that I was originally trying to avoid. (The comments and commit messages give more detail.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am pretty sure you need them to be global. A conflict marker might be something like <code>extra == &#x27;foo&#x27; or extra != &#x27;bar&#x27;</code>, for example. So you really do need to know the full set of activated extras/groups.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> part of the confusion here is that while conflict markers are using <code>extra</code>, and conflicts can be declared on extras, these don&#x27;t really resemble anything like what the PEP 508 <code>extra</code> stands for. We&#x27;re basically just abusing it to encode the conflict marker semantics into PEP 508 markers. So the standard practice for how we previously used markers for extras doesn&#x27;t really apply to conflict markers AIUI.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s a little awkward, but yes, I&#x27;ll do that. I didn&#x27;t do it originally because these are what I call &quot;marginal&quot; allocations. That is, the operation being done on them will still do <code>O(n)</code> allocs even if these are eliminated. Which in turn means that eliminating them is usually &quot;marginal,&quot; if that makes sense. But constant factors can still matter, so it&#x27;s a balancing act.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it be easier if we started at the conflicting nodes and propagated knowledge about the &quot;side&quot; of the conflict through from them? E.g.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]

      { extra = &quot;extra1&quot; },
      { extra = &quot;extra2&quot; },
    ],
]

<p>we could start at <code>project[extra1]</code> and <code>project[extra2]</code> respectively, mark every node with <code>(project, extra1)</code> or <code>(project, extra2)</code> respectively and then simplify the outgoing edges of all nodes that only have either marker.

</blockquote>
<p>I find this very difficult to reason about. On the one hand, it is certainly true that someone could use <code>extra-3-pkg-foo</code> as an extra name, and thus potentially collide with a separately defined extra named <code>foo</code> for the package <code>pkg</code>. (I think such cases would be pathological given the baroqueness of <code>extra-3-pkg-foo</code>. You not only need an extra with that name but it <em>also</em> has to be declared as a conflicting extra.) On the other hand, even if a collision does occur, it&#x27;s actually not totally clear to me that it would cause any problems. That&#x27;s because we tend to strip the &quot;normal&quot; <code>extra == &#x27;foo&#x27;</code> from markers at various points.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>A new marker type is possible (I think I suggested a new marker type or even something that isn&#x27;t a marker somewhere), but I believe it&#x27;s costly in terms of implementation effort. And even if we do have a new marker type, there is enough inter-operation going on that we&#x27;d need to be able to convert between the marker types. I think it&#x27;s doable, but yeah, a fair bit of work.</p>
<p>Some extra sigil that isn&#x27;t typically allowed in extra names is also possible... I think it&#x27;s probably less work than adding a new marker type. And the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e9d545e4a6257337b399cfa2f87d88018f42c174/crates/uv-pep508/src/marker/tree.rs#L421-L428">implementation kinda-sorta already makes room for it</a>. There&#x27;s definitely some refactoring cost involved here because we wouldn&#x27;t be able to use <code>ExtraName</code> or <code>GroupName</code>. So that means new APIs for evaluating markers with something looser than <code>&amp;[ExtraName]</code>. And new parsing APIs to &quot;allow&quot; the sigil in certain cases but continue to reject it in others. Overall possible, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s at least a couple days of work.</p>
<p>Since I think that, in order for a collision to occur, it has to be pathological, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth doing. One thing I can do as a mitigation is add a test that specifically provokes a collision and ensure behavior is reasonable.</p>

<p>I think we are bound to PEP 508 insomuch as we want to be. While these conflict markers are <em>technically</em> valid PEP 508 markers, I think they are definitely a step toward PEP 508 incompatibility since they require an encoding scheme to use properly.</p>
