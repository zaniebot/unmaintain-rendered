            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What about instead saying that we want to wait some time after a reqwest release so that regressions may get fixed, instead of waiting until after the next release? Otherwise we always have to check if something was already fixed in the latest version over being confident it&#x27;s a regression.</p>
<p>Can we extend the list to contain the transitive h2 and http dependencies too? Our bugs are often in those rather than in reqwest itself. A possible list <code>&quot;h2&quot;, &quot;http&quot;, &quot;http-body&quot;, &quot;http-body-util&quot;, &quot;hyper&quot;, &quot;hyper-rustls&quot;, &quot;hyper-util&quot;</code>. We may also consider <code>&quot;hyper-rustls&quot;, &quot;rustls&quot;</code>, though for rustls updating fast could be important security-wise? Apart from extending the list r+.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m worried that a 45-day means we get to N-1 instead of N, and then N has a fix we want. The release cadence isn&#x27;t very regular, so I don&#x27;t have a good suggestion for the actual timing.</p>

<p>What about extending <code>matchPackageNames</code> with <code>&quot;h2&quot;, &quot;http&quot;, &quot;http-body&quot;, &quot;http-body-util&quot;, &quot;hyper&quot;, &quot;hyper-rustls&quot;, &quot;hyper-util&quot;</code> and setting the cooldown shorter?</p>

<p>Isn&#x27;t that a problem for any N-1 release cycle? I think a fix release usually comes at a much faster cadence, which gives us <em>some</em> insulation from breakage by having a cooldown. The tooling doesn&#x27;t support doing N-1, so this is sort of the best approximation we can do, I think — though it&#x27;s unclear to me if N-1 solves the problem. What are you looking to specifically have change w.r.t. this point?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe relevant: I think upgrading to <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/releases/tag/v0.13.0">reqwest &gt;= v0.13.0</a> would fix #9243.
