# Return computed hashes from metadata requests

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-10 01:41_

## Summary

This PR modifies the distribution database to return both the `Metadata23` and the computed hashes when clients request metadata.

No behavior changes, but this will be necessary to power `--generate-hashes`.
