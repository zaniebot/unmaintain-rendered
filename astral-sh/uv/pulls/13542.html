<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Improving documentation by adding a section about working on existing projects in the projects guide. I didn't find anything explicit, and it is in my opinion not obvious to people new to uv. Full motivation is in #13541</p>
<p>Please feel free to change or improve the wording if necessary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's fine this way (e.g. poetry has the <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/">same order</a> (but on the other hand poetry may not be a reference since we try to do things better 😉 )). However, I'm completly open to both options, whichever you think is better!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Valid Nit. What you think about the &quot;..and the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#default-groups">default</a> dependencies&quot; with a link to the concept? I would not go into more details about platforms and Python versions at this point. I like the guides as simple and general as possible.</p>
