<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <code>reqwest</code> dependency was pinned to <code>=0.12.15</code> in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/commit/794b3ec7506e0430b088a24d2e680ed7ac8d14b4 as a workaround for https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13831.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/3900">fix is in <code>hyper-util</code> 0.1.14</a>, and <code>Cargo.lock</code> has that version, we <em>should</em> be able to unpin <code>reqwest</code> now.</p>
<p>(While we’re at it, it would seem to make sense to update the dev-dependency on <code>hyper-util</code> in <code>uv-client</code> from 0.1.8 to 0.1.14, although this does not affect <code>Cargo.lock</code> in practice.)</p>
<p>See also the declined PR https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/2743.</p>
<p>When I unpinned <code>reqwest</code>, I had to update four snapshots due to a reduced level of detail in certain error messages, which looks innocuous.</p>
<p>The tests still don’t pass due to the following:</p>
<pre><code>---- registry_client::tests::test_redirect_preserve_fragment stdout ----

thread 'registry_client::tests::test_redirect_preserve_fragment' panicked at crates/uv-client/src/registry_client.rs:1442:9:
assertion `left == right` failed: Requests should preserve fragment
  left: &quot;http://127.0.0.1:40859/foo&quot;
 right: &quot;http://127.0.0.1:40859/foo#fragment&quot;
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to be a regression associated with updating <code>reqwest</code> from 0.12.15 to 0.12.16 (https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/compare/v0.12.15...v0.12.16), since I can reproduce it after <code>cargo update reqwest --precise 0.12.16</code>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure exactly what should be done about the above test failure. Obviously, <code>uv</code> will need to unpin <code>reqwest</code> at some point. I would appreciate advice.</p>
