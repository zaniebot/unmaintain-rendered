<p>This isn&#x27;t a complete solution to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13986">astral-sh/uv#13986</a>, in the sense that it&#x27;s still &quot;fatal&quot; to <code>uv sync</code> if we fail to delete an environment, but I think that&#x27;s okay — deferring deletion is much more complicated. This at least doesn&#x27;t break users once the deletion fails. The downside is we&#x27;ll generally treat this virtual environment is valid, even if we nuked a bunch of it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If the motivation here is failing to delete Scripts\python.exe, would it be better to try to delete that one first as opposed to deleting pyvenv.cfg last?</p>
<p>Mostly I worry that Scripts\python.exe + pyvenv.cfg is enough to make a valid virtual environment IIRC (as in Python will start up), but it&#x27;s a broken one if we&#x27;ve deleted everything else, and <em>especially</em> if there&#x27;s stuff running in the background that might get weird. If the first thing we do is delete Scripts\python.exe and it fails, then we&#x27;ve left the venv unmodified.</p>
<p>(But this PR still seems like an improvement over the status quo so this is not an objection.)</p>

<p>I think that&#x27;s reasonable too, I&#x27;d probably do both? The thing with deleting <code>python.exe</code> is we probably want to use a deferred deletion, like we do for the <code>uv.exe</code> so I think the approach is a little different.</p>
<p>Any of these executables could be locked, so we&#x27;re sort of playing whackamole by deleting things first. I think <code>python.exe</code> is a good special-case though.</p>
