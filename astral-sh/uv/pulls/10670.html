            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, I have also recently implemented an <code>elvish</code>‘s <code>activate.elv</code> script. Our approach is quite similar, but I found that the <code>use</code> command of <code>elvish</code> does not support <code>re-import</code>. This means that after executing <code>deactivate</code>, if we want to enter the <code>venv</code> environment again, it will not take effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://elv.sh/ref/language.html#re-importing">Elvish Document about re-importing</a>:
Modules are cached after one import. Subsequent imports do not re-execute the module; they only serve the bring it into the current scope. Moreover, the cache is keyed by the path of the module, not the name under which it is imported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't tried your script yet, but if your script needs to be activated through <code>use ./xxx/activate</code>, there is a high probability that this issue will also occur.</p>
