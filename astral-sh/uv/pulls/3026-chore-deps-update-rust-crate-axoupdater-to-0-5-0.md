### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>axodotdev/axoupdater (axoupdater)</summary>

### [`v0.5.0`](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-050-2024-04-11)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0)

This release contains a few new features targeted primarily at testing environments.

-   A new feature enables forcing axoupdater to call a custom installer at a specified path on disk instead of downloading a new release. This is only expected to be useful for testing. ([#&#8203;77](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/pull/77))
-   It's now possible to query for a new release without performing an update. ([#&#8203;78](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/pull/78))
-   It's now possible to manually specify the release source used for querying new releases without needing to read it from an install receipt. ([#&#8203;81](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/pull/81))
