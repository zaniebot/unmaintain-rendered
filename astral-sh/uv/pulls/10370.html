            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PowerPC seems to build without errors if we upgrade <code>zlib-ng</code>, but upgrading <code>zlib-ng</code> causes Windows to break (https://github.com/rust-lang/libz-sys/issues/225), and Cargo doesn't let us include two different versions.</p>
<p>s390x fails because it can't find <code>stfle</code>. It's possible that we could fix this by by upgrading our manylinux version and/or by upgrading GCC (which may necessitate upgrading our manylinux version), but I don't know if it's fixable without one of those things? And it's not worth bumping compatibility for that reason. \cc @konstin</p>
