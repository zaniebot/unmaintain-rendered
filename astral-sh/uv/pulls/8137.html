            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is fine by me since i barely ever use <code>-vvv</code> and i see how it helps in some cases; tagging other team members who may use <code>-vvv</code> to not break their workflows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't use <code>-vvv</code> often either. This does seem to really increase the amount of output, but I don't think I have any strong objections. With that said, I think merging this would probably mean that I would definitely <em>never</em> use <code>-vvv</code> because the output is such that it's hard to read.</p>
<p>Is there a specific problem this extra level of logging is trying to solve?</p>
