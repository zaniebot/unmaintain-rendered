            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This partially addresses #17076 by adding <code>value_hint</code> to various arguments.</p>
<p>For cases where an option takes a path to either specifically a file or a directory directory, <code>ValueHint::FilePath</code> and <code>ValueHint::DirPath</code> are used respectively to try to limit the amount of noise presented by completions in shells which support it.</p>
<p>For cases where a URL (and only a URL, not a path) can be supplied, <code>ValueHint::Url</code> is used.</p>
<p>For cases where a python interpreter is to be specified, <code>ValueHint::CommandName</code> is used which will tab complete from <code>$PATH</code> by default, but will fall back to completing executable filenames if you start typing a path.</p>
<p>Finally, for the many cases where there is no built in completion which would make sense, and where default completion of a path would make no sense (e.g. a package name, or version specifier, or date) <code>ValueHint::Other</code> is used to explicitly disable completion.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Manually tested a bunch of these. These <em>could</em> be automated in the sense that we could snapshot the completion from zsh but I've not thought about how that could be done yet.</p>
