            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This represents a change to <code>--require-hashes</code> in the event that we don't find a matching hash from the registry. The behavior in this PR is closer to pip's.</p>
<p>Prior to this PR, if a distribution had no reported hash, or only mismatched hashes, we would mark it as incompatible. Now, we mark it as compatible, but we use the hash-agreement as part of the ordering, such that we prefer any distribution with a matching hash, then any distribution with no hash, then any distribution with a mismatched hash.</p>
<p>As a result, if an index reports incorrect hashes, but the user provides the correct one, resolution now succeeds, where it would've failed.</p>
<p>Similarly, if an index omits hashes altogether, but the user provides the correct one, resolution now succeeds, where it would've failed.</p>
<p>If we end up picking a distribution whose hash ultimately doesn't match, we'll reject it later, after resolution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These aren't as nice-looking, but keep in mind that for <code>--require-hashes</code>, the user has to pin <em>all</em> dependencies upfront anyway. There's no backtracking or anything.</p>
