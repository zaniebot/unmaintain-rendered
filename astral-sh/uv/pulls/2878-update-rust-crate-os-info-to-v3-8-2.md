```
 thread 'test_user_agent_has_linehaul' panicked at crates/uv-client/tests/user_agent_version.rs:210:13:
assertion `left == right` failed
  left: "22.04"
 right: "22.4.0"
```

`sys_info` and `line_info` disagree in the test here?

We hard code the value for the test input but then assert with real information from the system. Weird.
