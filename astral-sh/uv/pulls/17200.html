            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Removed .gitignore from the list of created files.</p>
<p>No issue created as quite a small change. Running <code>uv init</code> does <strong>not</strong> create a <code>.gitignore</code> file, therefore this list is slightly misleading.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ah you're correct, my apologies, I should have created an issue first and more importantly, taken the time to read the codebase rather than jump to a pr, lesson learnt!
this behaviour appears undocumented (as far as I could find) and also counterintuitive to me, a .gitignore file would be useful when also in a git repository if there isn't one already? alternatively, the wording in the docs could be changed to something along the lines of:</p>
<p>uv will create the following files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">├── .gitignore - if not already in a git repository
├── .python-version
...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think it's worth adding that nuance to the &quot;guide&quot;, it's intended to be an overview for getting started not comprehensive documentation. We could mention it in the <code>--vcs</code> reference documentation. We could also consider <code>--ignore-file</code> / <code>--no-ignore-file</code> options to toggle this separately from initializing the vcs.</p>
<p>Your other suggestion is already being discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11655 — I think it's probably reasonable to change our behavior to create it in existing repositories if there's not a parent <code>.gitignore</code>? but it gets quite complicated if we try to use a heuristic once there is a parent <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
