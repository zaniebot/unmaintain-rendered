Note that this is a fallback, we don't support-support (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/source-distribution-format/#source-distribution-file-name) these but just don't error anymore when they exist in a legacy registry. Uploading to pypi is banned (https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/blob/ae35f55aa9ae6250e7a698e34dbe64fbbf54632b/tests/unit/forklift/test_legacy.py#L1556)
