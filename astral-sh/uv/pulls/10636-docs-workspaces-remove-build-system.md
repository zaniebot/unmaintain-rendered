# docs(workspaces): remove build-system

---

_Pull request opened by @melMass on 2025-01-15 17:39_

## Summary

Unless I'm doing something wrong, specifying `hatchling` as a build system here results in `ValueError: Unable to determine which files to ship`

## Test Plan

Following the instructions of the document.

## Additional

Don't hesitate to discard
