# Use local copy of `gourgeist`

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-08 18:38_

This PR gets `gourgeist` passing our local CI and integrated into the broader workspace.

There's some duplicate between concepts in `gourgeist` (like the `InterpreterInfo`) and structs we have elsewhere, but we can tackle those later.
