The net effect is more space between the items on the far left?

Yes, sorry for not including a note. This increase the padding above the each top-level nav section e.g. "Guides" and "Concepts" to improve the clarity of the section groupings. The section items have a slightly reduced padding to compensate for the increase. There is no change for the "expandable" nav on small screens.
