            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR implements a solution to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9167">astral-sh/uv#9167</a>. It prioritizes executing the <code>uv run</code> command as a python script, if the script is installed, over executing the command as a python package or external command.</p>
Test Plan
<p>I tested my solution against the repoduction of the issue created here: https://github.com/raqbit/uv-scripts-repro/, and verified that <code>uv run foo</code> now executes the python script.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry I didn&#x27;t get to reviewing this — I looked at it and wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of the approach and figured I&#x27;d need to play with it myself to make a suggestion. I just found the time to try implementing the feature and landed on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11431">astral-sh/uv#11431</a></p>
<p>I think this approach is theoretically better, but I decided to go with the simpler practical approach for now.</p>
