            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR implements a solution to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9167. It prioritizes executing the <code>uv run</code> command as a python script, if the script is installed, over executing the command as a python package or external command.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I tested my solution against the repoduction of the issue created here: https://github.com/raqbit/uv-scripts-repro/, and verified that <code>uv run foo</code> now executes the python script.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry I didn't get to reviewing this — I looked at it and wasn't sure what to think of the approach and figured I'd need to play with it myself to make a suggestion. I just found the time to try implementing the feature and landed on https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11431</p>
<p>I think this approach is theoretically better, but I decided to go with the simpler practical approach for now.</p>
