# Re-upstream to dist to axodotdev/cargo-dist

---

_Pull request opened by @samypr100 on 2025-09-12 00:47_

## Summary

Both https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/tag/v0.29.0 and https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/releases/tag/v0.30.0 seem to contain all relevant changes from https://github.com/astral-sh/cargo-dist

## Test Plan

Not tested yet given I'd be running from a fork, but a dry-run run from astral-sh/uv would be great 😅
