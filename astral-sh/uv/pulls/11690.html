            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add example of dependency group includes</li>
<li>Refactor section to to show pyproject.toml config &amp; explanation of dependency resolution first and move CLI implementation and options into it's own section</li>
</ul>
<p>It took me a decent amount of searching through the issues and multiple attempts to resist just posting a &quot;question&quot; issue to ask how to do group includes before I finally stumbled upon the answer pointing to pep 735.  Since I had been over the docs in that section multiple times, I thought it would help to just add the answer front and center.</p>
<p>Also refactored the section to separate config from cli.  The part about resolution all being done together was something I had to search for a couple days ago and it seems like that's an important bit that should be closer to the top of the section instead of mixed in after the CLI option discussion.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask for adjustments if desired.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I started the docs server and reviewed manually.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The docs already reference <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/">PEP 735</a>.  I was going to reference it again but noticed that the pep itself points to the dependency groups spec as the canonical version.  So I linked to it.</p>
<p>However, upon reviewing the docs, I realized there was further room for improvement so pushed up another commit with some additional refactoring which removes this sentence.</p>
<p>However, it's up for debate on whether or not the existing PEP 735 reference should be kept or replaced with the link to the spec.  I'd be +0 towards the latter since the PEP points there.</p>

<p>I moved the notice to a comment in the example but wouldn't mind at all if your preference is to remove that too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR was primarily concerned with adding a section in the docs for <code>include-group</code>.  That's there now under &quot;Nesting groups&quot;.  Given the age of this PR, it can likely be closed as stale.</p>
