<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Expand environment variables that exist into their values accepting only the format ${VARIABLE_NAME_123} where the name must follow the POSIX standard of ASCII upper case letters, numbers and underscore. If the variable does not exist, it will not replace it.</p>
<p>Implements https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1473</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Adds environment variables and checks the expected file is generated</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, there's a subtle problem with this. We take a lot of care to ensure that environment variables are preserved with generating the <code>uv pip compile</code> output. E.g., if you have:</p>
<pre><code>black @ file://${PROJECT_ROOT}/black
</code></pre>
<p>Then in the generated <code>requirements.txt</code>, we'll have something like:</p>
<pre><code># This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile -
black @ file://${PROJECT_ROOT}/black
click==8.1.7
    # via black
mypy-extensions==1.0.0
    # via black
packaging==23.2
    # via black
pathspec==0.12.1
    # via black
platformdirs==4.2.0
    # via black
</code></pre>
<p>This is important because it means that the generated requirements don't contain machine-specific paths (or credentials, etc.). If we add the solution presented here, we'll lose that property.</p>
<p>I think instead we need to selectively perform this environment variable replacement in a dedicated set of reported locations. It won't be the same as pip, but I still prefer it. For example, prior to parsing the version specifier on the right-hand side, we may want to first expand environment variables. (It's okay if we don't preserve the environment variable literals in that case -- I mostly care about preserving them in URLs.)</p>

<p>Hi, I think .in files and .txt files have different requirements and should be parsed differently. For example if the version of a library is in an env variable in an .in file, you would like it to be converted to a value on a .txt file since the process is to make .txt files as final.</p>
<p>But in the case where .txt files are used directly, they need to be parsed with all the features, right?</p>
