Probably requires a bump to the Python version we test

---

_Comment by @samypr100 on 2024-04-23 19:22_

hmmm, I intentionally used 8 to make sure we still tested a supported OS here. Is the system test policy to test the most up-to-date os or the lowest compatible one?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-23 19:23_

We don't have a defined policy yet -- honestly it could make sense to test against both lowest and highest?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-04-23 19:54_

I figured we'd test against the latest unless we're specifically testing for compatibility with some old version too. Agree both makes sense though.

---

_Comment by @samypr100 on 2024-04-23 20:15_

For latest, the change would be

```diff
-    container: rockylinux:8
+    container: rockylinux:9
...
        run: |
-          dnf install python39 python39-pip which -y
+          dnf install python3 python3-pip which -y
```

The default python in rockylinux:9 is 3.9 so we don't have to be specific on the version anymore.
On rockylinux:8 the default was 3.6, which is why specific version was needed. 

On that note, it seems we can go up to Python 3.11 on 9 via `dnf install python3.11 python3.11-pip which -y`

I'll close this, and we can merge a change to add a separate job for `rockylinux:9` if anyone feels inspired to PR it :)
