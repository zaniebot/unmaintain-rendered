            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Currently, when --exclude-newer is given, all indexes that are missing it are treated entirely as unavailable. This makes it impossible to use this flag in combination with many indexes.</p>
<p>The new behavior warns about the missing field, but treats the distribution as available when the upload date it unknown.</p>
<p>This makes it possible to use this flag while still using packages from indexes that don&#x27;t support <code>upload-time</code>.</p>
Rationale
<p>If any extra-indexes are incompatible with exclude-newer, it would be more useful to have a best-effort attempt instead of ignoring the extra indexes and likely failing the solve.</p>
Test Plan
<p>I&#x27;m going to see what CI says about this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m a little unsure about the &quot;correctness&quot; of this behavior, but have felt this pain as well. Maybe we&#x27;ll want to toggle this with a configuration option so it&#x27;s opt-in?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I&#x27;m not sure this is the right behavior either. To me, if you&#x27;re using <code>--exclude-newer</code>, then it&#x27;s a very intentional opt-in to only wanting packages before a specific date. It&#x27;s a kind of hack to get a semblance of reproducibility for example. And if packages without a timestamp are allowed even when <code>--exclude-newer</code> is used, then it somewhat defeats the purpose for at least some use cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Going to close this for now as I believe it breaks a correctness contract. Feel free to open an issue if you want to discuss a configuration option.</p>
