<p>As long as I can get the behavior where it throws an error, see also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15475</p>
<p>As someone who writes scripts having commands behave differently when I run them locally vs CI is maddening and makes it really difficult to debug what went wrong.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For what it's worth, this is a pretty clear regression from #14309. I don't think we should be deleting arbitrary directories without opt-in.</p>
<p>I think the only questionable part is when <code>--clear</code> is explicitly provided. I would be okay deferring that to a future release.</p>

<p>I think we should definitely not prompt for non-virtual environments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I see, yeah it is a regression in that case. Okay, let's ship this for non-<code>--clear</code>, and leave <code>--clear</code> as-is?</p>

<p>Noted, it wasn't clear to me @charliermarsh was aware of that discussion.</p>
