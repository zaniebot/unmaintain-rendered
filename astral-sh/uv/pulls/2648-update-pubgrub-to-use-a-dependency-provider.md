# Update pubgrub to use a dependency provider

---

_@konstin_

With https://github.com/pubgrub-rs/pubgrub/pull/190, pubgrub attaches all types to a dependency provider to reduce the number of generics. We need a dummy dependency provider now to emulate this. On the plus side, pep440_rs drops its pubgrub dependency.
