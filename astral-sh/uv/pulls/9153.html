            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On large screens, we require scrolling below the fold for the next page / prev page navigation footer. This dramatically improves visibility of the left nav when looking at small pages like section overviews. Critically, this stops the height of the navigation from jumping around depending on the page you're on. On small screens, the positioning is unchanged since the nav is in a hamburger menu and it'd be annoying to scroll.</p>
<p>Eventually, we could move the next / prev nav out of the footer and into the content, e.g., as in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9121#issuecomment-2479282706.</p>
<p>These images don't quite do the change in experience justice. It's the consistency when changing pages that feels the most different.</p>

<p>I haven't looked at the code changes (requires rebasing), but ran it locally to experience it. I can look at it when rebased but feel free to merge without it.</p>
