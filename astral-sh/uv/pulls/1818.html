            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Previously, we were only checking /bin/sh. While that works in most
cases, it seems like there are still scenarios where /bin/sh isn&#x27;t an
executable itself, and is instead just a shell script that calls
/bin/dash. (See #1810 for example.)</p>
<p>In this PR, we make the <code>ld</code> detection a bit more robust by trying
multiple paths. As with previous changes, we emit copious logs to help
debug this in the future.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not totally clear how to test this. I&#x27;m not sure how to reproduce
the environment mentions in #1810 specifically since it seems like an
internal variant of WSL Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Fixes #1810</p>
