# Improve the styling of collapsible nav items

_@zanieb_

I've been a bit unhappy with the collapsible project section. I think it feels a little crowded and consequently hard to read. Here, we tweak the styling to decrease the font size a little and increase the margins. I aimed for a subtle change — we can change it more drastically later if we want.
