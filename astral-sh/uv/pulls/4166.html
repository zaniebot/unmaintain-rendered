            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We've debated this a bit but the thing that tipped me over the edge is https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4157. As-is, there's no way to represent &quot;a package should be installed, but the extra should only be installed conditionally based on the markers&quot;, because the markers sit on the <em>distribution</em>. By placing the markers on the edge, we can now represent scenarios that weren't previously representable.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4137.
Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4125.

<p>At least as of right now, I think I like the approach you've taken in this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it was because we typically test against 3.12 and 3.8. (This isn't required, it's just the common versions we use in these tests.) And so if I left it as-is, I would've had to install on 3.7 to hit the &quot;exclusion&quot; case. So it was just a bit easier to raise to 3.10, so that 3.12 is above and 3.8 is below.</p>
