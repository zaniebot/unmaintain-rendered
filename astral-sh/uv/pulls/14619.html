            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As discussed over in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14582#discussion_r2205125048 , this reimplements the important parts of the logic in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/stdio/windows.rs with some simplifying assumptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not know if the underlying syscall (<code>WriteConsoleW</code>) is async-signal-safe on Windows, but this will at least avoid the possible deadlock that can occur by using <code>eprintln!</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ReactOS's <code>WriteConsole</code> implementation says:</p>
<pre><code>    /*
     * For optimization purposes, Windows (and hence ReactOS, too, for
     * compatibility reasons) uses a static buffer if no more than eighty
     * bytes are written. Otherwise a new buffer is allocated.
     * This behaviour is also expected in the server-side.
     */
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;allocated&quot; here means using <code>CsrAllocateCaptureBuffer</code>, which allocates out of some shared heap with CSRSS, which handles the console. I am not sure if it locks. We could constrain our writes to 80 bytes at a time, I guess.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is awesome work! Excellent docs and comments. And I appreciate the <code>SAFETY</code> comments. :-)</p>
<p>I do agree that it might be wise to do better with <code>backtrace</code> if that's possible. If it were just a lock specific to backtrace I don't think I'd be too worried about it (it seems unlikely we'd be in the middle of generating a backtrace when getting a signal), but if it's doing allocs, I guess the allocator could be holding a lock. That's annoying.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Changed this to 80 bytes to avoid allocations (as mentioned above).</p>
<p>Also, I tried a different tactic for the format strings, wondering if this is more or less readable overall than the previous version. (<code>rustfmt</code> wants to expand the destructuring to one variable per line if it's more than a couple variables, and I didn't think this justified reconfiguring it or opting out.)</p>

<p>I think I prefer your change weakly over what it was before, since while it takes up more space, it seems more resistant to accidental mistakes.</p>
