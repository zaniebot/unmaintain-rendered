            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should be ready, but I have a few concerns.</p>
<p>According to PEP508, <code>python_version</code> is defined to be to <code>'.'.join(platform.python_version_tuple()[:2])</code> (i.e. no patch version, as opposed to <code>python_full_version</code>). However, we don't handle this in the existing marker code, so <code>python_version == '3.7'</code> will fail if the environment contains version <code>3.7.1</code>, which I believe is incorrect? To make this work with pubgrub we would have to normalize all marker python versions to <code>x.y.*</code>.</p>
<p>The check currently doesn't consider the special case of <code>python_version</code> and <code>python_full_version</code>, which are related and can be disjoint.</p>
<p>However, I think this can be merged as is and <code>python_version</code> markers be fixed separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sweet. The tests look great. This is awesome.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed (but didn't realize yesterday) is that this is in <code>uv-resolver</code>. I think that's fine because it should be the only place we need it. But it does seem like it would be nice for this to live in the <code>pep508_rs</code> crate. We'd have to change the implementation to not use <code>PubGrubSpecifier</code> though. But, I think it's fine for it to live here until there's a use case to move it. :-)</p>

<p>Yeah I think this is fine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I originally did have this in <code>pep508_rs</code>, but moved it because of how much simpler it would be to use <code>pubgrub</code>.</p>
