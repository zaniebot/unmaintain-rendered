<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>uv-trampoline uses Python's zipimport feature in a slightly hacky way to provide exe files, but the current method causes errors in Python 3.7 and earlier.</p>
<p>Specifically, uv-trampoline stores the Python executable path and other information as archive comments in the zip file. However, zipimport before Python 3.7 does not support archive comments (https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipimport.html#:~:text=Changed%20in%20version%203.8%3A%20Previously%2C%20ZIP%20archives%20with%20an%20archive%20comment%20were%20not%20supported ).</p>
<p>When I actually run the installed exe with Python 3.7 on Windows, I get the following puzzling error.</p>
<pre><code>$ pycowsay
  File &quot;C:\Users\nahco\.local\bin\pycowsay.exe&quot;, line 1
SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\x83' in file C:\Users\nahco\.local\bin\pycowsay.exe on line 2, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
</code></pre>
<p>This PR will support Python 3.7 and earlier by moving the path to Python, etc. (as well as the exe file content) before the zip portion.</p>
<h3>Is this necessary?</h3>
<p>Of course, Python 3.7 is EOL.
But it is still used in practice and as long as it is installable with uv, it is a good thing to support it. The change to support it is simple and will not change the cost of maintenance much.</p>
<p>Also, if this change is unacceptable, I think we should display an error indicating that the exe is not supported in Python 3.7 or earlier. In that case I am still willing to create a PR.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Simply install and run some tool using Python 3.7.
I added this for now because I don't really understand the uv code based testing method, but I will fix it if there are any problems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I also worked on the trampoline today and this will conflict with #8637 – I presume that can be reconciled though.</p>
<p>I'm a +1 on this. We'll want to hear from @konstin as well.</p>

For some works I'm stuck at Python 3.7. On Windows I have this problem that I cannot run apps/scripts directly after activating venv, or neither via <code>uv run</code>.
There is limited workaround: <code>uv run python -m &lt;MODULE&gt;</code> (only for those has same script name exposed as module name).</p>
<p>I can verify uv fully works on Python 3.7 on Windows and the only issue remained is that trampoline issue.</p>

I'm not sure if the added complexity is worth it given now that 3.8 is also effectively EOL, so we'd be supporting two EOL versions. In addition, it adds additional overhead to the developer when testing as they'd have to test 3.7 doesn't break the trampolines to @notatallshaw 's point in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7418#issuecomment-2359628408</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be difficult to put the magic number of the UV in a trivial position, since the magic number of the exe must be placed at the beginning of the file and the EOCD at the end.
The inverted version is also difficult because the length of the exe file is non-trivial. (The length of the exe file is known in advance, but this may not be very useful since it can change from version to version.)</p>
<p>I think it is possible to insert the magic number in the last 2 bytes of the EOCD (where the length of the comment is stored). Whether this will work is implementation-dependent, but a normal zip implementation should work fine.</p>

<p>We could hard-code this, I guess. Or pad to a specific size.</p>
<p>I basically need to be able to inspect the trampoline, as in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/9cb7bcfa7aa570f6a0c79d1698d7c849dfa716be/crates/uv-trampoline-builder/src/lib.rs#L39-L123</p>
<p>Notably with #8637 there isn't any zip payload at all in this variant, which perhaps simplifies things — we just won't be able to inspect the script variants.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Generally speaking I'd assume you'd always want the magic at the <code>beginning</code> or <code>end</code> (not in-between) to avoid issues with the magic casually popping up in-between twice due to other reasons (e.g. particular exe ends up having the magic repeated mid-way) which can happen often depending on the magic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we parse the EOCD and read the magic number in the middle of the file, the probability of false positives is as low as with the current method (or more).
Perhaps the problem is that the implementation would be somewhat more complicated. If we should to avoid that, padding the exe file sounds like a good idea.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One idea:  In the case of UVSC, embedding &quot;UV&quot; in the comment length section of the EOCD and using the EOCD's magic number (PK\005\006) for detection allows for a robust and reliable method that only requires static reading.
For UVPY, simply placing &quot;UVPY&quot; at the end is sufficient.</p>

<ul>
<li>For now, I've kept the magic number placed before the zip content (as before). This makes the parsing process a bit more complex, but the probability of false detection shouldn’t be an issue. Essentially, it's the same in that it relies on the probability that a specific 4 bytes appears at a specific location in the file.</li>
<li>As for tests, there are unit tests in <code>uv-trampoline-builder</code>, so I believe those are sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, whether or not we need 3.7 support is up to the maintainers, but I’ve made it so that we can merge this anyway.</p>

Basically, this invokes the provided `python.exe` executable.

The intended use is:

- First, place our prebuilt `.exe` content at the top of the file.
- After the exe file content, write the path to the Python executable that the script uses to run
  the Python script as UTF-8 encoded string, followed by the path's length as a 32-bit little-endian
  integer.
- Write the magic number 'UVPY' in bytes.

|   `&lt;path to python.exe&gt;`    |
| `&lt;len(path to python.exe)&gt;` |
| `&lt;b'U', b'V', b'P', b'Y'&gt;`  |

### How do you use it as Script runner?

Basically, this looks up `python.exe` (for console programs) and invokes
`python.exe path\to\the\&lt;the .exe&gt;`.

The intended use is:

- First, place our prebuilt `.exe` content at the top of the file.
- After the exe file content, write the path to the Python executable that the script uses to run
  the Python script as UTF-8 encoded string, followed by the path's length as a 32-bit little-endian
  integer.
- Write the magic number 'UVSC' in bytes.
- Finally, rename your Python script as `__main__.py`, compress it into a `.zip` file, and append
  this `.zip` file to the end of one of our prebuilt `.exe` files.

We can always revert this (non-breaking) change when final decision made into #8255.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By the way, I echo T-256's point that merging this PR first likely won’t cause much harm (as it can be easily rolled back if needed). But I’d love to hear your thoughts on whether that approach would be acceptable.</p>
<p>Anyway, if it looks like this might take a while longer to merge, perhaps we should consider adding a temporary patch that shows a warning or error on Windows with Python 3.7.</p>

We are currently attempting to manage our Python environments and dependencies using uv. Unfortunately, our production application uses Python 3.7.</p>
<p>Upgrading Python is contingent on us first using uv to manage and lock dependencies, ensuring that the Python upgrade will not introduce breaking changes. Judging from community feedback, quite a few users have encountered this issue while using uv, and I'm wondering if their scenarios are similar to ours.</p>
<p>Although Python 3.7 has indeed reached its end-of-life, we still very much hope this PR can be merged, as it would be immensely helpful for migrating to uv and upgrading our Python version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, I just opened a project which is un-upgradable (it works only with Python37 <code>ast</code> and <code>marshal</code> validating). it'd nice to run its executables via <code>uv run</code>.</p>
<p>@nahco314 Can you resolve conflicts of this PR, then I think I can deploy your branch and manually replace generated artifacts while using latest features of uv :)</p>

<p>The blocker is that we are hesitant to change an already complicated part of uv to support 3.7 (a version outside of both our and upstream support ranges), especially in a way that adds more complexity.</p>

<p>IIUC, implementation complexity of trampoline was described in <code>crates/uv-trampoline/README.md</code> for readers/researchers. IMO, in this PR, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8649/files#diff-1f39d28be1834a2813506fd9b872056a68cfd2569d281148dcd4f076c5b87049">that document</a> has improved.</p>

<p>I agree this version of Python is out of support now, but I see this PR has been labeled as <code>compatibility</code>. According to CI, Python3.9+ actively tested but docs didn't specify <em>compatible</em> ranges of Python version, I assume it must be <code>&gt;=3.5</code> (?). So, this PR tries to fix a compatibility issue.</p>
<p>Let's at least have one published version of uv with this change, so we can reference it with when related issues comes up for Python3.7 trampolines and check if that issue still reproducible with that version. We can revert it back when there is problem without no harm.</p>
<p>FWIW, currently there are 4 tiers of Python versions in uv:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>uv python</code> supported and actively tested: <code>&gt;=3.9</code></li>
<li><code>uv python</code> supported only: <code>3.8</code></li>
<li>compatibility supportyed only: <code>3.7</code></li>
<li>unsupported: <code>&lt;3.7</code> (see also: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7418)</li>
</ol>
<p>If decided to not merge this PR, I'd recommend blocking Python 3.7 in here:

<p>That's.. not how it works? It causes harm for us to release regressions, even if we revert it.</p>

<p>I suggest keeping it and don't revert, but can you expand that harm you mean with this change?</p>
