# Use cache for Python install temporary directories

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-05 02:21_

## Summary

It's fine for this to be in the cache, I think, since we don't necessarily need to colocate it with the Python directory.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5747.
