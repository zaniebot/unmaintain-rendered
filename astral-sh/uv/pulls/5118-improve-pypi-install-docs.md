```suggestion
There are prebuilt distributions (wheels) for many platforms; if not available for a given platform, uv will be built from source which requires a Rust toolchain to be installed. See the [contributing setup guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup) for details on building uv from source.
