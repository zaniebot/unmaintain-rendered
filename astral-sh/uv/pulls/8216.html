<p>I didn't mean to remove these when updating the regular expression. Arguably, they shouldn't be used anymore, but we should make that choice with intention.</p>

<p>Two things from my point of view:</p>
<p>One, there is a strong use case for pinning against a patch version of Python, I have seen plenty of times where patch versions of Python breaks code, so I want to be able to control when a patch version is updated and test against it carefully.</p>
<p>Two, I would not expect a tool that installs my Python versions to <em>ever</em> make certain versions unavailable without announcing it as a big breaking change. This will be particularly important for large organizations, but if I have an internal app running against Python 3.7.9, and everything is pinned, I would not expect that to suddenly not work even if that app is still running against that version of Python in 10 years.</p>

<p>Definitely agree — this was an unintentionally removal due to the peculiarities of these old artifacts.</p>
<p>Of course, this still works fine if you're using an old version of uv (and I think if you're going to be pinning and using things 10 years out you'll want to pin that!)</p>
