## Summary

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->
Partially address https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5605#issuecomment-2447089161

It puts the use cases in its own section, so the _non_ use cases are easier to find.

I still think more could be done to describe the usage of uv in non-workspace settings but I don't have specific examples at the moment, still exploring it.

## Test Plan

<!-- How was it tested? -->
