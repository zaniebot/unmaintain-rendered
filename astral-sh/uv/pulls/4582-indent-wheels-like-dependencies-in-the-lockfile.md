# Indent wheels like dependencies in the lockfile

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2024-06-27 10:15_

This PR contains two style changes to the lockfile:
* Always indent lists of objects, even with they are only a single element.
* Use 4 spaces instead of tabs for indenting, to mirror what we do in the ruff formatter.
