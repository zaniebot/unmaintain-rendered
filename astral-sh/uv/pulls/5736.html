            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Right now, if you have a <code>requirements.txt</code> with a pre-release, but the <code>requirements.in</code> does not have a pre-release marker for that dependency we drop the pre-release. (In the selector, we end up returning <code>AllowPrerelease::IfNecessary</code>, the default.)</p>
<p>I played with a few ways of solving this... The first was to remove that guard altogether. But if we do that, <code>universal_transitive_disjoint_prerelease_requirement</code> fails (we use <code>1.17.0rc1</code> in both forks, when it should only apply to one of the two).</p>
<p>The second was to do that, but also avoid pushing pre-releases as preferences when we solve a fork. But then <code>universal_disjoint_prereleases</code> fails, because we return a different pre-release in each fork.</p>
<p>Finally, I settled on allowing existing pre-releases in forks if they have no markers on them, i.e., they are &quot;global&quot; preferences. I believe this is true IFF the preference came from an existing lockfile.</p>
