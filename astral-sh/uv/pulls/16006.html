<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fix #5852</p>
<p>Switch default <code>pyproject.toml</code> indendation from 4 spaces to 2. I've hit this problem because <a href="https://pyproject-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">pyproject-fmt</a> uses 2 spaces. As per the linked issue (#5009), the example in <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements">the PyPA guide</a> also implies that.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, it would stick to 4 spaces if that's the existing indentation (as implemented in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5009). I've change the associated test case to use a non-default indentation of 4.</p>
<p>I tried to go with the simplest solution, but I appreciate that it might be considered too disruptive by the maintainers. If the project prefers to go with a more configurable solution, then it's probably best to close this and start over.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Update existing tests</p>

<p>indendation from 4 spaces to 2 to follow <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements">the PyPA guide</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, while examples use 2 spaces, there is no guidance or rule from PyPA.</p>
<p>For example, pip's pyproject.toml is completely inconsistent in the number of spaces it uses for indentation.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out, I've rephrased to make it clearer that it's not a rule from PyPA, but simply implied from the example. I landed on the issue after seeing a discrepancy between uv and pyproject-fmt.</p>
