<h2>PyO3 0.20.3</h2>
<p>This is a stability &amp; compatibility release to fix a couple of minor compilation edge cases from PyO3 0.20.2.</p>
<p>The <code>portable-atomic</code> dependency has been added to resolve compile failures on platforms without 64-bit atomic support.</p>
<p>A maximum Python version check (currently for Python 3.12) has been added to prevent using old PyO3 code against future Python versions beyond the supported range.</p>
<p>Thank you to the following users for the improvements:</p>
