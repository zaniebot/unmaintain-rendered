            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The implementation is more awkward than before here because I&#x27;m trying to keep using the <code>Realm</code> type for comparisons. We may want to consider not doing that, but I figured I&#x27;d share the draft.</p>
<p>In short, this no longer accepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A URL on a different scheme than the API (e.g., http vs https)</li>
<li>A URL with a superdomain matching the API superdomain</li>
<li>A URL with a port that differs from the API</li>
</ul>
<p>We require the CDN scheme and port to match the API URL.</p>
<p>However, we allow some special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A URL with a domain matching the API with <code>api.</code> stripped.</li>
<li>A URL with an arbitrary subdomain of the CDN domain</li>
<li>A CDN URL with the default port for the scheme (when the API is on a different port)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;ve chosen to restrict the subdomains we&#x27;ll treat as matching for the API because we <em>generally</em> should not allow credentials to be propagated across subdomains. This becomes relevant if, e.g., a user is customizing the API URL to a subdomain like <code>pyx.my-services.foo</code>, where we should not bleed credentials to arbitrary other services.</p>
