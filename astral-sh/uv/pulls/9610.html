            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Add the <code>uv build --list</code>, a &quot;subcommand&quot; to list the files that would be included when building a distribution. It does not build the distribution, except when a source dist is required for source dist -&gt; wheel. This is an important debugging tool for the include and exclude options: Did i actually include the files I wanted, or am i shipping a broken distribution? Are there any temporary files I still need to exclude?</p>
<p>Cargo offers this as <code>cargo package --list</code>.</p>
<p><code>--list</code> is preview-exclusive, since it requires the fast path, which I also put into preview.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>I'll fix the error handling in a follow-up.</p>
<p>Tagging as enhancement because it changes the stable output slightly (two lines instead of one).</p>
<p>CC @charliermarsh for uv-wide consistency in the stdout/stderr handling.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Should you mention in the docs here that this conflicts with <code>--force-pep517</code>? I might even spare a sentence or two saying why that conflict exists. (I'm guessing that in the fast path, it's easier to have a side channel asking the build backend to emit extra output? I haven't read the rest of the PR yet.)</p>

<p>(It occurs to me that &quot;fast path&quot; may be a misnomer, or at least, selling itself short. Because it isn't <em>just</em> a fast path but a required mode in order to access additional functionality.)</p>

<p>Potentially - We may grow more uv build backend only features in the future that don't work through the limited set of PEP 517 hooks. &quot;direct build&quot; is a better term now than fast path. We need to explain to users that uv build can be both the PEP 517 generic source dist and wheel builder (<code>python -m build</code>, <code>pip wheel</code>, etc.) and the CLI command to the uv build system (<code>poetry build</code>, <code>hatch build</code>, <code>maturin build</code>). The latter has more options than the former (<code>maturin build</code> is a good example), while the former is the &quot;official&quot; way, there is some agreement that <code>python -m build</code> is the &quot;official&quot; way to build. By default, uv will be the latter for the uv build backend, but we allow switching to the former with <code>--force-pep517</code>, since this is what your package's users will experience.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's correct for the output to go to <code>stderr</code> in general, and then <code>stdout</code> with <code>--list</code>.</p>
