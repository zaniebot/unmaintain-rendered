            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is my attempt at this - I don't exactly have much prior experience with
Uv's codebase and w.r.t graph algorithms I'm pretty rusty.
Let's look at this critically and try to find out if it does the right thing.</p>
<p>The strongly connected components algorithm both finds all cyclic
subgraphs, and a topological order of them. This seems to be a good
way to replace Topo with something cycle-aware.</p>
<p>The new algorithm uses the fact that in a strongly connected component,
all vertices reach each other through some edge. That means we can
combine markers of all internal edges in a component.</p>
<p>As an optimization, only outgoing edges pointing out of the current
component are updated. I didn't look outside this function, so don't
know if that's a reasonable choice.</p>

<p>I think we <em>want</em> the marker on the blue node to be <code>A and B and E</code>, but with this strategy, would it be... <code>(A or B or C or D) and E</code>? Since we'd <code>OR</code> the edges into the scc along with all the edges within the scc?</p>

<p>If we take that picture, but you had two edge at the start, A and A', both with the same target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then you want to start with A or A'?</li>
<li>Then you update with the cycle  (A or A') and B and C and D</li>
<li>Then you update E to the following: (A or A') and B and C and D and E?</li>

<p>Each edge is a marker condition, and we want each node to have the complete marker condition required for it to be included in a a resolution... So I think the desired end state here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow: A</li>
<li>Red: A and B</li>
<li>Green: A and B and C</li>
<li>Blue: A and B and E</li>
</ul>
<p>Yellow could also be written as: A or (A and B and C and D), but that just simplifies to A. In general, what I was trying to do was: edges into a node are <code>OR</code>'d, edges out of a node are <code>AND</code>'d.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is no nice property for each component/cyclic part as a unit. I think the current code (feedback arc set) seems ok so far then. I don't know how it selects edges to remove, so if it makes the wrong choice the result could be incorrect?</p>
<p>Based on two cases I've looked at, reverse postorder seems to work well, it would skip the edges we want to skip? (No definition - probably doesn't hold up) I think your graph has exactly one initial node (one root), which makes this easier.</p>

Okay. What's stopping us from simply doing the following?</p>
<p>DFS from the root nodes, propagating markers along as long as there is no cycle; when there is a cycle, you simply backtrack without propagating (because the propagation would lead to something like (markers to A) or ((markers to A) and (markers in cycle)), which simplifies to (markers to A)).</p>

<p>Finding all paths without cycles in the path sounds right. For example, to the node 3 I think all these are valid:</p>

<li>A, D</li>

<p>It's probably an optimization to run the all paths search in each SCC separately.

<p>@Peiffap So if we run dfs from both node 2 and 4, then we find all the required paths from 2 and 4 to 3. I think that the dfs from the root (0) would not find all the required paths to 3.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that's how I'm interpreting cycle-free too. Knowing an SCC basically allows us to say that node <code>N</code> in the SCC can be reached through <code>OR</code>ing all possible paths to any of the nodes in the SCC, where each path represents an <code>AND</code>ing of the edges in it, then from that node to <code>N</code>.
For example (SCC with nodes <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>N</code>): if we know all the paths to <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and we know that there is an SCC, we can already add</p>
<pre><code>((path 1 to `A`) or (path 2 to `A`) ... (path n_a to `A`) and `A -&gt; N`) or 
((path 1 to `B`) or (path 2 to `B`) ... (path n_b to `B`) and `B -&gt; N`)</code></pre>
<p>to <code>N</code>.
The thing I'm not sure about is that you <em>need</em> to do this -- as I see it, a proper DFS search (more on that later) should take care of discovering this already.</p>
<p>It's only necessary to find paths starting with the incident edges to the SCC (we should always have some edge incident, because the root is never in a cycle, hopefully?)</p>

<p>Thanks for making the example. I meant to use a modified version of DFS that only backtracks when a node is visited twice <em>in the current path</em>. I believe that would work, i.e. it would <em>eventually</em> get the right answer, but I'm not sure what implications it has for complexity (we are effectively looking at all possible simple paths which is O(n!) for complete graphs... but that's kind of what we need to do?).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I looked at computing all non repeating paths here: https://github.com/petgraph/petgraph/pull/650  It can be used on the whole graph or a subgraph (intention: used on one strongly connected component at a time.) I'm not sure if it does the useful thing we need, but it might.</p>
<p>I wanted to write the algorithm separately from the uv logic, I think it's better that way and easier to understand the code. (Not saying the code has to live in petgraph.)
In this case, paths are useful as <code>Vec&lt;EdgeId&gt;</code> (does this have a different name than path?) but in some other graph algorithms, paths are <code>Vec&lt;NodeId&gt;</code>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I meant the root of the graph in uv's code - the white node in @charliermarsh's picture and node 0 in my picture. IIUC, this is always present and it means any nontrivial SCC (has more than one node) does not contain the root and always has edges incident to the SCC (from the root or from other predecessor scc). This is useful in my example - we know that there are incident edges, we only need to compute paths from 2 and 4 in the scc?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That PR looks nice! I'll give it a more detailed look later, but it makes a lot of sense to me to focus on trails (i.e. no repeated edges) rather than paths (no repeated nodes).</p>
<p>I think you can make the assumption that the starting node never has incident edges; I believe it just represents a starting state, i.e. with no propagated markers. If that isn't the case yet for some reason, you should still be able to extend the graph by adding a new &quot;root&quot; node with no incident edges?</p>
<p>I think you're right about incident edges; for the example graph, 2 and 4 are the only possible entry points to the SCC, so you could limit yourself to computing the trails to those and then computing the trails starting in those to the rest of the SCC. Perhaps it also makes sense to only compute trails <em>to</em> nodes that have outgoing edges from the SCC (i.e. 5 and 6), since all the &quot;internal&quot; nodes (only 3 in your example) in the SCC will be covered by the trails from (2 or 4) to (5 or 6)?</p>

<ul>
<li>0 and 1 are trivial single node sccs</li>
<li>2, 3, 4 is a scc (all nodes in this group can reach each other)</li>

<p>Compute</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 0 = A</li>
<li>Node 1 = B</li>
<li>Input nodes for SCC are 2, 3</li>
<li>All paths from 2 are<ul>
<li>To 3: [E]. To 4: [E, F]   (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All paths from 3 are<ul>
<li>To 4: [F]. To 2: [F, G]   (**)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now we do all the scc nodes.</li>
<li>Node 2 = ((Node 0) AND C) OR ((Node 1) AND D) AND F AND G)<ul>
<li>Note including path from (**)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Node 3 = ((Node 1) and D) OR ((Node 0) AND C AND E)<ul>
<li>Note including path from (*)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Node 4 = ((Node 0) AND C AND E AND F) OR ((Node 1) AND D AND F)</li>
</ul>
<p>We process all paths from all input nodes together because all input nodes to an scc need to be considered in parallel. If there never was more than one input node, most of the complexity would be gone.</p>
<p>We have the following rules for how 'no marker'/None combines I believe: None OR X = None;  None AND X = X;</p>
