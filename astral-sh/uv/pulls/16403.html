            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Add PermissionDenied to error handling patterns in user(), system(), and find() methods to prevent crashes when configuration files are inaccessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include PermissionDenied in existing I/O error patterns alongside NotFound and NotADirectory</li>
<li>Provide helpful warnings when user, system, or workspace configuration files are inaccessible</li>
<li>Continue config discovery traversal when workspace directories have permission issues</li>
<li>Add test coverage comparing PermissionDenied warnings vs silent --no-config behavior</li>
<li>Ensure consistent behavior across all configuration discovery methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolves crashes that occurred when uv encountered permission denied errors while searching for configuration files in parent directories for which access is denied, and addresses inconsistencies between UV_NO_CONFIG and --no-config.</p>
<p>This caused uv to fail when only given permission to access a specific subdirectory, uv tried to keep going up the dir tree then crashed when access was denied.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! Do you have an MRE for uv hitting this issue when <code>UV_NO_CONFIG</code> is set or <code>--no-config</code> is provided? AFAICT, the changes here only affect cases in which those flags are <em>not</em> set.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @charliermarsh thanks for following up! I believe the change does affect both when both of the flags are variously set and not set, as stated in the description if it is run in a subdirectory where permission is allowed with a parent directory where permission is disallowed, and --no-config is set, uv will crash and it will not succeed prior to this fix. If I recall, --no-config didn't work properly and it tried to read the files, perhaps it still correctly didn't use them, but when permission is denied even a read or an attempted access of the file takes uv down and causes a crash. However, it is possible some aspects of those those details changed since I originally ran into the problem.</p>
<p>One easy way to test this on macos is use the macos app sandbox-exec cli and deny parent dir access but allow project dir access and run uv with and without the various flags. None of them should cause uv to crash, uv should be generally robust to valid permissions variations.</p>
<p>Also, I think the unit test included in the pull request should be a minimal reproduction, if you run the test on the main branch, I expect uv will fail the test and probably crash. If you run it with this patch, the test should pass and uv should succeed.</p>

<p>Is there an example / configuration you can provide using <code>sandbox-exec</code>? I'm curious what other things may not be behaving as expected under the sandbox constraints and what kind of support should be targeted on these type of environments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Everything else I tried seemed to work so long as the no config flag was set.</p>
<p>I don't have code ready to go I have a larger codebase in prep for potential later release but it isn't ready yet</p>
