            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It turns out that by keeping the <code>RECORD</code> file open, older versions of Windows mark it for deletion, but don't allow it to be deleted until it's closed. As such, we end up leaving the <code>.dist-info</code> directory around, since it appears non-empty; but once the program terminates, we <em>do</em> delete <code>RECORD</code>, leaving it empty. This then creates the impression that a package exists where it does not.</p>
