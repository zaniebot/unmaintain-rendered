            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Description</h2>
<p>Being able to specify relative paths for <code>cache-keys</code> is useful, but it is currently broken. This PR fixes that.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>Building a python project from maturin on a cargo workspace (i.e. it's not just the local package to trigger rebuilds from). e.g.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv]
# Rebuild package when any rust files change
cache-keys = [
    { file = &quot;pyproject.toml&quot; },
    { file = &quot;Cargo.toml&quot; },
    { file = &quot;.cargo/config.toml&quot; },
    { file = &quot;**/*.rs&quot; },
    { file = &quot;../sv2_behaviors/**/*.rs&quot; },
    { file = &quot;../sv2_collisions/**/*.rs&quot; },
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<h3>Why it's broken</h3>
<p>The previous tool, <code>globwalker</code>, cannot handle relative paths - it just silently passed over them. It's a long standing issue (5+ years) that's not likely to be fixed given that it's in maintenance mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/Gilnaa/globwalk/issues/28.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Plain old <code>glob</code> can handle relative paths. It is obsessed with working from <code>cwd</code> though, so this PR provides some assistance to redirect the relative paths to that rather than the directory that the toml file is in though.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I have a unit test in place to check for the relative path lookups.</p>

<p>First time contributing here, please do point out where and how I might better integrate this contribution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I <em>think</em> the technique here is sound, but I'm not certain. @charliermarsh How good is our test coverage here? IIRC, another concern here was perf. This PR I think is changing it to a world where every glob results in its own distinct directory traversal, which seems like it might be an issue. It might be better to just use <code>globset</code> with <code>walkdir</code>.</p>
