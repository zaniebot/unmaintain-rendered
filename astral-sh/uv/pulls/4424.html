<p>As for the name... Is this something that you think will be commonly used on the CLI? If so, I think I'd favor a shorter name. Otherwise, I like the descriptiveness of <code>--toolchain-preference</code>.</p>
<p>One other possible downside is redundancy here. Namely, <code>--toolchain-preference prefer-system</code> has &quot;prefer&quot; twice in it, but arguably is just as clear if &quot;prefer&quot; only appeared once. Not quite sure what the right answer is there.</p>

<p>Agree, this is a source of discomfort for me but idk it's also very clear.</p>
<p>I don't expect this to be used much from the CLI — mostly as a persistent configuration option.</p>

<p>I think that's probably okay. I thought of that too, but wondered whether it might leave folks wondering the difference between <code>managed</code> and <code>only-managed</code>.</p>
