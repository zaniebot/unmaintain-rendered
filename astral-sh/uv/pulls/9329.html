<blockquote>
<p>On windows, <code>[project.scripts]</code> will create a terminal. If you're writing a GUI application and don't want a terminal on Windows, use <code>[project.gui-scripts]</code> instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it would be worthwhile to have a mention (even if it is brief) to application entry-points. Although the more detailed documentation can be found in the pyproject.toml specification &amp; writing guide, I am sure a lot of new users will learn about the features of a pyproject.toml only from uv's documentation. If we can at least say those features are available and signpost where to find out more that would be very useful.</p>
<p>I speak from what I would have found useful when I was learning. Hatch's pyproject.toml documentation is very good (possibly because it makes use of the plugin system in its build backend hatchling), whereas flake8 makes use of the plugin system and has quite outdated and lacking documentation in my opinion.</p>
<p>Perhaps full examples are not necessary, but I think a mention to them would be very valuable</p>

<pre><code class="language-markdown">The `group` key can be an arbitrary value, it does not need to include the package name or
&quot;plugins&quot;. However, it is recommended to namespace the key by the package name to avoid collisions
