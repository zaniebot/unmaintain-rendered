The massive diff in the `cli.md` can be broken down into four kinds of changes in the generated CLI reference html page:

* Whitespace/newlines: The new markdown and resulting html is a lot denser, though I did not see any visible changes.
* Escapes: The new version does not html-escape `'` anymore, it now uses the character verbatim.
* Double quotes instead of single quotes for `href=`. 
* `<https://...>` links in the documentation now work.
