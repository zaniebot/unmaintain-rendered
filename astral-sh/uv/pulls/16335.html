            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Resolves #16306</p>
<ul>
<li>Default non‑editable for workspace deps in tool installs<ul>
<li>Tools no longer get editable .pth links to workspace members; installs are self‑contained.</li>
<li>Passing --editable makes both the target package and workspace members editable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Share editable conversion across commands<ul>
<li>Move editable conversion into apply_editable_mode and reuse from both sync and tool install</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tool install integration tests<ul>
<li>Default non‑editable workspace member (<code>tool_install::tool_install_no_editable_workspace_member</code>):</li>
<li>Explicit --editable (<code>tool_install::tool_install_workspace_editable</code>):</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locally used built uv with the Python project mentioned in #16306 and observed that changes to workspace dependency source code no longer changed tool behavior unless <code>--editable</code> was used</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I spent a bit of time exploring an alternative (mostly guiding Claude) and was considering something more of the flavor here https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/zb/tool-workspace</p>
<p>I'm not sure which is best yet, I'll try to find time to look closer but my time is elsewhere right now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven't had a chance to look further. I'm pretty sure the approach in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16335#issuecomment-3439165062 makes more sense, but maybe @konstin can confirm he agrees before you pursue that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The approach in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/zb/tool-workspace makes more sense to me: We should decide before doing the resolution if the default for workspace packages should be editable or non-editable, instead of changing this after the resolution is done.</p>
<p>There's also the question whether we want to expose inheriting the workspace editable state to users (like <code>path = &quot;foo&quot;, editable = &quot;workspace&quot;</code>), but that's a second or third step.</p>
