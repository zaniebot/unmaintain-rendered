<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR solves an issue on Windows that platform-specific paths are written to the <code>RECORD</code> file when installing, which is inconsistent with PEP 376, quoting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each record is composed of three elements:</p>
<p>the file’s path</p>
<ul>
<li>a ‘/’-separated path, relative to the base location, if the file is under the base location.</li>
<li>a ‘/’-separated path, relative to the base location, if the file is under the installation prefix AND if the base location is a subpath of the installation prefix.</li>
<li>an absolute path, using the local platform separator</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Test case included</p>

<p>It is related to the change, ~~which I have fixed~~.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have a difficulty following the way through how install receipt is written, since I don't have a Windows machine to test.</p>
