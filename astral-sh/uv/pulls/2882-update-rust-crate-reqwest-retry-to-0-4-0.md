I'm not sure why the changelog isn't present, there's not an entry in the [repository](https://github.com/TrueLayer/reqwest-middleware/blob/main/reqwest-retry/CHANGELOG.md) either.

Let's just ignore this for now. I'm doing the reqwest update all-at-once (and this is "part of" reqwest-middleware, or at least they're in the same workspace).
