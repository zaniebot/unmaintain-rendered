"Install and manage Python for you", maybe?

I think the comma after behavior is a little off. Maybe a semicolon or em dash?

Have avoided "you" so far (though it's not a big deal to use it in general, looking for consistency)

```suggestion
uv will also use an existing Python installation if already present on the system. There's no configuration necessary for this behavior: uv will use the system Python if it satisfies the requirements of the command invocation. See the [Python discovery](../python-versions.md#discovery-order) documentation for details.

I might use "will" instead of "should" here. I think you use "will" below.
