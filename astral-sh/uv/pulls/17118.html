            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A bunch of test failures here but they might be correct, since they all represent us producing lockfiles with at least one empty entry (typically for something like <code>torch</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A less strict formulation: Determine which maker in <code>tool.uv.environments</code> the current <code>env</code> is a sub-environment of (the marker of <code>env</code> is contained in the marker in <code>tool.uv.environments</code>), and then check the package against that marker. This ensures that the <code>env</code> narrowing from additional forking doesn't fail a resolution that would otherwise pass. This may be functionally equivalent to making <code>tool.uv.environments</code> being treated as required-environments.</p>
<p>There's also a problem I'm not sure we can solve: We only know whether a package will have no distributions in the lockfile after we've done the entire resolution: Consider a package that has only a macOS arm64 wheels, no source dist. The first fork we process is macOS x86_64. When we process the package, it has no distributions. The final fork we process is macOS arm64. Depending on whether we see a dependency on the package in that fork, it may or may not have no distributions in the lockfile. In the scenario, the user may or may not have set <code>tool.uv.environments</code> to <code>sys_platform == &quot;darwin&quot;</code>, this problem should affect either case. It should also work without forking, by only considering two conditional dependencies with macOS arm64 and macOS x86_64 markers respectively.</p>
