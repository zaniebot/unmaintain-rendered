# Ignore `install_git_private_https_pat_and_username` for now

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

Temporarily disabling `install_git_private_https_pat_and_username` since running this test can break your local Git authentication for other projects. I experienced this today and keep finding myself needing to ignore it locally.

See: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1980.
