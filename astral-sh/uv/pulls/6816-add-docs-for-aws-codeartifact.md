## Summary

This adds explicit information about using `uv` with AWS CodeArtifact (both as an extra index to fetch private packages and also to publish packages using `twine`).

## Test Plan

Thank you for contributing! I touched this up for consistency with our other documentation and tried to make it a bit easier to read. Want to let me know if I made any mistakes?
