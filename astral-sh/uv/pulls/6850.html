<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<ul>
<li>Fixed the directory structure and commands for the second scenario #6833</li>
<li>Added a headline &quot;Migrating an existing FastAPI project&quot; because the first part looks like a migration scenario, but didn't have its own section before.</li>
<li>Added explicit <code>--app</code> flags to commands to emphasize that the commands create an Application project. Although maybe unnecessary considering that <code>--app</code> is now default.</li>
<li>Added instructions for testing that the dev server and Docker image work correctly</li>
<li>Took the liberty of adding a <code>project</code> at the root of all directory structures and appropriate commands.<ul>
<li>With explicitly defined root directory it is easier to differentiate between the <code>project</code> root directory and FastAPI's <code>app</code> directory.</li>
<li>Without it it could be less obvious for developers less familiar with FastAPI. Had a similar issue when started using Django several years ago.</li>
<li>If I left <code>app</code> in the command, then after copying the <strong>app directory</strong> from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-fastapi-example the path would be <code>app/app/...</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cleaned up glyphs in tree sctructures that were copied from FastAPI docs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
<li>On project initialization <code>hello.py</code> is created. It is not reflected in directory structure trees in this PR and may be slightly confusing for developers less familiar with uv.<ul>
<li>I believe it will be soon addressed in #6750 and after that the docs will reflect actual directory structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh! We both did this at once. I'm going to merge https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6851 quick because it's shorter, but I think some of your changes still make sense if you want to rebase after? I think we can just drop the whole second section now that I wrote the first to use <code>uv init</code>.</p>

<p>Sure, I'll fix my PR.</p>
<p>Based on what you saw, is there anything I should change? Maybe add/not add/clarify something?</p>
