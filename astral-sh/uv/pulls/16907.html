            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're showing a bad error message in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/16906 where we say duplicate filename but don't show the filename, upgrading the zip crate shows the filename in the error message.</p>
<p>Older versions of the crate are still supported.</p>
<p>This pulls in a new dependency: https://github.com/hasenbanck/lzma-rust2. No benchmarking, xz compressed archives are rare in Python. I've asked for a new release for the zip crate so we don't start with a previous version in https://github.com/zip-rs/zip2/issues/479</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for checking! As far as Debian is concerned, upgrading dependencies to the latest version rarely hurts. This case looks fine to me - it can be that Debian's packaging of uv initially downgrades zip to version 5, until version 6 is available.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for checking! This should be just fine. We don’t have <code>rust-zip</code> updated to 6.0 yet in Fedora, but since several older versions are still allowed by the version range in <code>Cargo.toml</code> in this PR, that won’t be a problem. The big jump for us was from pre-1.0 “old maintainers” to post-1.0 “new maintainer who took over abruptly and then released tons of new code,” https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3642.</p>
