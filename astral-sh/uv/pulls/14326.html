            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adds a cache bucket for Python installs and uses it by default during tests, extending the opt-in cache added in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12175</p>
<p>Updates the <code>python_install</code> tests to use a shared cache for Python installs. This reduces the <code>python_install</code> test runtime on my machine from 23s -&gt; 17s. The difference should be much larger on machines with slower internet and less cores for test workers :) This should also improve stability in CI by reducing reliance on the network during test runs, see #14327</p>
