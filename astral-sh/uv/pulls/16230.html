            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Generating uv and uvx's autocompletions can take over half a second on even a moderately fast system, while loading pre-prepared files can be two orders of magnitude faster. This commit provides users with a general-purpose technique for generating autocompletion files offline, which could contribute to significantly faster shell startup times.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Documentation change - manual testing</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm it only takes 5ms on my machine, you're seeing half a second? That seems way too slow.</p>
<p>Separately, this might be nice to have but doesn't seem appropriate for our installation guide — it's too detailed. We'll want to find somewhere else for it, e.g., in the Reference, but I'm not sure where would be best yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>~300ms after some upgrades, yes. Then the cache kicks in and subsequent runs are much faster, but obviously only the first one matters.</p>
<p>I know it's general-purpose, but uv is the main culprit in my scenario, hence the uv docs. In the meanwhile I put it in its own <a href="https://gist.github.com/morags/31ef8d0b1b8da7f8b55f8380c904e6fa">gist</a>, in case it doesn't fit here.</p>
