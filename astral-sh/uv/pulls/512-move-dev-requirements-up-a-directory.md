# Move dev requirements up a directory

---

_@konstin_

Remove a dev annoyance: This makes the development paths shorter, e.g. `scripts/benchmarks/requirements/all-kinds.in` to `scripts/requirements/all-kinds.in`. The requirements are also shared between different tasks and not only used for benchmarking.
