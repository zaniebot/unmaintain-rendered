# Update the exclude newer duration tests to demonstrate package version changes

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2025-12-09 19:56_

Follows #16814 updating the test cases with Claude so that the timestamps and durations are on the boundary of package versions so we see actual version changes in the lockfile.
