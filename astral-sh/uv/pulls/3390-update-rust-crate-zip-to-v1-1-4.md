<details>
<summary>zip-rs/zip2 (zip)</summary>

### [`v1.1.4`](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#114---2024-05-04)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/compare/v1.1.3...v1.1.4)

##### <!-- 1 -->🐛 Bug Fixes

-   Build was failing with bzip2 enabled
-   use is_dir in more places where Windows paths might be handled incorrectly

##### <!-- 4 -->⚡ Performance

-   Quick filter for paths that contain "/../" or "/./" or start with "./" or "../"
-   Fast handling for separator-free paths
-   Speed up logic if main separator isn't '/'
-   Drop `normalized_components` slightly sooner when not using it
-   Speed up `path_to_string` in cases where the path is already in the proper format

##### <!-- 7 -->⚙️ Miscellaneous Tasks

-   Refactor: can short-circuit handling of paths that start with MAIN_SEPARATOR, no matter what MAIN_SEPARATOR is
-   Bug fix: non-canonical path detection when MAIN_SEPARATOR is not slash or occurs twice in a row
-   Bug fix: must recreate if . or .. is a path element
-   Bug fix

##### <!-- 9 -->◀️ Revert

-   [#&#8203;58](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/pull/58) (partial): `bzip2-rs` can't replace `bzip2` because it's decompress-only

### [`v1.1.3`](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#113---2024-04-30)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/zip-rs/zip2/compare/v1.1.2...v1.1.3)

##### <!-- 1 -->🐛 Bug Fixes

-   Rare bug where find_and_parse would give up prematurely on detecting a false end-of-CDR header
