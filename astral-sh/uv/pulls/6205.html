            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR migrates uv&#x27;s use of <code>chrono</code> to <code>jiff</code>.</p>
<p>I did most of this work a while back as one of my tests to ensure Jiff
could actually be used in a real world project. I decided to revive
this because I noticed that <code>reqwest-retry</code> dropped its Chrono dependency,
which is I believe the only other thing requiring Chrono in uv.
(Although, we use a fork of <code>reqwest-middleware</code> at present, and that
hasn&#x27;t been updated to latest upstream yet. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure of the
process we have for that.)</p>
<p>In course of doing this, I actually made two changes to uv:</p>
<p>First is that the lock file now writes an RFC 3339 timestamp for
<code>exclude-newer</code>. Previously, we were using Chrono&#x27;s <code>Display</code>
implementation for this which is a non-standard but &quot;human readable&quot;
format. I think the right thing to do here is an RFC 3339 timestamp.</p>
<p>Second is that, in addition to an RFC 3339 timestamp, <code>--exclude-newer</code>
used to accept a &quot;UTC date.&quot; But this PR changes it to a &quot;local date.&quot;
That is, a date in the user&#x27;s system configured time zone. I think
this makes more sense than a UTC date, but one alternative is to drop
support for a date and just rely on an RFC 3339 timestamp. The main
motivation here is that automatically assuming UTC is often somewhat
confusing, since just writing an unqualified date like <code>2024-08-19</code> is
often assumed to be interpreted relative to the writer&#x27;s &quot;local&quot; time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, with #6206 merged, Chrono is now removed from <code>uv</code>&#x27;s dependency tree:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo tree -e normal | rg chrono
$
</code></pre>
<p><code>chrono</code> does still appear in the lock file, but I think that&#x27;s from
<code>axoupdater-&gt;homedir-&gt;wmi-&gt;chrono</code>.</p>
