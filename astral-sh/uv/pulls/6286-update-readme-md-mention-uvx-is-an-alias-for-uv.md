## Summary

I think it's important to clarify that `uvx` is simply an alias for `uv tool run`. This distinction helps avoid confusion about when to use `uv` versus `uvx`.  I thought the [blog post](https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging) explained this well.

Just something that I ran into, I understand others may have a different perspective!  

## Test Plan

n/a
