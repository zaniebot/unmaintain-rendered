Summary


<p>I am a new uv user and I was reading the docs to better understand the project scope &amp; best practices. The section on <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/run/#signal-handling">signal forwarding</a> with <code>uv run</code> caught my eye because I&#x27;ve used tools that use SIGHUP to trigger config reloads or SIGUSR1/2 to enable debugging/profiling/etc so I was a little concerned about using a runner that might block those signals. After some searching in issues/PRs, I found that this behavior was actually <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13017">changed earlier this year</a> to forward additional signals (awesome!) and thought I would update the docs and save the next person/llm from thinking their tool won&#x27;t work as expected if it uses custom signal handling.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your great work!</p>
<p>P.S. If you think it makes more sense to explicitly list all forwarded signals as opposed to just the exclusions, I&#x27;m happy to edit.</p>
