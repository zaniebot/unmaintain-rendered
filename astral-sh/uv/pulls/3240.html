            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Previously, this would use the &quot;system&quot; temporary directory.
Because we rename the resulting directory to its final destination,
and because renaming is implemented via hardlinking, and because
hardlinking doesn't work across mount points, and because /tmp is
commonly on a different mount point than where <code>uv</code> is checked out,
we &quot;fix&quot; this by putting the temporary directory somewhere close to
the final destination of the fetched artifact.</p>
<p>There are alternatives we might consider pursuing. For example,
if the <code>rename</code> fails, then we should probably do a recursive
directory copy. But this is a quick fix for now and it also
consistent with colocation of other temporary directories in <code>uv</code>.</p>
<p>The main downside of this change is that if a user does ^C while
<code>uv-dev fetch-python</code> is running, then there is no mechanism for
cleaning up temporary directories.</p>
