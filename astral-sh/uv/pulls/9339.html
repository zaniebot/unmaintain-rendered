            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a second pass at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7556, which was reverted in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7608 due to a regression in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7606. The behavior is actually correct, but a package (<code>nmslib</code>) publishes inconsistent metadata, and the change here happened to cause us to select a wheel with &quot;wrong&quot; metadata. It's arbitrary, but it did cause a regression for folks.</p>
<p>Since we're now seeing other issues caused by the wrongness here (and since the reporter in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7606 has since removed the dependency), I'm inclined to ship this fix.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7553.
Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9283.</p>

<p>One of the linked issues comes from selecting Python 2 wheels? I feel like we should never read metadata from those?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can change that, but why hesitant? The current behavior is legitimately incorrect — it treats less compatible wheels as more compatible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>invalid platform as more compatible than invalid Python</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like we prefer an invalid platform over an invalid Python version — I don't see one of those as more-correct?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the PR title is kind of bad (I copied it over from the previous PR). My understanding of what's happening is that, at present, if we have two wheels with incompatible tags, we treat the wheel the wheel with &quot;less compatible&quot; tags as &quot;higher priority&quot; (which is wrong). Later, in error reporting, we say <code>no wheels with a matching Python implementation tag</code> if the &quot;highest priority&quot; tag is <code>IncompatibleTag::Python</code>, because we're demonstrating that the best wheel we could find uses a different Python implementation. But that's not true -- there <em>are</em> wheels with matching Python implementations, we just treated them as &quot;lower priority&quot; by accident.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Basically: I think everywhere else we actually <em>do</em> encode that mismatching platform tag is more compatible than mismatching Python implementation or ABI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug, Eq, Ord, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Clone)]
pub enum IncompatibleTag {
    /// The tag is invalid and cannot be used.
    Invalid,
    /// The Python implementation tag is incompatible.
    Python,
    /// The ABI tag is incompatible.
    Abi,
    /// The Python version component of the ABI tag is incompatible with `requires-python`.
    AbiPythonVersion,
    /// The platform tag is incompatible.
    Platform,
}
</code></pre>
<p>So the system assumes that in various places. Right now, we would actually actively prioritize Python 2 wheels over Python 3 wheels.</p>
