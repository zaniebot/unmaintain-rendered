<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I Googled for hours trying to solve this error message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Python installation is managed by uv and should not be modified.
Consider creating a virtual environment with <code>uv venv</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I propose change the second sentence as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider creating a virtual environment with <code>uv venv</code>, or use <code>--break-system-packages</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>No need really, just adding some description text</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We intentionally do not recommend <code>--break-system-packages</code>. If the interpreter is marked as externally managed, we should respect that and not install in it anyway. <code>uv venv</code> is the correct recommendation here, and we should not add a recommendation to ignore PEP 668 in the error message.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>bummer. I had a python setup with base_prefix==prefix and want <code>uv</code> to install some libs for me</p>
<p>It's inside a docker so there is ZERO reason to setup another venv. Everything should be kept minimal</p>
<p>I tried.</p>
