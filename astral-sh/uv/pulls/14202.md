#### What's Changed

- Update README.md by [@&#8203;nebuk89](https://redirect.github.com/nebuk89) in [#&#8203;407](https://redirect.github.com/actions/download-artifact/pull/407)
- BREAKING fix: inconsistent path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID by [@&#8203;GrantBirki](https://redirect.github.com/GrantBirki) in [#&#8203;416](https://redirect.github.com/actions/download-artifact/pull/416)

#### v5.0.0

##### 🚨 Breaking Change

This release fixes an inconsistency in path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID. **If you're downloading single artifacts by ID, the output path may change.**

##### What Changed

Previously, **single artifact downloads** behaved differently depending on how you specified the artifact:

- **By name**: `name: my-artifact` → extracted to `path/` (direct)
- **By ID**: `artifact-ids: 12345` → extracted to `path/my-artifact/` (nested)

Now both methods are consistent:

- **By name**: `name: my-artifact` → extracted to `path/` (unchanged)
- **By ID**: `artifact-ids: 12345` → extracted to `path/` (fixed - now direct)

##### Migration Guide

##### ✅ No Action Needed If:

- You download artifacts by **name**
- You download **multiple** artifacts by ID
- You already use `merge-multiple: true` as a workaround

##### ⚠️ Action Required If:

You download **single artifacts by ID** and your workflows expect the nested directory structure.

**Before v5 (nested structure):**

```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    artifact-ids: 12345
    path: dist

### Files were in: dist/my-artifact/
```

> Where `my-artifact` is the name of the artifact you previously uploaded

**To maintain old behavior (if needed):**

```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v5
  with:
    artifact-ids: 12345
    path: dist/my-artifact  # Explicitly specify the nested path
```
