            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Python 3.14, which is now in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0745/">feature freeze</a>, introduced a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/119535">change</a> (note: the name has been renamed in the second PR of this ticket) in the <code>venv</code> module.</p>
<p>More precisely, the interpreter is available in the <code>$PATH</code> once the venv is activated with yet another name.</p>
<p>This change is only for non-<code>nt</code> operating systems, and only for Python version 3.14 specifically.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m no rust developer, so I may have made mistakes when porting the code to rust. Please review accordingly!</p>
<p><em>I use a vague commit message to avoid spoiling the fun 🐇🥚</em></p>
Test Plan
<p>I ran <code>uv venv</code> under a linux machine and checked the content of the <code>.venv/bin</code> directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>With Python 3.13, it was as before the PR</li>
<li>With Python 3.14b1, a new symlink is created</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for contributing. I&#x27;m actually not sure I want to support this, I think it&#x27;s more confusing than it&#x27;s worth :/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries, I understand. You can read in the issues and PRs on CPython discussions about whether it would cause issues for nothing. I believe that in the end, having the name starting with a non-ascii letter (especially not with a <code>p</code>) means that it will not get shown when users try to autocomplete <code>python</code>.</p>
<p>It landed in <code>venv</code> module, so I thought you may be interested to have it in your crate as well, and this is why I created the PR. I personally think that is the kind of little things that can bring joy when discovered, which I believe was the intent on CPython.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, the maintenance cost falls on you, so no hard feelings if you don&#x27;t want to get this merged!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Python 3.14 is officially released, time to close the PR I guess. As I said, no hard feelings!</p>
<p>Enjoy the new Python version everyone! :partying_face:</p>
