<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Changed the appending <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to an overwriting <code>&gt;</code>
The reason being that if the <code>echo 'uv generate-shell-completion fish | source' &gt;&gt; ~/.config/fish/completions/uv.fish</code> command were to be executed twice, it would result in a redundant mass in the fish file.
Instead, a direct write would be more appropriate, allowing for the completions to be updated if necessary, should <code>uv</code> get more commands in an update.</p>
<p>Granted, it's not assumed that the completions command is going to be run more than once on the other shells, but this is a trivial change that I think would provide marginal improvements to whomever may need to use it</p>
