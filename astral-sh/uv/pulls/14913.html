            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking into  https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14836</p>
<p>This does resolve the issue, if the user adds <code>python_version == '3.8.*'</code> to the <code>required-environments</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In contrast to platform markers, I think we might <em>always</em> want to enforce that the Python version markers are satisfied by the implied markers, even if they're not defined as a required-environment. However, I'm curious if we should land this pull request <em>first</em> since it's an incremental improvement and we can get a sense of whether or not this has unintended effects? Then we can land doing this by default as a subsequent change?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think we <em>should</em> always enforce this, unlike platform markers.</p>
<p>I'm okay shipping this first if you'd prefer.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The only downside here is that the lockfile markers get unnecessarily more-complex in some cases, as you can see from the diffs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agree it's a bummer the markers are more complex. I guess some of that noise would be cut out if we treated <code>platform_python_implementation</code> differently. I think it's sort of fine though.</p>

<p>I'll try to look into that in the next week or so.</p>
