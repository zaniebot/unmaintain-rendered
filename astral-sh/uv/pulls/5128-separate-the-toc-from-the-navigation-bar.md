# Separate the TOC from the navigation bar

---

_@zanieb_

Starting a discussion.

I find the navigation bar too long and verbose, it's overwhelming. I think we either need to either:

- Limit the depth of the navigation bar (i.e. via `toc_depth: 2`)
- Move the table of contents out of the navigation bar over to the right side

I prefer the second, though I think we ought to do some styling to improve the aesthetics.

I'm ok with moving the ToC to the right.
