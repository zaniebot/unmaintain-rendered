### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>owo-colors/owo-colors (owo-colors)</summary>

### [`v4.2.0`](https://redirect.github.com/owo-colors/owo-colors/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#420---2025-02-22)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/owo-colors/owo-colors/compare/v4.1.1...v4.2.0)

##### Added

-   `Style::prefix_formatter` and `Style::suffix_formatter` return `Display` formatters for the prefix and the suffix of a style, respectively.
-   All the `*Display` types now have an `into_styled` function that converts those types into a `Styled`, erasing type parameters.
-   Even more methods are now `const`.

##### Changed

-   The `Color` and `DynColor` traits are now explicitly marked sealed (i.e. downstream crates cannot implement them).

    These traits were already effectively sealed due to a number of hidden methods that were not part of the API, but they are now explicitly so. In that sense this is not a breaking change, so it's being released under a new minor version rather than a major version.

### [`v4.1.1`](https://redirect.github.com/owo-colors/owo-colors/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#411---2025-02-22)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/owo-colors/owo-colors/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1)

##### Added

-   The vast majority of owo-colors is now usable in const contexts.

##### Fixed

-   Documentation for `Stream` is now rendered properly. Thanks [purplesyringa](https://redirect.github.com/purplesyringa) for the contribution!
-   Replace brittle const-promotion-based unsafe code with safe code. Thanks [Manish](https://redirect.github.com/Manishearth) for the contribution!

##### Other

-   owo-colors now lives under its own organization, https://github.com/owo-colors.

[4.2.0]: https://redirect.github.com/owo-colors/owo-colors/releases/tag/v4.2.0
