            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Relocates the <code>.venv</code> default venv name into a settings file that can be customized.</p>
<p>I couple of decisions I&#x27;m certain will end up getting questioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>etcetera vs dirs: Using <code>etcetera</code> preempts the moment where someone uses <code>dirs</code> to implement settings and annoy all the macos users who dont want their settings to live in <code>Application Support/</code>. (Like all the other rust tools using dirs/dirs-next that end up getting issues reported against them).</li>
<li>Addition of <code>toml_edit</code> over <code>toml</code>. Mostly I&#x27;m just unfamiliar with <code>toml</code> and already have working code using toml-edit 😬 . Secondarily I figured long-term you&#x27;d probably implement <code>uv init</code> or <code>uv add</code> that will want to write toml, and you&#x27;ll end up swapping to <code>toml_edit</code> then anyways.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&#x27;re not ready to commit to specific settings, or otherwise already have a system (i.e. something from ruff) in mind that you&#x27;d want to replicate, feel free to close this. Rather than submitting an issue, I figured I could quickly do the thing I&#x27;d otherwise be requesting.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t attempt to implement any tests in case this was quickly dead in the water.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey Dan! Thanks for taking the time to open a pull request and sketch this out.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re definitely not ready to commit to a configuration file yet, we want to approach it holistically since we&#x27;ll need to remain backwards-compatible with what we choose for the foreseeable future. We might need to create an issue to discuss what people want from their configuration.</p>
