# Add `--reinstall` flag to `uv python upgrade`

---

_@jtfmumm_

As described in #15179, there are cases where it can be useful to reinstall the latest patch on upgrade if it is already installed. Using this flag, you don't need to know ahead of time if you have the latest patch already.

Closes #15179.
