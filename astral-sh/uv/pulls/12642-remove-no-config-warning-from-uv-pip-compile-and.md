# Remove `--no-config` warning from `uv pip compile` and `uv pip sync`

_Pull request opened by @j178 on 2025-04-03 03:44_

uv has a global `--no-config` option, which indeed has an effect.

## Test Plan

```console
❯ cat pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"

[[tool.uv.index]]
url = "http://non-exist-host.com/simple"
default = true

❯ echo requests | uv pip compile -
