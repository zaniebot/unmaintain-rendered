### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>axodotdev/axoupdater (axoupdater)</summary>

### [`v0.7.0`](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#Version-070-2024-07-25)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/compare/v0.6.9...v0.7.0)

This release improves debugging for users who use axoupdater as a crate and who
disable printing stdout/stderr from the installer. If the installer runs but
fails, we now return a new error type which contains the stderr/stdout and exit
status from the underlying installer; this can be used by callers to help
identify what failed.

This release also introduces a debugging feature for the standalone installer.
It's now possible to override which installer to use by setting the
`AXOUPDATER_INSTALLER_PATH` environment variable to the path on disk of the
installer to use. A similar feature was already available to library users
using the `AxoUpdater::configure_installer_path` method.
