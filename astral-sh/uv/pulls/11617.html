            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey! I took the initiative of writing a bit of docs for the things I had to figure out myself. Plus, it was asked in #10047.</p>
<p>I think the docs could use a paragraph explaining the case of using cache mounts. But I&#x27;ve encountered the limits of my understanding of docker and uv.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the problem I found when trying to document it:</p>
<p><code>--mount=type=cache</code> leaves a root-owned directory after the <code>RUN</code> instruction has run; even when using the <code>uid=...</code>/<code>gid=...</code> options. I don&#x27;t know if this is intended behavior or a bug.</p>
<p>This makes it so that you need to either (1) <code>rmdir</code> it before allowing the command in <code>CMD [&quot;uv&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;foobar.py&quot;]</code> to run, or (2) <em>reset</em>  <code>UV_CACHE_DIR</code> to point to somewhere else.</p>
<p>Regardless of 1 or 2, the cache at &quot;build&quot; time becomes useless for the program at run time, and I don&#x27;t know how important that is.</p>
