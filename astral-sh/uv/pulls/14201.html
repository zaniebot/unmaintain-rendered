            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be a pretty big breaking change to just do this by default. I would think if we wanted to do this we'd want to default to installing it as <em>both</em> python3.12 and pypy3.12, with an option to opt out of the &quot;default&quot; name. This kind of change needs a lot of design work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The feature is in preview, so we can make changes like this though I agree we need to do some design work to be certain we should. I'm not sure if we <em>should</em> ever install PyPy or GraalPy as <code>python</code>, is that common? We'd definitely need to do some research to understand common patterns there.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree, and I don't think it's common. I'm not aware of <em>any</em> way to install PyPy (I have no experience with GraalPy) which would put it on your <code>PATH</code> as <code>python...</code> instead of <code>pypy...</code>, which is what my comment in #13565 about what <code>brew</code> and <code>apt</code> do was referencing.</p>
<p>See also https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/build.html#installation (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install PyPy system wide on unix-like systems, it is recommended to put the whole hierarchy alone (e.g. in /opt/pypy) and <strong>put a symlink to the pypy executable into /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin</strong>.</p>

<p>Here, I think we should probably do the same thing and make use of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/2966471db2dfafa71230cdedfa7f0cd124de02b7/crates/uv-python/src/implementation.rs#L74-L81</p>
