            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>If you have a dependency with a marker, and you add a constraint, it causes us to <em>always</em> fork, because we represent the constraint as a second dependency with the marker repeated (and, therefore, we have two requirements of the same name, both with markers). I don&#x27;t think we should fork here -- and in the end it&#x27;s leading to this undesirable resolution: #10481.</p>
<p>I tried to change constraints such that we just <em>reuse</em> and augment the initial requirement, but that has a fairly negative effect on error messages: #10489. So this fix seems a bit better to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is normal to see for this resolution, it&#x27;s an artifact of pinning on so many libraries that are a bit old and then trying to resolve them for newer versions of Python.</p>
<p>The correct solution here is that the user (me) shouldn&#x27;t pin so much, but this is an older set of requirements I use to smoke test new versions of uv, because I know the requirements are challenging.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I buy this I think. The point of forking is really to address differing markers, but if the markers are the same (and the Python requirement isn&#x27;t changed), then it seems <em>fine</em> to me that we don&#x27;t fork in that case.</p>
