            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This is an alternative to the approach we took in #11063 whereby we always included <code>provides-extra</code> and <code>requires-dist</code>, since we needed some way to differentiate between &quot;no extras&quot; and &quot;lockfile was generated by a uv version that didn&#x27;t include extras&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead, this PR adds a minor version (called a &quot;revision&quot;) to the lockfile that we can use to indicate support for this feature. While lockfile version bumps are backwards-incompatible, older uv versions <em>can</em> read lockfiles with a later revision -- they just won&#x27;t understand all the data.</p>
<p>In a future major version bump, we could simplify things and change the schema to use a (major, minor) format instead of these two separate fields. But this is the only way to do it that&#x27;s backwards-compatible with existing uv versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I made a mistake by suggesting that we make <code>provides-extra</code> non-optional (in order to power feature detection) -- I&#x27;m sorry about that. I don&#x27;t think what I have here is <em>perfect</em>, but I do think it&#x27;s less disruptive (e.g., we don&#x27;t have to re-make these fields hidden-when-empty when we bump the version in the future) and closer to the principles we use throughout the format (favoring conciseness, etc.).</p>

<p>Gah, yeah, I&#x27;m sorry that I went back and forth on it and made you do a bunch of extra work. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like the wrong tradeoff. I think the &quot;hard&quot; thing about adding the minor version was just figuring out what it should be called and what the schema should look like (since we need two version fields)... What we have here is <em>okay</em>, not perfect, but it&#x27;s does feel like a better tradeoff.</p>
