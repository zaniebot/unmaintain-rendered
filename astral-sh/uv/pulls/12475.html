            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Implements a rudimentary <code>uv pip wheel</code> command. This is simply a repackaged <code>uv pip install</code> that short-circuits at the actual install step and instead takes the cached wheels and zips them up. Marked as draft because I don't really like my implementation, it's a bit messy and duplicates a lot of <code>uv pip install</code>, and there's questions about the semantics of <code>pip wheel</code> that I don't have enough knowledge to answer.</p>
<p>Resolves #1681</p>
<h2>TODO:</h2>
<ol>
<li>De-duplicate most of the logic between <code>uv pip wheel</code> and <code>uv pip install</code></li>
<li>Decide whether a notion of <code>resolving dependencies</code> is really how <code>pip wheel</code> is supposed to behave</li>
<li>Introduce a separate crate for writing a zipped wheel (I basically just copied from <code>uv-build-backend</code>)</li>
<li>Write tests / integration tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>(On the last point: I can <code>uv pip wheel</code> and install said wheels, and they're identical to <code>uv pip wheel</code>, sans the records being slightly different due to console scripts not being included. I do think this is an actual bug though, which is why I want to use the logic in <code>uv-build-backend</code> which has already solved this, though it will need to be in a new crate).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>uv pip download</code> can be supported without much of a lift from this logic as well. <code>uv pip {download, wheel, install}</code> are conceptually all ancestors of each other and follow the same logic.</p>
