Maybe something like this?

```suggestion
- 🔩 Includes a [pip-compatible interface](#the-pip-interface) for a drop-in performance boost.
```

Haha "drop-in" is dangerous. But yeah... maybe.

I think we say drop-in right now..

Is it just me or does this read a bit self-contradicting: *Installable without Python via `pip`.*

Maybe *Installable without Rust or Python via `curl` or other package managers such as `pip`, `pipx`, etc.*

Haha this did come to mind.. but we also want to be able to tell people it's available by `pip` because it's such a popular installation method.. hm.

Why remove?

_Review comment by @charliermarsh on `README.md`:26 on 2024-08-20 13:26_

Should we say "single-file scripts"?

Not intentional, should be replaced with new benchmarks.
