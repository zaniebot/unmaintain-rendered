# Add ecosystem test for Prefect

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-04-09 18:52_

Reproduced https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2941 and confirmed fix.

We probably ought to have some ecosystem test coverage — this seems like a good starting point we can extend to other projects in the future.
