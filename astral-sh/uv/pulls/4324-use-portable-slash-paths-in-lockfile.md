# Use portable slash paths in lockfile

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-14 04:14_

## Summary

This would be a lightweight solution to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4307 that doesn't fully engage with all the possibilities in the design space (but would unblock cross-platform for now).
