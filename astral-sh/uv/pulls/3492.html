            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This still keeps the resolver state on the stack, but it organizes it
into a more structured representation. This is a precursor to
implementing resolver forking, where we will ultimately put this state
on the heap. The idea is that this will let us maintain multiple
independent resolver states that will all produce their own resolution
(and potentially other forked states).</p>
<p>Closes #3354</p>
