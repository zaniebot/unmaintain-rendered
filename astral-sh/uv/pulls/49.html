            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR massively speeds up the case in which you need to install wheels that already exist in the global cache.</p>
<p>The new strategy is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the wheel into the content-addressed cache.</li>
<li>Unzip the wheel into the cache, but ignore content-addressing. It turns out that writing to <code>cacache</code> for every file in the zip added a ton of overhead, and I don&#x27;t see any actual advantages to doing so. Instead, we just unzip the contents into a directory at, e.g., <code>~/.cache/puffin/django-4.1.5</code>.</li>
<li>(The unzip itself is now parallelized with Rayon.)</li>
<li>When installing the wheel, we now support unzipping from a directory instead of a zip archive. This required duplicating and tweaking a few functions.</li>
<li>When installing the wheel, we now use reflinks (or copy-on-write links). These have a few fantastic properties: (1) they&#x27;re extremely cheap to create (on macOS, they are allegedly faster than hard links); (2) they minimize disk space, since we avoid copying files entirely in the vast majority of cases; and (3) if the user then edits a file locally, the cache doesn&#x27;t get polluted. Orogene, Bun, and soon pnpm all use reflinks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Puffin is now ~15x faster than <code>pip</code> for the common case of installing cached data into a fresh environment.</p>
