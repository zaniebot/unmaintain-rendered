# Clarify uninstallation docs

---

_@my1e5_

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9871

> The current instructions first mention removing the binaries, and then mention a suggestion for removing stored data. The recommended data removal process involves uv commands that will no longer be available if the binaries are gone 😄.

I've edited the uninstallation docs to first suggest removing stored data before removing the uv and uvx binaries.
