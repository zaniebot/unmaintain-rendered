# Avoid comparing to system site packages in `--dry-run` mode

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

Right now, `uv sync --dry-run` returns the interpreter that _would've_ been used to create the environment; so we end up using _that_ interpreter's `site-packages`, and return changes relative to that interpreter. Instead, we now create a temporary virtual environment and compare against that.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11422.
