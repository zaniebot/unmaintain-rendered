            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is required to solve https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4669, because the <code>Requires-Python</code> version can now vary across a resolution. For example, within certain forks, we might have a more narrow range, which would allow us to use distributions that would not be allowed for the global resolution.</p>
<p>This should be fine because <code>requires-python</code> is part of the package metadata, so it should be consistent between files within a package version. As such, there shouldn't be any risk that we incorrectly prioritize distributions by omitting this information.</p>
<p>(To be more specific, the risk is something like: we prioritize some wheel over a source distribution within a package-version, so we don't track the source distribution at all. Then, later, when we choose a candidate, we see that the wheel doesn't meet the <code>Requires-Python</code> requirement, even though the source distribution <em>would've</em> met it. If files within a distribution could have varied support, this would be a real risk.)</p>
