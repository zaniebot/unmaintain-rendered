Omg no please let me test my automation!

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-08-21 23:21_

Wait but why didn't your automation upgrade this already?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-08-21 23:21_

(it doesn't really matter but I do want to know if it's working)

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-08-21 23:22_

Would your automation only be triggered when 1.90 comes out either way?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-08-21 23:23_

No I think it _should_ run before then. It's in the "Dependency Dashboard".

I think it's broken anyhow. I see
