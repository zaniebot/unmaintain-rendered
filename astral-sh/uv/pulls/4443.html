            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When executables were not named <code>python3</code> e.g. <code>python3.11</code> we would construct a Python path that would only work for <em>some</em> requests in tests since we don't search for those names unless a specific version is requested. To solve, we construct a test context with constant Python executable names. For example, if a test context was created with <code>3.11</code> and <code>3.12</code> we could end up with the search path <code>/usr/local/python-3.11/bin:/usr/local/python-3.12/bin</code> where the executables are named <code>python3.11</code> and <code>python3</code> respectively. A test invocation of uv requesting any Python toolchain version would then locate the <code>3.12</code> executable since the <code>3.11</code> executable doesn't have the generic name, but we want <code>3.11</code> to come first.</p>
<p>On Windows, we just leave things as-is because executables are always called <code>python.exe</code>.</p>
