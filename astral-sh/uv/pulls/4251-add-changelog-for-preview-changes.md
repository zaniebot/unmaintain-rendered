# Add changelog for preview changes

---

_@zanieb_

I tweaked rooster to allow sections to be overridden from the CLI so we can generate a separate preview changelog

See https://github.com/zanieb/rooster/pull/43 for the rooster changes needed

I tested `./scripts/release.sh` as well.

This is the first version when we started to use the preview label I think

Hey, Arch maintainer of [uv package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/uv/) here 👋🏼 

I saw this PR while looking at the changes. I also work on a changelog generation tool called [`git-cliff`](https://git-cliff.org) and I was curious how easy it would be to generate the same changelog format with using `git-cliff`.

The result is the following:

```md
# Changelog

## [0.2.10](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/0.2.9..0.2.10)

### Preview features

* Exclude preview items from changelog by @zanieb in [#4202](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4202)
* Bump version to 0.2.10 by @zanieb in [#4201](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4201)
* Clarify role of `--system` flag in README by @zanieb in [#4031](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4031)
* Add `uv toolchain install` by @zanieb in [#4164](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4164)
* Recreate project environment if `--python` or `requires-python` doesn't match by @konstin in [#3945](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3945)
* Improve static metadata extraction for Poetry projects by @charliermarsh in [#4182](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4182)
* Add `uv toolchain list` by @zanieb in [#4163](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4163)
* Fetch managed toolchains in `uv run` by @zanieb in [#4143](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4143)
* Implement `Toolchain::find_or_fetch` and use in `uv venv --preview` by @zanieb in [#4138](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4138)
* Fix `>=` to `==` typo in `is_contained_by` docs by @charliermarsh in [#4196](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4196)
* Document bytecode compilation in pip compatibility guide by @charliermarsh in [#4195](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4195)
* Remove `PubGrubPackage` dependency from `ResolutionGraph` by @charliermarsh in [#4168](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4168)
### <trimmed>

## New Contributors
* @Peiffap made their first contribution in [#4170](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4170)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/0.2.9...0.2.10

```

The obvious benefit is that you will have the links and usernames in the changelog along with the contributors list.

Did this experiment and just wanted to share the results 🐻

Cheers!

Hi! Thanks maybe I'll take a look at it. We actually don't want the usernames / contributors in the changelog because we think it's too noisy. We are interested in populating the GitHub Release notes with the contributing users but I haven't had time to invest in the tooling.

Where do you do filtering based on the pull request label? I don't see it in the template you shared. Actually it looks like there isn't categorization based on pull request labels which is our main criteria.
