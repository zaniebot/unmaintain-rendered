<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Use <code>dashmap::HashSet</code> over <code>Mutex&lt;HashSet&gt;</code>.
Suggested in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3435#discussion_r1592917098.</p>
<p>This is a bit more complex that I thought: the original hashmap lock was held through the <code>create_dir_all</code> call, and if we naively swap it for dashmap this is not the case anymore which creates a race condition. See f9a5feaa5b39892364c3f8b63f9ba22aa7917a75.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is worth it, feel free to close if not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since we're using this as a set, I'd find it clearer to define this as a <code>FxDashSet&lt;V&gt;</code> and fix the value type to <code>()</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'd also add a comment here saying why we aren't using a <code>DashSet</code> directly. I assume it's because a <code>DashSet</code> has no API for holding the lock in the case of a non-existent key.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think a <code>Mutex&lt;HashSet&gt;</code> is simpler here, so I think I want to see a reason to use a <code>DashMap</code> here in lieu of the simpler thing. And in particular, since we're holding the lock across I/O boundaries anyway, it's not clear to me that a concurrent hashmap is going to help us much if at all.</p>
<p>@ibraheemdev Did you have any thoughts here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm I agree that if we're holding the lock during the fs operation <code>DashMap</code> probably doesn't buy us much. We could use a <code>OnceMap</code> here to avoid contention on the lock, however, I'm not sure if the contention is a bottleneck given that the download still happens in parallel. If it's not I agree this is probably not worth it.</p>
