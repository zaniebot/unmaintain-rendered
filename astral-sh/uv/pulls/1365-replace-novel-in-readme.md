# Replace "novel" in README

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-15 21:56_

Per some prior discussion, "novel" can be confusing in this context as it's not clear what we're referring to.

PDM supports overrides — so I'll just drop this.

If anyone knows of other tools that support overrides and alternative resolution strategies please let me know I'd love to look at how they've implemented it :)
