# small refactoring in pursuit of fixing conflicting extras/groups

---

_@BurntSushi_

This PR splits off some commits from #9370. These are smaller
refactoring commits that shouldn't change any behavior. This is just in
the interest of making #9370 a bit smaller, which I expect might get a
bit bigger.

Ref #9289
