# Add ticks around error messages more consistently

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-12 00:42_

## Summary

I found some of these too bare (e.g., when they _just_ show a package name with no other information). For me, this makes it easier to differentiate error message copy from data. But open to other opinions. Take a look at the fixture changes and LMK!

Style-wise my favorite would be any quotes (backticks count) and no colon
