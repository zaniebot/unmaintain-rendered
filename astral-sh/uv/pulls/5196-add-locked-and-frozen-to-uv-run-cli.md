# Add `--locked` and `--frozen` to `uv run` CLI

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-18 18:47_

## Summary

You can now use `uv run --locked` to assert that the lockfile doesn't change, or `uv run --frozen` to run without attempting to update the lockfile at all.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5185.
