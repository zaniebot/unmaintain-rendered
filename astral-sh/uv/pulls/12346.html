<p>I don't know if I actually want to commit this, but I did it on the plane last time and just polished it off (got it to compile) while waiting to board.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like there's <a href="https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/uv/branches/charlie%2Fpath">no measurable change in perf</a>, but I still feel like this is something we should do for &quot;good sense&quot; reasons. This also eliminates the possibility of any <code>PathBuf</code> being replaced here containing &quot;extra&quot; capacity (which would be a kind of space leak I guess). But I don't think any of our metrics really track that, so it's hard to know whether there is an actual improvement or not.</p>
<p>One interesting thing to consider would be a &quot;small path&quot; optimization. I'm not sure a crate for that exists. (A quick search didn't turn anything up.) It might be a little trickier to build than a small string optimization.</p>
