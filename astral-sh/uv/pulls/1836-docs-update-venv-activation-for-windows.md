## Summary

Follow on to PR https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/1811 as part of issue https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1750. This change updates the windows venv activation to work for both Powershell and Command Prompt instead of just Powershell. This also aligns with what `uv venv` displays.
