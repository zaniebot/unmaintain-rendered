            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems okay to me... It's inconsistent with other interfaces, but it does kind of make sense here whereas it doesn't elsewhere. I'd like a second opinion from @zanieb or @konstin though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a good feature, if we allow a single package and <code>--all-packages</code>, it makes sense to also allow multiple, but not all packages.</p>
