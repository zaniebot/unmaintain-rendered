<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>I am using UV and would like to include a UV badge in my README. I found that the current logo does not match the one in your official docs (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).</p>
<p>I have replaced the SVG logo you are using (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/docs/assets/logo-letter.svg">/docs/assets/logo-letter.svg</a>).</p>
<p>This type of replacement will allow many users who call your official badge to not have to change anything.</p>

<p>Note: I use a URL from the repo I forked from you (https://github.com/Onyx-Nostalgia/uv/blob/fix/logo-badge/assets/badge/v0.json) to show you an example of the result you will get if you merge this PR. And of course, after the merge, you will also see the changes in the badge you use in your own README.</p>

<p>😅 I apologize for the confusion. I initially assumed that the logo-letter I saw in your web documents was the current logo that you didn't want to change. I also mistakenly thought you might have just forgotten to update the logo on the badge, so I changed it to maintain consistency.</p>

<p>If you do decide to change the UV logo in the future, may I offer a personal opinion? I believe that having distinct logos for each of your products could be beneficial. It would help highlight the unique identity of each product and prevent confusion with your other tools.</p>
<p>Just to clarify and perhaps help me provide better feedback on the logo: is the name &quot;UV&quot; something you intend to keep permanently? And is there a story or a reason behind the name (e.g., an acronym, a reference to UV light, etc.)?</p>

<p>@zanieb I've noticed that ty is using &quot;T&quot; for its badge</p>
