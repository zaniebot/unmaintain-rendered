# Ensure Pythons are aligned in `uv python list`

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

The existing tab input sometimes leads to misalignment on my machine, I think it has to do with breakpoints?

This PR computes the width explicitly, and then pads each line. I also added some colors to the RHS. I think it makes it easier to scan, but don't feel strongly.
