### [`v0.2.4`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#024-2025-03-10)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.3...0.2.4)

\==================
This is another small release that fixes a problem where Jiff could break
builds if they relied on inference for integer comparisons. Specifically, Jiff
uses internal trait impls to make comparing its internal ranged integers
more convenient. But Rust the language has no concept of "internal" trait
impls, and thus this can impact type inference. If code was written in a way
that relies on a singular trait impl that is available, then adding Jiff to
the project can cause it to break.

This isn't arguably Jiff's fault per se, but since these trait impls were just
about internal convenience and not essential to Jiff's design, we adopt a
pragmatic approach and just remove them.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;293](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/293):
    Remove internal trait impls that can cause breaks due to inference failures.
