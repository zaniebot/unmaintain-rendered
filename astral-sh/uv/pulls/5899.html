            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Initially, we showed <em>all</em> resolver and installer output in <code>uv run</code> and <code>uv tool run</code>, since it was way too much for workhorse commands. Then, we moved to showing <em>no</em> output by default, which was way too little -- you had no idea why anything was happening, and commands appeared to hang.</p>
<p>This PR adds a more nuanced middle-ground. With <code>--verbose</code>, we continue to show everything. But by default, in <code>uv run</code> and <code>uv tool run</code>...</p>
<ul>
<li>During resolution, we show any &quot;Building&quot; and &quot;Build&quot; messages, if you need to build a source distribution. But we don't show any other output. (This <em>could</em> be too little for expensive resolutions; we may want to show a spinner.)</li>
<li>If there are no changes to be made after resolving, we don't show any other output.</li>
<li>If we have to install, we show the progress bars for downloads (which disappear on completion) followed by a single summary line stating the number of packages installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feels pretty good, in my limited testing. When everything is built / cached, you don't get <em>any</em> additional output. When there's work to do, you have a sense for what's happening, and we leave you with a single summary line (&quot;Installed X packages&quot;) at the end.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5758.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Notice that the first <code>tool run</code> ends with an install line; the second shows no additional output:</p>

<p>If you run <code>uv run</code> in a package for the first time, we <em>do</em> tell you that we're building / built it:</p>

<p>But on the second run, there's no output:</p>

<p>If you add a <code>--with</code>, we'll show you all the installer progress bars (which disappear once they're done), and then a single summary line:</p>
