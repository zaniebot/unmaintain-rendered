Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: crates/pep440-rs/Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path crates/pep440-rs/Cargo.toml --package indoc@2.0.4 --precise 2.0.5
error: package ID specification `indoc@2.0.4` did not match any packages
Did you mean one of these?
