<p>Unfortunately, it's not! I opened #8160 to do a fair comparison and at least on Linux with the current setup, it's not making a different in CI. (I see a difference locally but... I'd like more than that!)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting. A few things come to mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Linux is already the fastest, are there benefits on other platforms?</li>
<li>Is there more benefit if we reduce the runner size? We increased the runner size several times to get a quick speed improvement, but that compute isn't free!</li>
<li>Is it faster for most tests but some slow tests that aren't network bound are the bottleneck?</li>
</ol>

<p>Probably! Selecting <code>lock::</code> tests and forcing <code>-j1</code> shows that, y'know, fopro is not doing <em>nothing</em>:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d662aa37-20e3-4362-830a-f075d3c0873e" alt="with fopro it runs in 77s, without it run in 89s" /></p>
<p>...and there's still some things it doesn't cache, like git clones, HEAD requests, byte range requests, etc. — which aren't <em>that</em> hard to add, tbh.</p>
