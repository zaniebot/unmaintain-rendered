<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>When printing a hint that Python downloads are set to 'manual' and suggesting that the user &quot;use <code>uv python install &gt;=3.11, &lt;3.12</code>&quot;, the request is now quoted as appropriate for a shell command: &quot;<code>uv python install '&gt;=3.11, &lt;3.12'</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>This change uses the <code>shell-escape</code> crate, which is already a transitive dependency of uv.</p>
<p>Closes #17051.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I've added a unit test <code>python_install_manual</code> covering the default case and the case of <code>&gt;=3.11, &lt;3.12</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know I suggested this in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/17051#issuecomment-3633659514 but I'm wondering if it makes more sense to just suggest the concrete version that'd be installed?</p>
<p>Like I think for this example we should just hint</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A managed Python download is available for Python &gt;=3.11, &lt;3.12, but Python downloads are set to 'manual', use <code>uv python install 3.11</code> to install the required version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we know which version we'd select?</p>
<p>I think we recently added some logic which lets us &quot;simplify&quot; a Python install key to drop default values.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense to me - though I could only find existing 'simplification' functions for <code>PythonDownloadRequest</code>, not for <code>PythonInstallationKey</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, thanks - I've done a variant of that where I add <code>impl From&lt;&amp;ManagedPythonDownload&gt; for PythonDownloadRequest</code>, similar to that already there for <code>&amp;ManagedPythonInstallation</code>, to avoid having to deal with the fail case (assuming the same assumption holds). It felt cleaner this way, though I can go through the existing <code>TryFrom</code> if preferred.</p>
<p>One concern I have with this is I'm not sure whether it's valid to do <code>without_patch()</code> as the version range could restrict the patch version, but unless we special-case that then we're being very specific about the install version and I'm not sure how much better it is than just displaying the range. For now I have used it, anyway, to avoid including an arbitrary patch number in the test snapshot, and to match your suggested output.</p>
