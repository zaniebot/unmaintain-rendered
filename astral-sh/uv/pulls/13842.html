            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Extends https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13841 — I'll drop that commit later after that pull request merges but it's small.</p>
<p>I find the split into a &quot;Configuration&quot; section awkward and don't think it's helping us. Everything moved into the &quot;Concepts&quot; section, except the &quot;Environment variables&quot; page which definitely belongs in the reference and the &quot;Installer&quot; page which is fairly niche and seems better in the reference.</p>
