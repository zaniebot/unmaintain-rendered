# [DOCS] build and publish package to PyPI from GitHub Actions

---

_Pull request opened by @kiankyars on 2025-07-01 15:22_

## Summary

I just finished up setting my workflow for UV using GitHub Actions to publish my PIP project and wanted to add this to the GitHub integrations guide.

## Test Plan

<!-- How was it tested? -->
I tested this workflow on [my own repository ](https://github.com/kiankyars/pypi/actions/workflows/publish.yml) and it successfully builds and publishes to pypi.org. Refer to the picture below if you don't want to check the repository.

Hi, thanks for contributing this guide! I've done an extended version of this guide in #15753, which should cover the topic together with our standalone example repo.
