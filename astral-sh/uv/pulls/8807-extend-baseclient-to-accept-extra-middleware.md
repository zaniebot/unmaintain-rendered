# Extend BaseClient to accept extra middleware

_Pull request opened by @tdejager on 2024-11-04 10:49_

This PR is a revival of #3502, albeit in a much simpler form.

This would allow for different middlewares like authentication and such, useful for if you want to deviate from the keychain authentication methods when using uv as a library.

@zanieb I hope I made the changes as you noted you wanted to see them :)

Happy to add/change anything you need.
