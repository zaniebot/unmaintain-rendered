            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure how to cross-compile for these targets. Binaries are not provided, AFAICT, so I think the target needs to be built. I vaguely have clues on how to do that, but not sure how to inject my ideas into maturin-action.</p>
<p>I don't think it's going to work, locally I tried:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -v $PWD:/uv -w /uv --rm -it ubuntu
apt update &amp;&amp; apt install curl build-essential cmake
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
. &quot;$HOME/.cargo/env&quot;
rustup install nightly
rustup +nightly component add rust-src
cargo +nightly build -Z build-std --target powerpc64le-unknown-linux-musl
</code></pre>
<p>It makes it pretty far, but crashes compiling OpenSSL.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like there's mention of the powerpc64le one in maturin-action, so I was rather thinking that might work. s309x is sounds like it's not possible currently. I'm checking to see if missing uv on these two (I would assume) rarely used images is acceptable in manylinux.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ppc64le musl requires Rust nightly, I have tried to <a href="https://github.com/rust-cross/rust-musl-cross/pull/62">build a Docker image for s390x musl</a> in the past, but it seems to have some issues (see https://github.com/rust-cross/rust-musl-cross/issues/63) so I haven't added it to <code>maturin-action</code>.</p>

<p>Is https://github.com/rust-cross/rust-musl-cross/issues/63 still an issue? Looks like it's been a while since it was attempted?</p>

<p>Probably still an issue, but I think it's solvable given that Alpine Linux has the target working for years now, although it's a hard problem for people without deep knowledge in GCC.</p>
