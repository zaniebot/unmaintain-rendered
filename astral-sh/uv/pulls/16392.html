            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had some qualms with <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16318">astral-sh/uv#16318</a></p>
<ol>
<li>The snapshot was specific to uv&#x27;s managed interpreter due to inclusion of the externally-managed output. This will break downstream distros. We either need to filter the message, or, as done here, install a managed interpreter.</li>
<li>It had a custom filter for the interpreter path, which we shouldn&#x27;t need. If needed, we should fix that in the test context.</li>
<li>We already had an implicit hint to create a virtual environment. The change in styling of the new hint hint following it is confusing. It&#x27;s also confusing to hint creating a virtual environment when <code>--system</code> was used.</li>
<li>There were unresolved requested changes to the language for the message / it didn&#x27;t fit stylistic with our existing ones.</li>
<li>The message was also very confusing for a uv-managed interpreter, which is both a &quot;system&quot; Python interpreter (in that it&#x27;s global) and the opposite of a &quot;system&quot; interpreter per UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also problematic, but not addressed here, is that there are other commands that display an externally-managed message, e.g., <code>uv pip sync</code>, but #16318 was just limited to <code>pip install</code>. We should not just implement this in one place — I&#x27;ll open a tracking issue to consolidate and reuse the logic.</p>
