            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems likely that we forgot to bump the version of the &quot;simple&quot; cache
in the 0.1.25 release. I&#x27;m still working on confirming it, but I figured
I&#x27;d get this bump up first.</p>
<p>The main problem here is that our &quot;simple&quot; cache is represented by
<code>rkyv</code>, and that in turn is tightly coupled to the representation of a
selection of data types in <code>uv</code>. Changing those data types without
bumping the cache version can result in cache deserialization errors
like this, or in the worst case, silent logic errors.</p>
<p>One possibility here is that the representation changed in a way that
permitted it to pass <code>rkyv</code> validation, but changed how the data itself
is interpreted. Our cache is robust with respect to <code>rkyv</code> validation
(if it fails, the cache will invalidate the entry and self-heal), but
being robust to higher level logical errors in interpretation of the
data is a much more significant challenge. Our best bet there is perhaps
some kind of checksum that we could do on top of <code>rkyv</code> validation (or
instead of it), and thus convert silent logical changes in how the data
is interpreted into failure modes that we&#x27;re already robust to.</p>
<p>Fixes #2711</p>
