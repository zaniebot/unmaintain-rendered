            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds extras to the lockfile, and enables users to selectively sync extras in <code>uv sync</code> and <code>uv run</code>. The end result here was fairly simple, though it required a few refactors to get here. The basic idea is that <code>DistributionId</code> now includes <code>extra: Option&lt;ExtraName&gt;</code>, so we effectively treat extras as separate packages. Generating the lockfile, and generating the resolution from the lockfile, fall out of this naturally with no special-casing or additional changes.</p>
<p>The main downside here is that it bloats the lockfile significantly. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>We include <em>all</em> distribution URLs and hashes for <em>every</em> extra variant.</li>
<li>We include all dependencies for the extra variant, even though that are dependencies of the base package.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could normalize this representation by changing each distribution have an <code>optional-dependencies</code> hash map that keys on extras, but we actually don't have the information we need to create that right now (specifically, we can't differentiate between dependencies that <em>require</em> the extra and dependencies on the base package).</p>
<p>Closes #3700.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This demonstrates the change in format. We now have a separate distribution for <code>project[test]</code>, which includes the dependencies for both the base package and the <code>[test]</code>.</p>
<p>I think we could change the <code>project</code> distribution to instead include <code>[[distribution.optional-dependencies.test]]</code>? But it requires more work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this LGTM for now, but I suspect we'll definitely want to pursue some kind of normalization here.</p>
<p>I'm also not quite fully sold on having a distinct package for each <code>extra</code>, but I don't have a good alternative to propose at the moment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can look into normalizing it as a next step. It may require changing some things in the resolver itself to make it <em>possible</em> to track dependencies that were only pulled in due to an extra.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because this is no longer true. The requiring package won't be <code>PubGrubPackageInner::Package</code>, but <code>PubGrubPackageInner::Extra</code>.</p>
