# Support `UV_NO_EDITABLE` where `--no-editable` is supported

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2025-08-06 12:27_

Specifically, support `UV_NO_EDITABLE=1 uv export`. It's now also supported in `uv add`, though it's default there anyway and the env var exists only for completeness.

Fixes #15103
