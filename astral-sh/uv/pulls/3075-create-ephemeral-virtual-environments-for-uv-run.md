# Create ephemeral virtual environments for `uv run`

---

_Pull request opened by @zanieb on 2024-04-16 21:34_

If a virtual environment does not exist, we will create one for the duration of the invocation.

Adds an `--isolated` flag to force this behavior (ignoring an existing virtual environment).
