<p>Simply keeps up with the latest <code>spdx</code> crate release.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I don’t currently have access to my machine that has enough memory to compile uv without workarounds, so I tested this via <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/music/spdx/packages/">a patch to the downstream Fedora packages</a>.</p>
