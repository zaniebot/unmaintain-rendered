            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This list of known discrepancies between package vs. import package name is missing a few very popular packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>PIL</li>
<li>GitPython</li>
<li>PyYAML</li>
</ul>
<p>I have added these and a number of others I am aware of. These projects are of varying popularity, so I would understand if you don&#x27;t want to include all of these, lest it gets out of control. These are just some suggestions to start a conversation.</p>
Test Plan
<p>No tests, since this is just adding to a JSON file. The list should be manually reviewed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! As-is, I think these are only shown when a build <em>failures</em>, and not when a resolution fails. So we might need to change that for this to take effect.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good point. There are a variety of ways things could go wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mistake name doesn&#x27;t exist on PyPI at all (e.g. <code>git</code>, <code>arcpy</code>)</li>
<li>Mistake name does exist on PyPI but doesn&#x27;t have a &gt;0.0 release (e.g. <code>absl</code>)</li>
<li>Mistake name does exist on PyPI and will build but it is a dummy package designed to avoid typosquatting (e.g. <code>bs4</code>)</li>
<li>Mistake name does exist but release is so old that it will almost always fail (e.g. <code>pil</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last case should probably be the focus of this PR for now.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also the case of two, well used and maintained packages competing over the same import name, but I don&#x27;t think we could do anything about that.</p>

<p>This is an older thing that was changed at some point - in the past the import name <code>fitz</code> was the only one exposed by <code>pymupdf</code>, now it looks like they have moved away from that except as a fallback.</p>
