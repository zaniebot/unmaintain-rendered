The list is getting long, which is a good thing. 
What about turning it into an alphabetically sorted paragraph, like [kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro#who-likes-kedro) has?

Let me think about the best way to handle. I'll probably keep some kind of opinionated curation (it's good advertising and assurance for users to have projects like FastAPI, Pandas, etc. at the top), at least at the top-level, perhaps followed by a sorted list.
