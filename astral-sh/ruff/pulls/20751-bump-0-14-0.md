Should we mention the stabilized 3.14 support too? It's less breaking than the 3.9 -> 3.10 default, but I think it's also technically breaking. We removed the non-preview warnings, and we also default to 3.14 now for detecting syntax errors.

nit:


```suggestion
- \[`refurb`\] Add fixes for `FURB101` and `FURB103` ([#20520](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20520))
```

(I should have caught that one when I merged it)

```suggestion
- \[`ruff`\] Extend `FA102` with listed PEP 585-compatible APIs ([#20659](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20659))
```

I would probably move this under `### Bug fixes`.

We should drop any `ty` changes and probably follow the link to apply the `ty` label to the PR, that way it will get pulled when they do a release too.

Thanks! Just a few small suggestions, but this looks great overall.

@ntBre I mostly copied the wording from a previous release, let me know if you like that or if there's a better way to phrase it.
