**Summary** Mostly mechanical symbol rename and search-and-replace, with small changes to the markdown docs to read better

Note: this requires changing the label within GitHub once this merges.

I'm comfortable with this, but probably worth getting at least one more approval before moving forward. I would also be interested in Zanie's opinion as the point person on CLI and applicability and such.

This is a little tricky as it seems like `fix` means the change is a bug fix. Do we use the `autofix` label in the changelog much anyway?

I'll try to review this tomorrow morning!

Makes sense to me, considering that we'll have "Autofix" with applicability "Manual". I defer to @zanieb for the final review

What's the decision on what to do with the labels, should we keep them as-is?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2023-09-26 15:57_

I don't think we need to generate a section for the `fix` label — seems safe to remove.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-09-26 16:04_

Yeah, I think it's fine to remove from the release notes. Do we want to remove the label entirely though? I'm fine with that too.

It kind of makes sense in the "Issue" section so seems fine to rename to `fix` and keep for now? We can see if there's any practical confusion
