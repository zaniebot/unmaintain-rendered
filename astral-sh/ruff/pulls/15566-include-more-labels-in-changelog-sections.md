_@dhruvmanila_

## Summary

This PR updates Rooster config to include more labels, specifically:
* Include [`diagnostics`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/diagnostics), [`docstring`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/docstring), [`fixes`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/fixes) and [`isort`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/isort) for "Rule changes" section
* Use [`performance`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/performance) for "Performance" section. We already have included "Performance" section in various version, so let's make it official :)
* Ignore [`testing`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/testing) label

The following is open:
* [`suppression`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/labels/suppression)
