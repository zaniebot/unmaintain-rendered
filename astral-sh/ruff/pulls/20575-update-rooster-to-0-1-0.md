# Update rooster to 0.1.0

_Pull request opened by @ntBre on 2025-09-25 13:54_

Summary
--

This reduces the page size of GraphQL queries (https://github.com/zanieb/rooster/pull/85), hopefully helping with some of the 502s we've been hitting.

Test Plan
--

I ran the release script, and it succeeded after failing several times on the old rooster version.
