Cool idea. I'd prefer not to add headings unless we're going to switch to an actual issue template.

Okay, how would you want this detail included, without the use of headings?

I think so, just like a suggestion to include some search keywords at the bottom. I'm thinking a real issue form will make sense in the future, Charlie has just been opposed to it :)

I don't like issue forms much either. Want to take another look at this?
