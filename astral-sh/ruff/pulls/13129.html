            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, thanks so much for the PR! So I should have added more color to astral-sh/ty#244 to clarify some of these better; this is an example of one where we&#x27;re kinda blocked on adding support for generics in order to do this correctly. The generator type should be derived from its definition in typeshed rather than added as a special case in the <code>Type</code> enum. And understanding its definition in typeshed requires that we understand type variables and generic classes, which we don&#x27;t have. Sorry this wasn&#x27;t clear in the issue, I&#x27;ve updated the text of the issue now to mark the ones blocked on this!</p>
<p>Going to close this since I think pretty much everything here would look different with the typeshed/generics approach, sorry about that! If you&#x27;re interested in tackling an open expression kind, there are gaps in our unary/binary expression support, or for something a bit more complex, lambda expressions might be interesting. @chriskrycho is currently working on call expression inference, which will unlock a bunch more expression kinds where we should be resolving them as dunder method calls. Feel free to ping us on Discord or in the issue if you want to get a bit of direction before starting work on an issue!</p>
