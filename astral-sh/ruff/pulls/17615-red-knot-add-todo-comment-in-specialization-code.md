# [red-knot] add TODO comment in specialization code

---

_@carljm_

## Summary

As promised, this just adds a TODO comment to document something we discussed today that should probably be improved at some point, but isn't a priority right now (since it's an issue that in practice would only affect generic classes with both `__init__` and `__new__` methods, where some typevar is bound to `Unknown` in one and to some other type in another.)
