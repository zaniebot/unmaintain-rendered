            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19806#discussion_r2260365462. In short, we would previously report EOF ranges as being on a line that didn't actually exist:</p>
<pre><code>try.py:5:1: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
  |
3 | 'x'
4 | )
  |  ^
  |
</code></pre>
<p>Note the final line is 4 in the file and in the diagnostic, but the header reports 5:1 as the location.</p>
<p>I split off this PR because I think this is basically a bug fix in Ruff. I'll leave the ty diagnostic change in #19806.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I was a bit worried that some of the output formats might differ in the way they calculate line locations, so I added a copy of the <code>output_format</code> CLI test that runs on a snippet minimized from the <code>ISC_syntax_error.py</code> case that also changed in this PR. I guess my fears have been allayed, so we don't necessarily have to keep the CLI test if we don't want to.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, now I'm a bit confused.</p>
<p>I assumed that the issue here was that we showed 5:1 for a file with no line break at the end of the file:</p>
<pre><code>(
'''unterminated string
'x'
)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, I expect Ruff to use 4:2 as the location.</p>
<p>But I'm not so sure if this is the right fix if the file does end with a new line. I tested both textmate and VS code and both allow me to navigate to <code>5:1</code> for</p>
<pre><code>(
'''unterminated string
'x'
)

</code></pre>
<p>which is why I think it's more accurate if we do report 5:1 if the offset points to the end of file and we should instead fix the rendering in annotated snippet.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that I misunderstood this in your other PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries, I realized that I was a bit confused yesterday afternoon too. I think I also thought there was no trailing newline initially and then somehow convinced myself it still made sense to do this when the newline was present.</p>
<p>I'll look into the rendering instead.</p>
