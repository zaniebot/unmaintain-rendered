            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR upgrades zizmor to the latest release in our CI. zizmor is a static analyzer checking for security issues in GitHub workflows. The new release finds some new issues in our workflows; this PR fixes some of the issues, and adds ignores for some other issues.</p>
<p>The issues fixed in this PR are new cases of zizmor&#x27;s <a href="https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/audits/#template-injection"><code>template-injection</code></a> rule being emitted. The issues I&#x27;m ignoring for now are all to do with the <a href="https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/audits/#cache-poisoning"><code>cache-poisoning</code></a> rule. The main reason I&#x27;m fixing some but ignoring others is that I&#x27;m confident fixing the template-injection diagnostics won&#x27;t have any impact on how our workflows operate in CI, but I&#x27;m worried that fixing the cache-poisoning diagnostics could slow down our CI a fair bit. I don&#x27;t mind if somebody else is motivated to try to fix these diagnostics, but for now I think I&#x27;d prefer to just ignore them; it doesn&#x27;t seem high-priority enough to try to fix them right now :-)</p>
