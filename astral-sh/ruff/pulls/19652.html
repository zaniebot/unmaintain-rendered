            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes #19640. I'm not sure these are the exact fixes we really want, but I
reproduced the issue in a 32-bit Docker container and tracked down the causes,
so I figured I'd open a PR.</p>
<p>As I commented on the issue, the <code>goto_references</code> test depends on the iteration
order of the files in an <code>FxHashSet</code> in <code>Indexed</code>. In this case, we can just
sort the output in test code.</p>
<p>Similarly, the tuple case depended on the order of overloads inserted in an
<code>FxHashMap</code>. <code>FxIndexMap</code> seemed like a convenient drop-in replacement, but I
don't know if that will have other detrimental effects. I did have to change the
assertion for the tuple test, but I think it should now be stable across
architectures.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Running the tests in the aforementioned Docker container</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for looking into this!</p>
<p>The goto reference changes look good to me. I'm less sure if this is the right place (it seems unfortunate to pay the overhead of an ordered map to fix a test only issue). I'd appreciate if @AlexWaygood could take a look at that code</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This makes sense to me. I doubt that this method will be very hot (attribute access should be cached, and we only enter it for <code>__getitem__</code> attribute access on tuple classes), so I don't think switching to an <code>FxOrderMap</code> (or <code>FxIndexMap</code>) is likely to significantly impact performance here</p>

<p>I merged a workaround for this in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19659 for now</p>
