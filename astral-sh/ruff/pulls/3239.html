<p>@charliermarsh the different violations have different severities. Would you like me to add a setting that lets users only see errors above a certain severity?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@colin99d - Na we need to tackle severities more holistically, I think. We could consider adding a severity level for all of Bandit...?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think adding severity into this rule, and then eventually to all the other ones slowly makes a lot of sense. Then we can just make a bandit-wide (and maybe eventually have this work with other rule sets) rule.</p>
