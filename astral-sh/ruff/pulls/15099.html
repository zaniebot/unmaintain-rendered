<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Closes #14975 by modifying the docstring of the InvalidPyprojectToml rule.  Previously the docs were incorrectly stating that author name and emails must be individual items in the authors list, rather than part of a single object for each respective author.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>This was a docstring change, no tests needed.</p>
