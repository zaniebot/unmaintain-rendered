            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We were mistakenly using <code>CommentRanges::has_comments</code> to determine whether our edits
were safe, which sometimes expands the checked range to the end of a line. But in order to
determine safety we need to check exactly the range we're replacing.</p>
<p>This bug affected the rules <code>runtime-cast-value</code> (<code>TC006</code>) and <code>quoted-type-alias</code> (<code>TC008</code>)
although it was very unlikely to be hit for <code>TC006</code> and for <code>TC008</code> we never hit it because we
were checking the wrong expression.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo nextest run</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. Yeah, <code>has_comments</code> is somewhat misleading. It tries to do the right thing but its name is too generic. I think it's mainly optimized for testing if a statement (possibly compound) has any comments but it is to forgiving in that case...</p>
