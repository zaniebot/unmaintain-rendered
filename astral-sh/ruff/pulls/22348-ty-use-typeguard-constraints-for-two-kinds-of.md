# [ty] Use "typeguard constraints" for two kinds of tuple narrowing

---

_Pull request opened by @AlexWaygood on 2026-01-02 21:59_

## Summary

Since we've already filtered the union in these locations, it seems like needless overhead to then intersect the previous union with the filtered union. We know what that intersection will simplify to: it will simplify to the filtered union. So rather than using a regular intersection-based constraint, we can use a "typeguard constraint", which will just directly replace the previous type with the new type instead of creating an intersection.

## Test Plan

- Existing tests all pass
- The primer report should be clean

~~But notably, a 2% improvement on colour-science (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22303, the PR that added one of these branches, led to a 4% performance regression on that benchmark, and we know that the colour-science source code has some very expensive tuple types in it).~~

Nope, that's gone completely after pushing another commit to the PR. Just noise in terms of the performance impact, then. Still, I feel like this change makes sense conceptually.
