            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently lint on examples like this (even though it's allowed at runtime, as long as you call <code>f</code> before <code>g</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f():
    global x
    x = 5
def g():
    print(x)  # error: [unresolved-reference]: Name `x` used when not defined
</code></pre>
<p>However, linting only on the <code>print</code> is kind of confusing. This PR adds a lint on the <code>global</code> statement itself (edit: updated after review feedback):</p>
<pre><code>error[unresolved-global]: Invalid global declaration of `x`
 --&gt; test.py:2:5
  |
1 | def f():
2 |     global x
  |     ^^^^^^^^ `x` has no declarations or bindings in the global scope
3 |     x = 42
  |
info: This limits ty's ability to make accurate inferences about the boundness and types of global-scope symbols
info: Consider adding a declaration to the global scope, e.g. `x: int`
info: rule `unresolved-global` is enabled by default
</code></pre>
<p>Because this is legal Python, I expect this is going to have a lot of new hits in the <code>ecosystem-analyzer</code> (and I had to fix some of our mdtests). I don't know what would count as an &quot;excessive&quot; number of new failures, though, and I'll need advice from reviewers :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could we give a better error message here than &quot;used when not defined&quot;? Currently the diagnostic looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>error[unresolved-reference]: Name `x` used when not defined
 --&gt; foo.py:2:5
  |
1 | def f():
2 |     global x
  |     ^^^^^^^^
  |
info: rule `unresolved-reference` is enabled by default
</code></pre>
<p>But I think I'd ideally prefer something like this (a dedicated rule with a clear error message and explanatory subdiagnostics for why we don't permit this):</p>
<pre><code>error[invalid-global-declaration]: Invalid global declaration of `x`
 --&gt; foo.py:2:5
  |
1 | def f():
2 |     global x
  |     ^^^^^^^^  `x` has no declarations or bindings in the global scope
  |

info: Consider adding a declaration to the global scope, e.g. `x: int`
info: rule `unresolved-reference` is enabled by default
</code></pre>
<p>The dedicated diagnostic should probably have <code>Severity::WARN</code>, since this coding pattern does work at runtime, it just limits ty's ability to make accurate inferences elsewhere</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure we should exclude builtins from this check: declaring a symbol as <code>global</code> in an inner scope and assigning to it from that inner scope will insert a symbol into the global scope that will shadow the symbol from the builtin scope, greatly complicating ty's ability to accurately infer boundness and types of symbols in the global scope. Implicit globals <em>should</em> be excluded from this check, though, as they <em>are</em> defined directly in the module's global scope.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I would remove this TODO, the one a few lines below it in <code>b.py</code>, and rework the prose above <code>a.py</code> to explain that we forbid the <code>global</code> statement in an inner scope if it refers to a symbol not declared or bound in the global scope, and that this is why we don't consider such symbols imported as a result of a <code>*</code> import in another module :-)</p>

<p>The main thing I think we need to do before landing this is to improve the diagnostic to make it clearer what the problem is, and why we object to this coding pattern</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Most of the new lints in the ecosystem are as expected, <code>global</code> statements that are creating a new global variable. But there's another case that shows up a couple times, <a href="https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome/blob/2c3a8905a7929335a9b2763e18d6e9ed516b8a38/lib/Crypto/SelfTest/Util/test_Counter.py#L31-L34">like this</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class CounterTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        global Counter
        from Crypto.Util import Counter
</code></pre>
<p>So that's doing a global import, but not in the global scope. If the user is sure they want to do this sort of thing, is there an alternative way for them to do it that will type-check? (Maybe something better than <code>Counter: Any</code>, since that might be bad for completions? Not sure.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, folks who want to do <code>global ... import ...</code> tricks can at least put an <code>Any</code> declaration in the global scope and not be worse off than before. That was the only surprising case (and any other surprises we run into down the road can probably use the same workaround?), so I'm going to go ahead and land this.</p>
