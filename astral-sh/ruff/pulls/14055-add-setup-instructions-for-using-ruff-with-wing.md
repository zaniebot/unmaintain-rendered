This is cool to see, but I don't think we should include integration documentation for a paid product. This should be documented on their end instead.

I'm unclear why Wing Pro isn't allowed but other paid products are: Sublime Text, for example is free only for eval and then requires payment.  Visual Studio and PyCharm also unless you really stretch the definition of paid product.
