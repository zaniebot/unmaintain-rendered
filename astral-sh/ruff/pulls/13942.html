            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>After #13918 has landed, narrowing constraint negation became easy, so adding support for <code>not</code> operator.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I added a new mdtest file for <code>not</code> expression, but maybe we should spread it over the other test files (by adding <code>not</code> cases to each one of them)? I'll be happy to hear your preference around that :)</p>

<p>I like what you've done here. I think in general any feature that makes sense to make a PR to add, probably makes sense to have a dedicated file to test as well. Which of course isn't incompatible with perhaps <em>also</em> having it occasionally show up in tests of other features, too, but not in a &quot;must add it everywhere&quot; way.</p>
