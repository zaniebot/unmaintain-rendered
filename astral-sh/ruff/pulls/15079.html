<p>Runtime improvements. It was originally planned as a &quot;cheap&quot; alternative solution to implementing TDDs, so I think it&#x27;s now superseded by @dcreager&#x27;s recent advances in this direction. We eagerly simplify these visibility constraints now, so any salsa-based memoization would probably result in a much smaller potential benefit, if any?</p>
