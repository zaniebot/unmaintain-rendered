### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/rustc-hash (rustc-hash)</summary>

### [`v2.0.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#200)

-   Replace hash with faster and better finalized hash.
    This replaces the previous "fxhash" algorithm originating in Firefox
    with a custom hasher designed and implemented by Orson Peters ([`@orlp`](https://togithub.com/orlp)).
    It was measured to have slightly better performance for rustc, has better theoretical properties
    and also includes a signficantly better string hasher.
-   Fix `no_std` builds

### [`v1.2.0`](https://togithub.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#120-YANKED)

**Note: This version has been yanked due to issues with the `no_std` feature!**

-   Add a `FxBuildHasher` unit struct
-   Improve documentation
-   Add seed API for supplying custom seeds other than 0
-   Add `FxRandomState` based on `rand` (behind the `rand` feature) for random seeds
-   Make many functions `const fn`
-   Implement `Clone` for `FxHasher` struct

</details>

### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package rustc-hash@1.1.0 --precise 2.0.0
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `rustc-hash = "^1.1.0"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 2.0.0
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `salsa v0.18.0 (https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa.git?rev=f706aa2d32d473ee633a77c1af01d180c85da308#f706aa2d)`
    ... which satisfies git dependency `salsa` (locked to 0.18.0) of package `red_knot_module_resolver v0.0.0 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/ruff/crates/red_knot_module_resolver)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `red_knot_module_resolver` (locked to 0.0.0) of package `red_knot v0.1.0 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/ruff/crates/red_knot)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

```
