            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>As a follow-up to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15811#discussion_r1939617368">the discussion here</a>, this changeset adds a new salsa query</p>
<pre><code>fn infer_expression_type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;(db: &amp;&#x27;db dyn Db, expression: Expression&lt;&#x27;db&gt;) -&gt; Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which is similar to <code>infer_expression_types</code> (plural), but returns the type of the expression directly instead of returning a <code>TypeInference</code> object. We can use this in a few places. Notably, it can&#x27;t be used here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/9d83e76a3b57bbd8788535cd968376587fb3ec38/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types/narrow.rs#L500-L504</p>
<p>because that uses <code>self.scope()</code>, not <code>cls.scope()</code>.</p>
Test Plan

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whether we want to use <code>infer_expression_type</code> or not is slightly more subtle. The way you changed it in this PR isn&#x27;t incorrect but it means that we pay for an extra salsa queries even in cases where the isolation isn&#x27;t necessary.</p>
<p>We should only use <code>infer_expression_type</code> if it isn&#x27;t guaranteed that <code>expression</code> belongs to the same file as the enclosing query. This, for example, isn&#x27;t the case in the <code>TypeInferenceBuilder</code> or <code>Unpacker</code> where all ast nodes are guaranteed to be from the same file. We do want the isolation in <code>Type::own_member</code> because there&#x27;s no guarantee from which file (if any) the method is called.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In general, an expression node can only be part of one scope, and that scope is the only possible correct scope to pass to <code>scoped_expression_id</code> for that expression. So I believe that in any case where we are doing this pattern, either you could use <code>infer_expression_types</code> instead with no change in behavior, or the existing code was buggy. I think the only reason existing code wouldn&#x27;t use the scope of the expression itself was just because that code happened to already have that same scope stored in a more convenient place. I think this is also true for the narrowing code you linked in the PR summary.</p>
<p>(Note this comment is just about semantic correctness, and independent of the whole question of whether we should introduce another layer of Salsa query in all of these places.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems to me that this is sufficiently useful on ergonomic grounds, that it might even be worth having two variants of it, a Salsa-cached one and a non-Salsa-cached one. (The Salsa-cached one could just call the non-Salsa-cached one.)</p>
<p>I think it would also be very valuable if we could implement (via some combination of types, visibility, and code organization) a clearer distinction between &quot;code that can be called across files&quot; (mostly I think this code should live in <code>types.rs</code> and on <code>Type</code> today? Because <code>Type</code> is how type information travels between files) and &quot;code that exclusively operates on only one file&quot;, and ensure that the former code can never see an AST directly. This might be a non-trivial refactor, but I think it would be worth it. Maybe worth creating an issue for, at least?</p>

<p>Oh, I think you&#x27;re correct. This means the previous implementation would&#x27;ve been probably incorrect for comprehensions because the unpacking would happen in the comprehension scope while the expression is in the outer scope but the previous implementation would try to get the expression from the comprehension scope where it doesn&#x27;t exist.</p>
