            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Previously we held off from doing this because we weren&#x27;t sure that it was worth the added complexity cost. But our code has changed in the months since we made that initial decision, and I think the structure of the code is such that it no longer really leads to much added complexity to add precise inference when unpacking a string literal or a bytes literal.</p>
<p>The improved inference we gain from this has real benefits to users (see the mypy_primer report), and this PR doesn&#x27;t appear to have a performance impact.</p>

<p>Okay, this one&#x27;s pretty cool -- ty is now able to infer that all possibilities have been exhaustively covered here, meaning the variable cannot possibly be undefined by the time the code reaches the assertion at the bottom: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/99c0ef6af161a4d8157cae5276a20c30b7677c6f/scipy/linalg/tests/test_lapack.py#L147-L171</p>

<p>This is a good example of the sort of issue that led us to disable <code>possibly-unresolved-reference</code> by default. Maybe at some point we&#x27;ll be able to reconsider that!</p>
