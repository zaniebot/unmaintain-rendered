            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a quick implementation of the idea in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19900#issuecomment-3188463902. Especially as we start using new diagnostic features, it seems like a good idea to keep an eye on the <code>concise</code> output format as well as the <code>full</code>. This PR just appends a second rendering of the diagnostics in our rule snapshots in the <code>concise</code> format. The concise message is typically reused in the other output formats too, so this kind of gives us a bit of coverage for all the output formats.</p>
<p>I noticed that some of our concise messages are still quite long. That might be another good class of diagnostic to use new features for. Some explanatory pieces might fit better as sub-diagnostics, now that we're not limited to a single line in the default case.</p>
<p>Adding these lines (and adding a <code>let</code> binding for <code>emitter</code>) is the only code change:</p>

<p>Existing snapshots. Again, I clicked through these individually, but very, very quickly</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for looking into this.</p>
<p>IMO, this contains too much redundant information and will only increase the noise when making changes to our tests. That's why I'd prefer a more granular opt in to testing the concise output</p>
