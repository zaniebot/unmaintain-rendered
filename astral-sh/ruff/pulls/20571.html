            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Generate a timing diff across the whole ecosystem and deploy it to CloudFlare pages. The timing information is collected already, we just need to create and upload the HTML report.</p>
<p>The timing results are just based on a single run. No statistical analysis across multiple runs or similar is performed. This means that results can be noisy, as can be seen on this PR, where we see slowdowns up to 1.26× and speedups down to 0.89×, even though the change should be neutral. Across all projects, these random events cancel out and we see an average factor of 1.01×. So I think this feature can still be interesting, given that it comes &quot;for free&quot;. We just need to keep in mind that it will be noisy, and shouldn&#x27;t read too much into these results.</p>
Test Plan
<p>CI run on this PR (see the new <em>timing results</em> link).</p>
