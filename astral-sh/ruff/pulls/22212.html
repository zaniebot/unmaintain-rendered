            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This implements a fixer for E402, as suggested at <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6514">astral-sh/ruff#6514</a>.</p>
<p>This enables users to move imports up to the top of the file when they are found lower down. This is similar to isort&#x27;s <code>float-to-top</code> logic, though not quite the same. As suggested by @ntBre on that issue, the expected path here is for people to enable unsafe-fixes to access this feature, potentially marking this fix &quot;safe&quot; in their config, rather than to implement an <code>float-to-top</code> option in the isort config.</p>
<p>Internally this means that there are separate fix edits for each import found to be out of place rather than a single one (the latter being how isort tends to work).</p>
<p>The current state of this is a <em>first draft</em>. It&#x27;s working, I&#x27;ve done some manual testing and I have copied over a lot of the handling from the isort-like <code>organize_imports</code> function, though I may have missed things.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m also fairly new to rust and to this project so e.g: I don&#x27;t know if e.g: the code is the best way to spell some of the concepts. I&#x27;m very happy to refactor things if there&#x27;s better ways, including if e.g: we want to share more code between this and the isort crate -- I&#x27;ve deliberately not done that so far (purely to get to something which works).</p>
<p>This remains a bit work-in-progress, so I&#x27;ve included a test project I&#x27;m using for testing against though obviously that would be removed before this gets anywhere near merging. (I might also tidy the history a bit too)</p>
<p>Fixes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6514">astral-sh/ruff#6514</a></p>
Test Plan
<p>Manual testing so far, see various demo files currently committed. I&#x27;d like to add some tests and will look into that next. It looks like it&#x27;s mostly snapshot based testing. Do we just add a new test function in <code>crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pycodestyle/mod.rs</code>?</p>
<p>Noting them down so they&#x27;re written, test cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>interaction with editor organise-imports logic -- with and without the E402 fix being accepted as safe</li>
<li>variations on import spelling</li>
<li>variations of other statements near the import, including on the same line (e.g: peruse the isort tests and pick relevant looking ones)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Apologies for the radio silence here. I am definitely hoping to keep working on this, I haven&#x27;t had a lot of time recently. I <em>may</em> have some time next week or the following weekend, but not sure.</p>
<p>@ntBre if you have capacity for a review of what&#x27;s here or any suggestions on approaching the missing pieces that&#x27;d be most welcome.</p>
