            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just playing devils advocate here: let’s assume I’m a user doing this on purpose. I think more than likely it would be some sort of manual exploratory work (like “how many of these errors are there? maybe I can just fix em…). I think a warning in that scenario is okay. And to make it permanent you’d just delete the ignore from the config. So 👍 this makes sense.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah good question!</p>
<p>This should actually only trigger in cases in which the user passes in an error code via <code>--select</code> or <code>--extend-select</code>, and it gets nullified completely by an ignore (either <code>--ignore</code> or <code>--extend-ignore</code> or from the <code>pyproject.toml</code>).</p>
<p>If a user wants to test out an error that is currently ignored in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, then they do need to override that ignore somehow (e.g., remove it from the config) in order for it to be enforced at all.  So I think the warning is still right in that case: it only shows up if you <code>--select</code> something, but the other settings combine such that your <code>--select</code> actually didn't do anything.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Alternatively, if someone passes a code to <code>--select</code>, maybe we should override the <code>--ignore</code> completely. I don't see Flake8 doing that, but it's an option.)</p>
