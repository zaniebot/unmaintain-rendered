<p>The Linux CI job has been queued for 20 minutes on https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14383, and this is the obvious thing that's changed recently with respect to our Linux CI</p>

<p>It means we can't merge the <code>ruff-0.8</code> branch, since the Linux job is a required check, and the Linux job has now been queued for over an hour on https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14383. It doesn't block me, but it might block you, since you mentioned that you wanted to merge the branch so that you could get started writing the changelog.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hmm, so the jobs eventually started after being queued for over an hour... and now we have fast CI times again.</p>
<p>I'm okay with closing this for now and revisiting if it happens again (maybe it was a one-time fluke??)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry! Figuring out how often we run into these problems is sort of a goal of scaling up our usage of Depot. I'd prefer not to revert this, though I'm sorry it didn't work for a bit.</p>
