<p>The Linux CI job has been queued for 20 minutes on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14383">astral-sh/ruff#14383</a>, and this is the obvious thing that&#x27;s changed recently with respect to our Linux CI</p>

<p>It means we can&#x27;t merge the <code>ruff-0.8</code> branch, since the Linux job is a required check, and the Linux job has now been queued for over an hour on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14383">astral-sh/ruff#14383</a>. It doesn&#x27;t block me, but it might block you, since you mentioned that you wanted to merge the branch so that you could get started writing the changelog.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>oh lol... I assumed it&#x27;s just slower. Not that it&#x27;s queuing forever</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hmm, so the jobs eventually started after being queued for over an hour... and now we have fast CI times again.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m okay with closing this for now and revisiting if it happens again (maybe it was a one-time fluke??)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry! Figuring out how often we run into these problems is sort of a goal of scaling up our usage of Depot. I&#x27;d prefer not to revert this, though I&#x27;m sorry it didn&#x27;t work for a bit.</p>
