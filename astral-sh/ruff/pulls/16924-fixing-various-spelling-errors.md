## Summary

This is a cleanup PR. I am fixing various English language spelling errors. This is mostly in docs and docstrings.

## Test Plan

The usual CI tests were run. I tried to build the docs (though I had some troubles there). The testing needs here are, I trust, very low impact. (Though I would happily test more.)
