            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As part of an earlier version of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21784">astral-sh/ruff#21784</a>, I added upstream <code>salsa</code> and <code>get_size2</code> support for <code>ordermap</code>, but that ended up not being needed in the current version of that PR. However, @ibraheemdev has mentioned that we might like to switch to <code>ordermap</code> across the board once the <code>salsa</code> support was there. So I&#x27;m separating out these changes into this separate PR, and I&#x27;m expanding them to entirely remove <code>indexmap</code> as a dependency of <code>ty_python_semantic</code>. Do we like these changes?</p>

<p><code>OrderMap</code> does preserve insertion order. <code>OrderMap</code> is a thin wrapper around an IndexMap that adds order-sensitive <code>Hash</code> and <code>Eq</code> implementations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I think you might be quiet reasonably assuming this is a bigger change than it is</p>
<p>OrderMap and IndexMap are nearly identical types, both being &quot;HashMap but iteration order is insertion order&quot; (i.e. <em>neither</em> is BTreeMap-like)</p>
<p>I think the only difference that exists between them is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since its reintroduction in 0.5, ordermap has also used its entry order for PartialEq and Eq, whereas indexmap considers the same entries in any order to be equal for drop-in compatibility with HashMap semantics. Using the order is faster, and also allows ordermap to implement PartialOrd, Ord, and Hash.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The most important practical difference is this part above: &quot;Using the order...allows ordermap to implement PartialOrd, Ord, and Hash&quot;. <code>IndexMap</code> doesn&#x27;t support <code>Hash</code>, which means it can&#x27;t be a field in a <code>salsa::interned</code> struct. That already forces us to use <code>OrderMap</code> in some places. Until the upstream changes I mentioned above, though, only <code>IndexMap</code> impl&#x27;d <code>salsa::Update</code>, so we were also forced to use <code>IndexMap</code> in some places. But with the dependency bumps in <code>Cargo.toml</code> here, <code>OrderMap</code> also impls <code>salsa::Update</code>, and we never have to use <code>IndexMap</code>.</p>

<p>Ah that&#x27;s a good point. Apart from seeing that tests pass, I&#x27;m not sure.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We need OrderMaps/OrderSets whenever we need to use an insertion-order-preserving map/set as a field of a salsa-interned struct. Because fields of salsa-interned structs must be hashable, and IndexMaps/IndexSets are not hashable. There are therefore many places in ty where we already use OrderMap/OrderSet.</p>
<p>This PR switches all the other bits of the ty codebase, that <em>don&#x27;t</em> strictly need to be OrderMaps/OrderSets, over to using those structs instead of IndexMaps/IndexSets. I believe the rationale is that we have OrderMap as a dependency anyway, and it lowers the cognitive burden on us as developers if we no longer have to worry every time we write a salsa-interned struct whether a field should be an OrderMap/OrderSet or an IndexMap/IndexSet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the additional context. I&#x27;m still not sure this justifies the stricter equality everywhere but I&#x27;m probably missing some context.</p>
<p>Only having to know one map type (as I&#x27;m a perfect example of), certainly makes live easier</p>

<p>Yes, bad wording on my part :-) but you do have to think twice in contexts <em>outside</em> of salsa-interned struct fields currently.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m very neutral on this FWIW — I do agree that it would make life a bit easier, but I don&#x27;t really have a strong opinion any way at all!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My main worry is fixpoint convergence because a query might never converge if the order keeps changing between iterations (remember exported_names).</p>
<p>Because of that, changing the type for cyclic queries is only safe if we know the query converges on consistent ordering. I don&#x27;t have a good sense for when this is safe and simply changing all types seems too high risk to me for what we gain (I don&#x27;t mind migrating one by one or defaulting to orderedmap in the future)</p>

<p>Yes, that sounds good to me. It should also be safe to change <code>IndexMap</code> to <code>OrderMap</code> in places other than salsa query return types.</p>
