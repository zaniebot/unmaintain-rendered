<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>np.NAN was also deprecated / removed, as reported in #12195.</p>
<p>Personally, i'd also wan't to have warnings for <code>from numpy import nan, NaN, NAN</code> (NAN and NaN shouldn't import as they've been removed) - but that's really out of my league - as there's no similar case at the moment (at least not in the NPY201 section).
Obviously, this would &quot;also&quot; apply to essentially all other cases of deprecations.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added testcase, manual test</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this could also be moved next to <code>np.NaN</code> - which i'd find more appealing as it'd really belong there - but i found the diff on the .snap file to be rather large - as it changes all subsequent line numbers...</p>
<p>let me know if you'd prefer that</p>

<p>That makes sense. I think that's best tackled as a separate pr</p>
