# Use `line-length` setting for isort

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

I incorrectly changed all `line-length` usages in the linter to use the `pycodestyle.max-line-length` setting. However, this is incorrect for `isort` that should use the same line length as the formatter (to ensure compatibility). 

## Test Plan

I tested in the playground that setting `line-length` to a lower limit than `pycodestyle.max-line-length` raises `I001`. Increasing the `line-length` makes the warning disappear again. Verified that `E501` continues to use the `pycodestyle.max-line-length` option.
