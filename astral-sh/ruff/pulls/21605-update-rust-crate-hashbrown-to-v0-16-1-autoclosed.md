[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/compare/v0.16.0...v0.16.1)

##### Added

- Added `HashTable` methods related to the raw bucket index ([#&#8203;657](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/657))
- Added `VacantEntryRef::insert_with_key` ([#&#8203;579](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/579))

##### Changed

- Removed specialization for `Copy` types ([#&#8203;662](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/662))
- The `get_many_mut` family of methods have been renamed to `get_disjoint_mut`

  deprecated. ([#&#8203;648](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/648))
- Recognize and use over-sized allocations when using custom allocators. ([#&#8203;523](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/523))
- Depend on `serde_core` instead of `serde`. ([#&#8203;649](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/649))
- Optimized `collect` on rayon parallel iterators. ([#&#8203;652](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/issues/652))
