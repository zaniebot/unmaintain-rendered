# change url to comply with pep 621

_@okken_

I was surprised when looking at the repository wasn't listed on PyPI:
https://pypi.org/project/ruff/

I think this might be because the url listed in pyproject.toml doesn't comply with [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/#example)

It's a small change. I chose "repository", but "home" or "github" would work too.
