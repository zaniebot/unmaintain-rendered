            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add more tests for various edge cases, especially around visibility constraints</li>
<li>Split some tests up and add some more narrative description</li>
<li>Fix some minor bugs in various tests that weren't actually testing what they were meant to be testing</li>
<li>Where there is only one module exporting things, and only one module importing things, consistently name the first of these <code>exporter.py</code> and the second of these <code>importer.py</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>uvx pre-commit run -a</code></li>
<li><code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code></li>
<li>Re-read it several times to make sure it made sense</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a somewhat large PR, but I'm going to &quot;bias towards action&quot; and merge without review: I want to rebase https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17286 on top of it, land <em>that</em> PR and then move onto other tasks. This PR also only makes changes to our test suite, not to any of our functionality. If anybody has any comments around any of the changes here, I'm very happy to tackle them in followup PRs!</p>
<p>Tests don't seem to be running in CI here... but I ran the tests locally so I'm pretty confident this won't break <code>main</code> 🤞</p>
