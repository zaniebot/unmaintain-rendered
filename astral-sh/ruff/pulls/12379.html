            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR cleans up some of the settings validation and types in the module resolver. Namely, at various points in the crate, we use a type alias, a ModuleResolutionPathBuf or an <code>Arc&lt;ModuleResolutionPathBuf&gt;</code> to refer to a module search path. This PR goes some way to cleaning that up by introducing a newtype wrapper in path.rs for module-resolution paths that specifically represent search paths.</p>
<p>The main motivation for this change is because module search paths and other module-resolution paths have different invariants, so should be validated differently. This PR has been split off from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12376, which bundled the validation changes in as the same PR, to ease review.</p>
<p>Copying from the PR description of #12376:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR goes halfway to addressing @carljm's review comments in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12141#discussion_r1667010245. We now have a distinct type for representing search paths specifically outside of <code>path.rs</code>. However, internally, <code>path.rs</code> still doesn't make much distinction between search paths and other kinds of paths: it doesn't have to, because I implemented <code>Deref</code> for the new <code>ModuleSearchPath</code> struct; all methods available on <code>ModuleResolutionPathBuf</code> are implicitly available on <code>ModuleSearchPath</code>. This is somewhat lazy and unprincipled of me, and I've left a TODO comment to get rid of it. I spent much of yesterday trying to get to a more principled solution, but it ends up being a massive diff that rewrites much of <code>path.rs</code>, and I don't think it's a priority for now. I think this is a nice cleanup that clarifies the types and improves settings validation in the meantime, without being a massive rewrite that would be time-consuming to write and review.</p>

<p>Can we rename the <code>PathBuf</code> and <code>PathRef</code> structs to maybe <code>ModulePathBuf</code> and <code>ModulePathRef</code>. At least I understand that these are now paths to modules and not to the search paths.</p>
<p>These structs could also use some documentation to explain the intent.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's harder to see the benefit when the validation changes are decoupled from the change to use a new type. This is partly why I originally put them together in one PR, in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12376.</p>

<p>Those aren't the names I've used -- the three structs are <code>ModuleSearchPath</code>, <code>ModuleResolutionPathBuf</code> and <code>ModuleResolutionPathRef</code>, which isn't <em>so</em> confusing. But I like your proposed rename.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks like a good start that brings a bit of extra naming clarity, but doesn't do the real refactor yet, just as advertised.</p>
<p>I agree with both of Micha's comments.</p>
<p>I'm fine landing this and holding off on any more refactor for now, until/unless there are actual problems caused by the current structure.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This makes sense but I'm going to postpone it for now. The idea of this PR was that it would be a small, incremental change that would be easy to review. Addressing this would require lots of changes to tests, and I think this PR is an improvement over the status quo as it stands.</p>
