            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Remove a hack in control flow modeling that was treating <code>return</code> statements at the end of function bodies in a special way (basically considering the state <em>just before</em> the <code>return</code> statement as the end-of-scope state). This is not needed anymore now that #18750 has been merged.</p>
<p>In order to make this work, we now use <em>all reachable bindings</em> for purposes of finding implicit instance attribute assignments as well as for deferred lookups of symbols. Both would otherwise be affected by this change:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def C:
    def f(self):
        self.x = 1  # a reachable binding that is not visible at the end of the scope
        return
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f():
    class X: ...  # a reachable binding that is not visible at the end of the scope
    x: &quot;X&quot; = X()  # deferred use of `X`
    return
</code></pre>
<p>Implicit instance attributes also required another change. We previously kept track of possibly-unbound instance attributes in some cases, but we now give up on that completely and always consider <em>implicit</em> instance attributes to be bound if we see a reachable binding in a reachable method. The previous behavior was somewhat inconsistent anyway because we also do not consider attributes possibly-unbound in other scenarios: we do not (and can not) keep track of whether or not methods are called that define these attributes.</p>
<p>closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/711</p>
<h2>Ecosystem analysis</h2>
<p>I think this looks very positive!</p>
<ul>
<li>We see an unsurprising drop in <code>possibly-unbound-attribute</code> diagnostics (599), mostly for classes that define attributes in <code>try … except</code> blocks, <code>for</code> loops, or <code>if … else: raise …</code> constructs. There might obviously also be true positives that got removed, but the vast majority should be false positives.</li>
<li>There is also a drop in <code>possibly-unresolved-reference</code> / <code>unresolved-reference</code> diagnostics (279+13) from the change to deferred lookups.</li>
<li>Some <code>invalid-type-form</code> false positives got resolved (13), because we can now properly look up the names in the annotations.</li>
<li>There are some new <em>true</em> positives in <code>attrs</code>, since we understand the <code>Attribute</code> annotation that was previously inferred as <code>Unknown</code> because of a re-assignment after the class definition.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>The existing attributes.md test suite has sufficient coverage here.</p>
