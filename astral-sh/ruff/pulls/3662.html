            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One challenge with this rule is that in Pylint, you typically have to enable it explicitly (I think?) by enabling the <code>pylint.extensions.while_used</code> checker. We don't have a great mechanic for that, so all users that have Pylint enabled would be opted into this 🤔</p>

<p>Ah fair point @charliermarsh, could we add an config option for Pylint like <code>while_used</code> to be set to true that way it only runs when the user has it enabled, similar to how the user would be enabling it with <code>extensions.while_used</code> in standard Pylint?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh, I've added a config option via Pylint's <code>Options</code> struct to try to simulate the <code>pylint.extension</code> needing to be enabled too. If this route isn't the way you'd like to head and this rule is too opinionated I understand not implementing :smile_cat:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a clever solution... Even <em>with</em> that, I think I'm gonna err on the side of skipping this one. The issue is we now have two ways to &quot;turn on&quot; the rule -- e.g., if a user does <code>--select PLW0149</code>, the rule actually wouldn't turn on, which feels unintuitive. But it <em>also</em> feels unintuitive for that to turn on the rule despite the presence of this extension setting!</p>

<p>I appreciate that, I've been jumping in head first into the Ruff ecosystem and it's allowing me to learn Rust and be able to contribute to a great community and project, so I've just started working on them first and have no hard feelings on closing a PR :smile: . However, will definitely ping you in the future if the rule seems very opinionated or noisy on how you'd like to proceed with it :smile:</p>

<p>(FWIW, in general, I'm happy to add anything on the Pylint list, but am wary of adding those rules that are part of Pylint <em>extensions</em> which is typically buried at the bottom of the page for the relevant rule.)</p>
