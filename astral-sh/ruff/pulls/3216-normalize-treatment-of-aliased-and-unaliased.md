# Normalize treatment of aliased and unaliased imports

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-24 22:04_

We now use the same data model for all "kinds" of imports. It's slightly denormalized, but it means we have more consistent behavior and fewer cases to reason about.

Closes #3168.
