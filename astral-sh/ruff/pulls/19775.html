<p>While I tend to prefer using <code>Self</code> too, it's also something that IDEs struggle with (e.g. fill in match arms doesn't use <code>Self</code>) and I suspect that coding agents will struggle with this too.</p>
<p>That's why I think this creates more work than it's worth it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't feel strongly about this, but I've generally resisted using <code>Self</code> because I find that while it makes <em>writing</em> code a little easier, it makes code just a little bit harder to read than it needs to be. I like to optimize for readers. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I weakly prefer using the type name instead of <code>Self</code>, but am more bothered by our <em>inconsistency</em>. So I would be in favor of a clippy lint that enforces a consistent style, even if it's not the style I'd prefer. I don't suppose there's a clippy lint that <em>disallows</em> <code>Self</code>, is there? :grin:</p>
<p>Though looking at the diff, it doesn't look like this affects enum variants (e.g. mandating one of <code>Type::TypeVar</code> vs <code>Self::TypeVar</code> inside of <code>Type</code>), which is where most of our inconsistency currently is. So it doesn't seem like this lint actually enforces full consistency.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because it makes it easier to see what type is being returned without having to scroll up to resolve the <code>Self</code> symbol.</p>
<p>(There are some instances where <code>Self</code> is required, particularly in trait definitions. So any Clippy lint that forbade <code>Self</code> would need to know when to <em>not</em> forbid it haha.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think I want to keep debating this. It's not always obvious (to me) which type I'm in when I jump to a place in the code. It's an opinion of mild degree that I don't hold strongly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll close this for now. Not because not using <code>Self</code> or inconsistency is better, but because I want to avoid such a minor detail distracting the team, and it seems there's no clear consensus.</p>
