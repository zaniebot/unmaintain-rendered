            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Extend red-knot type inference to cover all syntax, so that inferring types for a scope gives all expressions a type. This means we can run the red-knot semantic lint on all Python code without panics. It also means we can infer types for <code>builtins.pyi</code> without panics.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, this PR intentionally doesn't add any new type inference capabilities: the expanded coverage is all achieved with <code>Type::Unknown</code>. But this puts the skeleton in place for adding better inference of all these language features.</p>
<p>I also had to add basic Salsa cycle recovery (with just <code>Type::Unknown</code> for now), because some <code>builtins.pyi</code> definitions are cyclic.</p>
<p>To test this, I added a comprehensive corpus of test snippets sourced from Cinder under <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder/blob/cinder/3.10/cinderx/LICENSE">MIT license</a>, which matches Ruff's license. I also added to this corpus some additional snippets for newer language features: all the <code>27_func_generic_*</code> and <code>73_class_generic_*</code> files, as well as <code>20_lambda_default_arg.py</code>, and added a test which runs semantic-lint over all these files. (The test doesn't assert the test-corpus files are lint-free; just that they are able to lint without a panic.)</p>

<p>That's why I would rename the folder to <code>cinder</code> (to make the attribution very clear) or <code>smoke</code> to at least express the intend fo the tests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The overall approach looks great to me.</p>
<p>I wonder if this corpus of Python code should go in a redknot crate at all. It could also be a useful resource for testing the parser.</p>
<p>Additionally, we already have a Python script that fuzzes the parser on randomly generated (but guaranteed to be syntactically valid) Python source code (in the <code>scripts/fuzz-parser</code> directory), which we run as a CI job. It might be interesting to adapt that script so that it also runs redknot on the generated source code. I don't think it would be too hard to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The actual attribution history is more complicated than that; Cinder originally took these from another Python compiler project and added to them over time. And the Cinder license is MIT license, same as Ruff, and MIT license doesn't require attribution as a condition. So I don't think anything else is really needed here; there's no need or value in having two different copies of the same MIT license in two different places. I can add a readme that clarifies what I know about the history of this corpus, if you think that's useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should name these files for what they are, not how they are used. What they <em>are</em> is a body of snippets of Python code aiming to cover the syntax of the language. Anything that fits that description and covers a gap makes sense to add here. I think &quot;corpus&quot; is a good name for that, but I'm open to other suggestions.</p>
<p>I don't think they should be named for where they came from -- that isn't really relevant to anything. And I don't think they should be named for how we use them in one particular test; as Alex already pointed out, there are more potential uses for them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah. I think the main challenge that I see with this is where should I add a red knot specific test? The test may not make sense for the parser (or at least, it wouldn't give us a lot extra coverage so running a dedicated snapshot test for it doesn't make sense). Same for the formatter.</p>
<p>What's important to me is that contributors will know where to add a test and that it avoids creating unnecessary tests for parts that don't need running or where it doesn't provide any added value.</p>
