# Add tests for `return` statement

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-04-04 06:47_

## Summary

This PR adds support for `return` statement.

There's one TODO around not allowing yield expression which I want to solve holistically. Otherwise, both expression and statement parsing will be filled with error reporting.
