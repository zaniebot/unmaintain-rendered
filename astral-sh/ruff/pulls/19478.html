Summary
<p>Fixes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/815">astral-sh/ty#815</a>.</p>
<p>Previously a snippet of the form :</p>
<pre><code># fmt: off

def _(c: Callable[ 
            {1, 2}  
        ]
    ):
    reveal_type(c)  # revealed: (...) -&gt; Unknown
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<p>caused a panic in mdtests because no type was stored for argument <code>{1, 2}</code>. Now we store a type for the single argument case with <code>CallableType::unknown(..)</code> if it is a valid first argument to <code>Callable</code> (list of types, <code>ParamSpec</code>, Concatenate or <code>...</code>) or we infer it otherwise. For the tuple case, we make sure to infer the types in case the first argument is not valid.</p>
Test Plan


<p>Removed the <code>pull-types:skip</code> directive and added an additional error in the relevant test.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This doesn&#x27;t feel right (and it&#x27;s the cause of the &quot;unnecessary&quot; extra diagnostics I mentioned in the tests). We know that whatever expression is here, it&#x27;s not valid in this context. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to then try to infer it as a type expression (when an arbitrary type expression is not valid here, even if its a valid type expression!). We are only doing this because it&#x27;s the most convenient way to ensure a type is assigned to every sub-expression. If we had a &quot;walk expression tree and store Unknown for every sub-expression&quot; it would make more sense to use that here -- but we haven&#x27;t built that utility. And really even that seems wasteful.</p>
<p>I feel like this is pushing me over the edge where I am really ready to just implement a blanket fallback to Unknown (at query time) for any expression we didn&#x27;t store a type for, and be done with the &quot;no type stored for this expression&quot; panics once and for all. I think it&#x27;s fine if we occasionally miss an expression, end up with Unknown, and eventually get a bug report. And it can save us so much useless work (here I mean partially runtime work, but also development work) in error cases, where it would just become fine/correct to return early and not bother with storing types.</p>

<p>Strong agree (see also my &quot;side remark&quot; in the linked PR). We could maybe still make it a hard error (or at least an error in debug mode) if we fall back to <code>Unknown</code> within valid code, if that information is easy to retrieve/generate?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I still have concerns about the impact this might have on the ability to use ty as a backend for Ruff in the long-term (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14629">astral-sh/ruff#14629</a>#issuecomment-2505930718, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14629">astral-sh/ruff#14629</a>#issuecomment-2506271894).</p>
<p>I agree that we&#x27;ve spent a frustrating amount of time chasing down corpus panics for invalid syntax and/or invalid type expressions. But these corpus tests have also caught some genuine bugs where we weren&#x27;t storing subexpressions for nodes involving <em>valid</em> type expressions -- <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18535">astral-sh/ruff#18535</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18536">astral-sh/ruff#18536</a> were examples. I think it would be really confusing for users if they saw <code>Unknown</code> when hovering over an AST node inside a valid type expression. It would also be hard to figure out why a lint rule that used ty as a backend wasn&#x27;t getting the correct result when a bug was caused by <code>Unknown</code> being stored for an AST subnode. So I do think the corpus tests are valuable.</p>
<p>We are definitely too panicky in the server right now, though, and we definitely emit too many cascading diagnostics for invalid type expressions. My preferred solution for the first problem would be to keep the strict corpus tests, but to avoid indexing directly into the expression map from the server code -- instead we should do something like <code>expression_map.get(node).unwrap_or(Type::unknown())</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I looked back at that prior discussion, and I am not convinced that future-type-aware-Ruff is sufficient motivation for us to work so hard to infer meaningful types for invalid expressions. Invalid expressions aren&#x27;t common, issue their own errors, and tend to be fixed -- we don&#x27;t need type-aware-Ruff to issue a cascading diagnostic for every other possible lint issue inside an invalid annotation. (I don&#x27;t buy that there are any significant numbers of people who care about Ruff emitting a diagnostic for <code>Literal[1, 1]</code> everywhere it is used, but don&#x27;t care about valid type annotations in the first place.)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s still not clear to me how you would actually propose to handle the case in this PR. Should we infer it as a type expression, even though it is not in a context where a type expression is either valid or expected? As a value expression, even though it is not a context where a value expression is valid or expected? Neither option makes semantic sense, and both risk unnecessary/confusing cascading errors. I don&#x27;t know of any other option that&#x27;s been suggested, other than &quot;explicitly store Unknown for the whole tree.&quot; That option is significantly more work, and it still doesn&#x27;t help the Ruff case.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#x27;s not ideal if we wrongly reveal <code>Unknown</code> on hover in some valid case where we should reveal some other type. If this happens and it&#x27;s noticeable, it will eventually be reported as a bug and we will fix it like any other bug. (&quot;Failed to infer a type for an expression&quot; is only one way this can happen; enforcing an explicitly-stored type for every expression doesn&#x27;t prevent it.) I don&#x27;t think this is a super high priority category of bug, and I think the cost of this particular method of helping us to prevent it is significantly greater than the benefit.</p>
<p>I agree that at minimum we must start using a fallback when we pull types in the server, so we don&#x27;t panic, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s sufficient. If we maintain that the corpus tests must find an explicit type for every expression, that means we still (in principle, though we won&#x27;t catch the bugs as quickly via playground/LSP panics) require ourselves to always find some way to infer and explicitly store a type for every expression, including in all error cases. And I think that is a bad use of our time, and we should stop doing it.</p>
<p>I think the corpus tests should continue to exist, and should continue to pull a type for every expression, because that helps catch other failures/panics. But the corpus tests should also use a fallback to <code>Unknown</code> and no longer panic if they don&#x27;t find an explicitly-stored type for some expression.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your understanding! I think we really already have most of the mechanism, and this is a relatively easy change to <code>TypeInference::expression_type</code> -- instead of using <code>.expect</code> and panicking if <code>try_expression_type</code> returns <code>None</code>, it should instead fallback to <code>Unknown</code>.</p>

<p>I&#x27;d still like to try out the idea I mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/727">astral-sh/ty#727</a>#issuecomment-3019180248, of refactoring <code>infer_type_expression</code> to return a <code>Result</code> rather than eagerly emitting diagnostics. I think this would have a lot of benefits more broadly. But it wouldn&#x27;t be an easy refactor; your solution certainly gets us to a no-panic state more quickly.</p>
