## Summary

This was [discussed](https://discord.com/channels/1039017663004942429/1070132471699607623/1258392448569184417) previously on Discord, and then found out _indention_ was used in multiple places in the code. _indentation_ was used more than _indention_, so figured it would be easier to replace the existing _indention_ usage to _indentation_.

## Test Plan

<!-- How was it tested? -->
