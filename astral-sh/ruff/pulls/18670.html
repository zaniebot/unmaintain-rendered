            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I moved the <code>parsed_module</code> query inside of <code>ClassLiteral::header_range</code> to avoid this footgun in the future, but this likely doesn't apply to all uses of <code>header_range</code>, so we could instead make the correct query at call-site. @MichaReiser let me know if you would prefer that, because you mentioned you wanted to remain consistent with non-salsa-queries taking a <code>&amp;ParsedModuleRef</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks good to me; thanks for the fix! There is only one possible <code>ParsedModule</code> that is correct to use here, and we already have the information to know which it is, so there's no reason to leave open the possibility of a caller passing in the wrong one. Especially given that this results in a hard-to-understand crash, and the bug clearly can go undetected until we have a very particular cross-module scenario, so it may not be caught by tests.</p>
<p>It's true that this means calling <code>header_range</code> or <code>header_span</code> on a class implicitly means adopting a direct dependency on the AST of the module in which the class is defined, but that's the unavoidable nature of asking for a range/span, and it seems clear enough in the method names.</p>
<p>I don't mind waiting to land this until @MichaReiser has a chance to review it, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @carljm's assessment here. I think it's fine for functions to call parse internally if there's only one correct parsed module</p>
