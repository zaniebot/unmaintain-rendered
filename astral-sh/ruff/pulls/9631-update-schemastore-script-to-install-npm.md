# Update SchemaStore script to install npm dependencies

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-01-24 03:30_

## Summary

SchemaStore now depends on some Prettier plugins, so we need to install Prettier and its plugins as part of the project (rather than relying on a global install).

## Test Plan

Ran the script!
