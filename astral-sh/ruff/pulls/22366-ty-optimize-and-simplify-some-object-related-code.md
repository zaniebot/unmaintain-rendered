# [ty] Optimize and simplify some `object`-related code

---

_@AlexWaygood_

## Summary

I wondered if this might improve performance a little. It doesn't seem to, but it's a net reduction in LOC and I think the changes make sense. I think it's worth it anyway just in terms of simplifying the code.

## Test Plan

Our existing tests all pass and the primer report is clean (aside from our usual flakes).
