            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This extracts some pure refactoring noise from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15861.  This changes the API for creating and evaluating visibility constraints, but does not change how they are respresented internally.  There should be no behavioral or performance changes in this PR.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the internal representation isn't changed, so that we can make changes to it in #15861.</li>
<li>Add a separate builder type for visibility constraints. (With TDDs, we will have some additional builder state that we can throw away once we're done constructing.)</li>
<li>Remove a layer of helper methods from <code>UseDefMapBuilder</code>, making <code>SemanticIndexBuilder</code> responsible for constructing whatever visibility constraints it needs.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is to make sure that terminals are always normalized. Before we didn't have separate a variant for <code>AlwaysFalse</code>, we represented that as <code>VisibleIfNot(AlwaysTrue)</code>.  I added the additional variant to make sure all terminals had first-class support in the enum.  The AND and OR constructors were already handling cases where we statically know the result (e.g. <code>A ∧ false == false</code> for all <code>A</code>) so I wanted to be consistent here.</p>
