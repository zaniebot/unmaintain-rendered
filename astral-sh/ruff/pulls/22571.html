            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This leads to us calculating whether or not we're in a class def twice, here and in <code>add_argument_completions</code>. I think this is fine for now but we probably want to do some refactors here and store more information on the context such that we only run the detection once and can re-use that both to add completions and for ranking. Perhaps the <code>NonImportContext</code> can store another enum and track if we're in a class-def/raising_exception etc.</p>
<p>Have you already thought about how to best scale this @BurntSushi ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven't thought too much about this, no. But what you say sounds plausible to me. Possibly the challenge here is making sure we don't try to pre-compute too much stuff, particularly if we end up not needing it.</p>
<p>But yeah I agree that this is fine for now. Especially given that <code>covering_node</code> is only computed once now. :-)</p>
