            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Ignoring all lines until the first logical line does not match the behavior from pycodestyle. This PR therefore removes the <code>if state.is_not_first_logical_line</code> skipping the line check before the first logical line, and applies it only to <code>E302</code>.</p>
<p>For example, in the snippet below a rule violation should be detected on the second comment and on the import.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># first comment




# second comment




import foo
</code></pre>
<p>Fixes #10374</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>It was tested on the example given on the issue, and by running cargo test. Since this is an issue about the first line(s) of a file I did not add a fixture for it.
The ruff-ecosystem check should help verify that the PR does not have unintended side-effects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with your test plan although I think it would be useful to avoid any potential regression in the future. It's always good to have a test case for a bug fix PR which fails on <code>main</code> and passes on this branch :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dhruvmanila I've added a few fixtures as you requested. Since <code>E302</code> and <code>E303</code> are the only rules that should be able to trigger on the second line, I only added snapshots for those rules.</p>
<p>Should I also add snapshots for the other rules to check that no false positive is introduced in the future ?</p>
