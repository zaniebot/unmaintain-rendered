            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR moves all the relation methods from <code>CallableType</code> to <code>Signature</code>.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that <code>Signature</code> is going to be the common denominator between normal and overloaded callables and the core logic to check a certain relationship is going to just require the information that would exists on <code>Signature</code>. For example, to check whether an overloaded callable is a subtype of a normal callable, we need to check whether <em>every</em> overloaded signature is a subtype of the normal callable's signature. This &quot;every&quot; logic would become part of the <code>CallableType</code> and the core logic of checking the subtyping would exists on <code>Signature</code>.</p>

<p>Interesting! Curious to know what your <code>.gitconfig</code> has in the <code>[diff]</code> section</p>
