            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds <code>Type::call_bound</code> method for calls that should follow descriptor protocol calling convention. The PR is intentionally shallow in scope and only fixes #15672</p>
<p>Couple of obvious things that weren't done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to <code>call_bound</code> everywhere it should be used</li>
<li>Address the fact, that red_knot resolves <code>__bool__ = bool</code> as a Union, which includes <code>Type::Dynamic</code> and hence fails to infer that the truthiness is always false for such a class (I've added a todo comment in mdtests)</li>
<li>Doesn't try to invent a new type for descriptors, although I have a gut feeling it may be more convenient in the end, instead of doing method lookup each time like I did in <code>call_bound</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>extended mdtests with 2 examples from the issue</li>
<li>cargo neatest run</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this case is important enough to test in two different places.</p>
<p>I think it belongs better where you've put it (in <code>truthiness.md</code>). But really, most of this file should be moved over to <code>truthiness.md</code>, this file should really just test type negation and nothing else. It would probably be better to either move all the instance <code>__bool__</code> tests over at once, or none of them.</p>
<p>Best would probably be to move them in a separate PR, rather than in this one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should handle <code>Type::SubclassOf</code> as well -- but so should <code>Type::call</code>, and it doesn't either. So this can probably be left to a separate PR to fix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this TODO is not quite describing the situation accurately. We already correctly implement that <code>bool</code> called with no arguments returns <code>Literal[False]</code>. And your PR does correctly implement that calling the <code>bool</code> class as a method, since it is not a descriptor, calls <code>bool</code> with no arguments, which returns <code>Literal[False]</code>.</p>
<p>But since <code>BoolIsBool.__bool__</code> has no declared type, we model that it could be reassigned to any type, so we give it the type <code>Unknown | Literal[bool]</code> instead of the type <code>Literal[bool]</code>. And <code>Unknown</code> has ambiguous truthiness, so the result is that we still infer <code>bool</code>, rather than <code>Literal[false]</code>, here.</p>
<p>Since this result is not wrong, and the reasons we arrive at it are complex to explain (and are already explained in detail in other tests), I would just remove this TODO entirely here. The main point of this test is that we can handle this situation without a panic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since we don't have tests for descriptor protocol (and this PR doesn't add any), and we may want to design our descriptor protocol support a bit more holistically (not just specific to bound calls), I think we should not add support for it here. Instead we should just simplify this code to assume non-descriptor, with a TODO comment for descriptor support.</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">                // TODO descriptor protocol. For now, assume non-descriptor and call without `self` argument.
                self.call(db, arguments)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: can we group this down with the default not-callable case and explicitly mark them with a comment as &quot;cases that duplicate <code>Type::call</code>&quot;?</p>
<p>I think it may be worth duplicating these cases here, rather than deferring to <code>Type::call</code>, since they are very simple, and it will be less efficient to defer to <code>Type::call</code>. But I'd like to be clear on which cases should be kept in exact sync.</p>

<p>I removed this specific case from <code>not.md</code> and left it only in the <code>truthiness.md</code> file. I can move the rest in a separate follow-up or as a flyby with other stuff</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd love to work on the descriptor protocol as a whole, would be fun and will allow me to better review more of the red_knot codebase. If you are fine with that, I can open a separate draft PR and outline a plan.</p>
<p>One obvious place to start would be: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/0529ad67d76d01c5ca586ad9b3db8b37c1a930dc/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types.rs#L4211-L4219  and implement proper handling of <code>property</code> instead of a current &quot;workaround&quot;. This would serve as a test. + I can make a special mdtest suite for descriptors in general.</p>
<p>As for my code here, I do not think that there is harm in leaving it, as it will work for cases when <code>__get__</code> method is defined explicitly already, but since you suggest removing it, I'll just stash it and see if it eventually survives.</p>

<p>I think @sharkdp was planning to tackle descriptors soon, but may be open to you working on that instead, freeing him up to tackle something else? Let's wait for him to respond before you start on it, in case he has already started on it.</p>
<p>It would definitely be good to open an issue with a proposed design first, so we can discuss, before opening a PR; this may save some implementation work.</p>

<p>@mishamsk If you want to work on descriptors, we would definitely appreciate it! Starting with a separate design step sounds like a good idea. Please feel free to add comments to this issue: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15966</p>
<p>I will also set up an initial draft for a descriptor test suite that we can detail further while we work on the design and the implementation (Edit: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15972).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In case you want to work on something with a smaller scope first, I created a couple of fine-grained tickets around our understanding of instance and class attributes. They are listed as sub-tasks <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14164">here</a> and are roughly ordered by priority and inter-dependencies. I marked some of these issues as <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ared-knot+label%3A%22help+wanted%22">&quot;help wanted&quot;</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sharkdp thanks a lot for all the links. Helps a ton, I wouldn't have found that tracking issue myself easily.</p>
<p>I'll try to do both - comment on some plan rgd descriptors &amp; pick up one of the issues from #14164 - will do at least of two later today (I am EST)</p>
