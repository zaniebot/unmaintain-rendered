            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Part of astral-sh/ruff#15382</p>
<p>This PR infers the return type <code>lambda</code> expression as <code>Unknown</code>. In the future, it would be more useful to infer the expression type considering the surrounding context (#16696).</p>
<p>~This is done by adding the expression that represents the default value of the parameters as a standalone expression. Without this, it would create cycles as described in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16547. Both function and lambda expression's parameter defaults are added as standalone expression as we cannot differentiate between the two when doing the inference in <code>infer_parameter_definition</code>.~</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Update existing test cases from <code>@todo</code> to the (verified) return type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>mypy-primer is hitting a problem on <code>isort</code>. I'm looking into it. It looks similar to some issues we already see on some other mypy-primer projects. I think this PR is not urgent so we can hold off until we understand the issue?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On looking at this a bit more, I don't think we should go forward with landing this approach. I think instead, as I mentioned in Discord, we should simply record <code>Type::Unknown</code> as the return type of a lambda's callable type for now.</p>
<p>Useful inference of a lambda's return type will require a different approach, which does the inference of the body expression based on arguments at each call site, rather than eagerly computing a return type without knowing the argument types. I don't think anything from this approach would carry over to that, so I don't think it's worth making all function defaults standalone expressions just so that we can temporarily have slightly more information about lambda return types.</p>

<p>Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks for looking into it, I'll update the PR to use <code>Unknown</code>, add a TODO.</p>
