# Watch for changes to the generated file during documentation serve

---

_@dhruvmanila_

## Summary

Similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9244, but we need to use the `mkdocs.generated.yml` file because the `scripts/generate_mkdocs.py` uses the `mkdocs.template.yml` to generate the final config.
