# [ty] Introduce `ClassBase::Object`

_@AlexWaygood_

I'm not sure this is worth the increase in complexity, but I'm curious to see if this has any performance impact

## [CodSpeed Performance Report](https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/ruff/branches/alex%2Fclassbase-object?utm_source=github&utm_medium=comment&utm_content=header)

### Merging #22365 will **degrade performance by 5.51%**

<sub>Comparing <code>alex/classbase-object</code> (1efe431) with <code>main</code> (8464aca)</sub>



### Summary

`❌ 1` regression  
`✅ 21` untouched  
`⏩ 30` skipped[^skipped]  


> :warning: _Please fix the performance issues or [acknowledge them on CodSpeed](https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/ruff/branches/alex%2Fclassbase-object?utm_source=github&utm_medium=comment&utm_content=acknowledge)._

### Benchmarks breakdown

|     | Mode | Benchmark | `BASE` | `HEAD` | Efficiency |
| --- | ---- | --------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| ❌ | WallTime | [`` pydantic ``](https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/ruff/branches/alex%2Fclassbase-object?uri=crates%2Fruff_benchmark%2Fbenches%2Fty_walltime.rs%3A%3Apydantic&runnerMode=WallTime&utm_source=github&utm_medium=comment&utm_content=benchmark) | 10.6 s | 11.2 s | -5.51% |

[^skipped]: 30 benchmarks were skipped, so the baseline results were used instead.

yeah, uh, not the one I was hoping for tho 🤣

I also found running the ty-benchmarks script very helpful to assess performance wins. I think we have a pretty good coverage there, sometimes even better than on codspeed (e.g. discord.py) and it's guaranteed to reflect in real world performance wins.

clearly this was not one of my better ideas 😆
