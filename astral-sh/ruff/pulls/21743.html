            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>Display</code> implementation for constraint sets is brittle, and deserves a rethink. But later! It's perfectly fine for printf debugging; we just shouldn't be writing mdtests that depend on any particular rendering details. Most of these tests can be replaced with an equivalence check that actually validates that the <em>behavior</em> of two constraint sets are identical.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I guess the major drawback of this is that <code>static_assert</code> will only give you a success/failure feedback, whereas a failing <code>reveal_type</code> tests gives you both display representations (one in the error message, one in the test assertion).</p>
<p>We could follow the route of many other test frameworks and introduce something like a <code>static_assert_eq(left, right)</code> function that would show the display representation of the types of both arguments in case of a failure. That might be even nicer than <code>reveal_type</code> tests because we could properly align the left and right hand side types in the terminal.</p>

<p>The other PR was blocked on this one, though, so thank you regardless!</p>

<p>That's a good idea, I opened https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1719 to track it.</p>
