            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we generally include examples like this, but I don't really mind it if you want to keep it. The <code>preserved comment</code> here is technically after the replacement range, so it's a bit redundant with the explanation in your first line, but that's probably not obvious to most users.</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">/// An example to illustrate where comments are preserved and where they are not:
///
/// ```py
/// a, b = 0, 10
///
/// if a &gt;= b: # deleted comment
///     # deleted comment
///     a = b # preserved comment
/// ```
///
</code></pre>
<p>If we do keep the example, I think this should just be <code>py</code>. I believe <code>pyi</code> is for stub files, where code like this would be pretty unusual, as far as I know.</p>

I addressed your feedbacks. I hope it is what you wanted.</p>
<p>For the example: I took inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/VascoSch92/ruff/blob/44ad2012622d73373eb7922978f391eb6c1e54fa/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_pyi/rules/unnecessary_literal_union.rs#L36">here</a>
But I can delete it. No problem ;-)</p>
<p>PS: the CI is failing because of some red knot stuff. I don't know how this is related to my changes</p>

<p>That rule applies to stub files, and  the <code>## Example</code> section also uses <code>pyi</code>. This rule is for non-stub files, so we should use <code>py</code> or <code>python</code> in the code blocks.</p>

<p>Yeah no worries, <code>main</code> was actually failing for a little while, and your PR must have picked that up. I'll close and re-open the PR to retrigger CI because I think this is good to land otherwise.</p>
