<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Part of #18972</p>
<p>This PR makes <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/docstring-missing-exception/#docstring-missing-exception-doc501">docstring-missing-exception (DOC501)</a>'s example error out-of-the-box. Since the exceptions in the function body need to undergo name resolution to figure out if one of them is <code>NotImplementedError</code>, <code>DOC501</code> won't lint if the raised name is not defined. This could be considered a limitation, but should be fine since <code>F821</code> already covers undefined names. I did discover a different edge case, but it's not relevant to the example.</p>
