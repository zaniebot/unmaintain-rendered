I need to take a closer look what changed here and why we didn't upgrade to e.g. pyproject.toml 0.10.

I found https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10705#issuecomment-2030048001 as a reason why we didn't upgrade the dependency earlier. @charliermarsh do you remember any other reason why we never upgraded the crate?

_Comment by @MichaReiser on 2024-10-14 08:46_

This is still the same issue as linked in the other comment. Pep508 uses `let url = Url::from_file_path(path).expect("path is absolute");` which isn't available on wasm. Closing
