<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Improves rules table to make information more readable. Resolves #18296</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of showing a &quot;✔️&quot; to indicate a rule is stable, it shows nothing.</li>
<li>Adds a line to the docs stating that rules are stable unless indicated otherwise</li>
<li>Instead of showing a translucent &quot;🛠️&quot; to indicate that no auto-fix is available, it shows nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, this makes it much easier to understand the list of rules. It reduces the amount of information overload, as well as resolving issues including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;✔️&quot; is difficult to read when dark mode is activated</li>
<li>The use of translucency on the &quot;🛠️&quot; is a little unclear</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>No tests, it's just documentation. I did run them to triple-check.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for working on an improvement.</p>
<p>I sort of like removing the stable checkmark but it has the disadvantage that the experimental and &quot;fix available&quot; icons now are directly beneath each other. It took even me a moment to realise that the wrench icon doesn't indicate stability, but that a fix is available.</p>

<p>One option is to use different columns for each icon. I'm not sure if this will look odd for other reasons :) Another option is to change the checkmark icon. What do you think?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Personally, I'm ok with the &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;fix available&quot; icons being in the same column, since I believe the icons are distinct enough for it to be clear.</p>
<p>I suppose the difference in interpretation is because I see them as &quot;indicators&quot; (car dashboard style), and so don't care about their placement; whereas you see them as checkmarks, meaning the placement is far more important. With that in mind, I think that having different columns for each icon could work. At the very least, I think that the &quot;fix available&quot; icon should go in a separate column. The lopsidedness may look nicer if there are little dividing  lines to make the column-ness of it more clear.</p>
<p>I did a little CSS fiddling, and I think that it would work nicely if there's a bit more of a gap between them. In this case, I did it by editing the style table row on the deployed docs site to <code>display: flex; gap: 15px; flex-direction: row-reverse;</code> (primarily to avoid spinning up the docs server on my poor laptop).</p>
<p>Basically I'm thinking something like this, in terms of the columns being consistent, but instead using empty space in cases where the rule is stable or there's no fix available.</p>

<p>I think a better approach thank my hack would probably be to put them in two separate <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements, and then add something like <code>width: 100%</code> to the main text column.</p>
<p>Do you think this approach is worth investigating further?</p>

<p>I'm leaning towards separate columns. It has the added benefit that we can set an aria label on the column header</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just tried out separate columns, and mkdocs seems to have given far too much spacing to the &quot;status&quot; columns, which looks pretty gross. There's no good way to fix this in Markdown as far as I know.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6026ccf-148e-4f60-8d47-9a032c2d21ef" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That leaves two options imo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change <code>fn generate_table</code> to produce HTML so we can style it properly. I'm pretty sure <code>mkdocs</code> will still work fine for this.</li>
<li>Use my hacky approach from before to get a bit less of a gap, meaning we wouldn't need to rewrite half the function.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Tried the hacky approach, and I think it works pretty nicely.</p>
<p>One other change on the same thread: I don't think the opacity changes to indicate deprecation should apply to the status tokens, since it makes them much harder to read. I think it'd also be nice to have a strikethrough for the rule ID, since imo that's more readable than an opacity difference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd prefer if we discuss striking out rules as a separate PR. I remember that we explored this in an initial design and deliberately decided against it.</p>
