            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This avoids looking up <code>__bool__</code> on class <code>bool</code> for every <code>Type::Instance(bool).bool()</code> call. 1% performance win on cold cache, 4% win on incremental performance.</p>

<p>Yes. I spoke to @MichaReiser today and I really think we should make our benchmarks more diverse before we further spend so much time on performance optimization. I'm afraid we might be overfitting on tomllib.</p>
<p>I'll try to get some benchmarks on tomllib and maybe black tomorrow and see if adding int/str helps. Thanks for the suggestion.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a great point and I agree! Feel free to drop this topic (or just file an issue for later).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes, the problem here is that there is almost certainly a long tail of types for which it does not pay to cache (because there isn't enough repeat usage), and a few very common types for which it does. Which is why culling some of the very common types (where we also already know the answer) seems like an easy win.</p>
