# Demonstrate tree-sitter integration

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-10-01 20:47_

The goal of this branch is to enable the use of `tree-sitter` as an alternative parser. For now, we'll use `tree-sitter` for parsing, but map the generated representation to the `RustPython` AST structures.

Closing for now to avoid clutter.
