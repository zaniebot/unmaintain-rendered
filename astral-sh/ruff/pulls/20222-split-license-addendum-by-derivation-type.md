# Split LICENSE addendum by derivation type

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

Per https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20191#issuecomment-3251131478, this PR restructures the license file to draw a distinction between projects from which we've (e.g.) drawn source code and projects whose rules we've implemented but have otherwise not reused or adapted source code from, which are credited in the README. While I was here, I also sorted the list.
