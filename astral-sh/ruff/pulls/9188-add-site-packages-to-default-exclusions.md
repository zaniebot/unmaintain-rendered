# Add site-packages to default exclusions

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-18 16:12_

Suggested in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode/issues/232#issuecomment-1860788600. This is technically a non-backwards-compatible change, but I would be very surprised if it affected anyone in practice given that `site-packages` is always ignored already in virtual environments.
