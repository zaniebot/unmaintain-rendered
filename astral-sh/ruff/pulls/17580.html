            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is partially addresses https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/114</p>
<p>It avoids reading <code>files</code> or <code>open_file_set</code>, which both have low durability for typeshed files. This prevents downgrading typeshed queries to durability low if we happen to emit a diagnostic in them.</p>
<p>Ideally, we'd also short-circuit for third-party files but it's less clear to me how we would do that while supporting open-file-set (we could check the <code>included_paths</code>). That's why I decided to only optimize this for typeshed for now.</p>
<p>The incremental benchmarks improve by 2% which suggests that we try to emit diagnostics for at least some typeshed files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why <code>true</code>? I thought the &quot;open&quot; files were the files that we were directly checking (and therefore emitting diagnostics on)? Shouldn't we be returning <code>false</code> here for vendored stub files, since we don't want to emit any diagnostics on those?</p>
