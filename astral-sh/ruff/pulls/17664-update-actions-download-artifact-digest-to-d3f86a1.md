@MichaReiser I believe we need to bump the commit pinned in Cargo.toml here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/dbc137c9516808baa292da7a928e50ba36a14d39/Cargo.toml#L342-L346

That made CI happy and it's what @Gankra did in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/775815ef2201fe546049aabefce4783630e6d94e, so I think we're good to go. I'll take the blame here if I did the wrong thing 😆
