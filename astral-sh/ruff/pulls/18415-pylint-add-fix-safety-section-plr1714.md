@dylwil3 Thanks for the heads-up. I’ve added the PR link, but I’m not sure whether the unsafe change was introduced in #7910 or later in #14372 or #16685. Also, could you confirm if my unsafe example is accurate? thanks!

Thanks! I think the reason you gave is correct, but we don't have to give an example. Reworded slightly and removed the example.
