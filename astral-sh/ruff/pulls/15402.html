<pre><code class="language-suggestion">A tuple type that has `Never` as a type argument simplifies to `Never`. One way to think about this is the following. For any heteregenous tuple type `T`, `T` will have type arguments E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;... where each type argument represents the type a runtime tuple element must have at a given index if the runtime tuple as a whole can be said to inhabit `T`. Therefore, to construct a runtime tuple `t` that inhabits `T`, it must be possible to construct a runtime object that inhabits E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a runtime object that inhabits E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;... But since no runtime objects can ever inhabit the type `Never`, if `Never` is present as one of the type arguments for `T` you can therefore not construct any inhabitants of `T` at runtime. `T` is therefore uninhabited, and therefore equivalent to `Never`.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm, to be honest, I'm not sure if that helps with clarity? What part of my description confused runtime tuples with tuple types? The word &quot;contains&quot;? Maybe I should have written it as</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">A heterogeneous `tuple[…]` type that contains `Never` as a type argument simplifies to `Never`.
One way to think about this is the following: in order to construct a tuple, you need to have an
object of every element type. But since there is no object of type `Never`, you cannot construct
the tuple. Such a tuple type is therefore uninhabited and equivalent to `Never`.

</blockquote>
<p>yes -- when you say &quot;a <code>tuple</code> that contains <code>Never</code>, I think the natural understanding of <code>tuple</code> there is &quot;a runtime tuple&quot; rather than &quot;a tuple type&quot;, and even for a tuple <em>type</em> I wouldn't really say that it &quot;contains <code>Never</code>&quot;</p>

<p>that rewrite looks great! &quot;can not&quot; should be &quot;cannot&quot; here, though</p>
