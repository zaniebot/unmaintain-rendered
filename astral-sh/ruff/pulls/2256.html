            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I presume the reasoning for not including clippy in <code>pre-commit</code> was that it passes all files. This can be turned off with <code>pass_filenames</code>, in which case it only runs once.</p>
<p><code>cargo +nightly dev generate-all</code> is also added (when excluding <code>target</code> is does not give false positives).</p>
<p>(The overhead of these commands is not much when the build is there. People can always choose to run only certain hooks with <code>pre-commit run [hook] --all-files</code>)</p>
