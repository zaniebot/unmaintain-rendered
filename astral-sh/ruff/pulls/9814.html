            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @zanieb, since there are more of these deprecations in the codebase, do you mind if I keep adding commits to this PR, or shall I open a separate one for each of them?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @tibor-reiss — I'm unsure. Ideally these things would be in separate pull requests for our changelog and review but we're talking pretty far out here and it could be a significant amount to keep your changes up to date with <code>main</code>. In general, I'd recommend pursuing issues that aren't breaking changes since they aren't timing sensitive.</p>
<p>Another thing we can do is have deprecated options <em>error</em> in <strong>preview</strong> mode first but retain a <em>warning</em> in stable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @zanieb, I understand. I added the 2nd commit just before your answer - talk about timing. And as you predicted, merge conflict.
Since the timeline is unclear, and this is anyways a low-prio change, I would recommend gathering the commits here and not polluting the board with more PRs. Once we get closer, it's a minimal change to pull out the commits into separate PRs so you can ping me about your preferences about this change. What do you think?</p>
