            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Fixes #17322. Remove any need for snapshotting when applying visibility constraints to <code>*</code> imports. This also ends up simplifying the code!</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing tests all pass. I&#x27;d appreciate a careful review, though. Is it definitely safe to remove these calls, as I am doing currently in the PR?</p>
<p>E.g. the <code>UseDefMapBuilder::negate_star_import_visibility_constraint</code> method on <code>main</code> has this call:</p>
<pre><code>        self.scope_start_visibility = self
            .visibility_constraints
            .add_and_constraint(self.scope_start_visibility, negated_constraint);
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>UseDefMapBuilder::merge</code> has this call:</p>
<pre><code>        self.scope_start_visibility = self
            .visibility_constraints
            .add_or_constraint(self.scope_start_visibility, snapshot.scope_start_visibility);
</code></pre>
<p>Both calls are currently removed in this PR for the &quot;fast path&quot; for newly added <code>*</code>-import definitions, since <code>UseDefMapBuilder::negate_star_import_visibility_constraint</code> is removed as part of this PR, and <code>UseDefMapBuilder::merge</code> is no longer called in the fast path. If it&#x27;s <em>not</em> safe to remove these calls from the fast path, is there a test I could add that passes on <code>main</code>, but fails with them removed?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you, this looks correct! Great that we can reclaim even more performance.</p>
<p><code>self.scope_start_visibility</code> tracks the visibility of <code>x_new = &lt;unbound&gt;</code> bindings of symbols that are <em>not yet defined</em> (symbols that <em>are</em> already defined, track visibility of their own <code>x_defined = &lt;unbound&gt;</code> binding). This is important when we model something like</p>
<pre><code>if True:
    x = 1
else:
    # At this point in control flow, we have a scope_start_visibility
    # of `~[True]`, which we&#x27;ll use for the `x = &lt;unbound&gt;` binding
    # that will be implicitly created for this control flow branch
    # when we merge control flow with the `if` branch below.

# a use of `x` here sees `x = 1` with visibility `[True]` and
# `x = &lt;unbound&gt;` with visibility `~[True]`.
</code></pre>
<p>The important thing is that <code>scope_start_visibility</code> returns to <code>AlwaysTrue</code> after this <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> branch. <code>x</code> can not be unbound, but <em>new</em> symbols would still be unbound. You can basically ask: if I would see a use of <code>has_not_been_bound_yet</code> at this point in control flow, would I still be able to see the implicit <code>has_not_been_bound_yet = &lt;unbound&gt;</code> binding at the scope start? And the answer for this example is yes. Things could be different if there would be terminal statements inside the branches:</p>
<pre><code>def _():
    if True:
        return

    # scope_start_visibility would be AlwaysFalse here
</code></pre>
<p>For the star-import construct that we&#x27;re modeling, the scope-start-visibility should not be affected (after control flow has merged), since there are no terminal statements inside. A use of <code>has_not_been_bound_yet</code> after this construct would have the same visibility of the scope start than before:</p>
<pre><code>if &lt;condition&gt;:
    from module import X
else:
    # empty
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there are probably some optimisations we could also make for the &quot;slow path&quot; where the <code>*</code> import redefines a symbol that already exists in the global namespace. Even in the slow path, we&#x27;re probably doing much more work than we need to by snapshotting all definition/declaration states -- we really only need to snapshot the definition/declaration states for a single symbol.</p>
<p>But I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the complexity cost to make that optimisation, since I think it would require adding more APIs to the use-def map that would only be used in this one place, and we probably don&#x27;t hit the slow path very often at all.</p>

<p>Would appreciate a quick review from you or @sharkdp to double-check everything in the doc-comment is accurate!</p>
