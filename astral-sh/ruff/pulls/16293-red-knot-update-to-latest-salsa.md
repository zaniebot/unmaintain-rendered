# [red-knot] update to latest Salsa

---

_@carljm_

Update to latest Salsa main branch. This provides a point of comparison for the perf impact of fixpoint iteration, which is based on latest Salsa main.

This requires an update to the locked version of our boxcar dep, since Salsa now depends on a newer version of boxcar.
