            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the other thing to test in a classmethod is that we don&#x27;t suggest anything at all if the variable name matches an instance-only attribute. E.g. if we add an <code>__init__</code> method below that has <code>self.y = 1</code> and then reference <code>y</code> in the classmethod, we should not suggest <code>cls.y</code> (or anything at all) for <code>y</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it would be a bit nicer if this method instead returned a <code>FunctionDecorators</code> bitflag, rather than allocating a vector and requiring callers to sometimes clone it, and do all the type inference etc themselves.</p>
<p>Extra good would be if we could consolidate with the code that currently lives in <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::infer_function_definition</code> so we just have one occurrence of the match statement to build a <code>FunctionDecorators</code> bitflag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure if you were intending to leave this for a later PR (if so a test with TODO comment would still be good), but @AlexWaygood &#x27;s point in the linked issue was that we should not hardcode either the name <code>self</code> or the name <code>cls</code> based on what kind of method it is -- rather we should use the actual name of the actual first parameter of the method. It&#x27;s perfectly valid Python to use a name other than <code>self</code> as first parameter of a regular method, or a name other than <code>cls</code> as first parameter of a classmethod. (We should also have tests for these cases.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another issue here is that this method is also called <code>current_method_decorators()</code>, but I don&#x27;t see any checks in the method that the function scope is nested inside a class scope. It looks like it will return <code>Some()</code> for any function scope, not just method scopes. So maybe it should be called <code>current_function_decorators()</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve cleaned this up a bit, but i&#x27;m getting panics because of the decorator expression inference. Im not sure what order and function i should call to infer the type of the decorator expression.</p>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/carljm">@carljm</a> on 2025-06-10 20:53</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A core invariant of our type inference is that each AST node gets a type inferred for it once, in the &quot;inference region&quot; responsible for that node (an inference region can be a scope, a definition, or a standalone expression), and then that type gets merged into the surrounding region as needed, but doesn&#x27;t get re-inferred willy-nilly.</p>
<p>So I don&#x27;t think it will work well to have the <code>function_decorators</code> method just take a list of AST nodes; this means we&#x27;ll end up re-inferring its type ad-hoc from various call-sites, and that won&#x27;t work well.</p>
<p>The function decorators should have their type inferred exactly once, in <code>infer_function_definition</code> (via <code>infer_decorator</code>). We shouldn&#x27;t call <code>self.infer_expression</code> or similar on those same nodes anywhere else.</p>
<p>The previous code here that checked for abstract methods and overloads used <code>self.file_expression_type</code> on those decorator nodes, which doesn&#x27;t re-infer them: it looks up what scope they belong to, infers that entire scope, and then pulls the expression types out. This worked, but isn&#x27;t really ideal because it infers far more than necessary. A function definition is always a definition, and the decorator nodes are part of that definition, so we don&#x27;t need to infer the entire scope, just the definition.</p>
<p>So the ideal here would be to find the Definition for the function (scopes know the Definition that creates them, so this shouldn&#x27;t be hard to get from the body scope) and then use <code>definition_expression_type</code> to infer types for that definition and pull the specific inferred expression types out. (Although it seems like we store on the <code>OverloadLiteral</code> for the function what known decorators it has, so if we get the type for the function definition we can maybe just use that and not need to pull out specific decorator expressions at all?</p>
