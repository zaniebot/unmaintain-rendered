Thank you for contributing to Ruff! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

- Does this pull request include references to any relevant issues?
-->

<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Many core Airflow features have been deprecated and moved to Airflow Providers since users might need to install an additional package (e.g., <code>apache-airflow-provider-fab==1.0.0</code>); a separate rule (AIR303) is created for this.</p>
<p>As some of the changes only relate to the module/package moved, instead of listing out all the functions, variables, and classes in a module or a package, it warns the user to import from the new path instead of the specific name.</p>
<p>The following is the ones that has been moved to <code>apache-airflow-provider-fab==1.0.0</code></p>
<ul>
<li>module moved<ul>
<li><code>airflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth</code> → <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.api.auth.backend.basic_auth</code></li>
<li><code>airflow.api.auth.backend.kerberos_auth</code> → <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.api.auth.backend.kerberos_auth</code></li>
<li><code>airflow.auth.managers.fab.api.auth.backend.kerberos_auth</code> → <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.api.auth.backend.kerberos_auth</code></li>
<li><code>airflow.auth.managers.fab.security_manager.override</code> → <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.security_manager.override</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>classes (e.g., functions, classes) moved<ul>
<li><code>airflow.www.security.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride</code> → <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.security_manager.override.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride</code></li>
<li><code>airflow.auth.managers.fab.fab_auth_manager.FabAuthManager</code> → <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.security_manager.FabAuthManager</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Browse the airflow / ruff migration guideline</h3>
<p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@uranusjr/ByyCA_-m1l">How to create a Ruff lint rule for Airflow 2-to-3 migrations</a></p>
<h3>Setup local development environment</h3>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo install cargo-insta

uv tool install pre-commit
pre-commit install

cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/contributing/">Contributing to Ruff</a></p>
<h3>Check the existing rules from airflow issue</h3>
<p>All the ruff rules are listed down in <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44556">Airflow 2 to 3 auto migration rules - ruff #44556</a></p>
<p>Go to <code>AIR303: moved to provider</code> in the issue description and you'll find rules like</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">* `airflow.www.security.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride` → `airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.security_manager.override.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride` (from https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41758)
</code></pre>
<p>It means <code>airflow.www.security.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride</code> has been moved to airflow provider and the import should be changed to <code>airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.security_manager.override.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride</code>. This changed is made in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41758</p>
<p>Some of the rules might not be correct, so checking the pull request again is suggested.</p>
<h3>Add a new rule</h3>
<p>Go to <code>crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/airflow/rules/moved_to_provider_in_3.rs</code></p>
<p>In function <code>moved_to_provider</code>, add code section like the following</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">                [&quot;airflow&quot;, &quot;www&quot;, &quot;security&quot;, &quot;FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride&quot;] =&gt; Some((
                    qualname.to_string(),
                    Replacement::ProviderName {
                        name: &quot;airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.security_manager.override.FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride&quot;,
                        provider: &quot;fab&quot;,
                        version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;
                    },
                )),
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;airflow&quot;, &quot;www&quot;, &quot;security&quot;, &quot;FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride&quot;</code>: the deprecated import path</li>
<li><code>name</code> is the new name that should be used.</li>
<li><code>provider</code> is which provider this name has been moved to.</li>
<li><code>version</code> is the first version of the provider that has been moved to.</li>
</ul>
<p>For rules like</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">* [ ] `airflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth` → `airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.api.auth.backend.basic_auth` (from https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41663)
</code></pre>
<p>The whole module/pacakge has been moved to the provider. Thus, we'll need to warn the users when something is imported from the old path instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">                [&quot;airflow&quot;, &quot;api&quot;, &quot;auth&quot;, &quot;backend&quot;, &quot;basic_auth&quot;, ..] =&gt; Some((
                    qualname.to_string(),
                    Replacement::ImportPathMoved{
                        original_path: &quot;airflow.api.auth.backend.basic_auth&quot;,
                        new_path: &quot;airflow.providers.fab.auth_manager.api.auth.backend.basic_auth&quot;,
                        provider:&quot;fab&quot;,
                        version: &quot;1.0.0&quot;
                },
                )),
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;airflow&quot;, &quot;api&quot;, &quot;auth&quot;, &quot;backend&quot;, &quot;basic_auth&quot;, ..</code>: anything under this import path</li>
<li><code>original path</code></li>
<li><code>new path</code>: new import path in the provider</li>
<li><code>provider</code> is which provider this name has been moved to.</li>
<li><code>version</code> is the first version of the provider that has been moved to.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add test case</h3>
<p>Add a case that violate this rule to <code>crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/airflow/AIR303.py</code></p>
<h3>Test and generate snapshop to review</h3>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cargo insta test
cargo insta review
</code></pre>
<h3>Now you're ready to create a pull request</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a pretty long message, it might be useful to break it down into two parts - the description and the suggestion. For the description we can avoid the entire import path and just provide the symbol name itself while for the help text we can guide the user to install the provider and use the provider namespace for the symbol. For example:</p>
<pre><code>AIR303.py:10:1: AIR303 `basic_auth` will be moved into `fab` provider in Airflow 3.0
   |
 8 | from airflow.www.security import FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride
 9 | 
10 | basic_auth, kerberos_auth
   | ^^^^^^^^^^ AIR303
11 | auth_current_user
12 | backend_kerberos_auth
   |
   = help: Install `apache-airflow-provider-fab` and import from `airflow.providers.fab` instead
</code></pre>
<p>The help text is rendered using the <code>fix_title</code> method: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/a3bb0cd5ec4d4dffea5d42d184e8c4a062976663/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/airflow/rules/removal_in_3.rs#L65-L72</p>
<p>I'm also a bit worried about the version number for the package, I'd prefer to omit them as it can get outdated pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Curious to know your thoughts on this :)</p>

<p>Yep, that's what I think for some of the modules, but I'll confirm it again.</p>

<p>Yep, some of the modules can be done this way, but others might not, so that why I'd like to keep the individual symbols check as well</p>
