# Use ruff.toml format in README

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

See feedback in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4725#issuecomment-1994615409.

In the docs, we use a tabbed interface for express `ruff.toml` vs. `pyproject.toml`. Here, it might be clearer to default to `ruff.toml`, since it's more obviously _not_ `pyproject.toml`. But either way, this PR attempts to clarify that there's a difference.

I don't love `path/to/code/` here it seems like a bad example as a corollary for file discovery options.

I know it's copied from above but maybe a good time to improve
