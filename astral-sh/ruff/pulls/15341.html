            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds a new f-string formatting section to the documentation.</p>
<p>It adds it to the https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter page and provides a backlink in the deviation section as well.</p>
<p>There isn't a great place to add this kind of section in our documentation as ideally it would go under &quot;Ruff code style&quot; (similar to <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html">Black code style</a>) section.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>I've found having the &quot;Quotes&quot; and &quot;Line breaks&quot; section in structuring the content but I'm open to removing them. Any opinions are welcome!</p>
<p>There can be more content to it but I'm not sure if we want to provide a lot of details. For example, we can expand on the &quot;Quotes&quot; section to enumerate all additional cases where we preserve the quote style.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is slightly misleading. Ruff can change the quotes for:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">f'{10 + len(&quot;hello \&quot; &quot;)}'
</code></pre>
<p>It gets formatted to</p>
<pre><code>f&quot;{10 + len('hello &quot; ')}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>It can only not change the quotes if they're inside a debug expression (or format specifier). Let's double check with the implementation if there are other reasons when the preferred quote style can't be applied</p>

<p>It wasn't clear to me if this now demonstrates a case where Ruff doesn't change the quote style because it would result in invalid syntax but I think it doesn't. I'm leaning towards omitting this sentence because it's kind of expected that the formatter doesn't produce invalid syntax.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm leaning towards motivating this closer to what Prettier wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Template literals can contain interpolations. Deciding whether it's appropriate to insert a linebreak within an interpolation unfortunately depends on the semantic content of the template - for example, introducing a linebreak in the middle of a natural-language sentence is usually undesirable. Since Prettier doesn't have enough information to make this decision itself, it uses a heuristic similar to that used for objects: it will only split an interpolation expression across multiple lines if there was already a linebreak within that interpolation.</p>
