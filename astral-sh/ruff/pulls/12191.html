            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes a few typos and consistency issues in the &quot;Settings&quot; documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>use &quot;Ruff&quot; consistently in the few places where &quot;ruff&quot; is used</li>
<li>use double quotes in the few places where single quotes are used</li>
<li>add backticks around rule codes where they are currently missing</li>
<li>update a few example values where they are the same as the defaults, for consistency</li>
</ul>
<p>2nd commit might be controversial, as there are many options mentioned where we don't currently link to the documentation sections, so maybe it's done on purpose, as this will also appear in the JSON schema where it's not desirable? If that's the case, I can easily drop it.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Local testing.</p>

<p>I think this <em>is</em> true (that it will appear in the JSON Schema). But I think it's worth it.</p>
