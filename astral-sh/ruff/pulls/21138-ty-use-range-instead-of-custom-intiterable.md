# [ty] Use `range` instead of custom `IntIterable`

---

_Pull request opened by @sharkdp on 2025-10-30 14:10_

## Summary

We previously didn't understand `range` and wrote these custom `IntIterable`/`IntIterator` classes for tests. We can now remove them and make the tests shorter in some places.
