            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>There was some confusion in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21839">astral-sh/ruff#21839</a>, because ty as executed by the fuzzer was picking up the <code>requires-python = &quot;&gt;=3.7&quot;</code> setting in Ruff&#x27;s pyproject.toml file. But that&#x27;s different from ty&#x27;s default behaviour (if executed in a directory that has no pyproject.toml file, and no pyproject.toml file in any of its ancestor directories), which is to assume Python 3.14.</p>
<p>I think running the fuzzer with <code>--python-version={OLDEST_SUPPORTED_PYTHON}</code> is actually a pretty good idea -- it caught a bug in #21839! But we should do that explicitly rather than having ty implicitly pick up the Python version from Ruff&#x27;s pyproject.toml file. And we should print out the Python version and Python platform to the terminal when the fuzzer finds a bug.</p>

<p>What&#x27;s more likely the case is that you selected (or VS Code did it for you) a Python interpreter in VS Code, which we use as preferred fallback. You can select a Python Interpreter using <code>Cmd+P, Select Interpreter</code>. Make sure it points to your venv.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does this mean that the fuzzer will now always run the code assuming the oldest Python version and <code>linux</code>?</p>
<p>When I was debugging 21839, I ran the fuzzer with some print statements to get the panic message and it printed the message multiple times. This suggests that it must be running the same code multiple times (?) but I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t print the message for every run which suggests that the Python version picked up could&#x27;ve been different.</p>
<p>Let me know if my assumptions are incorrect because I don&#x27;t know how py-fuzzer works, you might know better! What I&#x27;m trying to ask is that would this make us loose coverage on testing the same seed with different Python version?</p>

<p>I explained why I think that it&#x27;s useful to test with an old version in my PR description. It&#x27;s better at catching bugs that way! It&#x27;s more likely to throw up situations that we didn&#x27;t think about when writing PRs, such as: &quot;What happens if we want to infer a type as a <code>ParamSpec</code> instance but the <code>ParamSpec</code> class doesn&#x27;t exist yet in the <code>typing</code> module?&quot;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>we can consider making those changes, for sure. For now, this PR just makes explicit what the PR was always implicitly doing before. I&#x27;d prefer to consider those changes separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This makes explicit what it was always doing: it was always using the Python version that it picked up from Ruff&#x27;s pyproject.toml file before.</p>
<p>The reason why you saw multiple messages from your <code>print()</code> statements isn&#x27;t because it was running ty with a matrix of Python versions or Python platforms. Instead, it&#x27;s that the fuzzer found a bug on a huge generated Python file and then systematically tried to minimize the AST in that file to produce the smallest possible snippet on which the bug would reproduce. That involves executing ty repeatedly.</p>
