            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to keep it. It was added in preparation for when we need to rename our first rule (that day will come!).</p>
<p>There are other concepts like removed and deprecated rules that aren't used today as well, but will become relevant in the near future.</p>
<p>Planning ahead to support those features was an explicit ask of @zanieb 😅</p>
