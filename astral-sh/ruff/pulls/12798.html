Summary


<p>I saw on Twitter that you guys want some help with faster CI.</p>
<p>This PR updates <code>Swatinem/rust-cache@v2</code> steps for testing jobs and other long-running tasks (except for release builds) to share cached build artifacts across jobs.</p>
<p>Each platform (linux/windows, didn&#x27;t see tests for MacOS) gets its own warm cache. Caches are read by all branches, but only saved when CI runs on <code>main</code>.</p>
Test Plan


<p>This is what Oxc&#x27;s CI does.</p>

<p>That makes sense. But doesn&#x27;t it mean that we only have to specify the shared key for cached that should be re-used across at least two jobs? For example, there&#x27;s only a single job using <code>warm-wasm</code>. Couldn&#x27;t we use the default cache key instead?</p>

<p>Thanks. Overall this looks reasonable to me. We can merge it after updating all jobs and removing unnecessary shard-keys to see if it has any positive impact.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are a few other things to keep in mind</p>
<ol>
<li>Saving the cache takes time, how does this trade-off with the savings of the shared cache?</li>
<li>Is the cache entry going to increase in size now? Presumably if more jobs are sharing it with slightly different builds it&#x27;s additive? How much does it increase by? How much time does it add to download the larger cache?</li>
<li>GitHub imposes a cache size limit, once we reach it entries are evicted. Does this approach help with that or not?</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I understand is that we would have fewer caches because we only store them on main. The cache size should be unchanged because it&#x27;s still the same caches. Saving fewer caches should give us some time back on non-main runs because we skip the caching step entirely</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I misunderstood some of the discussion here and thought we were <em>previously</em> only saving the cache changes for <code>main</code> (I made this change over in uv at some point), that changes my caveats. This comes with other trade-offs though, for example, if a pull request add dependencies we have to build them on every commit to the pull request instead of populating a cache on the first run.</p>

<p>I think this was a real problem in uv and I reverted the change. Maybe Ruff&#x27;s dependencies are more stable? Maybe we can toggle the key based on changes to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>? Seems kind of tricky.</p>

<p>Interesting. Would love to hear more about the specific problem you ran into. What I understand is that the builds for PRs adding dependencies will take longer because they have to build the added/changed dependencies. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect that they take that much longer and it&#x27;s mainly renovate that tinkers with dependencies.</p>

<p><code>warm-wasm</code> is used by two jobs, so I&#x27;ll leave that one. I&#x27;ve removed <code>warm-windows</code> and <code>warm-msrv</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there must have been some confusion because using <code>warm</code> for all jobs and only saving it in one job will give us worse performance for most jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>We should only specify <code>shared-key</code> when two or more jobs use the same cache. In our case that could be <code>cargo-test-linux</code> and maybe <code>mkdocs</code>?</li>
<li>Jobs should only use the same <code>shared-key</code> if they use the same target. Clippy, Windows, fuzz, test scripts all use different targets as far as I know</li>
<li>I would prefer to use more specific names than<code>warm</code></li>
<li>There are still multiple jobs that don&#x27;t use the new optimization (benchmarks, <code>check-formatter-instability-and-black-similarity</code>, <code>pre-commit</code>, <code>python-package</code>, <code>cargo-build-release</code>, <code>cargo-test-windows</code>). Is there a specific reason for it?</li>
