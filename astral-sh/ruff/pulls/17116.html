            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I noticed we were inferring <code>Todo</code> as the declared type for annotations such as <code>x: tuple[list[int], list[int]]</code>. This PR reworks our annotation parsing so that we instead infer <code>tuple[Todo, Todo]</code> for this annotation, which is quite a bit more precise.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing mdtest updated.</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s probably a false positive, but a single false positive is probably worth it here IMO. This gives us better understanding for a lot of <code>tuple</code> annotations that we were giving up on parsing before.</p>

<p>There&#x27;s an assert at the end of that function that should narrow away the <code>None</code> from the second element of the return tuple. If it&#x27;s quick to figure out why that&#x27;s happening, I think it would be worth tackling here. But if it&#x27;s unrelated to the tuple change (i.e. do we also not narrow <code>None | Unknown</code> to <code>Unknown</code> correctly on its own?) then I agree that the one false positive is worth it here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, we don&#x27;t do type narrowing for <code>assert</code> statements yet! So that explains it.</p>
