            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We added the release CI job to catch issues with conditionally compiled code (<code>debug</code>, <code>cfg(debug_assertions)</code> back in April 2024 (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11182).</p>
<p>But, we've since then also added <code>cargo-test-linux-release</code> (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14604), which not only compiles with the release profile but also runs all tests</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/3d2ece2f42f24b0c18968d3a624d37eeb37525ff/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L300-L331</p>
<p>That's why I think we can safely remove the release CI Job, as it's covered by cargo-test-linux-release</p>

<p>Looks like the release job was running on macOS though, so we lose <em>some</em> coverage with this change. That might be acceptable if we have other macOS builds, though.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, the reason it ran on macOS was that those used to be the fastest runners available. We can introduce a new CI job that runs all tests on macos if we want, that should still be much cheaper than another release job</p>
