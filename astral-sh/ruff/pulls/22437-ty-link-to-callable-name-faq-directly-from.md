How does this render on a terminal? Do we need to wrap the url in `<>`?

_@MichaReiser reviewed on 2026-01-07 13:00_

My only concern with this is that it adds more URLs that we add more dependencies on how our docs are structured.

yeah, definitely a downside. It seems far more user-friendly to link to the FAQ directly to the diagnostic, though, and not a huge maintenance burden for us. If a user notices that the link in the diagnostic goes stale, it's very trivial for us to update it in a PR.

But that only works for new ty versions ;) What we do for Ruff is maintain URL stability and that's not a lot of work but requires extra care

like this:

<img width="2610" height="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7839699-b91c-4e9b-9a2c-c6a484f7538e" />

> Do we need to wrap the url in `<>`?

Yes (as I've done) -- without the `<>` around the URL, if I double click on the URL in the terminal it tries to load `https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/typing-faq/#why-does-ty-say-callable-has-no-attribute-__name` (without the `__` suffix at the end of the URL). That doesn't exist, so the page loaded in the browser opens at the top of the FAQs page
