            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Renovate doesn't upgrade sha-pinned dependencies.</p>
<p>A sha pin on <code>└mkdocs-github-admonitions-plugin</code> was introduced due to a bug fix not being available in a released version in PR #18163</p>
<p>Now the bug fix has been released so the pin can be removed.</p>
<p>In the future, in such cases, it might be a good idea to add a comment
and/or set a reminder to look back and consider removing the pin
as renovate will not handle sha pins.</p>
<p>As renovate handles almost all dep upgrades, this provides a false sense
of &quot;security&quot; that deps are always kept up to date automatically.</p>
<p>Related to issue #19369</p>
<p>Thanks @ntBre for the pointer!</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Docs previews should be visually inspected for correct rendering of admonitions.</p>
<p>As I'm not an Astral insider, I unfortunately can't actually faithfully reproduce the docs (due to Material for MkDocs being closed source). I don't know if there are automatic preview builds in CI that I can inspect instead.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>I also add a comment to remind the reader that renovate does not automatically update git/sha pinned dependencies. This was touched on in #19369 as well - I think this comment might be worth it but happy to remove of course if reviewers differ. It's not a big change, hence adding as piggyback commit to the PR that edits the same file.</p>
