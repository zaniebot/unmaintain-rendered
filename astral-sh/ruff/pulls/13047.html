            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The point is to make it easier to parse out what's going on from an issue, and effectively push it to the next step.</p>
<p>I'm very happy to hear out what your most common issues are like so I can structure this into something that would be more useful for you guys.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @jvacek, thanks so much for this -- really appreciate it! However, I'm going to close this for now as I think it's something we'd want to discuss as a team (possibly quite in depth!) before we changed it. The contributor experience people have on an open-source project is really hard to get right, and there's a lot of subtleties here, so I'd want us to make sure we had internal consensus on any changes before we made them.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the suggestion, though! We're hoping on putting into practice some improvements to our issue triage processes soon, and looking at ideas like this is really helpful</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the nice message, understood, already had a brief chat in the discord about this.</p>
<p>FYI the example here is very over the top, but just wanted to show off the fields that make sense.</p>
<p>I'd propose keeping <em>only</em> the version field, one markdown field for free text, and the optional field for keywords.</p>
