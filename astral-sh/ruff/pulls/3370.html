            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR productionizes @MichaReiser's suggestion in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1820#issuecomment-1440204423, by creating a separate crate for the <code>ast</code> module (<code>rust_python_ast</code>). This will enable us to further split up the <code>ruff</code> crate, as we'll be able to create (e.g.) separate sub-linter crates that have access to these common AST utilities.</p>
<p>This was mostly a straightforward copy (with adjustments to module imports), as the few dependencies that <em>did</em> require modifications were handled in #3366, #3367, and #3368.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could make this something more general, like <code>ruff_python_syntax</code>, as suggested in the linked issue, which would let us move more code into this crate (e.g., <code>docstrings</code>).</p>
<p>I actually went through with this change misremembering that suggestion. I don't feel strongly either way.</p>
<p>(If we use <code>ruff_python_syntax</code>, we probably want to then scope all this code under <code>ruff_python_syntax::ast</code>.)</p>
