            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds <a href="https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint">actionlint</a> as a pre-commit hook. actionlint is a tool that analyzes your GitHub Actions and verifies that you have correct syntax in your workflows.</p>
<p>One of actionlint's most useful features is a <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck">shellcheck</a> integration. Shellcheck is a tool that checks for errors in shell scripts; actionlint's shellcheck integration extracts bash scripts from <code>run:</code> steps in GitHub Actions workflows and passes them to shellcheck. All the changes to workflow files in this PR are due to issues shellcheck identified via actionlint's shellcheck integration.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this PR is that it would have caught the mistakes fixed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14938 before they happened. I'd like to upgrade our zizmor pre-commit hook to the latest version (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15022), but doing so requires further changes to our GitHub workflows; I'm unwilling to do that until we have better linters for our GitHub workflows in CI.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>uvx pre-commit run -a</code> passes locally, and I verified that it is correctly running the shellcheck integration due to the <code>additional_dependencies</code> in the pre-commit entry</li>
<li>Let's see if CI passes on this PR...</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I checked it on my Mac, and the command copied-and-pasted into my shell works as it currently is on <code>main</code>, but adding the quoting breaks it. It's possible it might be different on Linux, but it's also just quite nice to use commands in our GitHub workflows that I can test locally</p>

<p>they <em>might</em> be fixable? Not sure. I don't think there's an actual bug on those lines anyway.</p>
<p>We could just put inline ignore comments on those lines? But that specific check didn't seem to actually flag any real issues in our shell scripts</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh right, I think the one in <code>publish-docs</code> is a false positive because the <code>pull_request_title</code> needs to be quoted as the title contains multiple words separated by whitespace:</p>
