            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>An alternative to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15738, which might be slightly more readable and easier to reason about. I'm also curious to see how this compares with the Codspeed benchmarks.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Same tests as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15738</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sharkdp -- curious if you find this more or less easy to understand than https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15738? The final commit here is the only difference between the two. (I'll add a comment to the branch about boolean literals delegating to <code>KnownClass::Int</code> whichever of the two we decide we prefer for readability.)</p>
<p>Performance seems to be basically the same between the two. Maybe this one is a tiny bit slower? But it could just be noise.</p>
