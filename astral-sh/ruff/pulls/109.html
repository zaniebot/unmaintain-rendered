            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good question :)</p>
<p>In my head, the current focus is achieving Flake8 parity <em>when Flake8 is used with Black</em>. So that includes most (all?) of the the pyflakes rules (the <code>F</code> series), plus a handful of the pycodestyle rules (the <code>E</code> series), although many of those are made redundant by Black.</p>
<p>That said: I'm definitely not opposed to adding pylint rules (<code>R001</code> is actually a pylint rule, though they call it <code>R0205</code>). The only rules I'd want to avoid are those that are low utility and/or have a very complex implementation.</p>
<p>We can always disable them by default if we want to stick to Flake8 parity out-of-the-box. We'd also need to figure out the right nomenclature for those rules (I originally copied pylint and used <code>R0205</code> for that rule, but it felt out-of-place with the three-letter codes, and I realized we could run into conflicts and other confusing situations, so I just reindexed them for ruff).</p>
