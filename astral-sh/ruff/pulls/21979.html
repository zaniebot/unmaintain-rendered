            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <code>for x in &lt;CURSOR&gt;</code> statements it's only valid to provide expressions that eventually evaluate to an iterable. While it's extremely difficult to know if something can evaulate to an iterable in a general case, there are some suggestions we know can never lead to an iterable. Most keywords are such and hence we remove them here.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This suppresses statement-keywords from auto-complete suggestions in <code>for x in &lt;CURSOR&gt;</code> statements where we know they can never be valid, as whatever is typed has to (at some point) evaluate to an iterable.</p>
<p>It handles the core issue from https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1774 but there's a lot of related cases that probably has to be handled piece-wise.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>New tests and verifying in the playground.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I remain slightly concerned about adding more and more of these &quot;do we match this AST pattern?&quot; checks. I think it's fine for now, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think eventually this is going to impact perf.</li>
<li>The &quot;check this case, then this case, and then this case&quot; approach already buckled under its own weight for imports. Now we have a &quot;look at the stuff we have <em>once</em>, and classify our case based on that.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't think there's any action item here right now. Mostly just voicing my thoughts.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess we don't technically have to call this unless we know we've added some keywords to the completions. And that only happens for scope based completions. So this will do an unnecessary AST check for <code>object.attr</code> and import completions.</p>
<p>But maybe we'll eventually rule out other things here besides keywords that we know can't be iterable. So I'm not sure it's worth trying to optimize this out?</p>
<p>I think part of my problem is that I don't have an intuition for the costs associated with calling <code>covering_node</code>. Maybe I'm tilting at windmills.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I'm not quite sure what the right architecture ought to be here. I suppose we could end up ruling out other completions as well.</p>
<p>Maybe having the completion collector &quot;know&quot; what the context is, and then its add methods could choose to ignore completions added that are incompatible with that context. But I think that's a bigger refactor.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gathering all my thoughts here instead of responding in the various threads.</p>
<p>I share your concerns and in theory I like the approach of building a context (before adding any completions) that has enough information such that we can later determine what completions should be added or ignored. Ignoring that this would be a big refactor, what slightly concerns me with that approach is that the size and the amount of information we would need to capture in the context could get out of hand, in order to support all the different cases where we might want to add or suppress different suggestions. So in practice I'm not quite sure how you would architect that to make it intuitive to work with.</p>
<p>To the extent it's doable, I do agree that we at the very least should stick to something like a single token-based pruning loop and a single AST-traversal pruning loop (I don't see how we can get away without both as long as we do any pruning at all) that either mutate completions in-place or builds some list of predicate functions that can be used to filter completions. This at least gets us away from a whole bunch of individual checks that all do their own AST traversal to remove bad suggestions. I'm not sure this would be quite as simple to do when we add new completions though (without bigger refactors), as that usually requires more work.</p>
<p>At some point a refactor in some direction is probably due though to make this scale nicer (both in terms of performance and readability), but to me it's not obvious what the right refactor to do here is.</p>
