            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR moves the Salsa caching &quot;down a layer&quot; in <code>tuple.rs</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TupleType</code> is no longer a Salsa-tracked struct; instead, it's just a thin wrapper around a Salsa-tracked struct, similar to <code>NominalInstanceType</code>, <code>ProtocolInstanceType</code> and others.</li>
<li><code>TupleSpec</code> (the type wrapped by <code>TupleType</code>) is no longer a type alias; instead, it's now a Salsa-tracked struct.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits of this are that we need to use many fewer <code>Cow</code>s across the ty codebase (which were previously required due to <code>TupleSpec</code> not being <code>Copy</code>), and we can avoid some very complicated trait bounds that we currently have in the signature of <code>TupleType::new()</code> on <code>main</code>.</p>

<p>When I first added this code, there were some hot path calls where that seemed to make a noticeable difference in performance. But looking again now, that no longer seems to be the case — in most places we're already calling with an owned <code>TupleSpec</code>. So, given that, you could also get rid of these bounds by just taking in an owned <code>TupleSpec</code>, and requiring the caller to <code>clone</code> before calling if they have a reference.</p>

<p>Hmm... we <em>could</em>, but I'm not sure I see the advantages of doing it that way. If we did this we'd have to keep <code>TupleType</code> as a Salsa-interned struct, or <code>NominalInstanceType</code> would no longer be <code>Copy</code> (and if <code>NominalInstanceType</code> were no longer <code>Copy</code>, <code>Type</code> would no longer be <code>Copy</code>). Our size constraints mean we have to intern either one or both of <code>TupleType</code> and <code>TupleSpec</code>.</p>

<p>Yep, with my suggestion, <code>TupleType</code> would remain interned, like it was before. We've found (e.g. in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19867) that interning fewer things is generally a good tradeoff, since interning requires cross-thread synchronization. My hunch is that we'll intern more values if we do the caching at the <code>TupleSpec</code> level. <code>try_iterate</code> is an example: it returns a <code>TupleSpec</code>, and there are call sites where we do not wrap that in a <code>TupleType</code>. So with this PR, we now have to intern the result of that function in places where we didn't have to before.</p>

<p>Hmmmmmm, I see, fair enough. I'm <em>slightly</em> sceptical that #19867 is indicative of a broader problem when it comes to lock contention -- my instinct is that that issue is quite sui generis. But I do agree that we should probably try to intern the minimum number of objects in the Salsa cache, since it leads to higher memory usage overall; and I think you're right that this PR in its current form probably leads to us interning a number of <code>TupleSpec</code>s that don't really need to be interned at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I guess that depends on the perspective :) It is specific in the sense that it is only an issue when the same interned values (of a specific interned struct) are used in a very hot code path. It isn't an issue if many threads intern many different interned structs because Salsa shards the locks by value, meaning most threads will end up acquiring different locks.</p>
<p>I don't understand <code>try_iterate</code> well enough to understand if this falls into the former (we often call it on very few tuples) or the latter (we call it on many different tuples) bucket.</p>
<p>The other part that makes #19867 somewhat unique is that it's a very hot methods. I'm not sure if <code>try_iterate</code> is equally hot. Either way. It's something you can test easily yourself. Build ty with the <code>profiling</code> profile (<code>cargo build --bin ty --profile profiling</code>) and run <code>samply record ./ruff/target/profiling/ty check ...</code> on a large repository. Then invert the stack frames and verify if there are now more frames attributed to the mutex lock cold path (see the PR for an example)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I find @dcreager's point pretty convincing: most of the paths in <code>Type::try_iterate</code> end up creating a fresh <code>TupleSpec</code> rather than reusing an (already borrowed one), because it returns a <code>TupleSpec</code> for all iterable types (not just tuples) in order to describe the behaviour these types have when they're unpacked. That means we'll end up interning (possibly many) <code>TupleSpec</code>s unnecessarily in many cases with the design proposed in this PR.</p>
<p>I don't <em>love</em> how viral our current design makes all the <code>Cow</code> types, but I'm persuaded that it's probably the least-bad option for now. I'll split out some of the other simplifications/improvements in this PR into a standalone PR.</p>
<p>Thanks @dcreager!</p>

<p>We can still try to get rid of the <code>Cow</code>s, if we want — we'd just have to make <code>Tuple</code> (and therefore <code>TupleSpec</code>) cheap to clone, so that we can return owned values all the time. They're just a couple of boxed slices of <code>Type</code>s, so they might be cheap enough to copy already!</p>
