            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/glyph/DateType"><code>DateType</code></a> library has some very large protocols in it. Currently we type-check it quite quickly, but the current version of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18659 makes our execution time on this library pathologically slow. That PR doesn't seem to have a big impact on any of our current benchmarks, however, so it seems we have some missing coverage in this area; I therefore propose that we add <code>DateType</code> as a benchmark.</p>
<p>Currently the benchmark runs pretty quickly (about half the runtime of attrs, which is our fastest real-world benchmark currently), and the library has 0 third-party dependencies, so the benchmark is quick to setup.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo bench -p ruff_benchmark --bench=ty</code></p>
