May not have time to fill out the rest of the map anytime soon - starting a draft with edit access in case anyone's got time to finish it out.

FWIW I considered creating`DecoratorProperties` and such to potentially make it this less annoying, but I think that'd make it harder to add new decorators in the future. If that's an approach you'd like me to take, please let me know

Gonna close this for now as it's not actively being worked on. Happy to re-open if there's interest in picking it up :)
