<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Rule <code>logging-warn</code> (<code>G010</code>) prescribes a change from <code>warn</code> to <code>warning</code> and has a corresponding autofix, but the autofix is mistakenly titled <code>&quot;Convert to `warn`&quot;</code> instead of <code>&quot;Convert to `warning`&quot;</code> (the latter is what the autofix actually does). Seems to be a plain typo.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I apologize for not being able to properly test this at the moment, the change was made by grepping the repo and fixing the typo in code as well as in the <code>.snap</code> file.</p>
