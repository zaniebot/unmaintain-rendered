## Summary

Here I fix the last English spelling errors I could find in the repo.

Again, I am trying not to touch variable/function names, or anything that might be misspelled in the API. The goal is to make this PR safe and easy to merge.

## Test Plan

I have run all the unit tests. Though, again, all of the changes I make here are to docs and docstrings. I make no code changes, which I believe should greatly mitigate the testing concerns.
