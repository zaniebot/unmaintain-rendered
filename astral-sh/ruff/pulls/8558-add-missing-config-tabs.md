I think the existing layout here is intentional because it shows you _both_ configurations at once, stacked.

~~And it still does, no? But both in either the `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml`. Currently, it only shows both in the `pyproject.toml`.~~ Sorry I was confusing my commits in this PR. OK, I understand what you mean now. By not indenting the code blocks you don't get the tabs and so see both config files at once. 

If you agree with the other two commits is it easier for you to cherry pick them or is there something you need me to do?
