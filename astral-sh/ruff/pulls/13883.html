            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This sets up &quot;jump to definition&quot; functionality in the <code>red_knot</code> server.</p>
<p>Here are some challenges in doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to go from a (file, line, row) triple to an AST node where the cursor is</li>
<li>Given an AST node, I need to look up definitions for them</li>
<li>Given a definition, I need to figure out the location</li>
</ul>
<p>I tackled this with a custom trait, <code>CanLocate</code>. We can ask implementations of the <code>CanLocate</code> trait where their definition is, based on a cursor location. This combines &quot;traverse the AST&quot; with &quot;do the lookup of the definition&quot; because sometimes we&#x27;ll need to just look up a name in a scope, but for attribute access in particular there&#x27;s some interplay between types and definition that need to happen so that <code>a.b.c</code> is properly done as &quot;find the definition of <code>c</code> on the type of <code>a.b</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>In practice this trait means I can traverse an AST tree, zooming down until I find the smallest node that a cursor is located in.</p>
<p>From there, I have added a couple of methods to help go from an AST node to a <code>Definition</code>.</p>
<p>From a <code>Definition</code> to a location has proven to be tricky. I have a <em>most definitely not the right answer</em> helper that is simply looking through a hash table to try and find the definition&#x27;s location based on its hash key (<code>definition_range</code>). It&#x27;s most definitely wrong, and would appreciate some advice there.</p>
<p>This currently implements &quot;go to definition&quot; based on just names and attribute access (not handling instance attributes just yet, though I believe MRO work is happening in another branch). Import traversal seems to magically work .</p>
<p>Still wanting to clean things up (in particular I think I can simplify some of the <code>CanLocate</code> implementations)</p>
Test Plan
<p>First you need to set up the LSP server. In Emacs I did this with the following with <code>lsp-mode</code> (please note I hardcoded the <code>red_knot</code> path , you&#x27;ll have to point to whatever you need)</p>
<pre><code>(lsp-register-client
 (make-lsp-client
  :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection &#x27;(&quot;/Users/rtpg/proj/ruff/target/debug/red_knot&quot; &quot;server&quot;))
  :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on &quot;python&quot;)
  :server-id &#x27;red-knot-ls
  )
 )
</code></pre>
<p>(in a project&#x27;s <code>.dir-locals.el</code>)</p>
<pre><code>((python-mode . (
                 (+format-with . ruff)
                 (lsp-enabled-clients . (red-knot-ls))
                 )))
</code></pre>
<p>I then was playing around with this file. Some &quot;jump to definition&quot; stuff works, some doesn&#x27;t.</p>
<pre><code>class C:
    a: int = 4

    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a

    def foo(self):
        return 0


def f(c: C) -&gt; int:
    return c.a


c: C = C(3)
c.a

c.foo()
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this contribution. This is a very cool feature.</p>
<p>This is a feature we want long term but it isn&#x27;t a short-term priority and there are a lot of things that we have to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The LSP shouldn&#x27;t call salsa methods directly. Instead, it should go through a facade (or it panics when another thread changes an input)</li>
<li>We don&#x27;t want lsp dependencies in red_knot_python_semantic</li>
<li>It&#x27;s unclear to me what the best way is to locate a node. I know that rust analyzer inserts an identifier at the cursor position</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t expect us to get around to reviewing and merging this feature in the short term. That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t work on it. I just want to avoid frustration if we won&#x27;t be able to make progress on this feature short term.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser yeah, understandable.</p>
<p>I appreciate how quick you all are for reviews, and believe that&#x27;s downstream of everyone doing these reviews seriously. So thank you for the expectation setting here. I&#x27;ll try to avoid this branch becoming a thing people have to consider until the time is right.</p>
<p>I wanted to open this draft PR to publicly state I had something working here (in case someone else was already tackling this), but I am comfortable just keeping this work on-branch until it looks like what people actually want. And if y&#x27;all come up with a totally different way to do this and just do it on a clean branch, no harm done (except to my pride 😆 ). I&#x27;ll still be working through this branch just because <em>I</em> need this functionality for now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks again for your work. I close this PR because it&#x27;s unlikely that we start working on this feature anytime soon (or review it). But we will pick it back up once we&#x27;re further along with Red Knot and your work will be a great source of inspiration for it.</p>
