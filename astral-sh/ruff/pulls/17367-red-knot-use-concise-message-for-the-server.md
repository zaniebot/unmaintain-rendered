# [red-knot] Use concise message for the server

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2025-04-12 04:46_

## Summary

This is mainly a follow-up from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17357 to use the `concise_message` method for the red-knot server which I noticed recently while testing the overload implementation.
