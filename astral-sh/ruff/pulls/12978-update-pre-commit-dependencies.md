The failures are because Ruff now autoformats Jupyter notebooks by default, and we have notebooks in `crates/ruff_notebook/resources/test/fixtures/jupyter` and `crates/ruff_server/resources/` that are either unformatted or in some cases deliberately have invalid syntax. I've pushed a commit to just ignore all pre-commit hooks for files in those directories.
