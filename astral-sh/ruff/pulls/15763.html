<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Transition to using coarse-grained tracked structs (depends on https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/pull/657). For now, this PR doesn't add any <code>#[tracked]</code> fields, meaning that any changes cause the entire struct to be invalidated. It also changes <code>AstNodeRef</code> to be compared/hashed by pointer address, instead of performing a deep AST comparison.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>This yields a 10-15% improvement on my machine (though weirdly some runs were 5-10% without being flagged as inconsistent by criterion, is there some non-determinism involved?). It's possible that some of this is unrelated, I'll try applying the patch to the current salsa version to make sure.</p>

<p>It seems you found the <code>Update</code> derive macro. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Feel free to only upgrade right before the commit introducing the <code>Update</code> constraint or let me know when you want some help adding <code>Update</code> implementations and I can commit right to this branch.</p>

<p>I believe the only difference is the ingredients only being created for tracked fields. However, we don't even use any tracked fields in this PR, so I don't see how that could be an issue.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>dependency_implicit_instance_attribute</code> test fails now. It suggests that we broke incrementality somehow (we end up performing type inference in a file that's unchanged). Good that @sharkdp added that test. However, it's very unclear to me what's triggering the invalidation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a bit unfortunate but we still need to keep the <code>tracked</code> for the <code>AstNodeRef</code> itself as @sharkdp test demonstrated it. The problem otherwise is that all definitions and expressions get new ids in the next revision, which in turn invalidates all <code>AttributeAssignment</code>, and the <code>attribute_assignments</code> query. The only way around this is if we use ids instead of actual ast nodes, ideally ids that are numbered per scope instead of globally to avoid that inserting an expression at the top invalidates the ids of all lower expressions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ideally yes. But it's not realy possible because of the order in which the PRs merged into Salsa. Coarse grained dependencies reqiures a bug fix that merged after the require <code>Update</code> trait PR and adding the <code>Update</code> requires the most recent commit which requires fewer <code>Update</code> implementations than the first PR...</p>
