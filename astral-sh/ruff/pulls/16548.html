<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>If an mdtest fails, the error output will include an example command that can be run to re-run just the failing test, e.g</p>
<pre><code>To rerun this specific test, set the environment variable: MDTEST_TEST_FILTER=&quot;sync.md - With statements - Context manager with non-callable `__exit__` attribute&quot;
MDTEST_TEST_FILTER=&quot;sync.md - With statements - Context manager with non-callable `__exit__` attribute&quot; cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic --test mdtest -- mdtest__with_sync
</code></pre>
<p>This is very helpful, but because we're printing the envvar value surrounded in double-quotes, the bits between backticks in this example get interpreted as a shell interpolation. When running this in zsh, for example, I see</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">❯ MDTEST_TEST_FILTER=&quot;sync.md - With statements - Context manager with non-callable `__exit__` attribute&quot; cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic --test mdtest -- mdtest__with_sync

test mdtest__with_sync ... ok
</code></pre>
<p>[^1]</p>
<p>This is a minor annoyance which we can solve by using single-quotes instead of double-quotes for this string. To do so safely, we also escape single-quotes possibly contained within the string.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/allenap/shell-quote">shell-quote</a> crate, which seems to handle all this escaping stuff for you but fixing this issue perfectly isn't a big deal (if there are more things to escape we can deal with it then), so adding a new dependency (even a dev one) seemed overkill.</p>
<p>[^1]: The filter does still work---it turns out that the filter <code>MDTEST_TEST_FILTER=&quot;sync.md - With statements - Context manager with non-callable  attribute&quot;</code> (what you get after the failed interpolation) is still good enough</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I broke the <code>## Context manager with non-callable `__exit__` attribute</code> test by deleting the error assertion, then successfully ran the new command it printed out.</p>
