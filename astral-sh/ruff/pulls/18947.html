<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Fixes #18825</p>
<p>This should make it so that clicking on the top left <code>RUFF</code> in the playground will take you to the docs. Untested locally since I could not figure out how to get <code>npm</code> to install correctly, so hopefully it just works/someone else can test it for me.</p>
<p>I did not add a link to the <code>ty</code> playground since a dedicated docs pages does not exist yet/it still says &quot;ASTRAL&quot; in the corner instead of having a <code>ty</code> logo.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>N/A, no functionality/tests affected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, it seems to work for me! I guess you can't really see my cursor, but I'm clicking on the logo in the header.</p>

<p>I'll let Micha take a look just in case there's more subtlety here, but it looks good to me.</p>
