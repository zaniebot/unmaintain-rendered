<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Added some extra notes on why you should have focused try...except blocks to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/try-consider-else/">TRY300</a>.</p>
<p>When fixing a violation of this rule, a co-worker of mine (very understandably) asked why this was better. The current docs just say putting the return in the else is &quot;more explicit&quot;, but if you look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html">linked reference in the python documentation</a> they are more clear on why violations like this is bad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of the else clause is better than adding additional code to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#try">try</a> clause because it avoids accidentally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by the try … except statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is my attempt at adding more context to the docs on this. Open to suggestions for wording!</p>
