            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<ul>
<li>Add Pylint <code>too-many-lines</code> (C0302) as a preview physical-lines rule with a 1000-line default, configurable via <code>lint.pylint.max-module-lines</code>.</li>
<li>Wire the rule into the linter registry/checker, remove the old flake8 file-length plumbing, and expose the new setting in workspace options and schema.</li>
<li>Add inline rule tests and regenerate docs/schema.</li>
</ul>
Test Plan
<ul>
<li><code>cargo test -p ruff_linter --lib</code></li>
<li><code>cargo dev generate-all</code></li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on this! However, I see that this rule is crossed out in the summary of #970 with the note &quot;not compatible with the formatter,&quot; so I don&#x27;t think we want to add this rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>+1 for merging this.
Resurfacing, running pylint standalone just for that rule is a tad annoying.
The &quot;not compatible with the formatter&quot; rationale doesn&#x27;t hold up:</p>
<p>The formatter changes line counts by maybe 1-5% through wrapping. If my limit is 200 lines, I don&#x27;t care if the formatter makes it 195 or 205. The point is catching 500+ line monsters, not precise line counts.
You already ship PLR0915 (too-many-statements), which has the same &quot;problem&quot;: the formatter can affect statement counts through expression splitting. Yet that rule exists and is useful.
This is blocking teams from consolidating on Ruff. Right now, I have to either:</p>
<p>Run Pylint alongside Ruff just for this one rule
Maintain a custom pre-commit script
Give up on enforcing file length
The implementation is done, and there&#x27;s clear demand. Would love to see this merged, even if it stays in preview mode.</p>
<p>@tluolamo thx for your work on this!</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t think this part is true. I&#x27;m fairly certain that the formatter shouldn&#x27;t modify the AST when it&#x27;s working correctly. If you&#x27;ve seen this happen, I&#x27;d love to see the code, and I think we&#x27;d consider it a bug!</p>
<p>(Not trying to invalidate the rest of the feedback, this part just caught my eye)</p>
