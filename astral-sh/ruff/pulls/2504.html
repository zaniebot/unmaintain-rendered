            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, changed. it should be the same.
I also fixed a special case when there are multiple imports in that import statement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Off-Topic:
I just merged the branch which does our tab to spaces migration and many more ruff-enhanced things (<a href="https://github.com/univention/univention-corporate-server/commit/2e5688d5636a453b266ddf6a8315552ce6862383">merge commit: 1,969 changed files with 203,016 additions and 203,292 deletions</a>).
If your are interested: this is our <a href="https://github.com/univention/univention-corporate-server/blob/5.0-3/pyproject.toml">pyproject.toml</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore I wanted to thank you for your effort in this project!!! The raw tabs-to-spaces migration was done with <code>autopep8</code> but <code>ruff</code> really helped me with the docstrings, which was not correctly done by <code>autopep8</code> and it made a lot of useful code refactoring things.</p>
<p>And I also wanted to appreciate your kindness in our collaboration: you took every issue of me serious and communicated clearly. You gave good hints in MRs. I enjoyed working with you so far!</p>
<p>I hope I will (have more time to) learn rust and contribute back to ruff in the future.
Best regards
spaceone</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@spaceone - That&#x27;s amazing! Thank you so much for this kind note, and I&#x27;m really glad that Ruff is working well for you. I&#x27;ve enjoyed our collaboration too. You filed a lot of issues 🤣 and found tons of edge cases -- I appreciate <em>your</em> contributions too (and I&#x27;m glad we could fix most of those issues!).</p>
