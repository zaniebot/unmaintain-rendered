<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This PR adds support for building loongarch64 binaries in CI. As such support has been merged in uv (astral-sh/uv#15387) it's time to consider adding it to ruff.</p>
<p>Please note that as Ubuntu is not yet available for loongarch64, I have elected to use a Debian Trixie container maintained by community members. In addition, as Debian's pip does not allow installing modules system-wide, I have modified the workflow to install additional modules in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>Since the workflow is shared between all targets, the only way to handle this difference (between Debian and Ubuntu) is just to install pip in a venv for all targets. If there is a better (and less intrusive) way to work around this, please let me know.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Tests are included in CI and the loongarch64 artifacts built in <a href="https://github.com/SkyBird233/ruff/actions/runs/17640270032/job/50125471548">this workflow</a> has been smoke tested.</p>
