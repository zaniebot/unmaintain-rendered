            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello team! 👋
I’m truly delighted with everything Ruff brings to the table. Our open-source project, <em>Orionis Framework</em>, is evolving with many features inspired by Laravel’s philosophy but built in Python. Every new feature we develop is reviewed with Ruff, and in fact, one of the framework’s native commands will integrate Ruff as its default linter — explicitly pointing to this official repository. 🚀
Thanks for creating such an amazing tool!</p>
