I know you can do this in git, but damn your git foo is good!

You give me too much credit. I first messed it up in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6099 . I then followed [this guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6099#issuecomment-1653116497) that @davidszotten shared and had to give it like 5 tries to make it work... Let's hope it really works and that @charliermarsh doesn't kill me for doing a merge commit :sweat_smile:

Lol, this didn't work. It worked when viewing the files on the branch but not after merging :confounded: We now have a messed up git log and no preserved history

_Comment by @MichaReiser on 2023-07-27 10:19_

I think I should have tone a rebase-merge rather than merge commit. Do I want to try this again
