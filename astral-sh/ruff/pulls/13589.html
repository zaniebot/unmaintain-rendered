            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I noticed that the red-knot benchmark was reporting different diagnostics on <code>tomllib</code> than red-knot did if you just ran red-knot from the CLI on the <code>tomllib</code> copied-and-pasted into an empty directory locally. Specifically, the following diagnostic was not being reported by the red-knot benchmark, but <em>was</em> being reported if you just ran red-knot locally:</p>
<pre><code>/src/tomllib/__init__.py:10:30: Name &#x27;__name__&#x27; used when not defined.
</code></pre>
<p>After some investigation, I realised that the culprit was this line here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/2a36b47f1395284d32ae2015e6c626f242922224/crates/ruff_benchmark/benches/red_knot.rs#L76</p>
<p>&quot;Opening&quot; the <code>tomllib/_parser.py</code> file means that red-knot will only check <code>_parser.py</code> and files that <code>_parser.py</code> depends on. <code>_parser.py</code> doesn&#x27;t depend on <code>__init__.py</code>, so <code>__init__.py</code> isn&#x27;t being checked at all by the red-knot benchmark currently. This PR therefore changes the benchmark so that all <code>tomllib</code> files are &quot;opened&quot;, and thus all <code>tomllib</code> files are checked.</p>
<p>The first commit in this PR should have no impact on behaviour: it&#x27;s just some refactoring I did so that I could see more clearly which files were being downloaded by the benchmark and copied into the <code>tomllib</code> directory used by the benchmark.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo bench -p ruff_benchmark -- red_knot</code></p>

<p>What&#x27;s the motivation for checking all files? Or why is it important for the benchmark to check all files?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two reasons I guess, but neither of them are directly related to the benchmark&#x27;s function &quot;as a benchmark&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>I was trying to repro the issues Charlie was seeing in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13579">astral-sh/ruff#13579</a>#issuecomment-2384751176, and it was just very confusing to me that I was seeing different diagnostics when running red-knot on <code>tomllib</code> directly than the ones that we were asserting in the benchmark. It&#x27;s much easier to understand what&#x27;s going on if the benchmark reports the same diagnostics that you get when executing red-knot on the directory from the CLI.</li>
<li>Probably we should add a separate test for this that just runs red-knot on <code>tomllib</code> as part of our test suite -- but this benchmark, as well as measuring performance, also serves as a really useful integration test that shows the kinds of false positives we currently emit on well-written real-world code. I sort-of think about the diagnostic list in the benchmark file as something of a todo list.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also -- and I suppose this <em>is</em> more related to its function as a benchmark -- I assumed that the benchmark <em>was</em> indicative of &quot;the time it takes to check the <code>tomllib</code> directory&quot;. I suppose it doesn&#x27;t really matter so much if that&#x27;s <em>not</em> what it&#x27;s indicative of -- but it does feel, again, slightly less confusing to me if it checks the whole directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems fine to me; I don&#x27;t think it matters a lot either way for the benchmark, and I agree this is less confusing when looking at the error output.</p>
