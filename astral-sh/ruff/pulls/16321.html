            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR rewrites <code>Type::try_iterate()</code> to greatly improve the quality of our type inference for edge cases involving iterables, and greatly improve the quality of our diagnostics. <code>IterateError</code> is renamed to <code>IterationError</code>, and ~~is expanded to have 10(!) inner variants~~. (Following code review, I&#x27;ve managed to reduce this to 4 inner variants.)</p>
<p>Fixes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16272">astral-sh/ruff#16272</a>. Fixes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16123">astral-sh/ruff#16123</a>. Helps a lot with astral-sh/ruff#13989.</p>
<p>Note: some of the diagnostic messages are now somewhat verbose. In the long run, I think we could probably change a lot of them to be diagnostics with concise messages but with several notes attached to them.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Several new mdtests, and lots of diagnostic snapshots</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if retaining all those different errors is the right approach. This is what I called out in my <code>CallOutcome</code> refactor that we need to find the right balance between retaining enough detail for diagnostics without making error handling awkward in other cases.</p>
<p>I think my preference here would be that the diagnostic handler recomputes some of that information rather than that we funnel it all the way through. The argument here isn&#x27;t necessarily performance but the complexity it introduces when handling an iterate error. You can see this with <code>CallError</code> today: Each call site that handles <code>CallError</code> needs to match on all variants and define how a call error in that situation should be matched. The more variants, the more complicated these error handlers become. Obviously, we have to retain enough information to distinguish the cases that are relevant for error propagation but we should aim to keep the enum minimal.</p>
<p>I also expect that we&#x27;ll need more variants long term and may even need to retain more information per variant to highlight the relevant parts. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m somewhat leaning towards simply re-doing some of the <code>iterate</code> resolution <code>IterateError</code>&#x27;s diagnostic logic. E.g. what about unions?</p>

<p>Either way. I&#x27;m concerned about having 10 <code>IterateError</code> variants. It doesn&#x27;t seem to scale well and I&#x27;m somewhat convinced that we&#x27;ll have to retain even more information for diagnostics in the future (e.g. the range where the <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__iterate__</code> method are defined).</p>
<p>This makes me believe that we should not distinguish between all those variants in <code>IterateError</code> but instead redo some of the <code>iterate</code> logic in the <code>IterateError::report_diagnostic</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>blegh, I much prefer <code>IterationError</code> 😄 because &quot;iterate&quot; just can&#x27;t be used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_adjunct">noun adjunct</a> in the same way as &quot;call&quot; or &quot;bool&quot; (because it&#x27;s a verb rather than a noun -- &quot;call&quot; can be both a verb or a noun depending on context, which is why that feels OK to me, but that&#x27;s not true for &quot;iterate&quot;)</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t feel too strongly though. I can change this back if you strongly dislike the new name, or if others agree with you :-)</p>

<p>Yeah. The main reasons why I wanted to do something now were:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have some error messages on <code>main</code> that are just flat-out incorrect, and are pretty confusing (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16272">astral-sh/ruff#16272</a>)</li>
<li>We finally <em>can</em> have both type inference that is more precise and diagnostics that are more informative, following your great work this week refacting <code>Type::call()</code> and <code>Type::iterate()</code>. I wanted to try it out 😄</li>
<li>I think we will <em>want</em> all this information in our diagnostics. I agree that we probably won&#x27;t want it <em>presented</em> all in one long sentence in the final version of our diagnostics, but it seems to me that this work will make it easier to migrate to those kinds of diagnostics-with-notes when the time comes -- because the changes I&#x27;m making here mean that when the time comes, all the information will be available to us to produce those kinds of diagnostics.</li>
</ul>

<p>FWIW: while I absolutely agree that this is a concern, I think it is <em>less</em> of a concern for iteration than it is for calling. The main reason why we need to match on <code>CallError</code> everywhere is because so many high-level operations in Python desugar to lots of call operations. Iteration <em>does</em> happen implicitly in lots of places in Python, but the only place I know of where there&#x27;s a higher-level operation that uses iteration under the hood is the <code>in</code> and <code>not in</code> operators: if a container doesn&#x27;t have a <code>__contains__</code> method, Python will attempt to iterate over the container to see if the object is (or isn&#x27;t) in the container.</p>
<p>The TL;DR here is that I think there will overall be many fewer places that we will need to match over the variants here and propagate them into a higher-level diagnostic; it&#x27;s not nearly as significant a problem as it is for <code>CallError</code>.</p>

<p>Nice, I&#x27;ll have another look and this addresses my concerns :)</p>
<p>I also think that I probably haven&#x27;t done a good job at this myself with <code>BoolError</code>. It&#x27;s more fine-grained than it probably ought to be.</p>

<p>I totally agree with this. I believe there&#x27;s only one case inside <code>member</code> where we have to deal with <code>iterate</code> errors. My motivation for course correcting here is mainly to test and establish certain patterns and it seems you&#x27;ve been very successful at it!</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s a failure if we start using snapshot tests everywhere (or for a large majority of tests) because the experience is than very close to what we have from Ruff. Instead, we should use them mainly to validate that the diagnostic ranges are correct.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for iterating on this. I still think that we might be doing too much work in <code>Type::iterate</code> that&#x27;s wasted if we don&#x27;t end up emitting the diagnostic but I&#x27;d have to play with the error variants myself to fully understand if that&#x27;s the case and you can probably answer this best. I also don&#x27;t think that this should block merging this PR anymore.</p>
<p>Ideally, we&#x27;d have exactly one error variant that <code>Type::iterate</code> returns. That would be the most efficient and easiest to handle by upstream code. It also allows to defer some of the error-probing calls to the diagnostic code path only (and skip them entirely if the diagnostic is turned off). There are two reasons why we might not want to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We might want to infer a more precise type for the element type even in the error case</li>
<li>We might have upstream code that calls <code>iterate</code> with deviating behavior based on <em>some condition</em></li>

<p>I don&#x27;t <em>think</em> that&#x27;s the case. But if you think you can make all my tests pass while doing less work in <code>Type::iterate()</code>, I&#x27;d love to see it ;-)</p>
<p>For example, here&#x27;s one edge case that we don&#x27;t handle correctly on <code>main</code> (it&#x27;s covered by a test in this PR):</p>
<pre><code>from typing import reveal_type

class Iterator:
    def __next__(self) -&gt; str:
        return &quot;foo&quot;

def test(flag: bool):
    class Foo:
        if flag:
            def __iter__(self) -&gt; Iterator:
                return Iterator()

        def __getitem__(self, key: int) -&gt; bytes:
            return b&quot;42&quot;

    for x in Foo():
        reveal_type(x)
        yield x
</code></pre>
<p>On <code>main</code> we say this:</p>
<pre><code>error: lint:not-iterable
  --&gt; /Users/alexw/dev/experiment/foo.py:16:14
   |
14 |             return b&quot;42&quot;
15 |
16 |     for x in Foo():
   |              ^^^^^ Object of type `Foo` is not iterable because its `__iter__` method is possibly unbound
17 |         reveal_type(x)
18 |         yield x
   |

info: revealed-type
  --&gt; /Users/alexw/dev/experiment/foo.py:17:9
   |
16 |     for x in Foo():
17 |         reveal_type(x)
   |         -------------- info: Revealed type is `str`
18 |         yield x
   |
</code></pre>
<p>But on my branch we now say this:</p>
<pre><code>info: revealed-type
  --&gt; /Users/alexw/dev/experiment/foo.py:17:9
   |
16 |     for x in Foo():
17 |         reveal_type(x)
   |         -------------- info: Revealed type is `str | bytes`
18 |         yield x
   |
</code></pre>
<p>which is much more correct, in my view. Since the <code>__iter__</code> method is possibly unbound, we union together the return type of the iterator&#x27;s <code>__next__</code> method and the return type of the <code>__getitem__</code> method to infer the type for <code>x</code> (rather than just using the return type of the <code>__next__</code> method. And we no longer report a diagnostic, which reflects the behaviour you get at runtime, where the <code>Foo</code> class is always iterable whether or not <code>flag</code> is <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% python -i foo.py                                                                                     
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(test(flag=True))
Runtime type is &#x27;str&#x27;
&#x27;foo&#x27;
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(test(flag=False))
Runtime type is &#x27;bytes&#x27;
b&#x27;42&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>But in order to achieve this we do need to continue calling dunders even after we hit the first error (which would be that the <code>__iter__</code> method is possibly unbound). We need to check that the <code>__iter__</code> method returns a valid iterator class in the event that it is bound, and we need to check that <code>__getitem__</code> provides a valid fallback in the event that <code>__iter__</code> is unbound. Only then do we have enough information to return <code>Ok()</code> from <code>Type::try_iterate()</code> rather than <code>Err()</code>.</p>

<p>Hmm, I rather don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t consider it a priority right now and I also think that you should know best. I was mainly trying to explain when I think it&#x27;s appropriate to add new variants and it&#x27;s perfect if you&#x27;ve now narrowed it down to exactly those cases</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with all that. I actually think for all of these diagnostics, the top-line error message should probably just be either &quot;Object of type  is not iterable&quot; or &quot;Object of type  may not be iterable&quot;.</p>
<p>Again, though, this PR isn&#x27;t really about trying to get to <em>perfect</em> diagnostics right now -- its aim is really to distinguish between the different error cases and make sure that we&#x27;re propagating the necessary information into `IterationError`` so that we can easily turn these into beautifully presented diagnostics when our infrastructure&#x27;s there.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I&#x27;d prefer to leave this as-is for now. Otherwise it&#x27;s the only <code>IterationError</code> diagnostic message that doesn&#x27;t given an explanation, which seems inconsistent 😄 and I think long-term, the explanation probably shouldn&#x27;t be part of the top-line message for any of these diagnostics</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s a great question.</p>
<p>Overall I feel like mdtest (as it is currently -- obviously we can keep improving it!) is fantastic in a lot of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows us to write tests very concisely and declaratively</li>
<li>It&#x27;s very easy to make lots of assertions on which types are revealed in which cases</li>
<li>It&#x27;s very easy to make lots of assertions that &quot;this Python code leads us to emit an error on that line with error code X&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I think mdtest isn&#x27;t very well suited to right now is making assertions on the full error message:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#x27;s very tedious to have to go through all locations and update the asserted error message if you make a change to the error message</li>
<li>Even if you do make an assertion on the full error message, you don&#x27;t see the full details of how the diagnostic will be rendered to the user. And as we&#x27;ve been discussing, that seems pretty relevant here, since cramming all the information into one sentence obviously isn&#x27;t the ideal way of presenting these diagnostics.</li>
<li>[This one is very fixable] I was pretty surprised that my changes didn&#x27;t initially lead to any tests failing, even though I had changed a bunch of error messages. That&#x27;s because currently if the error message is &quot;Object X is not iterable because foo bar baz&quot; and the assertion is <code>error: [not-iterable] &quot;Object X is not iterable&quot;</code>, the assertion will pass, since mdtest just checks whether the actual error message <em>contains</em> the asserted errror message (it doesn&#x27;t check that the asserted error message is a fullmatch).</li>
</ul>
<p>So using snapshots felt like a good fit for a lot of these tests, where what we really want to test is how the information is reported to the user, and where we expect that the presentation of the diagnostics will continue to change in the future. However, I do agree that it&#x27;s not ideal:</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be so much nicer with inline snapshots; having them far away from the Python snippets makes it much harder to tell whether the snapshot is correct or incorrect</li>
<li>It&#x27;s much easier to just blindly accept the snapshot without checking that it&#x27;s correct</li>
<li>Our current snapshotting setup for mdtest isn&#x27;t ideal. <code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code> stops testing a markdown file as soon as it finds a failing snapshot in that markdown file. That meant that I had to run <code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic; cargo insta review</code> several times before all snapshots for <code>for.md</code> were updated, which was pretty frustrating.</li>
</ul>
<p>All told, I&#x27;m also not sure that using this much snapshotting is a great idea right now. I&#x27;m happy to switch it to standard mdtest assertions on full diagnostic messages if you&#x27;d prefer it :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the detailed explanation. I&#x27;d probably create one snapshot test for each unique diagnostic rendering variant. All tests that only enforce type inference feature should not use snaphshot testing. I leave it up to you to assess whether that&#x27;s the case.</p>

<p>That makes sense to me. I did a quickish audit and removed a few hundred lines of snapshots. We&#x27;re pretty much there on this PR now, I think.</p>

<p>This thread did prompt me to add a few thoughts over on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16255">astral-sh/ruff#16255</a></p>
<p>Regarding messages in <code># error:</code> comments being a &quot;contains&quot; check rather than a &quot;full match&quot;, that was intentional, the idea being to reduce update pain by only asserting the critical information that a certain test wants to ensure is present in the message. I&#x27;m not sure this works out in practice, though; we almost always use the full message, and it reads pretty oddly if you don&#x27;t. So I&#x27;d be OK changing this to full match.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks great to me, thank you! I think the number of variants of <code>IterationErrorKind</code> is reasonable, and the current PR does a good job of deferring any extra work that is solely for diagnostic purposes into the path where there definitely is a diagnostic to report (mostly by wrapping the underlying call error in the iteration error, which seems like a good pattern to me.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IIRC the specific reason I added this test was to check that we still inferred <code>int</code> (rather than <code>Unknown</code>) for <code>x</code>, despite the fact that <code>__iter__</code> is possibly unbound and <code>__getitem__</code> is set to <code>None</code>. I think in an early version of this PR, that wasn&#x27;t true.</p>
<p>This at least warrants me adding some prose to describe the test, though; I agree that this isn&#x27;t obvious! And it&#x27;s probably best to include the full error message here anyway, just for consistency with the other tests in this file.</p>

<p>Yeah, I remember the reasons for the decision! But I also agree that it hasn&#x27;t proven useful in practice. And as I say, it actually <em>confused</em> me briefly while working on this PR -- so I&#x27;d also favour changing it now to require a full match.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s probably worth revisiting this once we have support for subdiagnostics/notes. Once those are implemented, we&#x27;ll generally have shorter summary lines in our diagnostics, so it&#x27;ll be less cumbersome to enforce a fullmatch on the summary line as part of mdtest.</p>
