<p>There are a few major parts to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making the formatter script idempotent, so it can be run repeatedly and is robust to changing commits</li>
<li>Reducing the overhead of the git operations, minimizing the data transfer</li>
<li>Parallelizing all the git operations by repository</li>
</ol>
<p>This reduces the setup time from 80s to 16s (locally).</p>
<p>The initial motivation for idempotency was to include the repositories in the GitHub Actions cache. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it yet — they&#x27;re about 1GB and would consume our limited cache space. Regardless, it improves correctness for local invocations.</p>
<p>The total runtime of the job is reduced from ~4m to ~3m.</p>
<p>I also made some cosmetic changes to the output paths and such.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m still using them because they&#x27;re not only useful to assess black compatibility (which the ecosystem checks don&#x27;t give us) but it also assigns a number to how compatible the stable and preview style are. The latter is mainly useful to understand: Is this a change happening very locally in a single file or does it touch every file in a repository. Something that I find difficult to assess from the ecosystem checks (because they truncate).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m also not concerned about the performance of this job. It only runs on formatter PRs and they&#x27;re rare. Every formatter diff has to wait for the ecosystem check results, which tend to be much slower than any other check.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. performance isn&#x27;t a concern for this job and it runs to infrequently for the caches to even be useful.</p>

<p>Not anymore! They run in 3m now — I&#x27;m following up on this because it&#x27;s one of the slowest remaining jobs.</p>
