            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR removes the following CLI aliases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ruff &lt;path&gt;</code> to <code>ruff check &lt;path&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>ruff --explain</code> to <code>ruff rule</code></li>
<li><code>ruff --clean</code> to <code>ruff clean</code></li>
<li><code>ruff --generate-shell-completion</code> to <code>ruff generate-shell-completion</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The aliases are deprecated since Ruff 0.3 and using them became a hard error in 0.5.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10171</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I tested that using any of the aliases becomes a hard error.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>We could keep the error messages around a little longer. It's not a lot of code but I would also expect that most users have migrated at this time (unless they skip 0.5)</p>

<p>I'd lean towards keeping these for another minor release, but I don't feel strongly</p>

<p>Are you sure you won't feel the same. IMO, we should either not remove the messages until like 1.0 or go ahead with it.</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty sure :P</p>
<p>With a one-month period, I feel like folks who aren't super speedy in updating their dependencies could easily just bump their Ruff pin from 0.4 to 0.6 and never see the nice error message we're giving them right now. Doubling the period to two months doesn't get rid of that risk (nothing can), but I feel like there'll be substantially fewer people falling into that bucket.</p>
<p>Again, though, I don't feel strongly. They've been deprecated for ages and this abides by our versioning scheme.</p>

<p>I don't really agree with this. I don't think we should special-case 1.0.</p>

<p>That's not my concern. My concern is that we keep spending time debating the same. That's why I rather postpone the removal indefinitely because the win of removing is very minimal (with the exception of <code>--output-format=text</code>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds like Alex and I have loosely held opinions, maybe make the decision based on code maintenance? I agree we shouldn't discuss it every cycle: we should set a future milestone and stick to it unless we're getting clear feedback from the community that it is incorrect. We can also always revert (restore the helpful error) if we get reports from confused users.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think you should do what you think is best here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just stumbling upon this PR... as a more long-term solution, it might be nice if there were a general mechanism that checks whether an unknown flag matches a subcommand, and then to suggest that subcommand in the error message. Could even be checking if there is a match with a small edit distance.</p>
