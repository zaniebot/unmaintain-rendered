            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I was a bit stuck on some snapshot differences I was seeing in #19415, but @BurntSushi pointed out that <code>annotate-snippets</code> already normalizes tabs on its own, which was very helpful! Instead of applying this change directly to the other branch, I wanted to try applying it in <code>ruff_linter</code> first. This should very slightly reduce the number of changes in #19415 proper.</p>
<p>It looks like <code>annotate-snippets</code> always expands a tab to four spaces, whereas I think we were aligning to tab stops:</p>
<pre><code>  6 | spam(ham[1], { eggs: 2})
  7 | #: E201:1:6
- 8 | spam(   ham[1], {eggs: 2})
-   |      ^^^ E201
+ 8 | spam(    ham[1], {eggs: 2})
+   |      ^^^^ E201
</code></pre>
<pre><code>61 | #: E203:2:15 E702:2:16
 62 | if x == 4:
-63 |     print(x, y) ; x, y = y, x
-   |                ^ E203
+63 |     print(x, y)    ; x, y = y, x
+   |                ^^^^ E203
</code></pre>
<pre><code> E27.py:15:6: E271 [*] Multiple spaces after keyword
    |
-13 | True        and False
+13 | True        and    False
 14 | #: E271
 15 | a and  b
    |      ^^ E271
</code></pre>
<p>I don&#x27;t think this is too bad and has the major benefit of allowing us to pass the non-tab-expanded range to <code>annotate-snippets</code> in #19415, where it&#x27;s also displayed in the header. Ruff doesn&#x27;t have this problem currently because it uses its own concise diagnostic output as the header for full diagnostics, where the pre-expansion range is used directly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This LGTM. You might want Micha to sign-off on the snapshot changes. I don&#x27;t mind them personally, and I think I might even prefer them. With tab-stops, the number of spaces inserted is variable and could, I think, be confusing as to what is happening. Where as I think if someone is using tabs, if they see they are consistently replaced by 4 space characters, then I think it&#x27;s probably easier to intuit what&#x27;s happening.</p>

<p>For the unprintable characters, they don&#x27;t have a &quot;width&quot;: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2024&amp;gist=7c5639c10e050961f2ec7b81a82abcd6</p>
<p>But we&#x27;re replacing it with a character that has a width of 1 column.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s possible this might work fine today if there&#x27;s a <code>character.width().unwrap_or(1)</code> somewhere in <code>annotate-snippets</code>. If not, I think the right way to fix that would be in <code>annotate-snippets</code>. IDK if that&#x27;s worth prioritizing right now. We could open a bug issue for it.</p>

<p>Ah, yep, I should revert most of that too.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess we do have the same issue for unprintable characters, but it&#x27;s probably a bit less prominent with a difference of 1 vs 3. And I kind of assumed unprintable characters are less common than tabs too.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure <code>annotate-snippets</code> doesn&#x27;t handle this already. I actually tested unprintable characters in #19535, unlike tabs, but I can double check.</p>
<p>Assuming not, grepping for <code>unwrap_or(1)</code> was surprisingly fruitful:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/c5ac998892a339be0304c7f9e69a5318b371deb8/crates/ruff_annotate_snippets/src/renderer/display_list.rs#L355-L357</p>
<p>I think this is for cutting long lines, but just above here is where <code>normalize_whitespace</code> is called, so it might be a promising place to try replacing unprintable characters too. I might spend a little time trying that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, I looked back at the snapshots in #19415, and if the problem is &quot;we display the wrong range in the header,&quot; this is okay, at least for the snapshots in our test suite. I&#x27;m a bit surprised by this because the <code>text_len</code> of our replacement characters is 3, so we are updating the ranges, but it doesn&#x27;t cause a mismatch in the header line like the tabs. I guess <code>annotate-snippets</code> <em>does</em> account for the length vs width difference already.</p>
<p>I even added a more exaggerated example:</p>
<pre><code>nested_fstrings = f&#x27;{f&#x27;{f&#x27;&#x27;}&#x27;}&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>where we replace 6 unprintable characters instead of 1 in the <code>unprintable_characters</code> test. The input range is <code>29..29</code>, which gets shifted to <code>41..41</code>, but the output is still correct:</p>
<pre><code>error[invalid-character-sub]: Invalid unescaped character SUB, use &quot;\x1A&quot; instead
 --&gt; example.py:1:30
  |
1 | nested_fstrings = f&#x27;␈␈␈␈␈␈{f&#x27;{f&#x27;␛&#x27;}&#x27;}&#x27;
  |                              ^
  |
</code></pre>
<p>So I think our unprintable handling is okay. I&#x27;ll revert the whitespace parts of #19535!</p>
