# [red-knot] mdtest: python version requirements

---

_Pull request opened by @sharkdp on 2024-12-13 09:32_

## Summary

This is not strictly required yet, but makes these tests future-proof. They need a `python-version` requirement as they rely on language features that are not available in 3.9.
