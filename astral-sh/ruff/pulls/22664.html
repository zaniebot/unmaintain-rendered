            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is <code>expr</code> the same in each of these cases? I would be tempted to compute the <code>applicability</code> once outside of the <code>match</code> and then reuse it in each of these places if so.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! This looks fine to me, just one suggestion about sharing the applicability check.</p>

<p>I kind of agree after seeing all these PRs. Perhaps something like <code>checker.contains_comments(expr)</code> ?</p>
