            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As discussed today, this is needed to handle legacy generic classes without having to infer the types of the class's explicit bases eagerly at class construction time. Pulling this out into a separate PR so there's a smaller diff to review.</p>
<p>This also makes our representation of generic classes and functions more consistent — before, we had separate Rust types and enum variants for generic/non-generic classes, but a single type for generic functions. Now we each a single (respective) type for each.</p>
<p>There were very few places we were differentiation between generic and non-generic <em>class literals</em>, and these are handled now by calling the (salsa cached) <code>generic_context</code> <em>accessor function</em>.</p>
<p>Note that <em><code>ClassType</code></em> is still an enum with distinct variants for non-generic classes and specialized generic classes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks nice!</p>
<p>It does lead to a small 3% perf regression on incremental benchmarks. I suspect it is because it now requires two salsa ingredients for every class (generic context and the class itself).</p>
