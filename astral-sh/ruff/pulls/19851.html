<p>If we wanted to be conservative we could probably gate this behind preview since it's conceptually close to adding a new safe fix to a stable rule. However, I think it's okay because the fact that the fix was missing before was kind of surprising. And there are no changes in the ecosystem either.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The more I think about this, the more I'm leaning towards using preview to be safe. @MichaReiser do you feel strongly one way or the other? I only found 99 results in a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%2F%5B%27%22%5D%5C.r%3Fsplit%5C%28maxsplit%3D%5B1-9%5D%2B%5C%29%2F+language%3APython&amp;type=code">code search</a>, so maybe it's quite a niche pattern anyway.</p>
<p>The preview-gate itself would be easy enough, but we also need a new function in <code>preview.rs</code> and to add the test case to the flake8-simplify <code>preview_rules</code> function, if we go that route.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we have to, according to our versioning policy. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8074 why we might want to change that.</p>
