# Remove `setup.py`

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-15 14:31_

This only existed to power GitHub's dependency graph. It _should_ be unnecessary now that GitHub supports the [PEP 621 standard](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-13-dependency-graph-supports-the-python-pep-621-standard/).

Closes #2920.
