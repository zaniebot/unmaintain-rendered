@jhossbach - Do you mind taking a look at this? I'm not really an expert on configuring the LSP integrations into various editors, so I just put an example based on what I had to do for Neovim. Would love to link to better example sources / guides if you know of any...

I use neovim myself so I can't speak for any other editors, but LGTM :+1:
