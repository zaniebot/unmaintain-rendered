            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There were many fields in <code>Signature</code> and friends that really had more to do with how a signature was being <em>used</em> — how it was looked up, details about an individual call site, etc. Those fields more properly belong in <code>Bindings</code> and friends.</p>
<p>This is a pure refactoring, and should not affect any tests or ecosystem projects.</p>
<p>I started on this journey in support of https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/462. It seemed worth pulling out as a separate PR.</p>
<p>One major concrete benefit of this refactoring is that we can now use <code>CallableSignature</code> directly in <code>CallableType</code>. (We can't use <code>CallableSignature</code> directly in that <code>Type</code> variant because signatures are not currently interned.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>nit: It might be useful to provide a brief description on what &quot;an empty Bindings&quot; mean here as I don't think it's about an empty <code>Bindings::elements</code> but more about the fact that this is kind of an &quot;initial&quot; state before matching any parameters to the arguments and doing type checking.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Done! By &quot;empty&quot; I meant that you have to do more work to actually analyze a call site using the <code>Bindings</code> you get back. I reworded the comment and added some more detail to explain that better.</p>
