            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2415 I think?</p>
<p>Previously, completions could be computed on stale file content because they were requested before the file objects were fully updated.</p>
<p>This became apparent when we configured <code>incomplete = True</code> as this causes completions to be re-fetched as more text is typed.</p>
<p>I don't really know if this is the best fix but it seems to work 🤷</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Verifying that https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2415 does not reproduce and that the playground seems fine in general.</p>

<p>We could, but we update the options in a few different scenarios in Playground.tsx and I'm not sure it's an improvement to specifically handle the settings changes when a file is modified in the editor while the rest still has to remain in the playground.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What's a bit surprising is that react-monaco wrapper does exactly this</p>
<p>https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor/blob/3062386185b0fee4fb2aa5002e5ef5fdedc05dbb/src/editor.tsx#L63-L67</p>
<p>I've to take a closer look why doing this here would work when doing the same in <code>onChange</code> does not</p>
<p>I suspect it has to do with <code>__prevent_trigger_change_event</code> but that would also mean that the issue really just is that we update the content out of order?</p>
