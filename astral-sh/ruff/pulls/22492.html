            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2415 I think?</p>
<p>Previously, completions could be computed on stale file content because they were requested before the file objects were fully updated.</p>
<p>This became apparent when we configured <code>incomplete = True</code> as this causes completions to be re-fetched as more text is typed.</p>
<p>I don't really know if this is the best fix but it seems to work 🤷</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Verifying that https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2415 does not reproduce and that the playground seems fine in general.</p>
