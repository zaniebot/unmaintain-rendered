### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rust-lang/hashbrown (hashbrown)</summary>

### [`v0.15.1`](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#v0151---2024-11-03)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)

This release removes the `borsh` feature introduced in 0.15.0 because it was
found to be incorrectly implemented. Users should use the `hashbrown` feature of
the `borsh` crate instead which provides the same trait implementations.
