            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Thanks! Looking at it now, C is still listed (as it <em>is</em> probably a substitute for C4 from what I've gathered from the previous conversation), as is COM. C90 is still absent, though, off the top of my head.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>C</code> does match <code>C4</code> and <code>C9</code>. It's admittedly confusing, but because those two categories both have a <code>C</code> prefix, they're both matched by <code>C</code>. This is different from <code>COM</code>, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I see. It's one of those things that only become intuitive after someone explains them. Hopefully this PR fixes the logic, making this discussion redundant 🙏 . Thanks!</p>
