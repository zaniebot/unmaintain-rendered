            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>A follow-up to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11222">astral-sh/ruff#11222</a>. <code>ruff server</code> stalls during shutdown with Neovim because after it receives an exit notification and closes the I/O thread, it attempts to log a success message to <code>stderr</code>. Removing this log statement fixes this issue.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Track the instances of <code>ruff</code> in the OS task manager as you open and close Neovim. A new instance should appear when Neovim starts and it should disappear once Neovim is closed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That wouldn&#x27;t work because the I/O with the client has shut down at the point where we log this. However, it would at least fail instantly instead of just waiting forever.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How can we avoid this in the future? It seems error prone to rely on tracing not being used after the main loop ends (it may even be a dependency that writes a trace, maybe even a third party dependency</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not understanding the root cause is what makes me wary of the fix. It&#x27;s a good fix to unblock users but it seems fragile to me long term.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>the <code>ruff server</code> is not the subprocess of nvim. is this relevant to it?</p>
