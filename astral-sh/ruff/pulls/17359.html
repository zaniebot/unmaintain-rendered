            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Uses the <code>relatedInformation</code> field in diagnostics to render additional data.</p>
<p>For now, this only renders subdiagnostics and annotations with location information. I played with showing other annotations as well, but the rendering in VS code looked awful (I mainly played with the overload diagnostic). I think this is an improvement over the status quo and we can iterate on it as we go.</p>

<p>I think specifically for overloads this seems like a reasonable amount of information to display using related information because a user can hover over the function variable to look at the possible overloads. For example, here the first group is the ty diagnostics while the last group is the hover content:</p>

<p>How this plays out with other diagnostics, that&#x27;s something that we can play around in follow-ups but this is a good start as you&#x27;ve mentioned.</p>
<hr>
<p>I know Neovim doesn&#x27;t support related information but I&#x27;m not sure about editors other than VS Code like Zed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would actually prefer the duplication over a trait. :-)</p>
<p>If the duplication gets obnoxious, another path we could follow is split the common parts of <code>Diagnostic</code> and <code>SubDiagnostic</code> out into a new internal helper type, and implement what we need there. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s quite worth doing yet.</p>
<p>My bias is that I tend to be pretty trait-averse.</p>
