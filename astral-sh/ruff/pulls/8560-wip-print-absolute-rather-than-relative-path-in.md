# WIP: print absolute rather than relative path in messages

_Pull request opened by @riccardoNovaglia on 2023-11-08 13:56_

A quick attempt at printing absolute rather than relative paths of files changed or where errors have been found.

This is not the full extent of changes required, but rather an attempt at finding where this logic might be.
