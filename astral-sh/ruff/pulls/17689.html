<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes: astral-sh/ty#159</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This PR adds the support for using <code>Self</code> in methods.
When the type of an annotation is <code>TypingSelf</code> it is converted to a type var based on:
https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/generics.html#self</p>
<p>I am naming the type var type that is created on the fly same as the class name so the type revealed shows that it's the class. Pyright for example names it <code>Self@ClassName</code> I'm not sure if that's better or not.</p>
<p>I just skipped Protocols because it had more problems and the tests was not useful.
Also I need to create a follow up PR that implicitly assumes <code>self</code> argument has type <code>Self</code>.</p>
<p>In order to infer the type in the <code>in_type_expression</code> method I needed to have scope id and semantic index available. I used the idea from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17589/files">this PR</a> to pass additional context to this method.
Also I think in all places that <code>in_type_expression</code> is called we need to have this context because <code>Self</code> can be there so I didn't split the method into one version with context and one without.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added new tests from spec.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>This test previously did not emit diagnostic but now there is a diagnostic.</p>
<pre><code>class Base:
    def __new__(cls, x: int) -&gt; Self: ...
</code></pre>
<p>I think it’s appropriate to make diagnostic?</p>
<p>mypy does it: <a href="https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=0be580f15a4fe36399738284c5c9688d">https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=0be580f15a4fe36399738284c5c9688d</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you're intending to leave this TODO for a follow-up PR, you'll need to remove a bit more of this code to make clippy happy; it doesn't like the unused <code>param</code> variable.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the way this should be handled is to assume the type <code>type[Self]</code> for the <code>cls</code> argument to <code>__new__</code> (if un-annotated), and similarly assume the type <code>Self</code> for the <code>self</code> argument, if un-annotated. If we do that, it seems like the existing constructor call specialization inference should handle this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think it matters since <code>Self</code> will never be part of the generic context of a generic class; variance only matters when determining subtyping between generic classes. So yeah, invariant is a fine default.</p>
