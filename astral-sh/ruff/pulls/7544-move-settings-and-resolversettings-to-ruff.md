# Move `Settings` and `ResolverSettings` to `ruff_workspace`

---

## Summary

## Stack Summary

This stack splits `Settings` into `FormatterSettings` and `LinterSettings` and moves it into `ruff_workspace`. This change is necessary to add the `FormatterSettings` to `Settings` without adding `ruff_python_formatter` as a dependency to `ruff_linter` (and the linter should not contain the formatter settings). 

A quick overview of our settings struct at play:

* `Options`: 1:1 representation of the options in the `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml`.  Used for deserialization.
* `Configuration`: Resolved `Options`, potentially merged from multiple configurations (when using `extend`). The representation is very close if not identical to the `Options`.
* `Settings`: The resolved configuration that uses a data format optimized for reading. Optional fields are initialized with their default values. Initialized by `Configuration::into_settings` .

The goal of this stack is to split `Settings` into tool-specific resolved `Settings` that are independent of each other. This comes at the advantage that the individual crates don't need to know anything about the other tools. The downside is that information gets duplicated between `Settings`. Right now the duplication is minimal (`line-length`, `tab-width`) but we may need to come up with a solution if more expensive data needs sharing.

This stack focuses on `Settings`. Splitting `Configuration` into some smaller structs is something I'll follow up on later. 

## PR Summary

This PR moves the `ResolverSettings` and `Settings` struct to `ruff_workspace`. `LinterSettings` remains in `ruff_linter` because it gets passed to lint rules, the `Checker` etc.

## Test Plan

`cargo test`

One followup here is that I think the paths in CONTRIBUTING.md need to be updated to reference these structs?

@samschlegel - Great catch, thanks! PR welcome or I can fix it up :)

I ran into it while reading it and I'm not entirely sure what's moved where so would probably be easier for you to do at the moment 😅

It looks like a few things are out-of-date in that section so I'll do some clean-up.
