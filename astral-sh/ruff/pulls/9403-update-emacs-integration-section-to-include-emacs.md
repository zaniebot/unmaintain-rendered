# update emacs integration section to include `emacs-ruff-format`

---

_@port19x_

## Summary

For emacs users just seeking a ruff formatter, apheleia is overkill.
Instead, a melpa package [emacs-ruff-format](https://github.com/scop/emacs-ruff-format) exists now.
This change prepends a mention of this package, without removing apheleia as an alternative.

## Test Plan

This is how I integrated ruff into my emacs.
