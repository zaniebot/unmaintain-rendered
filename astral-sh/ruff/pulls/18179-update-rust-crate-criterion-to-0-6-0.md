### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>bheisler/criterion.rs (criterion)</summary>

### [`v0.6.0`](https://redirect.github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#060---2025-05-17)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs/compare/0.5.1...0.6.0)

##### Changed

-   MSRV bumped to 1.80
-   The `real_blackbox` feature no longer has any impact. Criterion always uses `std::hint::black_box()` now.
    Users of `criterion::black_box()` should switch to `std::hint::black_box()`.
-   `clap` dependency unpinned.

##### Fixed

-   gnuplot version is now correctly detected when using certain Windows binaries/configurations that used to fail

##### Added

-   Async benchmarking with Tokio may be done via a `tokio::runtime::Handle`, not only a `tokio::runtime::Runtime`

</details>
