<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>While working on a detector for #15584, I noticed several inconsistencies in the docs, so this PR fixes them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank line between doc comment and <code>#[derive(ViolationMetadata)]</code></li>
<li>Empty doc comment before <code>#[derive(ViolationMetadata)]</code></li>
<li><code>## Fix Safety</code> instead of <code>## Fix safety</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>N/A, no functionality/tests affected</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure there's a need to change this file -- we just end up with a very small <code>Fix safety</code> section, and I think the content in that paragraph naturally fits with the content of the preceding two paragraphs. I don't think it's essential that every rule is totally consistent in the docs sections it has.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main reason I did is for the consistency - like what I've been doing, if you are writing a tool to try and detect all rules missing the section, it's a one-off edge case, since in the searching I did I could not find another rule that had this format.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Eh, fair enough. It would certainly be nice to enforce (one day...) in CI that all rules which are sometimes unsafe have a <code>Fix safety</code> section in their docs explaining why.</p>
