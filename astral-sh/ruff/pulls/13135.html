            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>~~This PR derives <code>is_macro::Is</code> on the <code>Type</code> enum, to reduce repetitiveness across our red-knot test suite. The <code>expect_*</code> methods that the macro generates for us are particularly useful for testing: we can remove quite a lot of duplication now, and I expect that we&#x27;ll have a need to add similar tests in the future.~~</p>
<p>~~<code>is-macro</code> is an existing dependency of Ruff, and I doubt we&#x27;ll be getting rid of it from Ruff anytime soon, as its use in Ruff is quite widespread.~~</p>
<p>Following discussion on this PR, it now just adds handwritten methods that are the equivalent of what <code>is-macro</code> would generate for us.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo test</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What&#x27;s the rationale for this name change?</p>
<p>Looking at https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#ad-hoc-conversions-follow-as_-to_-into_-conventions-c-conv it seems to me that if we are adding a conventional prefix here, the appropriate one would be <code>to_</code>, as this is a conversion that stays at the same level of abstraction, and also doesn&#x27;t consume <code>self</code> (<code>Type</code> is <code>Copy</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks pretty nice to me! The only part I don&#x27;t understand the reason for is the rename from <code>instance</code> to <code>into_instance</code>.</p>
<p>I know @MichaReiser has objections to <code>is-macro</code>, but I don&#x27;t understand them, so it&#x27;d probably be nice to wait for his review so we can discuss before merging.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The name of the method has to change because it now conflicts with a generated <code>instance()</code> method that deriving <code>is_macro::Is</code> adds to the class: <code>ty.instance()</code> would produce <code>Some(&lt;inner class type&gt;)</code> if <code>ty</code> was a <code>Type::Instance</code> variant, or <code>None</code> if not.</p>

<p>Ahh, good point, <code>to_</code> is the better prefix here. I&#x27;ll make that change, thanks!</p>

<p>Ah, thanks. That&#x27;s a great point and definitely worth keeping in mind. For this case specifically, I still feel like the usefulness of the generated methods outweighs that cost, especially since it&#x27;s a large enum already which is likely to continue growing as we add support for more typing features. But I absolutely agree that we should in general try to check whether we actually <em>need</em> <code>is-macro</code> on a given enum before deriving it.</p>

<p>This, and it also has the downside that I can&#x27;t search for references. E.g. find all references to <code>is_any</code> won&#x27;t work because there&#x27;s no such method that I can select in the IDE. I only recently ran into this again when searching for all usages of <code>PreviewMode.is_enabled</code> which I couldn&#x27;t. I had to remove the <code>is_macro</code> and add the method manually to find all referneces.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that the <code>is-macro</code> adds many more methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>as_*</code></li>
<li><code>as_mut_*</code></li>
<li><code>expect_*</code></li>
<li><code>*</code> (which should be named <code>into_*</code> to follow ruff&#x27;s/rust&#x27;s naming convention)</li>
</ul>
<p>I still prefer not to use the is-macro because it just got in my way in the past when it make refactors or finding references more painful at the mere benefit that adding the methods becomes cheaper. Making adding the methods cheap also comes at the downside that we don&#x27;t think about whether we want all these methods and how the methods should be named.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t block this change but I keep my preference. If you go ahead with this, please rename the take methods to <code>into_</code>. I would love to link you to some documentation but it seems the macro is entirely undocumented and it seems that renaming the <code>take</code> method isn&#x27;t possible. Which is kind of a deal breaker to me because it means that all types using the <code>is-macro</code> don&#x27;t follow our naming convention (<a href="https://docs.rs/is-macro/latest/src/is_macro/lib.rs.html#284-291">source</a>)</p>
