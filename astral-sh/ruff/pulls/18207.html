<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/453.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Add an additional info diagnostic to <code>unresolved-import</code> check to hint to users that they should make sure their Python environment is properly configured for ty, linking them to the corresponding doc. This diagnostic is only shown when an import is not relative, e.g., <code>import maturin</code> not <code>import .maturin</code>.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Updated snapshots with new info message and reran tests.</p>

<p>I'm okay with the link to the GitHub repo readme — we will want to update that to a more stable URL in the future once we have the docs hosted in a more stable place. But I don't think that needs to block this, since we'll want to do a careful vet of links when we do that anyway!</p>
