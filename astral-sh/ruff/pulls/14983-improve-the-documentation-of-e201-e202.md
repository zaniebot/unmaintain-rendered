# Improve the documentation of E201/E202

---

_Pull request opened by @DimitriPapadopoulos on 2024-12-15 13:36_

## Summary

The summary is misleading, as well as the `whitespace-after-open-bracket` and `whitespace-before-close-bracket` names - it's not only brackets, but also parentheses and braces. Align the documentation with the actual behaviour.

Don't change the names, but align the documentation with the behaviour.

## Test Plan

No test (documentation).
