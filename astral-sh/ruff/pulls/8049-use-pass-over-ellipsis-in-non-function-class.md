# Use `pass` over ellipsis in non-function/class contexts

---

_@konstin_

Split out of #8044: In preview style, ellipsis are also collapsed in non-stub files. This should only affect function/class contexts since for other statements stub are generally not used. I've updated our tests to use `pass` instead to reflect this, which makes tracking the preview style changes much easier.
