            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR updates the <code>to_overloaded</code> method to use an iterative approach instead of a recursive one.</p>
<p>Refer to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17585#discussion_r2056804587 for context.</p>
<p>The main benefit here is that it avoids calling the <code>to_overloaded</code> function in a recursive manner which is a salsa query. So, this is a bit hand wavy but we should also see less memory used because the cache will only contain a single entry which should be the entire overload chain. Previously, the recursive approach would mean that each of the function involved in an overload chain would have a cache entry. This reduce in memory shouldn't be too much and I haven't looked at the actual data for it.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Existing test cases should pass.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I thought about this when reviewing a previous PR that introduced <code>FunctionSignature</code>, but decided not to comment on it at the time because <code>CallableSignature</code> has a number of extra fields that are not useful to <code>FunctionSignature</code>, and there didn't seem to be a strong downside to having <code>FunctionSignature</code> not use <code>CallableSignature</code>. I am interested in @dhruvmanila 's thoughts here, though.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I think that could be used. Initially, I avoided that because of the additional fields that it had. There are couple of methods, specifically the <code>into_callable_type</code> on <code>FunctionType</code> and <code>BoundMethodType</code> which just requires the <code>Signature</code>s to convert the function / method into a callable type. So, the intermediary <code>CallableSignature</code> is not useful  in that case.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's a good idea. I can try in a follow-up later to remove the <code>FunctionSignature</code> if possible.</p>

<p>Actually, I realized today why I didn't opt for that - it's because <code>CallableSignature</code> requires the <code>signature_type</code> as an input when creating the struct and in <code>FunctionType::signature</code> that would always be <code>FunctionType</code> which isn't correct. For a bound method it should be <code>Type::BoundMethod</code>, for a callable type it should be <code>Type::Callable</code>, and so on.</p>
