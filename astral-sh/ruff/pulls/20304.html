            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The previous comment here indicates that this is probably not the right fix, but I don't see an immediate problem with merging legacy typevars and PEP 695 typevars in a single method, and it solves the problem with <code>self: Self</code>.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yes... I think it's invalid to combine legacy and PEP-695 type variables in general... but I think the sole exception to this rule is probably <code>Self</code>, which I <em>guess</em> counts as a &quot;legacy type variable&quot;, but is obviously different in several ways to most legacy type variables</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/#compatibility-with-traditional-typevars states that this is not legal in all situations. Maybe this indicates that implicit <code>self</code> should work differently for functions with an explicit <code>[S, T, U, …]</code> PEP 695 generic context. Maybe those functions shouldn't use <code>typing.Self</code>, but rather explicitly add a new synthetic type variable to this context: <code>[_Self: C, S, T, U, …]</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/generics.html#self">section about <code>typing.Self</code></a> doesn't seem to explicitly say one way or the other whether it's allowed in a PEP 695 generic function. I think it's worth supporting, and I think a slight modification to this approach is the right way to handle it.</p>
<p>Instead of merging the <em>entirety</em> of the legacy generic context, I would suggest looking to see if it contains (only) <code>typing.Self</code>. If so, add it to the PEP 695 generic context. If not, continue to &quot;TODO: raise a diagnostic&quot;.</p>
<p>(Note that we do have a distinct <code>TypeVarKind::TypingSelf</code> for <code>typing.Self</code>, so it should be easy to distinguish from &quot;real&quot; legacy typevars.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, I don't think the intention was to deprecate <code>typing.Self</code> as part of PEP 695. I think the PEP would have stated this explicitly if that was the intention.</p>
<p>Adding <code>Self</code> to the type system didn't make it possible to express anything in type annotations that couldn't be expressed before (except <em>maybe</em> in attribute annotations): it just made a common case much less verbose and much more ergonomic. Before you would have done this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import TypeVar

_SelfT = TypeVar(&quot;_SelfT&quot;, bound=&quot;MyClass&quot;)

class MyClass:
    def method(self: _SelfT) -&gt; SelfT:
        return self
</code></pre>
<p>and after the introduction of <code>Self</code>, you would do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Self

class MyClass:
    def method(self) -&gt; Self:
        return self
</code></pre>
<p>And the two mean exactly the same thing. The ergonomics argument for <code>Self</code> maybe isn't quite as strong for methods that use PEP-695 parameters, since there's no need to declare the type variable outside the body of the method anymore -- but I still think I'd find it a pain to have to explicitly include it in the type parameter list every time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I didn't mean to imply that PEP 695 made <code>typing.Self</code> unnecessary. I was trying to illustrate the inner workings of a type checker that encounters <code>def pep695_method[T](self, x: T)</code>. And it makes sense to me that this would be syntactic sugar for <code>def pep695_method[_Self: MyClass, T](self: _Self, x: T)</code> instead of <code>def pep605_method[T](self: typing.Self, x: T)</code>, because the former wouldn't have to mix legacy and PEP 695 type variables.</p>

<p>I don't think they're equivalent, since <code>Self</code> does something more sophisticated with the bound:</p>

<p>I don't think that behavior is right, either for <code>typing.Self</code> or for an explicit typevar -- discussed more on Discord.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Is this a distinction that matters in any practical way? Ultimately legacy and PEP 695 typevars are the same thing, the only difference is that they are declared differently -- and in the case of un-annotated <code>self</code>, there is no explicit declaration, so that sole difference disappears, too. And if explicit <code>typing.Self</code> annotations are allowed in a PEP 695 generic method signature, then the need to mix <code>typing.Self</code> with PEP 695 generic contexts exists regardless.</p>

<p>Not if <code>typing.Self</code>, <code>TypeVar(&quot;_SelfT&quot;, bound=&quot;MyClass&quot;)</code>, and <code>[_Self: MyClass]</code> all behave the same in all situations. From what I understand now, this is the case (which is a relief). I think I was maybe confused by the fact that <code>TypeVarKind::TypingSelf</code> exists, implying that it needs special treatment somehow (and @dcreager's example seemed to indicate that, but apparently that is just wrong behavior of other type checkers).</p>
