<p>Properly handles any kind of recursive inference and prevents panics.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me explain techniques for converging fixed-point iterations during recursive type inference.
There are two types of type inference that naively don't converge (causing salsa to panic): divergent type inference and oscillating type inference.</p>
<h3>Divergent type inference</h3>
<p>Divergent type inference occurs when eagerly expanding a recursive type. A typical example is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class C:
    def f(self, other: &quot;C&quot;):
        self.x = (other.x, 1)

reveal_type(C().x) # revealed: Unknown | tuple[Unknown | tuple[Unknown | tuple[..., Literal[1]], Literal[1]], Literal[1]]
</code></pre>
<p>To solve this problem, we have already introduced <code>Divergent</code> types (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20312). <code>Divergent</code> types are treated as a kind of dynamic type [^1].</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Unknown | tuple[Unknown | tuple[Unknown | tuple[..., Literal[1]], Literal[1]], Literal[1]]
=&gt; Unknown | tuple[Divergent, Literal[1]]
</code></pre>
<p>When a query function that returns a type enters a cycle, it sets <code>Divergent</code> as the cycle initial value (instead of <code>Never</code>). Then, in the cycle recovery function, it reduces the nesting of types containing <code>Divergent</code> to converge.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">0th: Divergent
1st: Unknown | tuple[Divergent, Literal[1]]
2nd: Unknown | tuple[Unknown | tuple[Divergent, Literal[1]], Literal[1]]
=&gt; Unknown | tuple[Divergent, Literal[1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Each cycle recovery function for each query should operate only on the <code>Divergent</code> type originating from that query.
For this reason, while <code>Divergent</code> appears the same as <code>Any</code> to the user, it internally carries some information: the location where the cycle occurred. Previously, we roughly identified this by having the scope where the cycle occurred, but with the update to salsa, functions that create cycle initial values ​​can now receive a <code>salsa::Id</code> (https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/pull/1012). This is an opaque ID that uniquely identifies the cycle head (the query that is the starting point for the fixed-point iteration). <code>Divergent</code> now has this <code>salsa::Id</code>.</p>
<h3>Oscillating type inference</h3>
<p>Now, another thing to consider is oscillating type inference. Oscillating type inference arises from the fact that monotonicity is broken. Monotonicity here means that for a query function, if it enters a cycle, the calculation must start from a &quot;bottom value&quot; and progress towards the final result with each cycle. Monotonicity breaks down in type systems that have features like overloading and overriding.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Base:
    def flip(self) -&gt; &quot;Sub&quot;:
        return Sub()

class Sub(Base):
    def flip(self) -&gt; &quot;Base&quot;:
        return Base()

class C:
    def __init__(self, x: Sub):
        self.x = x

    def replace_with(self, other: &quot;C&quot;):
        self.x = other.x.flip()

reveal_type(C(Sub()).x)
</code></pre>
<p>Naive fixed-point iteration results in <code>Divergent -&gt; Sub -&gt; Base -&gt; Sub -&gt; ...</code>, which oscillates forever without diverging or converging. To address this, the salsa API has been modified so that the cycle recovery function receives the value of the previous cycle (https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/pull/1012).
The cycle recovery function returns the union type of the current cycle and the previous cycle. In the above example, the result type for each cycle is <code>Divergent -&gt; Sub -&gt; Base (= Sub | Base) -&gt; Base</code>, which converges.</p>
<p>The final result of oscillating type inference does not contain <code>Divergent</code> because <code>Divergent</code> that appears in a union type can be removed, as is clear from the expansion. This simplification is performed at the same time as nesting reduction.</p>
<pre><code>T | Divergent = T | (T | (T | ...)) = T
</code></pre>
<p>[^1]: In theory, it may be possible to strictly treat types containing <code>Divergent</code> types as recursive types, but we probably shouldn't go that deep yet. (AFAIK, there are no PEPs that specify how to handle implicitly recursive types that aren't named by type aliases)</p>
<h2>Performance analysis</h2>
<p>A happy side effect of this PR is that we've observed widespread performance improvements!
This is likely due to the removal of the <code>ITERATIONS_BEFORE_FALLBACK</code> and max-specialization depth trick (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1433, https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1415), which means we reach a fixed point much sooner.</p>
<h2>Ecosystem analysis</h2>
<p>The changes look good overall.
You may notice changes in the converged values ​​for recursive types, this is because the way recursive types are normalized has been changed. Previously, types containing <code>Divergent</code> types were normalized by replacing them with the <code>Divergent</code> type itself, but in this PR, types with a nesting level of 2 or more that contain <code>Divergent</code> types are normalized by replacing them with a type with a nesting level of 1. This means that information about the non-divergent parts of recursive types is no longer lost.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># previous
tuple[tuple[Divergent, int], int] =&gt; Divergent
# now
tuple[tuple[Divergent, int], int] =&gt; tuple[Divergent, int]
</code></pre>
<p>The false positive error introduced in this PR occurs in class definitions with self-referential base classes, such as the one below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing_extensions import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;)
U = TypeVar(&quot;U&quot;)

class Base2(Generic[T, U]): ...

# TODO: no error
# error: [unsupported-base] &quot;Unsupported class base with type `&lt;class 'Base2[Sub2, U@Sub2]'&gt; | &lt;class 'Base2[Sub2[Unknown], U@Sub2]'&gt;`&quot;
class Sub2(Base2[&quot;Sub2&quot;, U]): ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is due to the lack of support for unions of MROs, or because cyclic legacy generic types are not inferred as generic types early in the query cycle.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>All samples listed in astral-sh/ty#256 are tested and passed without any panic!</p>

<p>I didn't understand this part or the semantics of the join operation.

<blockquote>

<p>For the reason stated above, I believe that simply providing a &quot;last provisional value&quot; in the cycle_recovery function will not achieve fully-converged type inference.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there is no need to set a &quot;threshold&quot; at which to give up on further type inference and switch to <code>Divergent</code> (for reasons other than performance). That's the purpose of #20566.
However, I think it's OK to merge the PR as a provisional implementation to push forward with the implementation of <code>self</code>-related features, as I can create a follow-up PR.</p>

<p>I think that leaving the decision of convergence to the user risks making inference unstable: that is, salsa users may force (or erroneously) declare convergence when it has not actually converged, leading to non-determinism.</p>

<p>Yeah, agree. But I think we can enable this functionality by comparing if the value returned by <code>Fallback</code> is identical with the last provisional and, if that's the case, consider the cycle as converged (which is true, because all queries would read exactly the same value when we iterate again).</p>

<p>I read that conversation and it's the part I don't understand. It also seems specific to return type inference because the lattice isn't monotonic. Which seems different from diverging cases that continue going forever.</p>
<p>Edit: Instead of having specific handling in many places. Could the cycle function instead:</p>
<p>If the previous value contains <code>Divergent</code>:</p>
<p>Replace all instance of <code>previous_value</code> in <code>new_value</code> with <code>Divergent</code></p>
<p>This is a no-op for <code>Divergent</code>, but should reduce <code>list[list[Divergent]]</code> to <code>list[Divergent]</code> if the previous_type was <code>list[Divergent]</code> and the new type is <code>list[list[Divergent]]</code>.</p>
<p>The change I proposed in Salsa upstream to consider a cycle head as converged when the <code>last_provisional_value == Fallback_value</code> should then mark this cycle head as converged (which might result in the entire cycle to converge, if all other cycle heads have converged too)</p>

<p>Consider inferring the return type of the following function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># 0th: Divergent (cycle_initial)
# 1st: None | tuple[Divergent]
# 2nd: None | tuple[None | tuple[Divergent]]
# ...
def div(x: int):
    if x == 0:
        return None
    else:
        return (div(x-1),)
</code></pre>
<p>If the values ​​from the previous and current cycles do not match, then the <code>cycle_recovery</code> function is called. However, no matter what replacement we make to the current value (the type cached for the next cycle) within <code>cycle_recovery</code>, it will not match the result of the next cycle. This is because if the type after replacement is <code>T</code>, the type for the next cycle will be <code>None | tuple[T]</code>. Therefore, any manipulation of the type to converge type inference must be done before the equality test.
This is why cycle_recovery handling cannot be integrated with divergence suppression handling. As already explained, suppressing oscillating type inference also needs to be done separately from <code>cycle_recovery</code>. Oscillating type inference can occur not only in function return type inference as in #17371, but also in implicit instance attribute type inference. For example, this type inference should oscillate if <code>self</code> is typed and overload resolution is implemented correctly:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import overload

class A: ...
class B(A): ...

@overload
def flip(x: B) -&gt; A: ...
@overload
def flip(x: A) -&gt; B: ...
def flip(x): ...

class C:
    def __init__(self, x: B):
        self.x = x

    def flip(self):
        # 0th: Divergent
        # 1st: B
        # 2nd: A
        # 3rd: B
        # ...
        self.x = flip(self.x)

reveal_type(C(B()).x)
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, I believe the correct approach here is to allow <code>salsa::tracked</code> to specify a <code>cycle_join</code> function as an argument, as explained in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17371#discussion_r2359458856. This function joins the previous and current values ​​before the equality check.</p>

<p>I think the new salsa version supports this now. The <code>cycle_fn</code> gets the old and new value and it can return <code>Fallback(V)</code>. If <code>V == last_provisional</code>, then salsa considers the cycle as converged (which I think is the same as you want with your join function)</p>

<p>Yes. For now I'm using https://github.com/mtshiba/salsa/tree/input_id?rev=9ea5289bc6a87943b8a8620df8ff429062c56af0, but is there a better way? There will be a lot of changes.</p>

<p>No, I don't think there's a better way. It's a breaking change that requires updating all cycle initial functions. Do you want to put up a Salsa PR (Claude's really good at updating the function signatures, but not very fast :))</p>

<p>I suspect what's happening (or at least, what we see more of) is that entire nested cycles &quot;disappear&quot; in later iterations because we converge (e.g. a <code>infer_implicit_attribute</code> on <code>Unknown</code> won't create any cycles anymore where it might have in previous iterationo where the value was a class literal)</p>

<p>It seems that there is no problem if we use a simplified union handling that does not call <code>is_redundant_with</code>, as long as it is done within <code>cycle_recovery</code> (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20566/commits/9115e40ddc854c240c283b9b3512e5e0917618c4).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The remaining problem is that if query cycles are nested, the <code>Divergent</code> type will remain even after convergence.
Here is the example:</p>
<p><code>mdtest/attributes.py</code> (simplified)</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class ManyCycles:
    def __init__(self: &quot;ManyCycles&quot;):
        self.x1 = 0
        self.x2 = 0
        self.x3 = 1

    def f1(self: &quot;ManyCycles&quot;):
        self.x1 = self.x2 + self.x3
        self.x2 = self.x1 + self.x3
        self.x3 = self.x1 + self.x2

    def f2(self: &quot;ManyCycles&quot;):
        self.x1 = self.x2 + self.x3
        self.x2 = self.x1 + self.x3
        self.x3 = self.x1 + self.x2

    def f3(self: &quot;ManyCycles&quot;):
        self.x1 = self.x2 + self.x3
        self.x2 = self.x1 + self.x3
        self.x3 = self.x1 + self.x2

        reveal_type(self.x1)  # revealed: Unknown | int
        reveal_type(self.x2)  # revealed: Unknown | int
</code></pre>
<p>But the revealed types are:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I found that these queries are in a nested cycle and are being delegated outwards.</p>
<pre><code>INFO Detected nested cycle infer_definition_types(Id(1406)), iterate it as part of the outer cycle ClassLiteral &lt; 'db &gt;::implicit_attribute_inner_(Id(8003))

</code></pre>
<p>In the current implementation, <code>Divergent</code> in the union type is assumed to be removed in the <code>cycle_recovery</code> function so that it is not exposed in convergent inference, but this handling is skipped when the cycle head moves.</p>
<p>I think that a fix for this requires changes to salsa. Here are some solutions I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a way to notify the <code>cycle_recovery</code> function that the cycle head has moved (e.g., by passing the IDs of the old inner cycle heads)</li>
<li>Specify a &quot;finalize&quot; function that will always be called after the cycle has converged</li>

<p>I somewhat suspect that this would be the case, and it shouldn't be hard to support this, other than coming up with a good API.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This seems too low-level to me.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I think a <code>finalize</code> method would be misleading because an inner cycle can't know if it has finalized. All it knows is that it has converged, but any other head participating in the same cycle might not have converged and forces another iteration.</p>
<p>I think I prefer to simply call the cycle function on every iteration, regardless if the query has converged or not. The only downside of this is that it may require comparing the value twice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once in the cycle function to decide whether some fallback logic should apply (maybe not in our case but I could see other instances where the fallback logic is expensive). This also feels a bit like a footgun for users that aren't aware that the function is called on every iteration</li>
<li>Once within <code>execute_maybe_iterate</code> to decide if the query has converged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, this seems very solvable. Would calling the cycle function on every iteration work for your case?</p>

<p>The case in which divergent type inference would actually lead to a too-many-cycles panic would be if <code>Divergent</code> were lost from the provisional value, making it impossible to track type divergence. However, my concern so far has been that <code>Divergent</code> is left behind (the cycle recovery function removes <code>Divergent</code> from the provisional value when it's not actually needed, so if execution of this function is skipped, <code>Divergent</code> will remain), and there are probably no scenarios where <code>Divergent</code> would accidentally disappear due to salsa (as long as the cycle initial function is always executed).
On the other hand, in oscillating type inference, monotonicity may be broken by skipping the execution of the cycle recovery function.</p>

<p>I guess that's exactly the part I'm worried about. If a nested cycle converges (the value and previous value are the same), then the recovery function would remove the divergent value <strong>before</strong> the outer cycle converges.</p>

<p>The recovery function only removes <code>Divergent</code> types that originate from its own query, so it will not accidentally remove <code>Divergent</code> types that originate from different cycle heads.</p>
<p>Also, the recovery function implementation does not include any part that determines whether values ​​converge.
The recovery function simply performs the following steps each time it is called:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the union of the types in the current and last provisional values</li>
<li>If a union type like <code>Divergent | T</code> exists among the provisional values, simplify it to <code>T</code></li>
<li>If a nested type containing a <code>Divergent</code> type like <code>Unknown | tuple[Unknown | tuple[Divergent, Literal[1]], Literal[1]]</code> exists among the provisional values, simplify it to <code>Unknown | tuple[Divergent, Literal[1]]</code></li>

<p>The cycle recovery function cannot remove <code>Divergent</code> types originating from other queries, as this would prevent it from detecting divergence. Also, when a query converges, if the result type contains a <code>Divergent</code> type originating from another query, it must not be removed either, as queries dependent on that query may not yet have converged.</p>

<p>It's true that all <code>Divergent</code> types must originate from cycles, but not necessarily from <em>this</em> cycle. There are recursive-type cases where the final converged type includes a <code>Divergent</code> type, and that's the best we can do (the alternative would be an infinitely-nested type.) So we can easily have, for example, a <code>list[Divergent]</code> type as the final result of some recursive list type unrelated to the current cycle, and then a query in the current cycle could index into that list and obtain the unrelated <code>Divergent</code> type, which the current cycle should not treat specially or eliminate. The <code>Divergent</code> types that should be treated specially are only those originating from the current cycle.</p>
<p>It makes sense to me (unfortunately) that we need the information from <code>CycleHeads</code>. I agree we don't want to expose too much Salsa internals, but I note that most of <code>CycleHeads</code> is only <code>pub(crate)</code>, so isn't exposed. The only thing exposed is <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/compare/master...mtshiba:salsa:expose-cycle-heads#diff-ab78fe8e8a3b757307bea73776713d03698bdeafc96cd9ab65d58ea97d24c24aR241">the new <code>ids</code> method</a>, which really is the minimum information we need to expose, I think.</p>

<p>It has to be removed on any iteration, this is how we get to the right converged value. You can see this happening in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20566#issuecomment-3497656147</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In salsa's execution model since salsa-rs/salsa#999, queries that are inner cycle heads never see the converged values ​​of outer cycle heads. Therefore, to remove <code>Divergent</code> from the output of all queries, we need to perform convergence steps on the values ​​from outer cycle heads as well.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><code>cycle_fn</code> sees the provisional value, and if it looks like <code>T | Divergent(ID associated with this cycle)</code>, it means the value has not converged (note that this &quot;convergence&quot; is a subtly different meaning from the convergence determined by salsa; what it means here is that it is possible to get closer to a more stable/simplified value from the type system's perspective. If it &quot;converges&quot; in this sense, it will also converge in the salsa sense), so we set it to <code>T</code>.
This is an operation that always guides the calculation toward convergence, and does not change the handling depending on whether or not the provisional value has converged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm asking because there are instances where a cycle head in iteration N becomes a normal cycle participant (not a head) in N+1. In which case cycle_fn is never called with two equal values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think this is a problem. Roughly speaking, cycle_fn performs cycle value normalization that is stronger than the convergence criteria required by salsa, so once salsa determines that the query has converged, cycle_fn does not need to be run again in the next iteration. This means that the change in salsa-rs/salsa#1021 (performing <code>recover_from_cycle</code> regardless of whether the values ​​have converged) was not actually necessary in this case...</p>

<p>Inner cycles should see the converged value from the outer-most cycle in the very last iteration.</p>
<p>I'm not able to come up with an example from the top of my head but I wonder if it's possible to end up with <code>Divergent | Divergent</code> types similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20566#issuecomment-3492424559, for example, when a variable depends on the output of two separate queries that both are divergent (but aren't part of the same cycle).

<p>I can see how this is useful but we should maybe reconsider the <code>cycle_fn</code> API overall. Its ergonomics is very poor with the amount of arguments it has and I still don't think we should expose the <code>CycleHeads</code> type.

<p>I can see how this is useful but we should maybe reconsider the <code>cycle_fn</code> API overall. Its ergonomics is very poor with the amount of arguments it has and I still don't think we should expose the <code>CycleHeads</code> type. I don't mind exposing the <code>ids</code> but I rather not expose <code>CycleHeads</code> directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can store all arguments in a single struct using the following way.
First, define the following trait and struct in salsa:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub trait TrackedFn {
    type DbView: ?Sized + crate::Database;
    type Input&lt;'db&gt;: Send + Sync;
    type Output&lt;'db&gt;: Send + Sync;
}

pub struct CycleRecoveryContext&lt;'db, 'c, 'l, F: TrackedFn&gt; {
    pub db: &amp;'db F::DbView,
    pub cycle_head_ids: CycleHeadIdsIterator&lt;'c&gt;, // Iterator that returns only `Id`s from `CycleHeads`
    pub last_provisional_value: &amp;'l F::Output&lt;'db&gt;,
    pub value: F::Output&lt;'db&gt;,
    pub iteration: u32,
    pub input: F::Input&lt;'db&gt;,
}

pub trait Configuration: Any {
    type TrackedFn: TrackedFn;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>When setting up the tracked function, generate the following code to implement <code>TrackedFn</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">$vis struct $fn_name {
    _priv: std::convert::Infallible,
}
impl salsa::plumbing::function::TrackedFn for $fn_name {
    type DbView = dyn $Db;
    type Input&lt;'db&gt; = ($($interned_input_ty),*);
    type Output&lt;'db&gt; = $output_ty;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, pass <code>CycleRecoveryContext</code> to <code>C::recover_from_cycle</code>. cycle_fn receives the value through the parameter of type <code>CycleRecoveryContext&lt;'db, '_, '_, fn_name&gt;</code> (this works fine, even though we need to define a cycle recovery function before using the <code>tracked</code> macro).</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that it simply doesn't work for tracked methods. So, for example, we can define a submodule like the following to provide pseudo-access to the method, but it seems a bit hacky.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod __salsa { // some fresh name
    pub mod Type {
        pub struct method {}
    }
}

CycleRecoveryContext&lt;'db, '_, '_, __salsa::Type::method&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I considered a <code>Context</code> too but I think the lifetimes and many generics don't make for a very ergonomic API. For me, the main goal is to avoid that exposing more information to the cycle function isn't a breaking API change in the future. That's why I'm leaning towards something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn cycle_fn(db: &amp;dyn Db, value: T, cycle: &amp;CycleInformation&lt;T&gt;, input: Type) -&gt; Type {
	
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>CycleInformation</code> exposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>previous_value</code></li>
<li><code>query_id</code> (or just id?)</li>
<li><code>heads</code> (or <code>head_ids</code>): The ids of all cycles including <code>id</code></li>
<li><code>iteration</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Or the following if we want to avoid any generics</p>
<pre><code>fn cycle_fn(db: &amp;dyn Db, value: T, previous_value: &amp;T, cycle: &amp;CycleInformation, input: Type) -&gt; Type {

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do we also need to ensure monotonicity between <code>Undefined</code> and <code>Defined</code>? We have seen oscillation examples before (for instance attributes) that oscillate between <code>Undefined</code> and <code>Defined</code>. For example:</p>

class C:
    def __init__(self, other: &quot;C&quot;):

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was reconsidering the problem while looking at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19579, and I think we might be able to use the mechanism introduced in this PR to improve our reachability analysis.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, we currently set the truthiness of places that aren't definitely-bound to <code>Ambiguous</code>, which guarantees convergence for the definedness of places. However, there is a slight downside to this approach. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def _(flag: bool):
    if flag:
        ALWAYS_TRUE_IF_BOUND = True

    # error: [possibly-unresolved-reference] &quot;Name `ALWAYS_TRUE_IF_BOUND` used when possibly not defined&quot;
    if True and ALWAYS_TRUE_IF_BOUND:
        x = 1
    else:
        x = 2

    reveal_type(x) # should be: Literal[1]
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, we infer <code>x: Literal[1, 2]</code>, but logically <code>Literal[1]</code> is better. This is because if <code>ALWAYS_TRUE_IF_BOUND</code> were not defined, an error would occur and the <code>x = 2</code> branch would never be executed anyway.
The new cycle recovery mechanism can merge the definedness of the current cycle's <code>Place</code> with the previous cycle's <code>Place</code>, allowing us to unambiguously determine the reachability of a definition while maintaining convergence.
In fact, in #20566 I confirmed that <code>static_expression_truthiness</code> no longer causes a panic even without the use of <code>all_places_definitely_bound</code>.</p>
<p>However, this presents another issue.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Literal

class Toggle:
    def __init__(self: &quot;Toggle&quot;):
        if not self.x:
            self.x: Literal[True] = True

reveal_type(Toggle().x) # should be: Literal[True]
</code></pre>
<p><code>Toggle().x</code> should be <code>Literal[True]</code>, but with the above change, it was inferred to be <code>Literal[True] | Unknown</code>.
After investigating why this was happening, I found that it was because <code>Literal</code> was inferred to be <code>Never</code>. The branch with <code>self.x: Literal[True] = True</code> was considered to be unreachable in a cycle, so the type annotation in that branch became <code>Never</code>. If we make a change like the one above, we should also make changes so that annotations in the unreachable code are not inferred to be <code>Never</code>.</p>
<p>In any case, this seems like something to consider after the merge, rather than something that should be done in this PR.</p>

<p>This can actually happen.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class ManyCycles:
    def __init__(self: &quot;ManyCycles&quot;):
        self.x1 = [0]
        self.x2 = [1]
        self.x3 = [1]

    def f1(self: &quot;ManyCycles&quot;):
        reveal_type(self.x3)  # revealed: Unknown | list[Unknown | int] | list[Divergent] | list[Divergent]

        self.x1 = [self.x2] + [self.x3]

        self.x2 = self.x1 + self.x3
        self.x3 = self.x1 + self.x2
</code></pre>
<p>This may seem like a strange type to users, but <code>list[Divergent(a)] | list[Divergent(b)]</code> should behave equivalently to <code>list[Unknown]</code> as a dynamic type, so as you say, this is just a UX issue rather than a bug. For reference, the result of pyright is also ugly (<code>list[int] | list[list[list[list[int] | list[list[list[list[int] | Unknown]] | Unknown]] | Unknown</code>).
To fix this, we could combine <code>Divergent</code>s of different origins into a single <code>Divergent</code> with multiple <code>Id</code>s (<code>list[Divergent(a)] | list[Divergent(b)] =&gt; list[Divergent(a, b)]</code>).
I personally think this is not a high priority and should be a TODO task.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think most of the issues have been resolved. The remaining issue is this:</p>
<p><code>mdtest/generic/legacy/classes.md</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pyi"># pyi

from typing_extensions import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar(&quot;T&quot;)

# TODO: no error &quot;Unsupported class base with type `&lt;class 'list[Derived[T@Derived]]'&gt; | &lt;class 'list[@Todo(specialized non-generic class)]'&gt;`&quot;
# error: [unsupported-base]
class Derived(list[Derived[T]], Generic[T]): ...
</code></pre>
<p>~~The reason <code>@Todo(specialized non-generic class)</code> appears is because the generic context of <code>Derived</code> may become <code>None</code> in a cycle.
<code>(inherited_)legacy_generic_context</code> extracts <code>Generic[T]</code> or type aliases from <code>explicit_bases</code>, but if there is a self-referential class in the base classes, all base classes will become <code>Divergent</code> and the type variables cannot be extracted.~~</p>
<p>The problem is probably unioning with values ​​from the previous cycle.
In the first cycle, <code>explicit_bases</code> calculates that <code>&lt;class 'list[@Todo(specialized non-generic class)]'&gt;</code> is one of the bases of <code>Derived</code>. This is the same behavior as main. In the next cycle, this base can be correctly inferred to <code>&lt;class 'list[Derived[T]]'&gt;</code>, but in #20566, cycle normalization takes a union with the type from the previous cycle, so the base becomes <code>&lt;class 'list[Derived[T]]'&gt; | &lt;class 'list[@Todo]'&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>cycle normalization takes a union with the type from the previous cycle</p>

<p>It seems like maybe we could address this with a targeted fix in the cycle recovery for <code>explicit_bases</code> query? For class literal types we could skip unioning, or union the type parameters instead if the outer type is the same and the outer type is covariant in its type parameters? Not sure on details, would need to experiment.</p>

<p>I feel like this issue and the &quot;unsupported-class-base&quot; issue discussed elsewhere are both symptoms of the same problem, which is that creating a union type in fixpoint iteration where a union would otherwise be unexpected can cause undesirable side effects. I wonder if we can address this as follow-up with more intelligent unioning -- like perhaps when the outer generic type is the same we should union the type arguments instead?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see many other <code>recursive_type_normalized_impl</code> methods that just propagate downwards whatever <code>nested</code> value they receive, and always propagate <code>None</code> upwards. But here we always propagate <code>nested=true</code> downwards, and only propagate <code>None</code> upwards if we were already nested. It's not clear to me why properties are different from some other types (like bound super, or tuples, or ...) in this regard. Can we add some documentation explaining more clearly how we should determine what behavior a <code>recursive_type_normalized_impl</code> method should have?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like we don't use the fully-expanded type here at all, unless it is <code>Divergent</code> (i.e. we found the type alias to be cyclic). Do we need a type-mapping (type transformation) and diverging Salsa fixpoint iteration in order to achieve this detection? Could we instead use a a simple type-visit (with cycle detection) which expands aliases, and track in the visitor whether we ever encountered a cycle?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These types send <code>nested=true</code> downwards instead of simply <code>nested</code> -- but in this case they propagate <code>None</code> upwards regardless of the outer <code>nested</code> value. So that's now three different behaviors I've seen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send <code>nested</code> downward as-is, always propagate <code>None</code> upward.</li>
<li>Send <code>nested=true</code> downward, always propagate <code>None</code> upward.</li>
<li>Send <code>nested=true</code> downward, send <code>None</code> upward if called nested, otherwise replace <code>None</code> with <code>div</code>.</li>

<p>Currently, ty infers <code>x.foo()</code> as <code>Unknown</code> (and claims that <code>Foo[int]</code> is an invalid type expression), while mypy and pyright can infer it as <code>int</code>.
Perhaps some kind of warning should be reported for such hacky code, but since the user's intent is clear and we have the ability to infer it, we can consider that we should do so.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also think this method is a bit over-engineered if we just want to check the divergence of type aliases.</p>
<p>One future direction I consider is that <code>expand_eagerly</code> would allow us to infer recursive type aliases a bit more intelligently, like the following code (although this type alias itself should probably be reported as invalid):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># TODO: this should probably be a cyclic-type-alias-definition error
type Foo[T] = list[T] | Bar[T]
type Bar[T] = int | Foo[T]

def _(x: Bar[int]):
    # currently: int | list[int] | Any
    reveal_type(x) # revealed: int | list[int]

<p>This means, when expanding a type alias, first expand recursively, and if it diverges, call <code>value_type</code> as a fallback.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nominal types such as <code>list[T]</code> and <code>tuple[T]</code> should send <code>nested=true</code> for <code>T</code>. This is absolutely necessary for normalization.
Structural types such as union and intersection do not need to send <code>nested=true</code>; that is, types that are &quot;flat&quot; from the perspective of recursive types. <code>T | U</code> should send <code>nested</code> for <code>T</code>, <code>U</code>.</p>
<p>For other types, the decision depends on whether they are interpreted as nominal or structural.
For example, <code>KnownInstanceType::UnionType</code> should simply send <code>nested</code>. You can confirm that mdtest fails when you send <code>nested=true</code> for <code>value_expr_types</code>.
I haven't found any problematic cases for other types, but they can be interpreted as nominal, so <code>nested=true</code> should be sent.
At the very least, sending <code>nested=true</code> ensures that <code>Divergent</code> remains, so it's safe operation. With <code>nested=false</code>, <code>Divergent</code> may be eliminated.</p>

<p>A basic principle of fixed-point iteration calculations is that errors should not be reported unnecessarily early in the cycle when sufficient information has not yet been gathered.
If <code>in_function_overload_or_abstractmethod</code> is <code>false</code>, additional checks will be performed and an error may be reported.
A natural implementation would therefore be to set <code>in_function_overload_or_abstractmethod</code> to <code>true</code> early in the cycle, and defer the decision to subsequent cycles until more detailed function information has been gathered.</p>
