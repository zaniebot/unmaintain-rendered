# docs(configuration): replace `extend-exclude` with `exclude`

---

_Pull request opened by @mkniewallner on 2023-10-28 14:28_

## Summary

Similarly to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8302, the configuration documentation mentions `extend-exclude` for tool specific configuration, although neither `format` nor `lint` supports it, since they only support `exclude`.
