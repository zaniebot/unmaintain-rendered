            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>One of the motivations in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16428 for panicking when the <code>test</code> or <code>debug_assertions</code> features are enabled and a lookup of a <code>KnownClass</code> fails is that we've had some latent bugs in our code where certain variants have been silently falling back to <code>Unknown</code> in every typeshed lookup without us realising. But that in itself isn't a great motivation for panicking in <code>KnownClass::to_instance()</code>, since we can fairly easily add some tests that assert that we don't unexpectedly fallback to <code>Unknown</code> for any <code>KnownClass</code> variant. This PR adds those tests.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Doesn't really matter, but it seems like it would be simpler and more robust just to unconditionally set the version each time through the loop, to the version-added for that class. Does that add noticeable runtime?</p>

<p>nah, not at all. Not sure what I was thinking there, that's obviously simpler! Thanks!</p>
