# Improve display of `assert_public_ty` assertion failures

While working on https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13576 I noticed that it was really hard to tell which assertion failed in some of these test cases. This could be expanded to elsewhere, but I've heard this test suite format won't be around for long?
