<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Noticed there was a wrong tip on the Contributing guide, <code>cargo benchmark lexer</code> wouldn't run any benches.
Probably a missed update on #9535</p>
<p>It may make sense to remove the <code>cargo benchmark</code> command from the guide altogether, but up to the mantainers.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->
