# Introduce `SourceCodeSlice` to reduce the size of `FormatElement`

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

This PR renames the `FormatElement::SyntaxTokenSlice` to `FormatElement::SourceCodeSlice` and changes its internal representation to reduce the size of `FormatElement` from 32 to 24 bytes. 

The `SourceCodeSlice` only stores the `TextRange` into the source code in production builds. Now, this isn't much fun for debugging. That's why the `SourceCodeSlice` includes the slice's text in debug builds (expensive, but... it's a debug build). 

Only storing the range now requires passing the `SourceText` to the printer. The downside is that you could pass an incorrect `SourceText` to the printer, resulting in it panicking when slicing the text (we could decide to Err instead but I don't think it's worth it). I think this is generally hard because the formatter infrastructure calls the printer for you and tests ensure that it passes the right source code. 

I plan to reuse `SyntaxTokenSlice` for the extracted comments, which is why I was working on this now (but I admin, the `FormatElement` size regression compared to rome bothered me for a long time. So I'm glad that I finally had the opportunity to fix it). 

Now, the biggest downside is that `ASTFormatContext` now requires a lifetime. We could get around that for now by copying the source to a `String` but I'm convinced that we need the lifetime soon anyway, when we store the comments on the context that reference AST nodes. 

## Test Plan

I added a few new unit tests, particularly ensuring that `Document.display()` works correctly. 

## Alternatives

I considered implementing my own `Rc<[str]>` that stores the text range in the heap allocation (storing the ref count and range before the start of the slice) . That would provide a very convenient API without the divergence between release and debug builds nor would we have to pass the source text around. The reason I decided against it are:

* Building my own `Rc<[]>` sounds more complicated.
* We would still need to copy the source from a `str` to the `Rc`, which we can now avoid. 

Using different representations between release and debug builds is also not entirely new. We already do this for `GroupId`s and `LabelId`:

* Release: 
  * `GroupId`: Stores the unique id of the group
  * `LabelId`: Stores the unique `TypeId` 
* Debug: 
  * `GroupId`: Stores the unique id with a debug name because it's annoying to match group by ids without knowing there conceptual meaning 
  * `LabelId`: Stores the unique `TypeId` together with the type name

The difference is that the `name`s are static strings, but that's a luxury that we don't have here.

These are mainly optimizations to avoid searching the string for newlines in release builds. It makes the API a bit more cumbersome to use but it's good for performance because we almost always know whether a token contains new lines

I feel like `ASTFormatContext` required a lifetime originally and we removed it -- is that right?

Sorry, nit, but I think this should be `ContainsNewlines` (we treat it as a single word elsewhere in this crate).
