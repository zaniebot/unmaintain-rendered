<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>While reading the docs I noticed this paragraph on <code>PERF401</code>. It was added in the same PR that the bug with <code>:=</code> was fixed, #15050, but don't know why it was added. The fix should already take care of adding the parenthesis, so having this paragraph in the docs is just confusing since it sounds like the user has to do something.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>N/A, no tests/functionality affected</p>
