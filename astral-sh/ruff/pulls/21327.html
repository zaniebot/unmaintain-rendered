<p>This does increase the walltime benchmark runtime by ~2min (from ~8 to ~10 and ~9 to ~11min). I do find the profile's useful when investigating a regression (to get a first impression of where it might be coming from).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel like we must have had very different experiences when investigating ty performance regressions 😆</p>
<p>To me, the benefits still don't seem worth the cost here. I've found the codspeed flamegraphs very useful when investigating Ruff performance regressions, but I can't recall a time when I've found they've given me any useful information regarding a ty performance regression -- and all our walltime benchmarks are ty benchmarks. A 2-minute increase in CI times is a pretty significant increase, meanwhile.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I used my watch to stop the time, it's 1min and 20s. I agree, that's somewhat significant.</p>

<p>I agree that they're less useful but they often give me at least an idea where a regression comes from when reviewing another PR without having to clone it and do some local profiling.</p>
