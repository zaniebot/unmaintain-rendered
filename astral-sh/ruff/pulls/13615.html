<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR introduces a new enumeration <code>BuiltinType</code> that serves 2 purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>df16f218aaa40f319fc6dd3eaddefdc7c3b5bfb0: give a common syntax for the convenience shortcuts to get a builtin instance<ul>
<li>For that purpose, the enum doesn't need to be exhaustive - just to have the types we often need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>c98ce748f74841eabe73eb1f4dbc77f83454e5f0: save if a class is a builtin on creation, to save time on call when we need to check for custom behaviour (<code>str(...)</code>, <code>bool(...)</code>, ...)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think for the first purpose that's mainly a syntax preference, you should be able to tell fairly fast if you prefer it that way.
For the second, that's mainly an optimisation that we might need once we handle more specific behaviour for <code>builtin</code> used as callable - this could clearly wait until we implement more of those.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>No tests were added, but the existing test suite is enough to check if this introduced a regression.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Naming nit: let's rename this to <code>BuiltinClass</code>. This actually only handles classes, not all kinds of types (functions are types too).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I kinda want to unify this PR and <code>FunctionKind</code>, in terms of both naming and API. The one trick there is that we want to represent known functions that aren't actually builtins (e.g. <code>reveal_type</code>). The same may be true in future for other stdlib classes!</p>
<p>So maybe ultimately what we'll actually want is <code>KnownClass</code> and <code>KnownFunction</code> enums, and a <code>known</code> field (which is an <code>Option&lt;KnownClass&gt;</code> or <code>Option&lt;KnownFunction&gt;</code> - I like this Option approach better than <code>FunctionKind::Ordinary</code>), and <code>is_known</code> method, on both <code>ClassType</code> and <code>FunctionType</code>. But this would require generalizing what you have in this PR to not assume builtins module, and instead classify the known functions/classes by module as well. I would be happy with doing all of this now, in this PR, or waiting on it if you prefer to land a simpler version of this PR for now.</p>
<p>cc @AlexWaygood in case you hate my naming/API preferences :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't like the name of this method currently because it implies that if it returns <code>None</code> the class is not a builtin. But that's not necessarily true, since our list of known builtins isn't exhaustive. I'd prefer <code>maybe_known_builtin</code>. Or just <code>maybe_known</code> if we go with the broader refactor/rename to handle any known class, even if it's not a builtin.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I considered the pros and cons of <code>Option&lt;KnownFunction&gt;</code> vs having <code>FunctionKind::Ordinary</code> while working on my previous PR. I ended up going with <code>FunctionKind::Ordinary</code> because I have a general preference having a flat list of possible states rather than representing possible states using an enum of enums. It makes it easier to count exactly how many possible states there are, and giving the default state a name (<code>Ordinary</code>) rather than using <code>None</code> makes it abundantly clear to new readers of the code what the default state represents. It's also more ergonomic to pattern-match on a flat list rather than a nested enum.</p>
<p>I don't feel <em>too</em> strongly, but a flat enum would be my preference :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think clearer naming is the primary reason I prefer <code>Option&lt;KnownFunction&gt;</code>. I don't like the name <code>FunctionKind</code> because it is so unnecessarily generic -- it doesn't clarify anything at all about what characteristic(s) of the function we are actually talking about. What happens when we later need to categorize functions according to some totally different cross-cutting categorization?</p>
<p>It seems clearer to me to have <code>known = Some(KnownFunction)</code> mean it's a known function (and then the enum specifies which one), and <code>known = None</code> to mean &quot;not a known function.&quot; I suppose we could still use the <code>KnownFunction</code> name and have <code>KnownFunction::NotKnown</code> or <code>KnownFunction::None</code> -- it just seems weird to me to have a variant of <code>KnownFunction</code> that means... not a known function.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, you're definitely right that <code>FunctionKind</code> is not a great name. And I think you're right that renaming it to <code>KnownFunction</code> addresses some of the concern I had that it wouldn't be obvious what the default state signified. When it's called <code>KnownFunction</code>, it's pretty obvious that <code>None</code> indicates that it's not a known function!</p>
<p>I'm still not a massive fan of nested enums, but I guess in this case it's <em>okay</em>. Feel free to proceed :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Completely agree. I think I like this <code>known</code> prefix - what would you think of also adding it to the type we store internally?
I'm overall afraid that a new reader would come - see a builtin field - and trust that it covers all existing builtins</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, if you're up for it I think it would be ideal to go ahead and make the switch to both <code>KnownClass</code> and <code>KnownFunction</code> enums in this PR, with <code>ClassType</code> having a field <code>known: Option&lt;KnownClass&gt;</code> and a method <code>is_known</code>, and similar for <code>FunctionType</code>.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah. @carljm, I think this might actually reveal a bug in <code>main</code>. The union of <code>Literal[True] | Literal[False]</code> should surely simplify to <code>Instance(&quot;bool&quot;)</code> rather than <code>Class(&quot;bool&quot;)</code>. If an object has type <code>Literal[True]</code>, it indicates that it the object is an instance of <code>bool</code>, not that it is the <code>bool</code> class itself.</p>
<p>The fact that the new idiom in this PR makes this bug more obvious is definitely a point in favour of us landing it @Slyces!!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: I'd probably add the other &quot;fundamental&quot; types in this list (<code>types.ModuleType</code>, <code>types.FunctionType</code>, <code>_typeshed.NoneType</code> and <code>builtins.type</code>) to the <code>KnownClass</code> enum as well, and take <code>typing.Any</code> out of the enum for now</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this feels a bit repetitive, and it also feels like we're doing some work that isn't always necessary depending on what <code>self</code> is. Maybe something like this?</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">        let is_stdlib_module = module.search_path().is_standard_library();
        let module_name = module.name().as_str();
        match self {
            Self::Any =&gt; is_stdlib_module &amp;&amp; matches!(module_name, &quot;typing&quot; | &quot;typing_extensions&quot;)
            _ =&gt; is_stdlib_module &amp;&amp; module_name == &quot;builtins&quot;,
        }
</code></pre>
<p>I'd actually also prefer it if we tediously enumerated all the builtin classes rather than using <code>_</code> as a fallback branch. If we do it that way then the compiler will warn us when we add a new non-builtins variant but forget to update this method, which would lead to incorrect results.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wish Rust had some way of enforcing that the r.h.s. of a match statement is meant to be exhaustive :/ I guess that's what you were going for with your initial <code>EnumIter</code> solution from <code>strum</code>. But I agree with Dhruv that it's probably not really worth an extra dependency.</p>
<p>If this enum continues to grow and this becomes a maintenance problem, I guess we could consider writing a macro to generate this method, which would allow us to ensure that the r.h.s. of the <code>match</code> is exhaustive. But that comes with its own tradeoffs, of course.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stdlib/_typeshed"><code>_typeshed</code> module</a> is a fictitious module that typeshed pretends is part of the standard library. Because typeshed pretends it's part of the stdlib, and we treat typeshed's stubs as the sole source of truth for the stdlib, we think it's part of the stdlib too!</p>
<p>The purpose of the <code>_typeshed</code> module is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>to define various convenient aliases and protocols that don't exist at runtime but which are used extensively in typeshed's stubs for the stdlib. These need to be defined in a stdlib module, because typeshed's stubs for the stdlib can't depend on any non-stdlib stubs.</li>
<li>to define certain compatibility workarounds for type checkers (that's us!) to use. <code>_typeshed.NoneType</code> <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/fc611d94c8edf225df33c8ccf66a62e6f4894679/stdlib/_typeshed/__init__.pyi#L304-L311">is an example of this</a>. At runtime, the type of <code>None</code> is <code>types.NoneType</code>, but <code>types.NoneType</code> was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.NoneType">only added in 3.10</a>. We can't use that as the type of <code>None</code>, as we still support Python 3.8 and 3.9, and all other type checkers also have this problem -- so typeshed defines <code>_typeshed.NoneType</code> as a little compatibility hack for us.</li>

<p>So, small question on the topic. I see that we have methods to lookup <code>typing_extensions</code>, but nothing from <code>typing</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that's for a very similar reason! There's some symbols that only exist in <code>typing</code> on some versions of Python, but exist in <code>typing_extensions</code> on all versions of Python. That means that it's usually better for a type checker to look things up in <code>typing_extensions</code> rather than <code>typing</code>, since <code>typing_extensions</code> re-exports all symbols from <code>typing</code>, and typeshed <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/stdlib/typing_extensions.pyi">pretends <code>typing_extensions</code> is part of the stdlib</a>. (I <em>promise</em> typeshed doesn't do this for <em>loads</em> of modules... only <code>_typeshed</code> and <code>typing_extensions</code>!!)</p>
