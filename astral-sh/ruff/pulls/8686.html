            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I'm struggling a bit to figure out what might be in-scope, and what not</p>
<p>For the respective numpy rules, it looks like the changes are backwards compatible - <code>np.round_</code> gets autofixed to <code>np.round</code>, but both have been around for years, whereas the Polars deprecations here were only introduced quite recently and the deprecated names will be removed relatively soon - so, these fixes would only be useful for a brief amount of time</p>
<p>Still, it's been useful to learn a bit about Ruff</p>
<p>I think I'll pivot back towards the kinds of rules discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7721, as those will likely be useful for the foreseeable future</p>
<p>Will try to update soon-ish!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>closing this for now, but I'm giving a go at some polars rewrites in polars-upgrade, once that's a bit more upstream / battle-tested I'll what if might make sense to contribute here</p>
