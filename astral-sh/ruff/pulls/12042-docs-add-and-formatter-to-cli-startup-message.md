# docs: add `and formatter` to CLI startup message

---

_Pull request opened by @baggiponte on 2024-06-26 09:54_

## Summary

The PR adds a small `and code formatter` to the display message when you run `ruff` on your CLI, to match the repo description.

## Test Plan

No tests since it's just "docs". But I'd be glad to review/change/build it and see how it behaves when run locally.
