<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>All the following if cases have the same semantic meaning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">x = 5

if 4 &lt; x and x &lt; 7:
    ...

if x &gt; 4 and x &lt; 7:
    ...

if x &gt; 4 and 7 &gt; x:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>However, the <code>boolean-chained-comparison</code> rule currently only spots the first case, even though all of them could be simplified by comparison chaining.</p>
<p>This PR implements a detection mechanism for the missing cases, however it does not implement quick fixes for them since this turned out to be quite difficult.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I've added new test case snapshots and compared the behavior to <code>pylint</code>.</p>
