Summary


<p>First contribution so please let me know if I&#x27;ve made a mistake anywhere. This was aimed to fix #19982, it adds the isolation level to PYI021 to in the same style as the PIE790 rule.</p>
<p>fixes: #19982</p>
Test Plan


<p>I added a case to the PYI021.pyi file where the two rules are present as there wasn&#x27;t a case with them both interacting, using the minimal reproducible example that @ntBre created on the issue (I think I got the <code># ERROR</code> markings wrong, so please let me know how to fix that if I did).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome, thanks for working on this! One note, I believe the <code># ERROR</code> comments in that file are just to make reviewing snapshots a little easier and don&#x27;t actually activate the rules. The file <code>PYI021.pyi</code> is used as one of the <code>test_case</code>s in this test:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/39f7a876d6aceedc3db4e3d63250d78bbb830fc2/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_pyi/mod.rs#L130-L139</p>
<p>so only PYI021 is active still:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/39f7a876d6aceedc3db4e3d63250d78bbb830fc2/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_pyi/mod.rs#L39</p>
<p>I think you&#x27;ll probably want to create a copy of this test function and enable both the rules. Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    #[test_case(Path::new(&quot;PYI021.pyi&quot;))]
    fn pyi021_pie790_empty_function(path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
        let diagnostics = test_path(
            Path::new(&quot;flake8_pyi&quot;).join(path).as_path(),
            &amp;settings::LinterSettings::for_rules([Rule::DocstringInStub, Rule::UnnecessaryPlaceholder]),
        )?;
        assert_diagnostics!(diagnostics);
        Ok(())
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could just hard-code the path in this case since I doubt we&#x27;ll need multiple <code>test_case</code>s :) It might also make sense to use a separate <code>pyi</code> file from the main <code>PYI021.pyi</code> case, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a big deal either way, up to you.</p>
<p>I think your fix is likely still correct, but this will make sure we&#x27;re testing the right thing!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ll take a look. <code>Isolation</code> may not be enough. We may need to check explicitly (in one or both rules) that we&#x27;re not leaving an empty function body. That might be a good separate test to try, or check if we already have some. Do the rules individually suggest deleting the last statement in a function?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah sorry, this might actually be trickier than I expected. PYI021 only looks at the deferred definitions after the AST has been traversed, so <code>checker.semantic().current_statement_id()</code> is returning <code>None</code>. That explains why <code>Isolation</code> isn&#x27;t working. But both rules try to check that they aren&#x27;t deleting the last statement in a definition, so <code>Isolation</code> also still seems like the right fix. I&#x27;m just not seeing a way to get a real <code>NodeId</code> to pass to <code>Checker::isolation</code> from a <code>Definition</code> or docstring literal.</p>
<p>We may have to move PYI021&#x27;s check into the same phase of analysis as PIE790, which would be a bit more involved.</p>

add both rules to a <code>IsolationLevel::Group</code> then look instead of getting the <code>current_statement_id</code> get something like the <code>current_scope</code> or something like that, does that sound reasonable?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, I don&#x27;t mean to leave you hanging on this, I&#x27;m just not quite sure the best approach yet either. I don&#x27;t think I mentioned this above, but I even tried something like this method added to our <code>SemanticModel</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    pub fn statement_id(&amp;self, stmt: &amp;ast::Stmt) -&gt; Option&lt;NodeId&gt; {
        self.nodes.iter().find(|node| self.statement(*node) == stmt)
    }
</code></pre>
<p>without much luck. Basically your idea sounds right to me, and is what I expected the fix to be too, but I&#x27;m not sure if it works with the way we&#x27;re traversing the AST or calling this rule.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t feel any pressure to keep working on this, I&#x27;ll try to take another look at some point too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey no worries - I can see you&#x27;re pretty busy on a load of other PRs!</p>
<p>I&#x27;m happy to keep tweaking and chipping away at ideas, it&#x27;s a good opportunity for me to get familiar with more of the codebase.</p>
<p>Out of interest what <code>Stmt</code> are you passing into this method?</p>
<pre><code>    pub fn statement_id(&amp;self, stmt: &amp;ast::Stmt) -&gt; Option&lt;NodeId&gt; {
        self.nodes.iter().find(|node| self.statement(*node) == stmt)
    }

<p>Maybe passing the statement that holds the ellipsis expression could work?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve had a play, I added the method you shared. After running <code>dbg!</code> on all of the statements in the <code>docstring_in_stubs</code>, they all seem to be returning None.</p>
<p>The fact that the <code>self.node_id</code> is None makes me agree with you that we should move the rule itself to the same point where the other rule is triggered, but that causes issues in that the function signature will need to change because the function that calls <code>unnecessary_placeholder</code> uses <code>suite: &amp;[Stmt]</code> whereas the other one uses <code>definition: &amp;Definition</code></p>
<p>I think that the self.node_id is always None because it&#x27;s being called after the ast has finished traversing?</p>
<pre><code>[crates/ruff_python_semantic/src/model.rs:1414:9] &amp;self.node_id = None
[crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_pyi/rules/docstring_in_stubs.rs:65:5] checker.semantic().statement_id(&amp;statements[0]) = None
[crates/ruff_python_semantic/src/model.rs:1414:9] &amp;self.node_id = None
[crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_pyi/rules/docstring_in_stubs.rs:66:5] checker.semantic().statement_id(&amp;statements[1]) = None
[crates/ruff_python_semantic/src/model.rs:1414:9] &amp;self.node_id = None

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That all sounds right to me. I think the best course of action is to move it to the earlier analysis phase, while we&#x27;re still traversing the AST, like <code>PIE790</code>. I was quite hesitant to do that earlier, but I think it won&#x27;t be too bad after looking again today. We should still be able to call <code>docstring_from</code> on just a <code>&amp;[Stmt]</code>, which we have access to in that phase:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bbfcf6e111648052783bdb68ec71706fc69b714f/crates/ruff_linter/src/docstrings/extraction.rs#L6-L8</p>
<p>and the only reason we pass a <code>Definition</code> to <code>PYI021</code> is also to extract its <code>&amp;[Stmt]</code>.</p>
<p>So this rule actually seems to fit nicely into <code>analyze::suite</code> next to <code>PIE790</code>:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bbfcf6e111648052783bdb68ec71706fc69b714f/crates/ruff_linter/src/checkers/ast/analyze/suite.rs#L9-L12</p>

<p>I moved <code>in_protocol_or_abstract_method</code> to the semantic model itself because I thought I might need to check it in PYI021 but didn&#x27;t need it in the end so can move it back if you want although I think it makes more sense as a method than a free function</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This docstring seems slightly misleading since the snapshot shows it trying to fix both diagnostics 😄</p>
<p>In testing this locally in the CLI, the net effect is that we still emit both diagnostics when checking, but the isolation level means only the first diagnostic actually gets fixed. Since we sort by diagnostic range, that means PYI021 gets fixed and PIE790 does not. You don&#x27;t need to write all of that in the docstring, to be clear, just recording my observations!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One thing I didn&#x27;t realize about moving this here is that it now gets called for non-function (or -class or -module) suites, such as context managers or <code>if</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>with foo():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;docstring&quot;&quot;&quot;
    pass

if True:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;docstring&quot;&quot;&quot;
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>I tested these locally, and we flag both of these. Fortunately, it looks like we already track a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_linter/src/checkers/ast/mod.rs#L235"><code>docstring_state</code></a> field on <code>Checker</code>. We&#x27;d have to add a <code>pub(crate)</code> getter function for this and make the <code>DocstringState</code> and <code>ExpectedDocstringKind</code> enums <code>pub(crate)</code> too, but I think we can use that to check that we&#x27;re in an actual docstring.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s an existing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_semantic/src/model.rs#L1997"><code>SemanticModel::in_pep_257_docstring</code></a> method, but unfortunately that flag only gets set on the <code>SemanticModel</code> once we&#x27;re actually visiting the docstring.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! This looks great overall, I just had a couple of nits and one slightly larger issue with the <code>suite</code> handling. But even the fix for that shouldn&#x27;t be too bad.</p>

<p>I pushed one small commit fixing a few nits:</p>
<ul>
<li>revert changes to <code>unnecessary_placeholder.rs</code></li>
<li><code>current_docstring_state</code> -&gt; <code>docstring_state</code></li>
<li>exclude <code>ExpectedDocstringKind::Attribute</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The last one was probably the biggest, but I also think it wasn&#x27;t possible to reach based on how we&#x27;re calling <code>analyze::suite</code>. It just seemed better to be explicit in case that changed in the future.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome, nice one - I didn&#x27;t realise that we didn&#x27;t have to worry about docstring_state clashing being both an attribute and a method of the struct that&#x27;s good to know. Yeah checking explicitly for the expected docstring kind makes sense too, I&#x27;ll have a closer read of the changes you made to see if there are any tricks to steal!</p>
<p>Cheers for your help and guidance on this PR btw, I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for any others that I think are my level of difficulty!</p>
