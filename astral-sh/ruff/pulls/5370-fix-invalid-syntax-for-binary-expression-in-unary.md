## Summary

Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5338

I added `BinOp` to `can_break_expr` for `UnaryExpr` but this can cause invalid syntax. It turned out, that I only had to add it because the grouping of the binary expression wasn't correct. 

This PR changes the grouping to:

* Group all binary expressions with the same precedence 
* Group the left
* Group the right expression

This required changing the implementation significantly. It now "flattens" the left hand sides of the binary expression and formats all of them at once without recursing. 

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan

I added a few new snapshot tests

Black keeps the line breaks as is because of the type ignore comment. It formats the expression the same as Ruff does now when removing/changing the comment

These are now formatted the same as with black
