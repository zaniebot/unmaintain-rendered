            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Default to the latest python version if a project has no <code>requires-python</code> constraint or <code>environment.python-version</code>.</p>
<p>I first assumed that this would be more complicated because we would also need to respect the requires-python uppper bound.
However, this isn&#x27;t necessary because the fallback behavior only applies if a project has <strong>no</strong> requires-python constraint
(because we error if a requires-python constraint has no lower bound).</p>
<p>I do think that we&#x27;ll want to have two python versions once we start adding version-dependent lint rules
because we don&#x27;t want that users see different diagnostics (because they could now make use of some newer syntax)
when running <code>ty check --python-version &lt;newer&gt;</code> when there <code>requires-python</code> clearly states that they have to support <code>&lt;older-version&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The way this would be implemented is that <code>ty</code> knows both a <code>minimal-supported-python-version</code> and a <code>python-version</code> option.</p>
<p>Closes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/112">astral-sh/ty#112</a></p>
Test Plan
<p>Added CLI test</p>
<p>I verified that none of the projects with mypy primer changes specifies a <code>requires-python</code> constraint.</p>

<p>I do think that we&#x27;ll want to have two python versions once we start adding version-dependent lint rules
because we don&#x27;t want that users see different diagnostics (because they could now make use of some newer syntax)
when running <code>ty check --python-version &lt;never&gt;</code> when there <code>requires-python</code> clearly states that they have to support <code>&lt;older-version&gt;</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m confused. I expected some push back from you @AlexWaygood ;)</p>
<p>I should probably have called out the trade offs in the summary. So let me do it here.</p>
<p>Defaulting to the latest supported Python version comes with its trade-offs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Defaulting to the oldest python version: ty errored when using newer language features when a project doesn&#x27;t explicitly configure a Python version. This can be confusing to users because their code works at runtime. The other downside is when using ty in an editor when working on projects without a ty configuration. Using the oldest version is unlikely the right version</li>
<li>Defaulting to the newest Python version: ty now misses errors specific to newer Python versions if a user actually uses an older Python version to run their code. It may be harder for them to become aware that they need to set the configuration because there&#x27;s nothing (no diagnostic) that makes them aware of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards defaulting to the newest Python version because we already have experience with what it means to default to the oldest version from Ruff and i want to use the alpha to get some feedback for doing the opposite. I also think that part of the solution will be to get better at detecting the fallback version (by e.g. using uv)</p>

<p>Whoops, <code>never</code> -&gt; <code>newer</code>. But yes, this isn&#x27;t something we have to discuss now</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I&#x27;m well aware of the tradeoffs. This is going to lead to false negatives, and maybe some false positives too. But the current situation is confusing for users, and I&#x27;m tired of arguing about whether this is the best solution or not. I&#x27;m more interested in moving on and exploring ways to avoid falling back to this default at all:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should use the Python version from the pyvenv.cfg file where possible, instead of falling back to this default. We already collect this information when reading the pyvenv.cfg file, we just don&#x27;t use it for this yet.</li>
<li>We should probably add support for <code>.python-version</code> files as well -- they&#x27;re very common, practically a de-facto standard at this point, and shouldn&#x27;t be hard to support</li>
<li>Even if a venv isn&#x27;t activated, then yes, uv might be able to tell us something about the Python version being used</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>TL;DR this solution has problems that I&#x27;m still unhappy with, but on net I think probably reduces very real confusion for users, and I think there are very obvious ways in which we can mitigate the problems in followups.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks good, thank you!</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think any option is <em>great</em> when we are just arbitrarily choosing a default with no information, but it seems pretty clear to me that this option is the best available, and the way to improve it is to need the fallback default less often.</p>
