# `struct.unpack` return type inference

---

_@sakgoyal_

https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2437

## Summary
Allow the checker to analyze the format string for `struct.unpack` to ensure correct types are generated instead of `Any`. 

## Test Plan
Added mdtest cases from original issue. 


> NOTE: the code in `types/call/bind.rs` was written by AI. the rest was written by me.

Thanks! Please take a look at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ty/CONTRIBUTING.md for help with resolving the CI failures. Looks like prek and clippy are failing, as well as the new mdtests you added. Putting the PR back in draft; please mark it ready for review once CI is green.
