# Preserve quotes in generated byte strings

---

_Pull request opened by @ntBre on 2025-01-27 21:58_

## Summary

This is a very closely related follow-up to #15726, adding the same quote-preserving behavior to bytestrings. Only one rule (UP018) was affected this time, and it was easy to mirror the plain string changes.

## Test Plan

Existing tests
