# Fix `Options` JSON schema description

---

_Pull request opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-10-20 00:13_

## Summary

It's seems that `schemars` uses the comment of a flattened struct for the enclosing struct. 
In our case, the comment on `CommonLintOptions` was used for `Options`.

I moved the `lint` section comment to `LintOptions` which avoids this undesired inheritance.

## Test Plan

Reviewed the json schema changes
