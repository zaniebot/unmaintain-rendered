            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Work towards <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11653">astral-sh/ruff#11653</a>.</p>
<p>This PR adds a <code>build.rs</code> script to the <code>red_knot</code> crate that compresses our vendored typeshed stubs into a zip that is then included in the Ruff binary via <code>include_bytes!()</code> in <code>module.rs</code>. This will enable us to resolve modules to vendored stdlib stubs from typeshed in the future.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>build.rs</code> script is run before anything else in the crate is built</li>
<li>We print a <code>cargo:rerun-if-changed</code> directive to stdout to let Cargo know that the <code>build.rs</code> only needs to be rerun if the contents of <code>crates/red_knot/vendor/typeshed</code> changes, or if the <code>build.rs</code> script itself changes. Docs here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#rerun-if-changed. We need to use a syntax for this directive that&#x27;s officially deprecated, due to the fact that our pinned minimum Rust version is old enough that it doesn&#x27;t support the new version. (The deprecated syntax is <code>cargo:rerun-if-changed=</code>, with one colon. The new syntax uses <code>cargo::rerun-if-changed=</code>, with two colons.)</li>
<li>The zipfile that is created during the build step is <code>.gitignored</code>. Unfortunately there will be a need to manually keep that <code>.gitignore</code> entry in sync with the hardcoded path in <code>build.rs</code>.</li>
<li>The PR adds a new Ruff dependency on the <code>zip</code> crate. Following the precedent in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3642">astral-sh/uv#3642</a>, I pinned to an old version of the <code>zip</code> crate, and added a Renovate rule to make sure that we don&#x27;t get dependency-update PRs for that crate.</li>
</ul>
Test Plan
<p>Some basic tests have been added that show that the zip archive containing typeshed is available from the Ruff after it has been built, and that the zip archive has some stdlib stubs in it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I wondered about that... In the end I guess I was lazy and didn&#x27;t make too many changes to the recipe Carl and I found at https://github.com/zip-rs/zip-old/blob/5d0f198124946b7be4e5969719a7f29f363118cd/examples/write_dir.rs. But this makes sense; I&#x27;ll make the change.</p>

<p>We&#x27;re definitely able to inspect the contents of files in the zip at runtime using the <code>zip</code> crate that we used to create the zip. From what I can tell, everything is as we&#x27;d expect it to be. I assert as such in the tests I added, and the tests correctly fail if I change the contents of the vendored <code>stdlib/functools.pyi</code> file.</p>
<p>I also managed to inspect the filenames in the zip using Python&#x27;s <code>zipfile</code> module, and everything was as I would expect it to be. (Except that on my machine, the zip includes a <code>.DS_STORE</code> file... but probably not a huge issue, and unlikely to appear in the binaries we publish to PyPI.)</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been struggling to extract the zip archive or inspect the contents of any of the files in the zip from outside Rust -- most tools for unzipping zip archives don&#x27;t seem to expect the <code>zstd</code> algorithm to be used, and I havne&#x27;t succeeded in using <code>zstandard</code> tools to extract the zip either. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a concern or not.</p>

<p>Sorry, I should have been more explicit. Can you compare the release build numbers.</p>

<p>Also, The red knot binary size is identical. I think the typeshed files should be larger than 0 bytes? Ohhh, maybe the compiler optimizes them away (or isn&#x27;t part of the executable anymore if you moved it to tests)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this confused me as well, since the length of the <code>TYPESHED_ZIP_BYTES</code> array is definitely not zero. I deliberately passed <code>--tests</code> so I think it should be included in the binary. Not sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I should have been more explicit. Can you compare the release build numbers.</p>

<p>No worries, I&#x27;ll do that!</p>

<p>So, still not showing up in the size of the binary (even though it&#x27;s definitely compiling all the test features as part of that command.</p>
<p>Still, we know how large the zip is from this:</p>

<p>The <code>TYPESHED_ZIP_BYTES</code> array in <code>module.rs</code> appears to be of length 617,342.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11779">astral-sh/ruff#11779</a>/commits/c5ad832102cc9cd16da3c8035c0fb9d413da6890, I switched to setting the location of the zip (relative to cargo&#x27;s <code>OUT_DIR</code> environment variable) via an environment variable set at compile time in <code>.cargo/config.toml</code>. This feels slightly nicer than having to hardcode the location manually in both <code>crates/red_knot/build.rs</code> and <code>crates/red_knot/src/module.rs</code>. @MichaReiser, are you okay with that change?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood what&#x27;s the benefit of the environment variable for the name of the zip? It feels like unnecessary complexity to me, considering that we don&#x27;t have a use case for a different name.</p>
<p>If it&#x27;s just to avoid the path repetition, then I think adding a comment to <code>build.rs</code> or the other way around would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Edit: Like I&#x27;m not against it, but it makes the code harder to follow. I then need to search for where the environment variable comes from and understand if there&#x27;s actually a use case where we want to change the path. Having it hard coded makes it very explicit and failing to update the path in one file will also give you compile errors right away.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, it was just to avoid the repetition, and to make it so that there was a &quot;single source of truth&quot; for the location. It felt more &quot;principled&quot; to me. But I also wasn&#x27;t sure if it was worth the new complexity, so I&#x27;ll revert it if you find it less readable 👍</p>
