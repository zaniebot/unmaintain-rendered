            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could distinguish bound vs possibly-unbound here, because we shouldn't give the wishy-washy &quot;possibly unbound&quot; below if we know it's definitely not bound on a type.</p>

<pre><code class="language-py">class PossiblyUnbound:
    if random.randint(0, 1):

<p>But this kind of type should be uncommon, so I also think it's fine to only give the extra details for union elements where it's definitely unbound.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think in this case we'd want to report on any union element that is missing <em>either</em> method. We could potentially reach this case when there is no union element missing both methods.</p>
<p>One thing that could simplify the code here (and in other cases in this PR) is that we don't have to squeeze all the information into a single sentence for a single diagnostic message. It would require a bit more restructuring in this <code>report_diagnostic</code> method, but we can report multiple additional info sub-diagnostics. So e.g. each union element that is missing a method could just be its own <code>info</code> sub-diagnostic, and then we wouldn't have to worry so much about joining with &quot; and &quot;, is vs are, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this PR really addresses most of this TODO. We still don't surface the full underlying call error for wrongly-implemented dunders, like we do for e.g. <code>IterationError::report_diagnostic</code>.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the pull request! This is definitely an improvement.</p>
<p>My idea when I filed the issue was that we would bubble up the information about which types had the dunder unbound or possibly-unbound as part of the <code>CallDunderError</code>, but looking at it now I see this would probably require special-casing <code>Type::Union</code> in <code>try_call_dunder</code> (because <code>member_lookup_with_policy</code> squashes union information into a single <code>PlaceAndQualifiers</code>). I still think this might make sense, but I also think it's OK to just re-create the information once we know there's a problem.</p>

I think for purposes of this PR you can ignore the comment about &quot;bubbling up the information through <code>CallDunderError</code>&quot;, and you can ignore one other comment I'll mention inline. The other ones I think don't require an entirely &quot;new approach&quot; to address, just some updates to the current approach.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for the rookie question.</p>
<p>Can I get a really brief example of how snapshots work?</p>
<p>e.g. should be snapshotted in main or post changes? What if the message changes do I need to update snaps? Are all the snaps run when I do <code>cargo nextest run</code>?</p>
