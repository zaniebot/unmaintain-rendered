            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>The fix for PYI025 is currently marked as unsafe in non-global scopes for both <code>.py</code> and <code>.pyi</code> files, on the grounds that all global-scope symbols in Python are implicitly exported from the module, so changing the name of something in the global scope could break other modules that import the module we&#x27;re fixing. Unlike in <code>.py</code> files, however, imported symbols are never implicitly re-exported from stub files. Symbols are only understood by static analysis tools as being re-exported from stubs if they are marked as explicit re-exports, which take three forms:</p>
<pre><code>from foo import *  # all symbols from foo are re-exported from the stub

# the &quot;redundant&quot; alias marks it as an explicit re-export
# (note that the alias needs to be identical to the symbol&#x27;s &quot;actual&quot; name
# in order for it to be a re-export)
from bar import barrr as barrr

# inclusion in __all__ also marks it as an explicit re-export,
# just like in `.py` files
from baz import bazzz
__all__ = [&quot;bazzz&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This is <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#stub-files">specc&#x27;d in PEP 484</a>, and means that we can mark the fix for PYI025 as safe in more cases for <code>.pyi</code> files.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo test</code>. An existing test case goes from being an unsafe fix to a safe fix in a <code>.pyi</code> fixture. I also added a new fixture so we have coverage of global-scope imports that are marked as re-exports using &quot;redundant&quot; <code>from collections.abc import Set as Set</code> aliases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fun fact: I wrote a version of this PR on Thursday, but bumped into #10508 while writing tests for it. That then meant I had to do <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10525">astral-sh/ruff#10525</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10527">astral-sh/ruff#10527</a> first, before I could file this 😄</p>
