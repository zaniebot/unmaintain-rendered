<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This change introduce the <code>Maybe</code> to <code>contains_effects()</code> to be able to distinguish between possible and no side effects cases, and thus allowing a finer control of the behavior of the rule.</p>
<p>This was talked about in this comment issue as a way to address the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12953#issuecomment-2295449654</li>
</ul>
<p>The following list contains all rules using <code>contains_effects()</code>.
A description for each will be added to describe how the introduction of <code>Maybe</code> change the behavior of the rule in preview.</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] RUF019<ul>
<li>The fix become unsafe when <code>contains_effects()</code> returns <code>Maybe::Maybe</code></li>

<li>[ ] FURB105</li>
<li>[ ] TRY300</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Add the problematic code from #12953 in RUF019 fixture</li>
<li>[x] Add a preview snapshot of RUF019</li>
<li>[x] Check there are no regression in the ecosystem for the stable version</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi @JonathanPlasse</p>
<p>Red Knot is far out and we should not block Ruff improvements because of it.</p>
