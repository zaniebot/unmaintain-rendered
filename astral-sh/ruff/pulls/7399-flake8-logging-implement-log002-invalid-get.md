# [`flake8-logging`] Implement `LOG002`: `invalid-get-logger-argument`

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-09-15 04:44_

## Summary

This PR implements a new rule for `flake8-logging` plugin that checks for
`logging.getLogger` calls with either `__file__` or `__cached__` as the first
argument and generates a suggested fix to use `__name__` instead.

Refer: #7248

## Test Plan

Add test cases and `cargo test`

Nit: It could make sense to move these checks outside of the `if`, assuming that `find_argument` and `matches` are relatively cheap in comparison to `resolve-call_path`

We then need to check if these are builtins. We also need to check if `__name__` is a builtin before trying the fix :)

Ah, right! I completely forgot about that. It's been a while since I worked on a rule xD
