### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>squirrelchat/smol-toml (smol-toml)</summary>

### [`v1.4.0`](https://redirect.github.com/squirrelchat/smol-toml/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/squirrelchat/smol-toml/compare/v1.3.4...v1.4.0)

This release introduces better support for integers, courtesy of [@&#8203;Gouvernathor](https://redirect.github.com/Gouvernathor)! It is now possible to parse integers that are larger than 53 bits as BigInts. It is also possible to parse all integers as BigInts, enabling full type preservation of TOML documents.

The project is now tested against Node 24 as well, ensuring stability on the latest versions of Node.js.
