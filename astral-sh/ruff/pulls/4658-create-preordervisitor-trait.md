# Create `PreorderVisitor` trait

## Summary

The existing `Visitor` trait traverses the tree in evaluation-order. In the formatter, 
we iterate over the comments and try to attach them to the right node. This only works 
if we iterate the nodes in pre-order. 

This PR introduces a new `PreorderVisitor` trait that allows pre-order traversal of the AST nodes. 

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan

I added a few unit tests showing the difference when traversing the arguments.

The idea is to import the visitor as `ruff_python_ast::visitor::preorder::*`

If there are benefits to doing the preorder traversal, I feel like we should move more of our other visitors to use it. E.g., `StatementVisitor` could probably be preorder... as could most of the implementations of `Visitor` (apart from the AST checker).

Lol yeah. I copied the `Visitor` methods because I'm lazy but I prefer to have empty lines so I started adding them. It's a pitty rustfmt doesn't add them automatically, now I (the lazy person) has to do it.

Maybe I should remove that recommendation again. The pre-order visitation can be slower because of the AST's design (requires zipping in some situations). But then, the out-of-order visitation may be unexpected for users (I was surprised by it). 

I don't plan to refactor any existing code because I want to focus on the formatter. We can follow up on this if it comes up more often.

this is so confusing to me because we have the BinOp node but than there's another node for the actual Op which we visit in-order

To make this more confusing. `op` isn't an AST node because it doesn't have a `range`
