Should we add a secondary annotation instead that points to the definition of `foo`? The info message is helpful, but it still requires me to lookup `Base`, find `foo`, to understand the method signature

_Review comment by @AlexWaygood on `crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/infer/builder.rs`:1317 on 2026-01-20 12:50_

There are quite a few as-yet unimplemented rules where we need to know the full set of unimplemented abstract methods a class might have (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1927, https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1923, and https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1877). I think it would best to extract this into a standalone method on `ClassType` (probably Salsa-cached, so we don't repeatedly reconstruct the `FxHashMap`, which seems expensive).

What's the reason for calling `.skip(1)` here? This means that your branch doesn't emit an error on this, but it seems just as invalid as having an unimplemented method on a parent or grandparent class:

```py
from typing import final
from abc import abstractmethod, ABC

@final
class F(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def g(self): ...
```
