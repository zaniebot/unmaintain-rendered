            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nvim 0.11+ uses the builtin <code>vim.lsp.enable</code> and <code>vim.lsp.config</code> to enable and configure LSP clients. This adds the new non legacy way of configuring Nvim with <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> according to the upstream documentation.</p>

<p>Update documentation for Nvim LSP configuration according to <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> and Nvim 0.11+</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Tested locally on macOS with Nvim 0.11.1 and <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> master/<a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/tree/ac1dfbe3b60e5e23a2cff90e3bd6a3bc88031a57">ac1dfbe</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not personally very familiar with neovim, but how much of the other config code below this also needs to be updated? I see that much of it starts with <code>require('lspconfig')</code> too. The existing docs just above this also suggest installing <code>nvim-lspconfig</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The new way of configuring doesn't require importing i.e., <code>require('lspconfig')</code> because <code>vim</code> is a builtin global variable much like <code>int</code> or <code>map</code> in Python.</p>

<p>I think this is up to you and depending on how long you want to document &lt; 0.11. <a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig"><code>nvim-lspconfig</code></a> already mentions the other format as deprecated and not supported but just landed in March so might be some time before users adopt.</p>
<p>I think no need to change all occurrences of <code>require('lspconfig').&lt;lsp&gt;.setup</code> (only 3 places) for now, I think if you're on 0.11 and set up ruff you know how to setup <code>pyright</code> to ignore files for analysis too.</p>

<p>Do'h, my bad! 🤦  Fixed this but feel free to move it around or use sub-headings!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, actually <code>nvim-lspconfig</code> would still be required here because the actual config definition is in that repository so the config is only partial here. Thanks @ntBre for pointing that out!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I thought that was intentional since it's already mentioned above. Given all the variants of package managers and bundled Nvim installations it's hard to pick one way to install and setup <code>nvim-lspconfig</code>.</p>
<p>I think it's best to just keep the current text that refers to the docs on how to install and configure it.</p>
