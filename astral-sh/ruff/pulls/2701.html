            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your relentless work on Ruff!</p>
<p>What do you think about this first shot, extremely rough, extremely naive and incomplete attempt to handle <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/2602">charliermarsh/ruff#2602</a> by trying to figure out whether the last statement is a call to one of the known no-return functions? This is my first timid look into the Ruff source code, and my first ever look into rustpython-parser, too, so there will certainly be several &quot;this is not the way&quot; objections... assuming this is even on the right path.</p>
<p>And to foresee at least one of these objections: as noted in the code comments, this is naive and incomplete in that it compares the name under which the module (&quot;os&quot;, &quot;pytest&quot;, etc) is referenced, and not the actual name of the imported module. I would guess that Ruff already records imported modules somewhere so that there is a way for this code to obtain the actual (possibly fully qualified) name of the module that the expression refers to; if you could point me to a place in the Ruff code where something like that is done, I&#x27;d be happy to use it here. Also the same applies to unqualified names in function calls: when we see a call to <code>abort()</code> or <code>xfail(...)</code> as the last statement, it would be nice to be able to notice that this is, in this particular Python source file, actually <code>from pytest import xfail</code> and not complain about it.</p>
<p>Of course, as noted in #2602, a real solution would not only resolve called functions and methods, but also check whether they are type-annotated as NoReturn, and base the decision on that. If you say that my temporary band-aid is not worth merging since a type-checking solution may be the way to go, that would be fine, too.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and keep up the great work!</p>
<p>G&#x27;luck,
Peter</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So we do have a system to support these -- grep around for <code>checker.resolve_call_path</code>. That will abstract away all the concerns around <code>import</code>, <code>import from</code>, aliasing, etc., and do the &quot;right thing&quot; in all cases to ensure that <code>func</code> is in fact a reference to the thing we care about here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wow. That made things... a lot simpler. But then, yes, that&#x27;s what happens when a project already has the infrastructure in place to build upon. Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right, so after @charliermarsh pointed me in the right direction on resolving function calls, things are a bit simpler now in <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/2701">charliermarsh/ruff#2701</a>/commits/41ee9a827b1c25e34f2ef2391224d3fecbca565e
Of course, the question remains of whether an allowlist that Somebody(tm) needs to maintain is the right path to take, but it might help things along for the present.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this @ppentchev! Without typing support this is the next best thing.</p>
<p>Also nice picking up on stuff in the standard library.</p>
