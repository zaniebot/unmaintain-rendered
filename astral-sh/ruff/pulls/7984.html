            <div class="timeline-body"><p>See the provided breaking changes note for details.</p>
<p>Removes support for the deprecated <code>--format</code>option in the <code>ruff check</code> CLI, <code>format</code> inference as <code>output-format</code> in the configuration file, and the <code>RUFF_FORMAT</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>The error message for use of <code>format</code> in the configuration file could be better, but would require some awkward serde wrappers and it seems hard to present the correct schema to the user still.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @acdha I&#x27;m sorry to hear this broke your CI.</p>
<p>Use of this displayed warnings since v0.0.291 and the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.291">changelog for that release</a> had a bolded notice. Additionally, we grouped this breaking change with an increase in a different version number per our <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/">versioning policy</a>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure what else we could have done here, except to have a longer deprecation period — which we will generally strive for, but in this case the error messages when the <code>format</code> configuration option was used incorrectly were confusing many of our users and challenging to improve without dropping support as we did here.</p>

<p>Yeah, I appreciate that there isn&#x27;t a great answer here - a longer period than a couple of weeks might have helped but given that most of the time it&#x27;s running in CI where people rarely look at passing builds I think the part which would have helped more would have been having an error message specifically noting that this option was renamed. Long-term, I&#x27;m sure the best solution would be an official GitHub Action which you could update at the same time as any future API changes.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m sorry about that. What&#x27;s your setup? Do you always install the latest Ruff version on CI? If so, I would recommend you to pin your ruff version and bump it periodically.</p>
