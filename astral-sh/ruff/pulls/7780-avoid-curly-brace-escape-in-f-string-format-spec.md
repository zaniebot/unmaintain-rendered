# Avoid curly brace escape in f-string format spec

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-10-03 13:47_

## Summary

This PR fixes a bug in the lexer for f-string format spec where it would consider the `{{` (double curly braces) as an escape pattern.

This is not the case as evident by the [PEP](https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/#how-to-produce-these-new-tokens) as well but I missed the part:

> [..]
> * **If in “format specifier mode” (see step 3), an opening brace ({) or a closing brace (}).**
> * If not in “format specifier mode” (see step 3), an opening brace ({) or a closing brace (}) that is not immediately followed by another opening/closing brace.

## Test Plan

Add a test case to verify the fix and update the snapshot.

fixes: #7778
