# [ty] Early return in `Type::has_relation_to_impl` for `Type` variants that are always mutually disjoint

---

_@AlexWaygood_

## Summary

This PR improves a pre-existing optimisation in `Type::has_relation_to_impl`, for a 4% speedup on static-frame (according to codspeed) and a 2-3% speedup on pandas (codspeed says 2%; I measure 3% locally with ty_benchmark).

I'm in two minds about this PR -- I'm really not sure I like this. It feels like it makes the code uglier and harder to understand, and this is already a very complicated function.

On the other hand, we already _have_ this optimisation lower down in `Type::has_relation_to_impl` -- it's just not as complete as it could be! All this PR does is move the optimisation higher up and make it more complete.

Anyway, curious for other folks' thoughts here.

## Test Plan

- Existing tests all pass
