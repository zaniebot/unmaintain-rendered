            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This rips out the previous implementation in favour of a new implementation with 3 rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>froms are locals</strong>: a <code>from..import</code> can only define locals, it does not have global
side-effects. Specifically any submodule attribute <code>a</code> that&#x27;s implicitly introduced by either
<code>from .a import b</code> or <code>from . import a as b</code> (in an <code>__init__.py(i)</code>) is a local and not a
global. If you do such an import at the top of a file you won&#x27;t notice this. However if you do
such an import in a function, that means it will only be function-scoped (so you&#x27;ll need to do
it in every function that wants to access it, making your code less sensitive to execution
order).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>first from first serve</strong>: only the <em>first</em> <code>from..import</code> in an <code>__init__.py(i)</code> that imports a
particular direct submodule of the current package introduces that submodule as a local.
Subsequent imports of the submodule will not introduce that local. This reflects the fact that
in actual python only the first import of a submodule (in the entire execution of the program)
introduces it as an attribute of the package. By &quot;first&quot; we mean &quot;the first time in this scope
(or any parent scope)&quot;. This pairs well with the fact that we are specifically introducing a
local (as long as you don&#x27;t accidentally shadow or overwrite the local).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>dot re-exports</strong>: <code>from . import a</code> in an <code>__init__.pyi</code> is considered a re-export of <code>a</code>
(equivalent to <code>from . import a as a</code>). This is required to properly handle many stubs in the
wild. Currently it must be <em>exactly</em> <code>from . import ...</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This implementation is intentionally limited/conservative (notably, often requiring a from import to be relative). I&#x27;m going to file a ton of followups for improvements so that their impact can be evaluated separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have cleaned up the implementation and added some more tests. I&#x27;ve made a few edge-cases a bit more strict. I am hoping this is a complete implementation, except for some code/mdtest comments need to be updated to reflect the current semantics.</p>
<p>For posterity, this is the results that we agreed seemed shippable <em>before</em> my cleanup. Hopefully the stricter implementation isn&#x27;t a huge change!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe the TL;DR of this PR is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have ripped out my previous work with submodule-attributes</li>
<li>I have introduced a re-export rule that treats <code>from . import x</code> in <code>__init__.pyi</code> as if it was <code>x as x</code> (must be <em>only</em> from <code>.</code>, cannot be <code>.y</code>)</li>
<li>I have introduced a new <code>ImportFromImplicitDefinitionKind</code> that expresses the implicit <code>x = &lt;thispackage.x&gt;</code> that results from the first <code>from .x.y import z</code> in an <code>__init__.py(i)</code><ul>
<li>This value is <em>never</em> re-exported, as there wasn&#x27;t a good way to &quot;turn it off&quot; (you could do an absolute import in the current implementation), and you can just do <code>from . import x</code> if you wanted to re-export it.</li>
<li>Because it&#x27;s not a submodule-attribute, it essentially introduces a local variable, which means it implicitly models semantics that imports in a function should probably only be visible in that function, safety-wise. While top-level imports would be visible to all functions.</li>
<li>Because it&#x27;s not a submodule-attribute, it can be overwritten and we won&#x27;t complain (<code>from .myfunc import myfunc</code>, <code>from .myfunc import other; myfunc = 0</code>)</li>
<li>Only the first import of a particular direct-submodule name will create an assignment<ul>
<li>Known bug I&#x27;m shipping and will file an issue for: the &quot;first&quot; check is file-global and not per-scope, which means we get confused if e.g. two functions do the same import (only the first will see the symbol).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, &quot;re-exported&quot; is only an applicable concern for definitions in .pyi files, so both kinds of definitions will be fully visible in .py files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: the fact that all test headers / names in this test file assume &quot;in a stub file&quot; by default (and then suffix &quot;(Non-stub Check)&quot; to a subsequent equivalent-except-not-in-stub test) may have made sense before this PR, when this file was really only about tweaking stub file rules, but it feels weird after this PR, now that this file is really about submodule attributes in general, stub or non-stub.</p>
<p>I would just have a single test heading describing each case, and then use sub-headings <code>### In py file</code> and <code>### In stub file</code> under that, rather than repeating the whole test description.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t know that it matters, since the from-import node itself is otherwise unused as a definition NodeKey, and there can only be one implicit definition per from-import, but I&#x27;m curious whether we could attach this definition to the Identifier for the submodule itself rather than to the entire import-from node? It seems slightly more intuitive/clearer. Maybe we can&#x27;t do this because <code>Identifier</code> isn&#x27;t a real AST node? (I don&#x27;t recall...)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As discussed in person, I don&#x27;t think accepting these two bugs (submodule-attribute works only in first function, and can wrongly clobber a function local) is the right tradeoff, vs just not modeling submodule-attribute side-effects at all for imports inside functions. The latter is a clearly delineated and explainable choice of what to model and what not to model; the former two are confusing edge-case bugs where something sometimes works but then sometimes fails in surprising ways.</p>

<p>Normally I would want to adjust more of the wordings and tests in this PR to accurately describe the behavior I think we should be aiming for (with TODOs as needed where we don&#x27;t achieve it yet), but I&#x27;m good with skipping those updates here if the follow-up PRs are coming shortly. So consider all comments on this PR as OK to address in follow-ups if you prefer.</p>
