            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds support for caching workspace diagnostics.</p>
<p>For each file, ty now sends a <code>resultId</code> that is the hash of all diagnostics for that file. The client sends the <code>resultId</code>s from the previous workspace diagnostic requests as part of the next request payload. This allows ty to determine if the diagnostics of a file changed and only send a full diagnostic report for those files (and send unchanged for all other files).</p>
<p>I hoped that this would fix the observed lag for home assistant when workspace diagnostics are enabled. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. It reduces the lag, but it doesn't fix it entirely</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wonder if this should actually be fixed in the test server instead to mimic what a client would do. This is because, I think, it's VS Code that does this part or more specifically the ty VS Code extension that creates the workspace and global settings and sends it via the initialization options.</p>
<p>The extension would construct workspace settings by asking VS Code the values for each setting which would automatically fallback to the global value. This means the server doesn't need to do any resolution between workspace and global values. This is what Ruff (and ty) does currently.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another follow-up would be to add this to document diagnostic as well (<code>textDocument/diagnostic</code>) but I'm not sure if it's beneficial in that request because that request would be sent every time the file got changed and whenever a user is typing, the change would usually produce a syntax error initially before the code gets in a stable state. One scenario where it would be useful is when copy pasting a code snippet which doesn't produce any diagnostic and the locations of existing diagnostics didn't change.</p>

<p>I don't know how I'd measure this. I'd need to plug into VS code's rendering performance (it's re-rendering the problems list that is slow)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ideally, we'd fix this in the server itself, but it feels out of scope for this PR. I'm not entirely sure how I would model this but the server should prefer the option specified in the global option over a value provided in the workspace configuration. In fact, it should only use the workspace level option if it wasn't provided globally. But I'd prefer not to make changes to settings while you're also doing a refactor. That's why I'd prefer to leave this as is for now</p>

<p>Would that require that the test specify the entire <code>initialization_options</code>? Like, with <code>{ &quot;settings&quot;: global_options }</code>?</p>

<p>No, I just want to indicate that these are the initialization options because I'd find global options a bit confusing from a client perspective.</p>

<p>I don't know how I'd measure this. I'd need to plug into VS code's rendering performance (it's re-rendering the problems list that is slow)</p>

<p>A quick way would be to get the numbers that the server logs? I think it logs how long it took a request at the debug or trace level.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It already uses <code>into_iter</code> implicitly. The reason we need to clone the <code>url</code> is because <code>key</code> requires an owned <code>Url</code> and we also need the URL for the <code>FullDiagnosticReportItem</code>. It might be possible to avoid the URL clone by getting the <code>url</code> from the <code>DocumentRef</code> (adding an <code>into_url</code> method or similar) but it complicates the code a fair amount which I don't think is justified</p>

<p>I don't think this number will be very meaningful. The issue isn't that the request takes too long. It's that VS code dies diffing the diagnostics and rendering the new diagnostics</p>

<p>Another follow-up would be to add this to document diagnostic as well (textDocument/diagnostic) but I'm not sure if it's beneficial in that request because that request would be sent every time the file got changed and whenever a user is typing, the change would usually produce a syntax error initially before the code gets in a stable state. One scenario where it would be useful is when copy pasting a code snippet which doesn't produce any diagnostic and the locations of existing diagnostics didn't change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Done. I think it's still useful because an editor might send <code>pullDiagnostic</code> requests for multiple files and the diagnostics won't change for all of them</p>
