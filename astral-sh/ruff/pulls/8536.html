            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note, I did not adjust the auto-generated text code blocks in configuration.md as I presumed any changes would be overwritten. To apply the same style for those blocks I presume it would have to be applied from where those blocks are generated. But I was unsure where that was.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is this enforceable by one of our pre-commit tools for linting markdown? I'm not sure I really care either way but if it's not checked by a tool it's probably not going to remain consistent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR relates to the inconsistency I highlighted <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8505#issuecomment-1794505040">here</a> and it was explained <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8505#issuecomment-1795850229">later</a> that it is required or did I misinterpret that explanation. @charliermarsh also added indentation to code blocks (commit https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8512/commits/231aff02c9bb3b0d754a15890f2fd20008a7da17) in another PR I submitted so I presumed that was the preferred style.</p>
<p>But in reality my understanding is indentation is <strong>not</strong> necessary if the code block is fenced which they all seemed to be. So if anything the indentation should be removed from all code blocks, no?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know but if so then it doesn't seem to enforce it consistently whichever style is preferred.</p>

<p>yep, I specifically said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] indented code blocks are only used for tabs because that's the syntax they require [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlie's commit specifically corrects that</p>
<p>I think this PR can be closed 👍</p>
