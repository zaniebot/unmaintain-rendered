            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think if you want people to be able to enable this separately from the other 3.0 rules, a separate rule would be required. Alternatively, we could hold off on adding this until 3.0.1 is released, if that would work for you all.</p>
<p>Which part is not in 3.0.0? If the replacement is available but the old version isn't deleted, I think it could make sense just to enable the rule anyway, but that obviously wouldn't make sense if the replacement is only added in 3.0.1.</p>
<p>I'll go ahead and review but hold off merging in case you want a separate rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'd prefer to keep it in the same rule, you could update the diagnostic message for the existing rules to make it explicit that this &quot;requires Airflow 3.0 or greater&quot;. It also seems to be something that's part of a patch version in Airflow so I'm assuming that it's backwards compatible and as Ruff can't detect the dependency version it makes sense that Ruff assumes that users are on the latest version of Airflow 3. I think it's the same for NumPy 2.0 deprecation rules if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Yep, I think we should hold off till 3.0.1</p>

<p>The replacement itself. It will be introduced in 3.0.1</p>

<p>Yep, I was thinking of something similar. Cool! I'll go with this route after 3.0.1 release. Thanks!</p>
