This file is generated (see the comment on the first line of the file). But I don't think that matters too much here. If regenerating the file unpins the actions versions, renovate will just re-pin them again in its next scheduled update.

Hmm, ignoring it in renovate doesn't seem ideal because we then don't get the pinning. But modifying generated files also isn't ideal...

I guess the "perfect solution" is for cargo-dist to generate the file with the pins... we could file a feature request upstream?
