Hooray -- this brings in the formatting improvements from https://github.com/astral-sh/docstring-adder/pull/2, and adds docstrings to Windows- and macOS-only modules thanks to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19360 / https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19367 (`msvcrt.pyi` is a good example of a module that previously did not have docstrings, but now does)
