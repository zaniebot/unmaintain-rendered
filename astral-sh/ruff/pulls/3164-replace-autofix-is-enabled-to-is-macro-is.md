# Replace Autofix::is_enabled to is-macro::Is

---

_@youknowone_

I have 2 different suggestion of the flag types.
One using is_enabled and the other one using Into<bool>

This is the `is_enabled` one with `is-macro`

Oh sorry, I missed that this was mutually with #3165, but I'm fine with what got merged there.
