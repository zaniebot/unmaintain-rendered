# Maybe parenthesize long constants and names

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

This PR implements https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6271 for string, fstring, and number literals as well as for names. The stacked PR implements the behavior for non-fluent call expressions (Doing the changes separately helps to understand the compatibility and performance implications).

This PR is about parenthesizing unsplittable expressions if it makes them fit on a line, but the formatter should omit the parentheses if they still don't. 

```python
x = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
x_aaaa = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

# Exceeds the line width even when parenthesizing
x = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
# Fits after parenthesizing
x_aaaa = (
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
)
```


## Test Plan

I added a few new test cases. 

The similarity index improves for all projects except typeshed.

## Performance

The performance implication of this should be limited because constants and single names are rarely used in clause headers (`if "string":`). However, constant are used frequently in assignments where this assignment applies as well and using `BestFitting` has a considerable cost:

* `BestFitting` allocates a `Vec` for each variant + one vec for itself 
* It requires using `memoized`, which allocates too
* `propagate_expands` requires special handling for interned (used by memoized) to avoid visiting the document multiple times. 
* Handling Interned (memoized) FormatElements means the printer can no longer iterate over a flat Vec.

This is similar to Prettier's/Rome's formatting of type assertion expressions 
https://github.com/rome/tools/blob/2655264565608e29229490101f7abbfa89a35598/crates/rome_js_formatter/src/ts/expressions/type_assertion_expression.rs#L46-L60

I added some more documentation in the following PR.

Let's always initialize the vector with a non-zero capacity because it always writes at least 3 entries, and lets double it to avoid resizing.

This helped to improve performance quiet a bit. I haven't done any science but our groups very likely form a tree, the depth of a balanced binary tree is probably not the worst approximation.

The `assert` above will be tricky. Because both the left and the right shouldn't have parentheses by default if it doesn't make them fit. Which is given, because the string is simply way too long, making it never fit. But we should then still break the expression.. hum. A Problem for another day

This is always going to indented if it's parenthesized, right? So could we subtract the indent size from `context.options().line_width().value()`?

Ah okay, so this looks for newlines in the IR, interesting. How does `will_break` deal with things that might break conditionally?

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/expression/expr_name.rs`:44 on 2023-08-24 09:20_

This is a rather arbitrary number and a heuristic to avoid the cost of using best fitting for most literals and common names like `self`. It can result in the formatted text exceeding the line width even if parenthesizing would make it fit but IMO, I probably rather have a 4-character name exceed the line width by 2 than add parentheses and expand it vertically. 

How did I come up with the number. I exclude the constants `True`, `False` and `None` and... I assumed that they all have a length of 4. So you see, I'm not good at math nor counting :rofl:  

I'll factor this method out and add a comment of why 4... uhm 5.

We could, but we don't have an indent size option yet (only available in the printer). Let me add it in a follow up PR.

It looks for things that make group expand for certain: Like hard line breaks or `expand_parent`. The logic ignores any conditions (it returns `true` if content in `if_group_breaks` or `if_group_fits` contains a hard line break). It showed that conditions can mostly be ignored, especially because it is uncommon or even unneeded to have hard line breaks or expand parent inside of conditional content.
