<p>btw if we would like to mark AIR3XX as stable, what would be the requirement? are we allow to gradually improve the rules afterward?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Going by the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/#rule-stabilization">rule stabilization</a> docs, the main normal requirement is that a rule has been in preview for one minor release cycle. So since these are going into 0.11.x, I think we usually wouldn&#x27;t consider stabilizing them until 0.13.0, or at least 0.12.0.</p>
<p>That page also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stable rule behaviors are not changed significantly in patch versions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we wouldn&#x27;t want to change them drastically after stabilization, but if you mean something more like adding a few new deprecated imports, I think that would be okay.</p>
<p>These rules feel like a bit of an exception to the general guidelines to me, so we could possibly consider stabilizing them sooner, but I&#x27;d defer to @MichaReiser or @dhruvmanila on that decision.</p>
<p>Were you just hoping that users could access these without enabling preview mode?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Everything that @ntBre said is what we usually follow. In this case we could possibly stabilize it in the next minor release but that isn&#x27;t planned in the near future (possibly in June). Do you think there would be any issue in recommending users to use the <code>--preview</code> flag when migrating? It can be clubbed with <code>--select</code> flag to only select certain rules so that other preview rules are not selected.

<p>Got it. The only concern we have is the <code>--preview</code> flag, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a major concern. Thanks for letting us know! I&#x27;ll bring the message back to the community!</p>
