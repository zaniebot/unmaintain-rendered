            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The latest version of mdformat-mkdocs apparently conflicts with our other Markdown pre-commit hook, markdownlint. I haven't spent too much time figuring out if there's a way to make the latest versions of the two happy with each other, since the conflict is causing pre-commit to fail on the main branch.</p>
<p>I tested locally that pre-commit passes on this branch.</p>
