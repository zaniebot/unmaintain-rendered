Not ideal for mobile devices, but I’ll let Charlie decide how much of a concern that is.

IMO it's not too bad on mobile devices, maybe 2 or 3 columns can be better.

I think I'm gonna leave this as-is just because I find the multi-column harder to parser. I'll move it to the bottom of the section though.
