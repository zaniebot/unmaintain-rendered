            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Currently we do not emit an error on this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from ty_extensions import Not

def f[T](x: T, y: Not[T]) -&gt; T:
    x = y
    return x
</code></pre>
<p>But we should do! <code>~T</code> should never be assignable to <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>This fixes a small regression introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/14fe1228e72dca90db6b3dbb7e07f973d175ea0e#diff-8049ab5af787dba29daa389bbe2b691560c15461ef536f122b1beab112a4b48aR1443-R1446, where a branch that previously returned <code>false</code> was replaced with a branch that returns <code>C::always_satisfiable</code> -- the opposite of what it used to be! The regression occurred because we didn't have any tests for this -- so I added some tests in this PR that fail on <code>main</code>. I only spotted the problem because I was going through the code of <code>has_relation_to_impl</code> with a fine toothcomb for https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20602 😄</p>

<p>Yes -- ideally we'd have the <code>NonInferrableTypeVar</code> branches below the <code>Union</code> and <code>Intersection</code> branches. Then we wouldn't need these branches at all, as you say. Unfortunately, however, value-constrained TypeVars make this quite hard, as they require special handling with regards to unions:</p>

<p>Hmm, interesting question. I think that also calls into doubt the validity of this pre-existing branch -- if the TypeVar could be solved to <code>Any</code>, it should not be considered a subtype of itself:</p>

<p>I wonder if this is something that @dcreager's work on constraint sets could help with? If the relation is <code>TypeRelation::Subtyping</code>, we could possibly return a constraint set from these branches that indicates that <code>self</code> is a subtype of <code>target</code> only if neither <code>self</code> nor <code>target</code> is solved to <code>Any</code>?</p>

<p>But that doesn't really make sense, of course, because these are <em>non-inferable</em> type variables -- type variables from the perspective of inside a function or class body... I think this does lead to the conclusion that <code>T</code> cannot be a subtype of <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> is a non-inferable type variable); it can only be assignable to <code>T</code>. No matter what the bounds or constraints on a type variable are, it could <em>always</em> be specialised to <code>Any</code>, so you can't really ever conclude that a non-inferable type variable is ever a subtype of (or disjoint from) anything, I don't think</p>

<p>Right, I'd even reword this slightly to say that typevar <em>inference</em> will never infer a gradual type for a typevar. (A typevar can be specialized to <code>Unknown</code> if we don't infer <em>anything</em> for it, and it has no default, but I consider that different than explicitly infering a gradual type for it.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The current way we're handling assignability of typevars is very brittle and dependent on these kinds of hacks, because of &quot;rounding error&quot; that's introduced by the early conversions of the assignability checks of union/intersection elements into a true/false value. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20093 is working on using constraint sets to model the assignability of a typevar, which will allow us to correctly model when e.g. each element of a union is assignable &quot;sometimes&quot;, but in a way that combines to &quot;always&quot; when you merge them together. That will hopefully remove the need for these match arms completely. But having the mdtest here will be good to avoid a regression when that lands.</p>
