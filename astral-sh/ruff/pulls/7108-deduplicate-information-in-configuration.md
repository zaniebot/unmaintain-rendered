---

_Pull request opened by @dalgarno on 2023-09-03 20:28_

## Summary

This changes deduplicates information in the configuration section of the documentation, corrects a numbering error, and makes it (hopefully) clearer to read.

## Test Plan

Manually checked the change by running MkDocs locally. All unit tests and pre-commit checks pass.
