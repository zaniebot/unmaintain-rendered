### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2025-31125](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-4r4m-qw57-chr8)

### Summary

The contents of arbitrary files can be returned to the browser.

### Impact
Only apps explicitly exposing the Vite dev server to the network (using `--host` or [`server.host` config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host)) are affected.

### Details

- base64 encoded content of non-allowed files is exposed using `?inline&import` (originally reported as `?import&?inline=1.wasm?init`)
- content of non-allowed files is exposed using `?raw?import`

`/@&#8203;fs/` isn't needed to reproduce the issue for files inside the project root.

### PoC

Original report (check details above for simplified cases):

The ?import&?inline=1.wasm?init ending allows attackers to read arbitrary files and returns the file content if it exists.  Base64 decoding needs to be performed twice
```
$ npm create vite@latest
$ cd vite-project/
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Example full URL `http://localhost:5173/@&#8203;fs/C:/windows/win.ini?import&?inline=1.wasm?init`
