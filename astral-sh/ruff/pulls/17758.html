            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Add cycle handling for <code>try_metaclass</code> and <code>pep695_generic_context</code> queries, as well as adjusting the cycle handling for <code>try_mro</code> to ensure that it short-circuits on cycles and won&#x27;t grow MROs indefinitely.</p>
<p>This reduces the number of failing fuzzer seeds from 68 to 17. The latter count includes fuzzer seeds 120, 160, and 335, all of which previously panicked but now either hang or are very slow; I&#x27;ve temporarily skipped those seeds in the fuzzer until I can dig into that slowness further.</p>
<p>This also allows us to move some more ecosystem projects from <code>bad.txt</code> to <code>good.txt</code>, which I&#x27;ve done in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17903">astral-sh/ruff#17903</a></p>
Test Plan
<p>Added mdtests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know I shouldn&#x27;t be looking at draft PRs, but just to note... as well as finding a couple of new panics, the fuzz job appears to have taken 15 minutes to complete on this PR branch (much longer than it does on <code>main</code>). I can repro this locally running this branch of red-knot on the code generated by seed 120, which is:</p>

<p>didn&#x27;t take that long 😛 I just looked to see what the final reported seed was in CI, saw it was 120, and then ran this in the terminal to get the code generated from seed 120:</p>

<p>That&#x27;s reasonable. I was aiming to knock down more of the easier panics to eliminate that are maybe more likely to hit user projects in alpha testing, but if at this point the upstream bugs are hitting us commonly enough for alpha use cases, I can put this on ice and work on the Salsa issues instead.</p>

<p>Nice! It took me slightly longer since I hadn&#x27;t pushed the PR yet and didn&#x27;t have the completed run from CI to look at, so I had to parse the output, extract the seeds that did complete, sort them, and then find the missing one :)</p>

<p>And I didn&#x27;t know how to do all this, so instead I just modified <code>fuzz.py</code> to print out its initial source snippet before testing it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the problem only manifests with nested cycles and incrementality. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m more hesitant to introduce new possibly larger or nested cycles. However, it shouldn&#x27;t matter much for as long as no one uses <code>--watch</code>.</p>
<p>The other consideration here is that cycles are probably going to get more expensive because salsa currently takes incorrect shortcuts (see my most recent PR which regresses perf for the cycle case by 10%). It might be easier to assess the performance cost once we have a fix in view</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To be clear, the motivation of this PR is to fix cycle panics in the ecosystem and the fuzzer (and it does that effectively); we&#x27;re not just using fixpoint iteration to simplify code here.</p>
<p>We do now rely on fixpoint iteration of <code>try_mro</code> and <code>try_metaclass</code> to detect cyclic inheritance instead of the <code>inheritance_cycle</code> query, but this doesn&#x27;t really increase the overall use of fixpoint, since the removed <code>inheritance_cycle</code> query itself had fixpoint iteration support too! The problem is just that <code>inheritance_cycle</code> was not actually sufficient to catch all inheritance cycles, so we still need the fixpoint iteration support in <code>try_mro</code> and <code>try_metaclass</code> -- at which point it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to keep around a separate query that just catches <em>some</em> cycles, which we&#x27;ll catch in the other queries anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this means that we essentially lose the improvements that were added in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15561">astral-sh/ruff#15561</a>: we will now emit an error on a first-party-code class that inherits from a third-party-code class with a cyclic definition, even if the first-party-code class does not actually participate in the cycle. This isn&#x27;t a limitation either mypy or pyright has: both only emit one diagnostic for the original cyclic definition, and no diagnostics on classes that have cyclically defined classes in ther MRO but do not actually participate in a cycle themselves.</p>
<p>(There&#x27;s a mypy example <a href="https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=65663619b86e964d0bcec267dbfaf254">here</a>. The pyright playground isn&#x27;t much use here because I can&#x27;t tell it to treat the file as a stub file, and if it&#x27;s a <code>.py</code> file then pyright just (correctly) tells you that the forward reference is going to fail at runtime. but I confirmed locally that it has similar behaviour to mypy if you paste this example into a stub file and run pyright on it.)</p>
<p>Realistically this is unlikely to come up, and I definitely think fixing panics is more important than this minor UX detail. However, this still isn&#x27;t <em>ideal</em>, so I&#x27;d prefer it if we could restore the TODO comment that was removed in #15561.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There were two more fuzzer seeds that were hanging or taking a long time (one did finish after a long time, the other didn&#x27;t finish within the 20 minute timeout). Both are also seeds that were previously just cycle-panicking, so I don&#x27;t have any reason to think at this point that this PR <em>causes</em> the hang/slowness on those seeds (it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any new hangs on currently-good ecosystem projects); it might just expose it by getting us past the panic on those seeds. For now I&#x27;ve skipped those seeds on the fuzzer as well.</p>
<p>I still think this is worth landing as-is to reduce cycle panics; I&#x27;ll look at the hanging fuzzer seeds when I can, though I&#x27;m more motivated to look first at hangs occurring on ecosystem projects.</p>
