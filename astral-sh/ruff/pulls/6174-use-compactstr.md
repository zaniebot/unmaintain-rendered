## DHat

I ran `dhat` on a `release-debug` profile before and after, but using the standard allocator (we otherwise only see the jmalloc allocations):

### CPython

==203843== Writes:    15,620,638,174 bytes
```


### Summary

The savings are smaller than I expected (only about 9MB for CPython and 23MB for Homeassitant). The general noise makes it difficult to get to the bottom of it:

* The cpython repo contains many diagnostics 
* The string parser happily allocates a ton of strings
* The generated parser uses `Vec`s for everything... 


## Test Plan

<!-- How was it tested? -->

> The way, compact is - Yoda.

I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't improve performance at all. I need to analyze the memory usage to understand if it is worth it.

_Comment by @Boshen on 2023-07-29 16:25_

Your benchmark files are too small for compact string to take into effect. I only noticed difference when I started linting a few thousand files, there will be a tiny "drop" period for all the individual allocations.

_Comment by @Boshen on 2023-07-29 16:26_

Take a look at your max RSS to verify allocations are reduced? Or use dhat.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-07-29 17:19_

Have you benchmarked with hyperfine or Instruments (or comparable)?

---

_Comment by @MichaReiser on 2023-07-29 20:08_

Thanks for the suggestions. I'll give the cpython benchmark a try and do some valgrind/dhat profiling. Let's see when I have time for it, I'm not really supposed to work on this 😅
