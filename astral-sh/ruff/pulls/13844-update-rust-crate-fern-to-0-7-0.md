### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>daboross/fern (fern)</summary>

### [`v0.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/daboross/fern/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#070-2024-10-20)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/daboross/fern/compare/fern-0.6.2...fern-0.7.0)

\==================

-   Upgrade `colored` to version 2. This is a breaking change due to
    `colored` being exposed in the public API of `fern`. (thanks \[[@&#8203;faern](https://redirect.github.com/faern)] for
    doing the boilerplate here!)
-   Remove most of the unsoundness warning, and update it to reflect fern 0.7.0
    fixing the issue.
