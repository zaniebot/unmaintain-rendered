            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes #17541</p>
<p>Before this change, in the case of overloaded functions, <code>@dataclass_transform</code> was detected only when applied to the implementation, not the overloads.
However, the spec also allows this decorator to be applied to any of the overloads as well.
With this PR, we start handling <code>@dataclass_transform</code>s applied to overloads.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Fixed existing TODOs in the test suite.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is as of now incomplete, in that it only handles the cases where the function which is supposed to act like a dataclass decorator is being used in a &quot;call&quot; context, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@versioned_class(version=2)
class D2:
    x: str
</code></pre>
<p>This PR does not yet fix cases where <code>versioned_class</code> is used in a &quot;name load&quot; context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@versioned_class
class D1:
    x: str
</code></pre>
<p>This is because, in the later case, logic to determine if the <code>FunctionLiteral</code> acts like a dataclass decorator is here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/e95130ad8062f64a11247d51a72f62bb735ddd19/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/infer.rs#L2101-L2106</p>
<p>For the <code>FunctionLiteral</code> case of <code>versioned_class</code>, my understanding is that the only live binding of <code>versioned_class</code> at the use is the implementation. If the implementation does not have <code>dataclass_transform</code> applied to it (and instead a prior overload has it), we will not find any <code>dataclass_params</code> in the above code, and will not deem <code>versioned_class</code> to be dataclass-like.</p>
<p>@dhruvmanila I would appreciate any thoughts on how to handle this case. We will need to probably add in some custom behavior to &quot;carry over&quot; the <code>@dataclass_transform</code> decorator between bindings. I am not sure how to do this. I am also not sure whether this has to be done more generally for decorators, instead of just for <code>dataclass_transform</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you very much for working on this! I am planning to do a full review soon. One thing that I hoped would be happening with this PR is that we understand <a href="https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry/blob/ca61f9fa9b3e7f08cee71b1b7f5e49deb390eb27/strawberry/federation/object_type.py#L100-L173"><code>strawberry.type</code></a>. I would imagine that this would cause some ecosystem changes once we do.</p>
<p>But it does not seem to work yet, on your branch:</p>
<p><code>strawberry_test.py:</code></p>

    age: int

<p>Oh, indeed. I must have done something wrong when switching branches. It works as expected — nice!</p>
<p>I expected more ecosystem changes in strawberry, but it looks like in mypy_primer, we're only checking the &quot;strawberry&quot; subfolder, and not strawberry's tests, which would contain many examples. The occurrences of <code>@strawberry.type</code> inside the &quot;strawberry&quot; source folder are mostly in doc comments.</p>
<p>Sorry for the distraction.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that we should change that. I think it's fine as is. It is configured here: https://github.com/hauntsaninja/mypy_primer/blob/a4e8faf6832df707a36a4225f88ec4dc04733e96/mypy_primer/projects.py#L1517</p>
<p>We use mypy_primer to run ty across a set of open source projects (the ones you see in that linked file). Once for the version on <code>main</code>, and once for the feature branch. It then computes a diff of ty's diagnostics output and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17835#issuecomment-2849381547">posts it as a PR comment</a></p>
