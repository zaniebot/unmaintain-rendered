# [doc] Update FAQ on Flake8 for structural pattern matching

---

_Pull request opened by @YDX-2147483647 on 2023-03-13 01:53_

Structural pattern matching ([PEP 622](https://peps.python.org/pep-0622/), `match`–`case`, tracked by #282) was implemented in #3047, [v0.0.250](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.250).

Relates-to: #3091 where the compatibility was (partially) re-added.
