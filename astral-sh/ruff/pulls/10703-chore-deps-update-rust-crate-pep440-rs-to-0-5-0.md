### ⚠ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package pep440_rs@0.4.0 --precise 0.5.0
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `pep440_rs = "^0.4.0"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.5.0
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `pyproject-toml v0.9.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `pyproject-toml = "^0.9.0"` (locked to 0.9.0) of package `ruff_linter v0.3.4 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/ruff/crates/ruff_linter)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `ruff_linter` (locked to 0.3.4) of package `ruff v0.3.4 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/ruff/crates/ruff)`
perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?

```
