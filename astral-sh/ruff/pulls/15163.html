            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Does this mean that clicking <em>New issue</em> now always requires clicking on <em>Bug report</em>?</p>
<p>The old issue template intended something extremely lightweight. Our goal is to keep opening an issue as simple as possible without requiring any specific structure. While the new template looks okay, I think it&#x27;s more structured than we want.</p>
<p>I think the best first step is to mimic what we had before: A single markdown field with a default text.</p>

<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, yes (though one can also choose to click the &quot;Open a blank issue&quot; link at the bottom).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, yeah I think this is somewhat annoying and can be confusing. E.g., what are you supposed to do when you don&#x27;t want to open a bug report? It might be confusing enough that people click away.</p>
<p>Considering all this, I&#x27;m leaning toward removing the template and we can explore something similar to uv&#x27;s <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9452">astral-sh/uv#9452</a> if we see details missing in many new issues</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR does need a new &quot;Feature request&quot; template to go with &quot;Bug report&quot;. I think these two will account for the vast majority of cases. People who are more involved with the project will know what to do with the blank template.</p>

<p>That reminds me, uv also has <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/1fb7f352b117ec3751a91391c0f6c34aab87acf9/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md">a similarly outdated issue template</a>. I&#x27;ll submit a PR over there too once we decide what to do with this one.</p>

<p>Yeah, but there are many more cases: changes to existing rules, questions, black deviations, style requests, etc.</p>
<p>My preferred solution remains just to remove the template, considering that we haven&#x27;t been using the issue templates for a few weeks and that the issues opened during this time have been as good as before.</p>
