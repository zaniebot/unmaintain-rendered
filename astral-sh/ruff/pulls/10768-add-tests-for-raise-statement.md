# Add tests for `raise` statement

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-04-04 06:48_

## Summary

This PR adds test cases for `raise` statement.

There's one TODO around not allowing yield and starred expression which I want to solve holistically. Otherwise, both expression and statement parsing will be filled with error reporting.
