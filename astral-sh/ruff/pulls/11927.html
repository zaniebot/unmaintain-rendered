Thank you for contributing to Ruff! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5306</p>
<p>The check right now only checks in the first 1024 bytes, and that's really not enough when there's a docstring at the beginning of a file.</p>
<p>A more proper fix might be needed, which might be more complex (and I don't have the <code>rust</code> skills to implement that). But this temporary &quot;fix&quot; might enable more users to use this.</p>
<p>Context: We want to use this rule in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/ and we got blocked because of this hardcoded rule (which TBH took us quite a while to figure out why it was failing since it's not documented).</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>This is already kinda tested, modified the test for the new byte number.</p>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks okay, although I'm not sure why the limit even exists. The only performance issue that I can see is if the regex uses a wildcard at the start. Any regex without a wildcard at the start should end by just testing a few characters.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay it seems that the somewhat arbitrary limit is coming from the original lint rule. I think the limit there makes sense because the rule actually reads the file. The situation for ruff is different because we already have the file in memory.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for contributing!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here's the regex:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/2e7c3454e0d4ef24b6d46c7ec5fac7eab56ae907/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_copyright/settings.rs#L18</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<pre><code>(?i)Copyright\s+((?:\(C\)|©)\s+)?\d{4}((-|,\s)\d{4})*
</code></pre>
<p>And the search is using <code>Regex::find</code>, which is an unanchored search. So the regex behaves as if there is a <code>(?s:.)*?</code> at the beginning. So putting a limit on how much is searched seems sensible if you only expect it to be near the beginning of file <em>and</em> it's plausible that this could be used to search very large files. I doubt 4096 and 1024 will make much of a difference, so this change seems okay.</p>
