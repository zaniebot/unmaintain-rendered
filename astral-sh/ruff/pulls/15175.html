<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My company has issue codes longer than 6 characters, and I imagine we're not the only ones. The current maximum value of 6 characters seems arbitrary (please correct me if I'm missing something), so I chose the value of 12, since that would easily cover every issue code my company uses (and I sincerely doubt there are very many users using codes longer than this).</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I added some additional snapshot checks which cover the new boundary conditions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm leaning towards removing any arbitrary length restrictions and instead simply require that the code has a specific format:</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">        r&quot;^#\s*[A-Z]+\-?\d+$&quot;, // issue code - like &quot;TD003&quot;

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice, thank you.</p>
<p>Our current implementation matches the Regex of the upstream flake8-todos implementation. I tried to figure out the reason from the upstream blame but without success, because <a href="https://github.com/orsinium-labs/flake8-todos/blame/master/flake8_todos/_rules.py">the blame</a> doesn't allow me to go past the most recent revision for the regex line). I also checked the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/3921">PR adding</a> rule to see if there's any discussion around what issue formats to support, but I couldn't find any.</p>
<p>That said, I think it's fine to remove the length restriction. It helps to remove some false positives, like in your case, and I think it's unlikely to reduce true positives, considering that the format is unlikely to be used in a regular comment. I'd prefer to remove it entirely instead of just bumping it to 12.</p>
<p>We also need to update the rule's documentation because it mentions <em>up to 6</em> which would now be outdated.</p>
