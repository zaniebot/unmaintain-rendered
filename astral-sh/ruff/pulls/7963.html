Summary
<p>Refactor for isort implementation. Closes #7738.</p>
<p>I introduced a <code>NatOrdString</code> and a <code>NatOrdStr</code> type to have a naturally ordered <code>String</code> and <code>&amp;str</code>, and I pretty much went back to the original implementation based on <code>module_key</code>, <code>member_key</code> and <code>sorted_by_cached_key</code> from itertools. I tried my best to avoid unnecessary allocations but it may have been clumsy in some places, so feedback is appreciated! I also renamed the <code>Prefix</code> enum to <code>MemberType</code> (and made some related adjustments) because I think this fits more what it is, and it&#x27;s closer to the wording found in the isort documentation.</p>
<p>I think the result is nicer to work with, and it should make implementing #1567 and the like easier :)</p>
<p>Of course, I am very much open to any and all remarks on what I did!</p>
Test Plan


<p>I didn&#x27;t add any test, I am relying on the existing tests since this is just a refactor.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It should be because both <code>module_key</code> and <code>member_key</code> return a tuple with first <code>maybe_lower_case_name</code> (which is <code>Some(name.to_lowercase())</code> if <code>settings.case_sensitive</code> is false, otherwise <code>None</code>) and then the module/member name.</p>
<p>So if <code>settings.case_sensitive</code> is true, then we just compare the names using <code>natord::compare</code>, and if it&#x27;s false we first compare the lowercase names with <code>natord::compare</code>, and then the actual names.</p>
<p>I guess the question is, is comparing two strings that have been turned into lowercase with <code>natord::compare</code> the same as comparing them directly with <code>natord::compare_ignore_case</code>? I looked at the <a href="https://docs.rs/natord/latest/src/natord/lib.rs.html#142-153">source code</a> for <code>natord::compare_ignore_case</code> and they&#x27;re just calling <code>to_lowercase</code> on the <code>char</code>s individually, but apart from that it seems like what I did should be equivalent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess to do that we would need to use a <code>Cow</code>. What we could do is have a single <code>NatOrdStr</code> struct like this:</p>
<pre><code>use std::borrow::Cow;

struct NatOrdStr&lt;&#x27;a&gt;(Cow&lt;&#x27;a, str&gt;);
</code></pre>
<p>whose contents are either owned or borrowed.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t played around with <code>Cow</code>s much, so I don&#x27;t know if the overhead is low enough to make it worthwhile to avoid that allocation in case the string is already lowercase, what do you think? If you think it is I&#x27;ll gladly tweak my implementation :) but in that case I think it&#x27;s better to use that <code>Cow</code>-based struct everywhere rather than just for <code>maybe_lower_case_name</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it is slightly different, because they also map integers to avoid sorting them lexicographically, right? For example, to avoid putting <code>module10</code> before <code>module2</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh I thought you were talking about the fact that there are two function calls (one case sensitive and one case insensitive).</p>
<p>The correct natrural ordering (typically <code>module2</code> comes before <code>module10</code>) is indeed correctly captured in my refactor because I&#x27;m relying on <code>natord::compare</code> to implement the <code>Ord</code> trait for my types. Was that the question?</p>

<p>Absolutely no need to apologize, I totally understand and I&#x27;m very grateful that you took the time to look deeper into my proposal 🙏
I really appreciate that and I&#x27;m super excited this got merged! 😁</p>
<p>Now I can go back to implementing length sort ^^</p>
