            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A PEP-695 type parameter creates a binding that is tracked by Ruff's semantic model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f[S](): ...
    # ^ `S` symbol bound here
</code></pre>
<p>But if the type parameter has a bound or constraint, the range of the <code>Binding</code> recorded by Ruff's semantic model includes the bounds or constraints of the type parameter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f[T: int](): ...
    # ^^^^^^ Semantic model's `Binding` for `T` has this range

def g[U: (int, str)](): ...
    # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Semantic models' binding for `U` has this range
</code></pre>
<p>This is problematic, as <code>S: int</code> is not a valid Python identifier, and nor is <code>T: (int, str)</code>. All other bindings in Ruff's semantic model have their range point to the <em>name</em> that is bound, not the full expression/statement that creates the binding. A specific effect that this has is that if you have a <code>Binding</code> <code>x</code> that points to a PEP-695 type parameter, calling <code>x.name(source)</code> does not actually return the name of the PEP-695 type parameter. Instead, if <code>x</code> pointed to the binding for <code>T</code> in the example above, calling <code>x.name(source)</code> would return <code>&quot;T: int&quot;</code>, and if <code>x</code> pointed to the binding for <code>U</code>, calling <code>x.name(source)</code> would return <code>&quot;U: (int, str)&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>This PR changes the range for PEP-695 bindings so that it points to the name that is bound by the type parameter. This makes these <code>Binding</code>s consistent with other bindings, makes <code>Binding::name()</code> work as expected in all situations, allows us to simplify some code in the implementation of the PYI019 rule, and unblocks #15862</p>

<p>Do you expect that this breaks any diagnostic range? E.g. do you know if the binding range is used in any diagnostic / fix code? I know, this is probably hard to figure out, just something that I'm slightly worried about but relying on our tests/user reports might be fine to catch this.</p>

<p>It's very hard to tell... :(</p>

<p>Agreed, and this is partly why I wanted to separate this out as a separate PR from #15862 (see my comment in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15862#discussion_r1940982081). This is also why I worked around the bug in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15888 rather than fixing it prior to making that PR... but then @ntBre ran into exactly the same bug the next day in #15862! And I don't think it'll be so easy to workaround the bug in his PR. Plus, <code>Binding::name()</code> not working consistently for all bindings is a massive footgun. So I think it's time to fix the bug.</p>
<p>The fact that none of our snapshots change and the ecosystem check is clean gives me confidence that, if this <em>does</em> change our user-facing behaviour in some cases, they're at least rare/edge cases. And PEP-695 type parameters are anyway new syntax that are still rarely used in the real world. So I <em>think</em> we're good here.</p>
