            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Simplification follow-up to #15413.</p>
<p>There's no need to have a dedicated <code>CallOutcome</code> variant for every known function, it's only necessary if the special-cased behavior of the known function includes emitting extra diagnostics. For <code>typing.cast</code>, there's no such need; we can use the regular <code>Callable</code> outcome variant, and update the return type according to the cast. (This is the same way we already handle <code>len</code>.)</p>
<p>One reason to avoid proliferating unnecessary <code>CallOutcome</code> variants is that currently we have to explicitly add emitting call-binding diagnostics, for each outcome variant. So we were previously wrongly silencing any binding diagnostics on calls to <code>typing.cast</code>. Fixing this revealed a separate bug, that we were emitting a bogus error anytime more than one keyword argument mapped to a <code>**kwargs</code> parameter. So this PR also adds test and fix for that bug.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Existing <code>cast</code> tests pass unchanged, added new test for <code>**kwargs</code> bug.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries! Both approaches are reasonable, and the issue of missing binding diagnostics is very subtle, and due to the fact that binding diagnostics are integrated in a very hacky way right now. Looking forward to your outcomes refactor hopefully improving that!</p>
