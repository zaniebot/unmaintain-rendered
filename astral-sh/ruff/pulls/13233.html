<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This change configures git to be able to run from within the devcontainer.</p>
<p>It also 'installs' pre-commit.</p>
<p>I was following https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/contributing/#prerequisites and realized that it is better to just build on top of current devcontainer infra that is already supported by the community, and have even fewer manual steps.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>This was tested by running locally.</p>
<h2>Naturally SQUASH the commits :-)</h2>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm a bit hesitant to enforce pre-commit to contributors inside the dev containers or more generally I'm hesitant to install anything other than the required tools to be able to contribute to Ruff. I, personally, don't install the hooks and run them manually as I might commit a lot.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i guess it ultimately is comes down to the prevailing preference.  I generally prefer about anything I might want to be installed, and I can always disable.  BUT, I understand the alternative, so can close this PR.</p>
