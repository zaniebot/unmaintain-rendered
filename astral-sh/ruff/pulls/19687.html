            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I ran into some nightmarish borrow-check issues in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19669">astral-sh/ruff#19669</a> that were hard to figure out. This PR fixes them -- but I&#x27;m splitting it out of #19669 because it seems like a nice simplification on its own merits (it simplifies all callsites of the <code>py_slice</code> method), and helps reduce the diff to review for that PR.</p>
<p>I had to enlist @oconnor663&#x27;s help to understand the lifetime issues I was running into in #19669. Quoting his analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the problem was the signature of <code>PySlice::py_slice</code>, specifically its <code>&amp;&#x27;db</code> self parameter. in our case, <code>tuple</code> is a borrowed local variable, and this is saying that that borrow needs to live for <code>&#x27;db</code>, which is impossible.</p>
<p>that lifetime bound is there because we&#x27;re returning <code>impl Iterator&lt;Item = &amp;&#x27;db Self::Item&gt;</code>. the references we&#x27;re returning can&#x27;t outlive <code>self</code>, so we need to get rid of <code>&#x27;db</code> there too. but that leads to another issue, which I expect was the motivation for sprinkling <code>&#x27;db</code> around everywhere in the first place.</p>
<pre><code>error[E0491]: in type `&amp;&lt;Self as PySlice&lt;&#x27;db&gt;&gt;::Item`, reference has a longer lifetime than the data it references
   --&gt; crates/ty_python_semantic/src/util/subscript.rs:119:31
    |
119 |     ) -&gt; Result&lt;impl Iterator&lt;Item = &amp;Self::Item&gt;, StepSizeZeroError&gt;;
    |                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>I think the wording of that error is misleading. It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re saying the lifetime of <code>&amp;self</code> is longer than <code>&#x27;db</code>, it&#x27;s just that those are two independent lifetimes, and we haven&#x27;t said anything about how they relate. We know that <code>&amp;self</code> is short lived, and the type system can see that in our impl blocks, because there <code>&#x27;db</code> is a type parameter of Self (which I think implicitly requires that <code>Self</code> doesn&#x27;t outlive <code>&#x27;db</code>). But in the trait definition there&#x27;s nothing saying that <code>Self</code> is bound by <code>&#x27;db</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@oconnor663 has an alternative patch at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/36a8edaf4bc71f886dfefa8cbe356005d618d082 that also fixes these issues, and continues the behaviour on <code>main</code> whereby <code>PySlice</code> is implemented for all <code>[T]</code> (this PR changes this: <code>PySlice</code> is now only implemented for all <code>[T]</code> where <code>T: Copy</code>). I <em>weakly</em> prefer my version here, because it simplifies all callsites of the trait method, and iterating over references to <code>Type</code>s feels a <em>bit</em> silly when we know they&#x27;re all <code>Copy</code>. But I&#x27;m happy to go with Jack&#x27;s solution too, if we&#x27;d prefer to continue implementing the trait for <code>[T]</code> where <code>T: !Copy</code>!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I wrote that code initially. Sorry that it caused problems. I vaguely remember seeing/thinking about those problems back then, but I don&#x27;t have the full context anymore. Seems like two people are involved already, so I&#x27;ll leave it up to you two to decide whichever solution you prefer.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the only person who might have a strong opinion is @sharkdp as the original author of this trait, and he&#x27;s left it up to us 😆</p>
<p>The only current users of the trait are <code>[Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;]</code>, <code>[u8]</code> and <code>[char]</code>: <code>Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;</code>, <code>u8</code> and <code>char</code> are all <code>Copy</code>. I can&#x27;t see why we&#x27;d want to use it with a <code>[T]</code> where <code>T: !Copy</code>, and I think we can easily revisit this question if that does come up as an annoyance in the future.</p>
