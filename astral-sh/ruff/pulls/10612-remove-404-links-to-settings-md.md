# Remove 404 links to settings.md

The settings.md seems gone, and I couldn't find a better link than the link already included at the end of the paragraph.

Thank you.

The link to unsafe fixes seems to be working fine when viewing the [documentation on the website](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#ruff-tried-to-fix-something-but-it-broke-my-code-whats-going-on). Any chance you opened the faq.md directly on the repository?

Ahh - yes I might have done that! Then maybe this is not a good change :-)
