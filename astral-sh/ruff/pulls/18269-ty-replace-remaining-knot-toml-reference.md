# [ty] Replace remaining knot.toml reference

---

_@sharkdp_

## Summary

Fix remaining `knot.toml` reference and replace it with `ty.toml`. This change was probably still in flight while we renamed things.

## Test Plan

Added a second assertion which ensures that the config file has any effect.
