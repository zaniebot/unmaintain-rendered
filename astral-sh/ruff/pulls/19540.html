            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note: I purposely removed this TODO. It's unrelated to the other parts of this PR, but this was a convenient time to remove it. I previously thought that &quot;goto&quot; for TypedDict subscripts was supported in pylance, but it turns out it is not supported. While this is something that could certainly be added at some point in the future, we should probably wait for users to request it before making it a priority.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. I'll waiting for the moment where this all becomes too much and we'll need to rewrite the playground to run ty in a web worker. Probably something that claude can help us when we reach that point</p>
