We could change `CFormatErrorType` to use `CFormatErrorKind` and use `kind` field instead but I've avoided that for now as `typ` still needs to be ignored because it's used in third-party dependencies. `TYP` should be removed once the redirect is removed.

I think I'm going to wait before merging this PR as this is an upstream crate and I'm not sure what's the process of updating it is. ~I could upstream this change~ (https://github.com/rust-lang/annotate-snippets-rs/pull/182). cc @BurntSushi

I think I'm going to merge this, I've opened a PR to update this upstream as well. Happy to make any changes in a follow-up as needed.

I think this change is fine, but in general the idea is to minimize the diff between our code and upstream as much as possible. That way, if we want to bring in patches from upstream, it's less of a hassle.

I don't know how long this will last or if it's a viable long term strategy, but it's what has been guiding my changes to our vendored copy so far. e.g., There's a lot of other stuff I would want to change too and general code clean-up and what not, but specifically decided against it to keep the diff minimal.

Thanks, that makes sense, I'll keep that in mind. The upstream PR is merged, so this shouldn't result in any diff.
