<p>Changes RUF006 to allow private vars.</p>
<p>I believe this is a reasonable addition, private declarations surely satisfy the underlying needs.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should document this pattern and explain the reasoning why we allow it.</p>
<p>To me it's not entirely clear if allowing it is in the spirit of the rule. I suspect you're coming from rusts <code>let _ = returns_result()</code> convention that allows suppressing the <code>must_use</code> error?.</p>
<p>@AlexWaygood any thoughts?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser this makes sense to me. This rule isn't a stylistic rule, it's a correctness rule. You need to have a reference to the <code>asyncio</code> task or it will be garbage-collected, which is almost never what you want. From the perspective of Python's garbage collector, it doesn't matter whether you assign it to a private name or a public name.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the docs for this rule already explain the motivation for the rule quite well, so I don't think extra documentation is required here</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I discussed this offline with @MichaReiser and I think I misunderstood what this PR was trying to do.</p>
<p>@diceroll123, the fixture snippet you've added looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import asyncio

def f():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    _task = loop.create_task(main())
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff will indeed emit a RUF006 error on this currently, but it's not because it's a private variable. It's because the function could exit immediately after the <code>loop.create_task()</code> call, which will lead to the <code>_task</code> variable immediately being cleaned up since it's only a local variable. If you change your example to this, Ruff no longer complains about it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import asyncio

def f():
    global _task
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    _task = loop.create_task(main())
</code></pre>
<p>I'm no longer convinced I agree with the change being proposed here. I think the bug that the rule is trying to protect you from applies just as much to tasks assigned to variables that start with underscores. Could you maybe give a little more detail about your motivation for making this PR?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm, good points all around.</p>
<p>The usage in my codebase that made me make this PR is deep within a forever-running async loop, so I suppose I overlooked what Alex has brought up.</p>
