            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/473.</p>
<p>If <code>invalid-return-type</code> is emitted on a method with an empty body on a non-protocol subclass of a protocol class, the user probably meant for the non-protocol class to actually be a protocol class too. Add a nice subdiagnostic explaining why we do not infer the concrete subclass as being a protocol class.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We already have a function <code>enclosing_class_symbol</code> (which should probably be renamed because it returns a Type,  not a Symbol) -- seems like there's likely redundancy between this method and that one?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given that there were two different uses of this method, and both now become significantly more verbose, would it really be a problem to keep this method as short-hand, even though it's body would now be a one-liner?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In one of the two use cases (the one where we now want to retain the enclosing class context even if the class is not a protocol class), I think it would be a mistake to use this method, because you'd end up doing a lot of work twice in quick succession. So I feel like it's sort-of a footgun to keep it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, that existing function continues iterating up through scopes until it finds a class scope, whereas this new function should only return <code>Some(class)</code> if <code>class</code> is either the immediate parent scope <em>or</em> the immediate parent scope is a type-parameters scope and <code>class</code> is the grandparent scope. So they're doing subtly different things. I'll rename the other one and add doc-comments to both to explain the differences.</p>
