# Remove `--line-length` option from `format` command

---

_Pull request opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-10-23 09:27_

## Summary

This PR removes the undocumented `--line-length` setting from the `format` command.
The main reason is that we should either support all formatter options or none of them. I would prefer not supporting formatter options via the CLI.  

We can reintroduce the option in the beta based on user feedback.

## Test Plan

```bash
cargo run --bin ruff -q -- format . --line-length=100
error: unexpected argument '--line-length' found
```

So what is the way to set a global line length that works across projects in VS Code?  https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode/issues/6

_Comment by @MichaReiser on 2024-02-20 17:19_

You can use `--config line-length=100` in the most recent version of ruff

Em, it seems not working. Is the following correct? I am using ruff v0.2.2.
```
  "ruff.path": ["/opt/homebrew/bin/ruff"],
  "ruff.args": [
    "--config",
    "line-length=100"
  ],
```

The option should either be `ruff.lint.args` or `ruff.format.args`. See [configuring ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode#configuring-ruff)

Thanks! `"ruff.format.args": ["--config", "line-length=79"]` works.
