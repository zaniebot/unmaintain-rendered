            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds support for <code>knot.toml</code> files during project discovery.</p>
<p><code>knot.toml</code> files take precedence over any <code>pyproject.toml</code> but we still need to read the <code>pyproject.toml</code>
to get the project's name and any <code>requires-python</code> constraint (not part of this PR).</p>
<p>This PR doesn't add support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading <code>knot.toml</code> files from ancestor directories (hierarchical configuration)</li>
<li>Reading a user configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/219</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added unit test</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I found this name confusing, because the TOML part all happens in <code>discover</code> method, so this method doesn't do anything &quot;from Knot TOML&quot;, it's &quot;from root and options and maybe PyProject&quot;. (I initially had a comment here assuming this method was just a stub for now and the TOML-parsing part was coming in a later PR, and only realized that was wrong once I got to the <code>discover</code> method below.)</p>
<p>I understand now the structure you're going for where <code>from_pyproject</code> and <code>from_knot_toml</code> are parallel, depending which config file we found. I think those two cases share so much, that I would find it clearer if this method were named something more generic (<code>from_options</code>?) and were actually called by <code>from_pyproject</code> as well. Then you also wouldn't need the separate <code>name_from_pyproject</code> method, it could be inlined here. And similarly you'd save repetition in the future with <code>requires-python</code> support.</p>
<p>If you don't like that restructuring, then I think the parallel you are going for would be stronger if the naming was parallel: <code>from_pyproject_toml</code> and <code>from_knot_toml</code> or else <code>from_pyproject</code> and <code>from_knot</code>; I think the latter makes more sense because nothing TOML-related happens in these methods, but I understand <code>from_knot</code> may not be super clear what it's referring to (which is why my preferred option above is to not go for that parallel at all and just make this a more general constructor.)</p>
<p>But up to you.</p>
