            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Related to #13773</p>
<p>This PR adds support for unpacking <code>for</code> statement targets.</p>
<p>This involves updating the <code>value</code> field in the <code>Unpack</code> target to use an enum which specifies the &quot;where did the value expression came from?&quot;. This is because for an iterable expression, we need to unpack the iterator type while for assignment statement we need to unpack the value type itself. And, this needs to be done in the unpack query.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>One of the ways unpacking works in <code>for</code> statement is by looking at the union of the types because if the iterable expression is a tuple then the iterator type will be union of all the types in the tuple. This means that the test cases that will test the unpacking in <code>for</code> statement will also implicitly test the unpacking union logic. I was wondering if it makes sense to merge these cases and only add the ones that are specific to the union unpacking or for statement unpacking logic.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Add test cases involving iterating over a tuple type. I've intentionally left out certain cases for now and I'm curious to know any thoughts on the above query.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is basically the same logic as in the assignment statement, I'm going to wait until I implement unpacking support in other places to get an overview of what can be simplified to avoid repetition.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is actually a bug, calling <code>visit_expr</code> on the expression panics in the following case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">[] = *data
() = *data
</code></pre>
<p>This is because in <code>infer_target</code>, we completely skip the inference when there are no elements in the list / tuple target.</p>
<p>I'm going to fix this in a follow-up.</p>
