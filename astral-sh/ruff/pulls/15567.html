            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for looking into this. The pre-commit currently fails and I don't see a speedup. E.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15566 completed after 3 min where the run on this job failed after 4.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you please rerun the failing test because rhysd/actionlint#507 seems to pass.</p>
<p>The hooks seem to be recreated with each run so perhaps the network io time dwarfs the faster CPU.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I restarted the job but I don't think it will succeed because it seems to error because our github workflow linter doesn't recognize the new runner yet. We probably need to update it first.</p>
