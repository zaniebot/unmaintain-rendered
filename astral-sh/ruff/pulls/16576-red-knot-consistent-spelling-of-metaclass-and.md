# [red-knot] Consistent spelling of "metaclass" and "meta-type"

---

_Pull request opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-03-09 12:27_

## Summary

Fixes a small nit of mine -- we are currently inconsistent in our spelling between "metaclass" and "meta class", and between "meta type" and "meta-type". This PR means that we consistently use "metaclass" and "meta-type".

## Test Plan

`uvx pre-commit run -a`
