            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just as we allow string arguments for <code>cast</code> in <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/runtime-cast-value/#runtime-cast-value-tc006">runtime-cast-value (TC006)</a>, we should allow f-strings, printf-style strings, and formatted strings, since these all evaluate to strings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wonder if it would be better to introduce a generic violation for invalid type expressions, since none of these kinds of strings are actually allowed in type expressions (outside of <code>Annotated</code>, but we remove the type definition flag for those parts of the expression).</p>
<p>That would in theory catch all such problems in the future, rather than having to play whack-a-mole on a rule-by-rule basis, having to check for things that aren&#x27;t actually valid.</p>
<p>In this case I think it makes more sense to disable the affected UP rules inside type definitions.</p>

<p>What if the user disabled the other rule? We&#x27;d still have infinite recursion under some combinations of settings, and that&#x27;s not an acceptable outcome for us unfortunately.</p>

<p>Fair point, ideally the way the way this would work is to make it a special type of diagnostic that silences all other diagnostics contained in the target range, it is emitted even when it is disabled, just silently.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Daverball&#x27;s correct that f-strings are invalid in annotation expressions, though. Since RUF027 is looking for strings that seem like they have f-string syntax but are missing the <code>f</code> prefix, a better fix here might be to just not run RUF027 at all on expressions that we know are meant to be annotation expressions, such as the first argument to <code>cast()</code> or the second argument to the <code>TypeAliasType</code> constructor. (These are almost never &quot;actually meant to be f-strings&quot;.) I think we set a flag on the semantic model when we&#x27;re visiting a type definition? We can probably just return early from RUF027 if we see that flag&#x27;s been set.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yup, the flag you&#x27;re looking for is <code>TYPE_DEFINITION</code> or the method <code>semantic.in_type_definition()</code>.</p>
