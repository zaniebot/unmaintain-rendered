# [minor] Mention UP049 in UP046 and UP047, add `See also` section to UP040

---

_@ntBre_

## Summary

Minor docs follow-up to #15862 to mention UP049 in the UP046 and UP047 `See also` sections. I wanted to mention it in UP040 too but realized it didn't have a `See also` section, so I also added that, adapted from the other two rules.

## Test Plan

cargo test
