            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are there any analogies we can draw to other tools, to help inform the user-facing API for the CLI?</p>
<p>E.g., <code>rustup</code> has <code>rustup toolchain list</code>. Should we have <code>ruff rule list</code> instead of just <code>ruff rule</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes I think it's quite common for commands to default to listing when there's no more apt action, examples that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git branch</code></li>
<li><code>mount</code></li>
<li><code>ip address</code>, <code>ip route</code> (etc. all the <code>ip</code> subcommands)</li>
<li><code>getent &lt;database&gt; [key]</code>, e.g. <code>getent hosts</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>ruff rule list</code> would be ambiguous in case there's a rule named <code>list</code> (which we'll probably never have since it would be a very non-descriptive rule name but it's still nice to avoid such ambiguities).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just want to note that if we want to change <code>explain</code> to <code>rule</code> (I personally think it's a good idea) we should do that before releasing the subcommand refactor so that the release notes in <code>BREAKING_CHANGES.md</code> stay up to date.</p>
<p>To clarify my commit message: At some point in the future we may have:</p>
<p><code>ruff config banned-api</code> to explain the <code>banned-api</code> config option</p>
<p><code>ruff rule banned-api</code> to explain the <code>banned-api</code> rule</p>
<p>... if we only had <code>explain</code> it would have to report both, which would be confusing. And we also would have to introduce separate subcommands for listing linters, rules, config settings ... I think having a setup where one subcommand lists everything by default and shows an individual item with another argument makes more sense.</p>
