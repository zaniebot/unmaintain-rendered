<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes #14695.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>The root cause was tricky to find.
&quot;Complex&quot; forward reference type annotations are handled differently. Forward references are &quot;complex&quot; in this case when the raw contents (without quotes) of the expression with the parsed contents is not contained in the string literal.
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/84748be16341b76e073d117329f7f5f4ee2941ad/crates/ruff_python_parser/src/typing.rs#L65</p>
<p>Annotations are recursively parsed, for instance:
<code>&quot;'int'&quot;</code> (complex) =&gt; <code>&quot;int&quot;</code> (simple)</p>
<p>The raw contents of the expression &quot;in\x74&quot; is not contained in the string literal <code>int</code> and hence requires multiple complex parsing steps: <code>&quot;'in\x74'&quot;</code> (complex) -&gt; <code>&quot;in\x74&quot;</code> (complex). This is rare, and probably that's why the bug went unnoticed.</p>
<p>Parsed type annotations are cached by their start offset:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/84748be16341b76e073d117329f7f5f4ee2941ad/crates/ruff_linter/src/checkers/ast/mod.rs#L2544</p>
<p>As it turned out, for these complex annotations the starting offset was not properly updated (removing the quotes), as well already do for the simple annotations. This caused an infinite loop, and eventually a stack overflow.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Extended the test suite with regression tests.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm a bit confused still. Why are we using the range without quotes for the parsed expression in case of complex annotation? Because for simple annotations, we just use the range without quotes for the original string expression.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think an ideal solution here would be to fix the <code>relocate_expr</code> to transform the entire parsed tree accordingly and then move the <code>range_exluding_quotes</code> in <code>parse_type_annotation</code> which then passes to both <code>parse_simple_type_annotation</code> and <code>parse_complex_type_annotation</code>.</p>
