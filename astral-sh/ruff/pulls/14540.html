            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In #14182 I added &quot;precise&quot; per-TypeVar type inference for attributes of a typevar (<code>__bound__</code>, <code>__constraints__</code>, <code>__default__</code>). This wasn't motivated so much by the real-world need for this precise inference, as it was by wanting to test the correctness of our internal representation of the typevar, via an mdtest.</p>
<p>The implementation I added was unfortunately just wrong. The problem is that our internal representation cares about the bound/constraints/default inferred as a type expression, while the runtime attributes of the <code>TypeVar</code> object will return it as a value expression.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, this means that for a typevar <code>[T: A]</code>, while we might store the bound as the Instance type <code>A</code>, the value of the <code>__bound__</code> attribute should be typed as <code>type[A]</code>.</p>
<p>Beguiled by the simple case, I slapped on a <code>.to_meta_type()</code> and called it a day. But this is just wrong in more complex cases; the meta-type is not always the same thing as the &quot;type form&quot; type. For example, the meta-type of <code>A | B</code> is <code>type[A] | type[B]</code>, but the type-form type in this case would be an instance of <code>types.UnionType</code>.</p>
<p>In a future world with PEP 747 (<code>TypeForm</code>), where we have a typevar with a bound of <code>A | B</code> it would be correct for us to infer its <code>__bound__</code> attribute as <code>TypeForm[A | B]</code>, offering a nicer solution to this problem.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think we should just follow the lead of other type checkers in falling back to the general typeshed types for these attributes, and I should bite the bullet and write a Rust test instead of an mdtest when I want to test internal representations of types that don't (yet, since we haven't implemented generics) have a visible effect in the type system.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Re-wrote an mdtest as a Rust test.</p>
