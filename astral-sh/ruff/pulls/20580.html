            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In #7047 some logic was added to comment placement in order to address a panic in #6898 . I believe that panic was caused by old behavior of <code>SimpleTokenizer</code> that is no longer present, because it does not occur if the new logic is simply removed.</p>
<p>This was discovered while trying to figure out the potential side-effects of #20578 - I originally was going to augment the logic to include t-strings here, but discovered that you could instead just remove it (unless I missed something?)</p>

<p>Can you explain what this new logic is? Reading https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6898. My impression is that the issue is that the <code>SimpleTokenizer</code> doesn't support lexing strings. This hasn't changed.</p>
<p>To me, it also seems that the comment is still true because the interpolated element's range only covers <code>{1}</code> but maybe that's fine?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can't comment there but doesn't this change result in the <code>SimpleTokenizer</code> trying to lex <code>' # comment</code> on line 136. This would be invalid because the <code>SimpleTokenizer</code> should never be pointed inside a string.</p>
