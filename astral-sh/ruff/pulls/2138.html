            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Following up on another discussion point from https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/2038, that violations should go together with the rules.</p>
<p>I noticed while doing this that some rules have multiple violations. I don't know if this will be a problem when it comes to the idea regarding auto generating documentation. Should there be a 1:1 rule:violation mapping?</p>
<p>I also notice in the registry that there are things under pycodestyle errors but they're not rules in the pycodestyle module. Haven't looked into it yet to determine if they should be.</p>
