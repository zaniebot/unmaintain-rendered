            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our preferred style for pinning dependencies is to put the pins in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file in the repository root. So you&#x27;d put <code>dir-test = &quot;0.3.0&quot;</code> in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file in the repository root, and in this <code>Cargo.toml</code> file you&#x27;d just put <code>dir-test = { workspace = true }</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This certainly makes the tests run a lot faster! Unfortunately, that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re not actually testing anything anymore 😄 You need to make sure you&#x27;re actually still calling <code>red_knot_test::run()</code> on the path after you&#x27;ve &quot;cleaned the path up&quot; :-)</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The way these tests work is a macro generates (at build time) a Rust test for each file in a specific directory. Each generated test runs <code>red_knot_test::run()</code> on a specific Markdown file here. The <code>red_knot_test::run()</code> call is the part of the test that actually makes assertions that red-knot is running correctly:</p>

<p>Your PR currently removes this call, meaning that the macro is generating a lot of tests, but those tests aren&#x27;t really testing anything :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! This LGTM. I confirmed it implements the feature @MichaReiser asked for, and that the tests still fail correctly if there&#x27;s an incorrect assertion in a <code>.md</code> file. The tests also <em>appear</em> to be running slightly faster for me locally as well, which is nice!</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll wait for another approval before merging, though, as I&#x27;m pretty new to <code>dir-test</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @Aditya-PS-05. Thanks again for the PR! It was really useful, and an important improvement.</p>
<p>GitHub issue trackers and PR threads aren&#x27;t really the best place to ask for this kind of advice. There are forums such as Reddit and various programming Discord servers where volunteers are often very happy to give this kind of advice, but on GitHub we prefer to be more focussed on specific coding projects and problems :-)</p>
<p>That said, my advice would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Continue submitting open-source PRs! I managed to get hired on the back of my open-source experience, so it&#x27;s definitely possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on PRs where you&#x27;re confident you understand how to fix the problem. A PR that doesn&#x27;t really address an issue or that approaches an issue in completely the wrong way can end up meaning that a maintainer has to spend more time reviewing and fixing the PR than they would have spent if they just did it themselves.</p>
<p>This PR wasn&#x27;t that -- I think it did save us some time! It did also have some important mistakes in it at the start, though, which I think could possibly have been avoided if you&#x27;d taken some more time to think about the problem before submitting the PR.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your ability to make excellent PRs will improve if you continue to improve your programming ability in other ways as well. Read lots of code, watch YouTube programming tutorials, read tutorials/howtos/StackOverflow questions, continue to work on your own hobby projects. You don&#x27;t have to do all of these, but they&#x27;re all great ways to continue learning and developing your skills, and they&#x27;ll all make you a better open-source contributor in the long run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps. Good luck with your coding journey! :-)</p>
