<p>I'm not sure if it makes sense to update the stdlib if Ruff doesn't have support for Python 3.15. I think I'd prefer to wait for when we add Python 3.15 support once the beta is closer, to ensure that we don't ship with a stale stdlib for 3.15</p>

<p>Sure, feel free to close this PR if you think it's just noise in  the PR pool ATM.</p>

<p>What is the approach when supporting a new Python version? When will users can set <code>python-version = &quot;PY315&quot;</code> for example? (even if it's still considered experimental)</p>
<p>Does ruff have a contributer's guide on when  to implement support for new Python  versions?</p>

<p>In the past, we waited for the new Python version to be closer to beta to avoid implementing features that don't end up being stabilized (or have to change the semantics multiple times).</p>

<p>We don't have a contributor guide for adding support for a new Python version but you can search for the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Apython314"><code>python314</code></a> label to see the relevant PRs for adding Python 3.14. That should give you a good idea on how we go about it.</p>
