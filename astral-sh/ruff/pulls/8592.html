            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This brings ruff's behavior in line with what <code>pep8-naming</code> already does and thus closes #8397.</p>
<p>I had initially implemented this to look at the last segment of a dotted path only when the entry in the <code>*-decorators</code> setting started with a <code>.</code>, but in the end I thought it's better to remain consistent w/ <code>pep8-naming</code> and doing a match against the last segment of the decorator name in any case.</p>
<p>If you prefer to diverge from this in favor of less ambiguity in the configuration let me know and I'll change it so you would need to put e.g. <code>.expression</code> in the <code>classmethod-decorators</code> list.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Tested against the file in the issue linked below, plus the new testcase added in this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @ThiefMaster! I just modified the PR to break the logic out into standalone functions, and we also now always run the match checks rather than only if it's <em>not</em> an import.</p>
