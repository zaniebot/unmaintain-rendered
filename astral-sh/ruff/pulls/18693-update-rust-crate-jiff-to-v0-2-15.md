### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.2.15`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0215-2025-06-13)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.14...0.2.15)

\===================
This release fixes a bug where error values were being constructed during
parsing even in the success case. This was a regression introduced in `0.2.14`
as a result of trying to improve compilation times. Thankfully, fixing this
regression doesn't seem to meaningfully impact the amount of IR generated by
compiling Jiff.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;385](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/385):
    Fixes a performance regression for parsing.
