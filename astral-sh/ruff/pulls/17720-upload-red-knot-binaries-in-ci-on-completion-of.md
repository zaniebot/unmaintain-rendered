# Upload red-knot binaries in CI on completion of linux tests

_Pull request opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-04-29 20:00_

This is a preparatory PR for https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17719. It needs to be split into a separate commit or CI wouldn't pass on that PR, since that PR needs to download a baseline binary from somewhere.
