            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>It&#x27;s a good practice to write configuration as a multiline list with trailing commas. Such a format allows you to have a simple and clear diff when you maintain configuration.</p>
<p>Having comments per rule is much more easy to support than one comment for all of them.</p>
<p>My changes break a pattern for numbers per config section, not only do some of them have numbers, but maybe remove other numbers as well.</p>
<p>Documentation page that will be updated: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on the documentation.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a strong agreement that one is preferred. Especially in documentation where a more dense form can improve readability. I prefer to keep the documentation as is to save some space. But interested to hear what others think</p>
