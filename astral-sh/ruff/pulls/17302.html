<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Add more narrowing analysis for match statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>add narrowing constraints from guard expressions</li>
<li>add negated constraints from previous predicates and guards to subsequent cases</li>
</ul>
<p>This PR doesn't address that guards can mutate your subject, and so theoretically invalidate some of these narrowing constraints that you've previously accumulated. Some prior art on this issue <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~scherer/research/mutable-patterns/mutable-patterns-mlworkshop2024-abstract.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Add some new tests, and update some existing ones</p>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>We should add a test for this that's not part of the star-import tests, and figure out what we need to adjust in this PR in order to avoid regressing it.</p>
<p>I pushed my rebase and one slightly expanded comment, but I need to move on to other things for now, so I'll consider this PR back in your court.</p>

<p>it turns out it was just that I had copied the Stmt::If branch too closely: in the case of If, you must visit the test expression in the &quot;no branch taken&quot; flow because we need to evaluate the test before we can know it's False(y)</p>
<p>In the case of match statements, however, visiting the pattern implies undertaking symbol bindings, which we definitely don't want to track on the &quot;no case matched&quot; flow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for revisiting this!</p>
<p>Looks like we are now seeing a panic in one of the corpus tests, where we enter what should be an unreachable code path. We seem to simultaneously think there is a binding visible for a symbol, while the &quot;unbound&quot; initial state for that symbol is also definitely-visible -- that combination shouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>I took a quick glance at the code changes and nothing jumped out at me; let me know if you aren't able to figure out the reason and I can take a closer look.</p>
