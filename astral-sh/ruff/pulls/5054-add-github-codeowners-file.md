What's the process by which this is kept up-to-date? (E.g., if we add new directories, or rename, or remove?)

I'm seeing a message on top of the file saying "This CODEOWNERS file is valid". I believe GitHub checks it against the repository. Let me do a quick commit and verify.

If not, we could use https://github.com/mszostok/codeowners-validator although it seems to be not maintained anymore.

Hmm, I think GitHub seems to be only checking for syntax. Also, the `codeowners-validator` is giving me segmentation fault :(

The path could contain patterns as well but if we don't use patterns then we could do a manual check on just the existence of path in CI.

_Review comment by @charliermarsh on `.github/CODEOWNERS`:87 on 2023-06-14 03:23_

In that case, I might vote to only include the folders for which we're enforcing rules, and add them as we go. What do you think?

Yeah, makes sense. Do you have any other folders in mind? (I'll comment out the rest before merging)

_Review comment by @charliermarsh on `.github/CODEOWNERS`:87 on 2023-06-14 04:22_

Na, that's fine, I may add some later :)

Also: it may be easier just to remove rather than comment-out, since they'll probably get stale if we don't maintain them?
