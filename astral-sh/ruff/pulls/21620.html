            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It's currently pretty painful to have ty's workspace diagnostics enabled in the Ruff repo, because ty will proceed to type-check every single fixture in the <code>ruff_linter</code> crate, resulting in &gt;10,000 diagnostics. This PR disables ty workspace diagnostics if you're browsing this repo inside VSCode.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>On this branch, I no longer have &gt;10,000 diagnostics reported in the <code>problems</code> tab in VSCode, despite having the ty-vscode plugin installed and despite having this setting in my VSCode user settings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">    &quot;ty.diagnosticMode&quot;: &quot;workspace&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>yeah, kinda:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want workspace diagnostics enabled for all my Python projects, so I enabled that in my user settings, and it was great, I love it</li>
<li>But then I opened up Ruff and hoo boy, I cannot deal with that many diagnostics in the problem tab</li>
<li>So I went to disable it in the workspace settings for Ruff, and that was nice, now I have workspace diagnostics enabled for all my Python projects but not for this one special project (Ruff) that isn't really a Python project but happens to have literally thousands of lines of Python that happen to be deliberately of questionable quality</li>
<li>But oh no, now I can't do <code>git commit -am</code> anymore because Ruff apparently commits <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> into source control for some reason rather than <code>.gitignor</code>ing it. So PR'ing it up (as I'm doing here) is the only solution here, it seems?</li>

<p>Well that seems as good a reason as any, ship it</p>
