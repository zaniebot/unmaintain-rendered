            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb - Do you have an opinion on this issue more broadly (of fixes that delete comments)? I could see us marking them as unsafe, or as display, or omitting them entirely as in this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(I am the author of the original issue.) If possible, I would prefer to just put the autofix below the comments, as it is otherwise a good fix as you said.</p>
<p>Another option could be to write the autofix over multiple lines keeping the comments in place, but I suspect that would be much more difficult to implement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">-nums.append(4)
+nums.extend((4,
# Critically important comment 1
-nums.append(5)
+5,
# Critically important comment 2
-nums.append(6)
+6))

<p>This seems to already be an unsafe fix. I'd actually then go with display only for this one.</p>

<p>Yeah, we'd probably need to use LibCST to construct the fix instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going forward with the current solution as it's consistent with various other rules (<code>PT014</code>, <code>SIM117</code>, <code>SIM102</code>, etc.) where comments doesn't generate the fix but feel free to suggest otherwise.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel like all of those should just be unsafe. I don't think we should prevent the user from accessing the fix due to comments -- they should just have to opt in. But I'd like @zanieb's opinion too. (Not asking for any changes right now.)</p>
