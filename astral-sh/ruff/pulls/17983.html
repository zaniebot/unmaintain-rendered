            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was suggested on Discord, I hope this is roughly what we had in mind. I took the message from the ty README, but I'm more than happy to update it. Otherwise I just tried to mimic the appearance of the <code>ruff analyze graph</code> warning (although I'm realizing now the whole text is bold for ruff).</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>New warnings in the CLI tests. I thought this might be undesirable but it looks like uv did the same thing (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6166).</p>

<p>I actually <em>only</em> see color on the warning (and other logging) with <code>-vvv</code>, not with any of the lower verbosity levels. Is that expected?</p>
<p>(updating the snapshots then I'll push the <code>tracing::warn</code> version)</p>
