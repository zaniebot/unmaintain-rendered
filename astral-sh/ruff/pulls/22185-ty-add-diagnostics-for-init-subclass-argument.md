It's not very satisfying how big the `check_class_definitions` function is becoming, but refactors aside I think this is probably a reasonable place to add these checks? This is not really a part of the code base I've been modifying before though so I could be wrong :)

Thank you for your work on this feature. Almost the entire team was out last week and is out this week. It may take a few days before someone finds time to review your PR. Happy holidays.

Absolutely no worries, we all need a well-deserved break :) Happy holidays to all of you!

Thank you!

I wish we could make the diagnostics here a bit friendlier. Some users may not be aware of how the semantics of `__init_subclass__` work, and the diagnostic doesn't try to explain it much at the moment:

But propagating context into (or out of) `binding.report_diagnostics()` in order to add subdiagnostics looks really complicated ☹️. So that's probably better done as a followup
