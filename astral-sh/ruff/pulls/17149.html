            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A few comments here. Generally looks good!</p>
<p>The cycle failure here in the corpus tests is a symptom of a larger problem, which I discussed (along with some possible fixes) in Discord. We could probably paper over it by adding fixpoint cycle handling to <code>Class::try_metaclass</code> query, but given that this is a smaller PR and not likely to accumulate many conflicts, it may make sense to just hold off for a more general fix, which I should be able to land soon (and already verified eliminates this cycle.)</p>
