            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>A pattern that shows up a lot in the <code>ruff_linter</code> crate currently is to do something like this to determine whether an <code>ast::Expr</code> node refers to a builtin symbol:</p>
<pre><code>fn do_the_check(checker: &amp;mut Checker, expr: &amp;ast::Expr) {
    let ast::Expr::Name(ast::ExprName { id, .. }) = expr else {
        return;
    }
    if id != &quot;zip&quot; {
        return;
    }
    if !checker.semantic().is_builtin(&quot;zip&quot;) {
        return;
    }
    // and now we do the check that only applies to the builtin zip function...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#x27;s pretty verbose and repetitive, and <em>lots</em> of our checks have some interaction with a builtin function or class in some way</li>
<li>This pattern doesn&#x27;t account for the fact that it&#x27;s perfectly possible to explicitly import the <code>builtins</code> module and e.g. refer to <code>zip</code> by using <code>builtins.zip</code> rather than just <code>zip</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This PR adds a new method to the semantic model that means that this kind of logic becomes both more concise and more accurate. The above logic can now be replaced with this, which will also (unlike the old function) recognise <code>builtins.zip</code> as being a reference to the builtin <code>zip</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>fn do_the_check(checker: &amp;mut Checker, expr: &amp;ast::Expr) {
    if !checker.semantic().match_builtin_expr(expr, &quot;zip&quot;) {
        return;
    }
    // and now we do the check that only applies to the builtin zip function...
}
</code></pre>
<p>A new method is also added to <code>crates/ruff_linter/src/importer/mod.rs</code> to enable us to provide autofixes involving builtin functions/classes, even when they&#x27;ve been shadowed by a user-defined function or class in the current scope.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo test</code>. Several fixtures have been extended with new examples to test the new functionality.</p>
<p>This PR should be easiest to review commit-by-commit: each commit passes the full test suite by itself.</p>

<p>Hmm, will it? Currently:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it&#x27;s an <code>Expr::Name</code>, we take the fast(er) path, and we never actually call <code>resolve_qualified_name()</code><ul>
<li>we return <code>true</code> if the <code>id</code> of the <code>Name</code> matches the symbol and <code>self.is_builtin(symbol)</code> is also true</li>
<li>else, we return <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise, in the slow path, we don&#x27;t actually call <code>self.is_builtin(symbol)</code> at all, since as you say it&#x27;s redundant if we have to call <code>resolve_qualified_name()</code></li>

<p>Ah, that&#x27;s a regression: something can be imported explicitly from <code>builtins</code> even if it&#x27;s not an <code>ast::Name</code> node. My fast path doesn&#x27;t work as it&#x27;s currently written.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s worth it or not — it&#x27;s less repetitive code for us and it&#x27;s more principled in that we&#x27;re handling the semantics of Python more accurately, but importing <code>builtins</code> explicitly also isn&#x27;t that common.</p>

<p>yeah. I would have hoped that the fast path from the <code>if self.seen_modules(Modules::BUILTINS)</code> check would mean that performance would be basically unchanged for those benchmarks.</p>
<p>Any idea what might be the cause of the slowdown? <code>pyflakes::rules::unused_import</code> seems to be showing up in a bunch of the codspeed flamegraphs, which is weird, because I haven&#x27;t touched that function in this PR</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The other thing you might consider doing is benchmarking locally with Hyperfine. E.g., you could build a release build on main, stash it (<code>mv ./target/release/ruff ./target/release/main</code>), then build on your branch and do something like:</p>
<pre><code>hyperfine --warmup 10 --runs 100 \
    &quot;./target/release/main ./crates/ruff/resources/test/cpython/ --no-cache --silent -e&quot; \ 
    &quot;./target/release/ruff ./crates/ruff/resources/test/cpython/ --no-cache --silent -e&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;d suggest running it a few times and switching the order of <code>main</code> and <code>ruff</code> around to reach a safe conclusion.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m getting similar results from running <code>cargo benchmark</code> locally (tried it a few times earlier), so I don&#x27;t <em>think</em> it&#x27;s just noise :/ I&#x27;ll try tomorrow with hyperfine to see if the macrobenchmark shows anything different to the microbenchmarks...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like this PR is doing two separable things: improving detection of what is a builtin, and allowing auto-fixes that want to use a builtin to import it via <code>builtins</code> module if the name is shadowed.</p>
<p>Have you benchmarked those changes in isolation, to clarify which one the regression is coming from? IIUC we always eagerly generate fixes, so it seems like a change that allows more fixes in more cases could easily cause a regression?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, although we should only be generating more diagnostics (and therefore more fixes) for files that import builtins, and we don’t have any such files in our benchmarks (IIUC).</p>
<p>It <em>could</em> be that computing the fixes become more expensive (the use of get_or_import_symbol will be more expensive) even in the case that the file doesn’t import builtins, though I don’t have intuition on whether that could account for the delta here. You could try removing the changes that involve modifying the fixes, to see if the benchmarks return to normal as Carl suggests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks to me like all the rules that are changed to use <code>try_set_fix</code> with the new <code>get_or_import_builtin_symbol</code> (e.g. <code>unreliable_call_check</code> is one example) will now generate more fixes than before in any file where the builtin they want to add a reference to is shadowed. E.g. in a module that contains <code>callable = ...</code>, <code>unreliable_call_check</code> will now generate a fix that imports <code>builtins</code> and uses <code>builtins.callable</code>, rather than bailing and not generating a fix at all. Similar for a number of other rules. So this would generate more fixes even in files that don&#x27;t currently import <code>builtins</code>.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t checked whether the benchmarks in question do this, but this change seems entirely separable from the better detection of imported builtins, so if there are any mysteries it seems like a good first step is to separate the changes and narrow down the cause. (And if it&#x27;s still a mystery, perhaps further separate by only changing one rule at a time.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, that&#x27;s true! Good call. I would be surprised if we had any instances of those in our benchmark files (and especially not in <em>all</em> of them) but it&#x27;s possible there are a few and it&#x27;s definitely a good idea to isolate the changes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yet another possibility: the change to the fixes also involves changing a bunch of fixes to use <code>Fix::safe_edits</code> instead of <code>Fix::safe_edit</code>, even if a builtin symbol is not overridden in the relevant scope. It&#x27;s possible <code>safe_edits</code> is slower than <code>safe_edit</code>, even if only a single edit is passed? Anyway, I didn&#x27;t get to it today, but I&#x27;ll do some benchmarking tomorrow without the changes to the fixes, as @carljm suggests :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is the case where I don&#x27;t like our clippy rule that switches the <code>if</code> and` else if the if condition is negated. Naturally, I would expect that the &quot;fast&quot; path comes first (and that&#x27;s also what branch predictors assume by default, as far as I know).</p>
<p>You could try to use</p>
<pre><code>        // fast path
        if !self.seen_module(Modules::BUILTINS) {
            return matches!(expr, Expr::Name(ast::ExprName { id, .. }) if id == symbol &amp;&amp; self.is_builtin(symbol));
        }

        self.resolve_qualified_name(expr)
            .is_some_and(|qualified_name| match qualified_name.segments() {
                [&quot;builtins&quot; | &quot;&quot;, member] =&gt; *member == symbol,
                _ =&gt; false,
            })

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this change negatively impacts performance. The idea was to have all cheap tests early. Calling <code>resolve_symbol</code> isn&#x27;t cheap. It might be worth adding a &quot;fast&quot; path in the slow path of <code>match_builtin_expr</code> that exits early if <code>expr</code> is a name but doesn&#x27;t match the builtin name (except if you want to support <code>from builtins import float as f</code>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wonder if we could instead change the method to return a <code>QualifiedName</code> where constructing the <code>QualifiedName</code> short-circuits if <code>Modules::BUILTINS</code> isn&#x27;t imported.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m bringing this up because <code>QualifiedName</code> already has methods for handling builtins (that might be incorrect?)</p>
<pre><code>pub fn is_builtin(&amp;self) -&gt; bool {
    matches!(self.segments(), [&quot;&quot;, ..])
}

<p>So what I would have in mind is</p>
<pre><code>model.resolve_builtin_name(expr).is_some_and(|builtin| builtin.is_builtin_name(&quot;open&quot;))

<p>We could still have a helper as you have today to avoid some of the repetition (<code>is_some_and</code> is somewhat annoying). But it would build up on the same concepts.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes. <code>match_builtin_expr</code> above checks whether the func represents either <code>open(&quot;foo&quot;)</code> or <code>builtins.open(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>, both of which are calls to the <code>builtins.open()</code> function. A this point, we&#x27;re now checking to see whether the func represents either <code>Path(&quot;foo&quot;).open()</code> or <code>pathlib.Path(&quot;foo&quot;).open()</code>, which are different function calls but have similar semantics to <code>builtins.open()</code>, so are treated equivalently by this pylint rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These things (like <code>is_identifier</code>) <em>do</em> show up in traces sometimes because we tend to be calling these rules for <em>every</em> function call, which is why being able to gate on something as cheap as &quot;the name of the function&quot; is useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure how we would be able to use <code>lookup_symbol</code> here, as <code>lookup_symbol</code> takes <code>&amp;str</code> (representing the name of the symbol) rather than an AST node. And we don&#x27;t know the name of the symbol -- even if it&#x27;s a builtin, as you can do <code>from builtins import open as o</code> -- unless we resolve the qualified name</p>

What do you think of that solution?</p>
