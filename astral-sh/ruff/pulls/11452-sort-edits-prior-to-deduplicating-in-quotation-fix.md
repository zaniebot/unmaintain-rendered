# Sort edits prior to deduplicating in quotation fix

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-16 15:59_

## Summary

We already have handling for "references that get quoted within our quoted references", but we were assuming a specific ordering in the way edits were generated.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11449.
