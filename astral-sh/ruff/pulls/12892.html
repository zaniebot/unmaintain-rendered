            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds definition for augmented assignment. This is similar to annotated assignment in terms of implementation.</p>
<p>~An augmented assignment should also record a use of the variable but that's a TODO for now.~</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Add test case to validate that a definition is added.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't really relevant to your PR @dhruvmanila but FWIW, I think this kind of thing is where @carljm's approach of treating <code>Unbound</code> as a separate type falls down. If you have a module that just consists of the following, what is the type of <code>x</code> -- <code>int</code> or <code>Unbound</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">x += 1
</code></pre>
<p>At runtime, this is going to fail with <code>NameError: name 'x' is not defined</code>, which would imply that <code>x</code> should have <code>Type::Unbound</code> here. But in an LSP context, we surely want to infer <code>int</code> for <code>x</code>, since that's obviously what the type of the <code>x</code> variable is <em>meant</em> to be, and it'll give us much better results for autocompletion etc. This would be solved if we treated whether or not a variable is unbound as something that can be queried on a <code>Definition</code> (<code>x</code> would be inferred as an &quot;unbound variable with type <code>int</code>&quot; rather than a &quot;variable with type <code>Unbound</code>&quot;) rather than a separate <em>type</em> altogether.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think what you're discussing here is orthogonal to representing Unbound as a type or not. In terms of the types that we use for type checking (the types we are confident in), there's no question or issue here: if <code>x</code> was unbound before <code>x += 1</code>, its still unbound after it (or maybe we prefer switching to unknown in order to avoid more cascading errors, either way can work.) I think actually inferring a type of <code>int</code> for <code>x</code> in this case, for type checking purposes, is something we definitely don't want to do; we don't want to potentially issue a bunch of cascading downstream type errors because of a type that we just guessed in the face of broken code.</p>
<p>What you're bringing up is a separate feature, which we discussed in planning this morning, which is that in some cases we may have unknown/any as the &quot;correct&quot; type, but we may also want to track a &quot;best guess&quot; type, so we can give &quot;better&quot; (well, hopefully better rather than just misleading) autocomplete etc downstream of incorrect code. That's a feature that needs some design work and discussion, but I don't think representing Unbound as a type makes it any more difficult to implement that feature, or really affects it at all.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To be clear, I'm very open to considering alternate ways of handling Unbound; I think a good case can be made for other approaches. I just don't think this situation exposes a good rationale for a different approach.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I need to study this more and propose a concrete alternative. I think mypy's approach to this problem is very different; but then, mypy is in general much worse at detecting unbound variables than either pyright or Ruff, so that doesn't say much for mypy's approach! I didn't realise that pyright also treats <code>Unbound</code> as a distinct type to <code>Unknown</code>.</p>
