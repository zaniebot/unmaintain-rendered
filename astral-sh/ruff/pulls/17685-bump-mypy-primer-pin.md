# Bump mypy_primer pin

---

_Pull request opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-04-28 16:09_

So that we get a version that includes https://github.com/hauntsaninja/mypy_primer/commit/b83b9eade0b7ed2f4b9b129b163acac1ecb48f71

Also simplify the workflow slightly (there's no need for a separate install step)
