            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gave this a quick test drive: https://github.com/adriangb/ruff/actions/runs/2953375467. There's an artifact with all of the wheels (16 total) on that page.</p>
<p>I do ask that you look at the release gates. I think you intend this to run and release on every tagged commit, even if it's not a commit on <code>main</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wait, this is so nice of you? Not only did you go find this repo but you PR'd a huge improvement? Thank you!</p>
<p>For context: I started by copying over the graphlib2 YAML, but at that point, I was still including pyo3 (I later realized this was unnecessary), which was forcing me to build version-specific wheels... so I think some of the individual wheels were failing, because I wasn't building against 3.7? And then I just figured it wasn't worth the painful debugging loop, and gave up on a lot of versions :) This is way better!</p>

<p>For now I only want to upload to PyPI when I create a new release, though I'd be open to creating (and not uploading) the artifacts for every commit.</p>

<p>Easy enough: #46. Now you'll have artifacts on GitHub for every commit but only publish to PyPi on tags. I guess one could download and install those wheels specifically if they wanted to. Shame you can't link to them directly (so you can't point pip at them).</p>
<p>Sorry about that rogue lint step.</p>
