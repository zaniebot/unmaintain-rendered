            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood one thing I realized yesterday in thinking about this more is that I&#x27;m not sure lazily resolving class bases will work well, because if you inherit from <code>Generic</code> or <code>Protocol</code> we will I think want to record the class differently (i.e. as a different variant of the <code>Type</code> enum). If that&#x27;s true, then I think resolving the <code>str</code> type at all is blocked on Salsa cycle handling (barring some kind of ugly temporary hack like changing typeshed or special-casing lookup of the <code>str</code> type.)</p>
<p>But I could be wrong; maybe we can record generic classes and protocols all as <code>Type::Class</code>, with internal differentiation in the <code>ClassType</code> struct. If so, then resolving bases lazily might be an option (but I think we&#x27;d probably end up resolving the bases on almost any use of the type.) It might be hard to come to a clear conclusion here without going down the path of designing our handling of protocols and generics, which I hadn&#x27;t planned to tackle yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, mypy has the same representation for protocol definitions as it does for class definitions — it has has a boolean flag that you can query to tell you whether it&#x27;s a protocol or not: https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/e67decb91ea5aacbb1e126463b02d78ded680a90/mypy/nodes.py#L2967</p>
<p>(But that obviously doesn&#x27;t mean that that&#x27;s the best representation for us to use!)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m AFK until Monday, but we could also just change the test to use <code>__spec__</code> rather than <code>__name__</code> for now, since <code>__spec__</code> is not a <code>str</code>.</p>
