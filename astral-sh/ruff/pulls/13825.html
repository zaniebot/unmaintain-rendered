<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A small fix for comparisons of multiple comparators.
Instead of comparing each comparator to the leftmost item, we should compare it to the closest item on the left.</p>
<p>While implementing this, I noticed that we don’t yet narrow Yoda comparisons (e.g., <code>True is x</code>), so I didn’t change that behavior in this PR.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added some mdtests 🎉</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Technically, given any single transitive relation (and <code>is</code> is transitive; <code>is not</code>, of course, is not 😆 ) used across all comparisons, any narrowing that applies in one comparison can be applied across all of them; it would be safe to infer <code>Literal[False]</code> for <code>y</code> here also.</p>
<p>A more general framing would be to say that it's valid to use the type of a name as narrowed in one chained comparison when evaluating another chained comparison involving the same name, so in this case it would be valid to use the type <code>Literal[False]</code> for <code>x</code> when evaluating narrowing for <code>y is x</code>, giving us <code>Literal[False]</code> for <code>y</code> also. The tricky thing about actually implementing this would be deciding in which order to evaluate the narrowings.</p>
<p>All that said: I don't think it's important that we <em>do</em> this. Perhaps not ever, and certainly not in this PR.</p>
<p>I do think it's important that you also added the &quot;is not&quot; test below, since that one was more clearly wrong with the prior behavior.</p>
