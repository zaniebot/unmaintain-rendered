<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>The purpose of this change is to explain how to use ruff as a language server in Eglot with automatic formatting because I've struggle to use it with Eglot. I've search it online and found that there are some people also struggle too. (See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/118mo6w/eglot_automatic_formatting/">this reddit post</a> and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp/issues/19#issuecomment-1435138828)</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I've use this setting myself. And I will continue maintain this part as long as I use it.</p>
