# Add `rooster` release management configuration and instructions

I'd rather not be the only one who can easily generate our changelog entries so I invested some time to get Rooster a bit further along and add instructions.

Does the `@main` have an effect here?

As part of this, should we remove the stuff in `.github` that categorizes the auto-generated release notes based on labels?

It shouldn't, but until it's on PyPI I might tag versions and pin them as changes are made going forward.

We could drop it

Done — I kind of like that format maybe I'll change ours to use that eventually :)
