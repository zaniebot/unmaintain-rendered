Test Plan


<p>This isn&#x27;t currently tested, as it isn&#x27;t finished yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This rule doesn&#x27;t exist in flake8-mock-spec - probably because <code>ThreadingMock</code> only was added in Python 3.13 - so I have taken the liberty of using the next rule number for it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s not clear to me what outstanding decision there is to be made from the issue. As far as I can see there hasn&#x27;t been any activity towards this for the last two years, so I thought it might be easiest to try to work a bit towards it and gather feedback on that - hence this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The outstanding decision is whether we want to add the new mockspec plugin (does it fit into the rules we think should be part of Ruff. Every rule also adds a fair amount of maintenance burden)</p>
