# Using Ruff as the default linter in Orionis Framework

_Pull request opened by @rmunate on 2025-09-02 18:19_

Hello team! 👋
I’m truly delighted with everything Ruff brings to the table. Our open-source project, *Orionis Framework*, is evolving with many features inspired by Laravel’s philosophy but built in Python. Every new feature we develop is reviewed with Ruff, and in fact, one of the framework’s native commands will integrate Ruff as its default linter — explicitly pointing to this official repository. 🚀
Thanks for creating such an amazing tool!

Thank you for the kind words! We tend to limit the number of testimonials that we include here to keep the README short and impactful, so I'm going to omit this for now, but I do appreciate the PR and the encouragement.
