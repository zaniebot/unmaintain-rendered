            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1885.</p>
<p>It wasn't obvious to me that there was a deliberate order to the way these rules were listed in our reference docs -- it looked like it was <em>nearly</em> alphabetical, but not quite. I think it's simpler if we just list them in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>The output from running <code>cargo dev generate-all</code> (committed as part of this PR) looks correct!</p>
