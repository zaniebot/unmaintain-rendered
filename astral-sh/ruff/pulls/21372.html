            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By resolving <code>.</code> and the LHS of the from import during semantic indexing, we can check if the LHS is a submodule of <code>.</code>, and handle <code>from whatever.thispackage.x.y import z</code> exactly like we do <code>from .x.y import z</code>.</p>
