            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>The latest version of zizmor points out that we have the default permissions set in several of our GitHub workflows that don&#x27;t really need any permissions at all. These can be made more secure by restricting the permissions for these workflows.</p>
Test Plan
<p>CI on this PR. All workflows being modified here are fully run as part of normal PR CI.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn&#x27;t make modifications to these files because they don&#x27;t run as part of normal PR CI (only during releases, usually) and it wasn&#x27;t obvious to me how to figure out what permissions each workflow needs. I didn&#x27;t want to break the release workflow, and it didn&#x27;t seem worth investing a large amount of time into trying to investigate exactly what permissions each workflow needed, so I left it for now.</p>

<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4cfa3555199f9377b29c490cbb703beb6b1eb3b4/Cargo.toml#L309-L310</p>
<p>And, can also be referred in the <code>release.yml</code>.</p>
<p>So, I think it&#x27;s just <code>build-docker.yml</code> that requires specific permission while the other two jobs don&#x27;t require any.</p>
<p>But, I&#x27;m fine leaving it as it is.</p>

<p>I think if we put <code>permissions: {}</code> in e.g. <code>publish-wasm.yml</code>, it would override the permissions passed to the workflow by <code>release.yml</code> -- the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows#supported-keywords-for-jobs-that-call-a-reusable-workflow">docs here</a> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> permissions passed from the caller workflow can be only downgraded (not elevated) by the called workflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the called workflow here would be <code>publish-wasm.yml</code>, so that would mean that <code>publish-wasm.yml</code>&#x27;s more restricted permissions would downgrade the permissions passed to it by <code>release.yml</code>, breaking the release workflow.</p>
<p>I think that means that each of these workflows needs to have exactly the same permissions in their individual workflow files as they have passed to them by <code>release.yml</code> -- does that sound right to you?</p>

<p>Interesting, doesn&#x27;t this mean that the nested workflow (e.g., <code>publish-wasm.yml</code>) <em>can</em> have <code>permissions: {}</code> because that&#x27;s more restrictive as compared to the parent workflow (<code>release.yml</code>) ?</p>
<p>Otherwise, we&#x27;ll need to revert the <code>build-binaries.yml</code> update in this PR as that&#x27;s also a nested workflow called by <code>release.yml</code>.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m <em>pretty</em> confident that the <code>build-binaries.yml</code> change is okay because, unlike the other workflows, that workflow is run exactly the same way as part of PR CI as it is when it&#x27;s called from <code>release.yml</code>. (And the CI on this PR is green.)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just going to leave this as-is for now, but I&#x27;m very happy if somebody else wants to experiment with removing these ignores and actually fixing the issues zizmor is complaining about!</p>
