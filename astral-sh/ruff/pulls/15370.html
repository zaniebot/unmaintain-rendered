            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The symlink-approach in the typeshed-sync workflow caused some <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15138#issuecomment-2578642129">problems on Windows</a>, even though it seemed to work fine in CI.</p>
<p>Here, we rely on <code>build.rs</code> to patch typeshed instead, which allows us to get rid of the modifications in the workflow (thank you @MichaReiser).</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made sure that changes to <code>knot_extensions.pyi</code> result in a recompile of <code>red_knot_vendored</code>.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Removing this means that we will rebuild <code>red_knot_vendored</code> if <em>any</em> file in the package has changed (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#change-detection">ref</a>). I need this, because <code>knot_extensions.pyi</code> is not in the <code>vendor/typeshed</code> directory, and we need to pick up changes to it.</p>
<p>And I don't think there's a huge drawback since there are no files in <code>red_knot_vendored</code> that should <em>not</em> trigger a rebuild except for the README.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When I originally wrote this function, I intended to write it so that it could be used to zip up any directory into a zip archive -- that's why it's called <code>zip_dir()</code>, and that's why it accepts the typeshed directory path as a parameter rather than hardcoding it in the function. I think since I originally wrote it, it's already grown a few features that make it quite specific to its use-case here, such as the conditional logic a few lines above for deciding what the compression method should be. So I don't really mind much hardcoding things like <code>&quot;stdlib/VERSIONS&quot;</code> directly into the function body. But at this stage, it probably doesn't make much sense for the typeshed directory to be passed into the function as a parameter, and we should probably change the name of the function 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry about that, I figured it would be okay to modify in this way since it wasn't being used anywhere else and not in a place where it could be imported from anywhere else. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15372</p>
