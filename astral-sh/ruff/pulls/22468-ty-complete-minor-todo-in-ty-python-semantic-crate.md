# [ty] Complete minor TODO in ty_python_semantic crate

---

_Pull request opened by @carljm on 2026-01-08 23:39_

This TODO is very old -- we have long since recorded this definition. Updating the test to actually assert the declaration requires a new helper method for declarations, to complement the existing `first_public_binding` helper.

Trivial test fix, and we have enough open PRs to review; merging this one without review. (Or alternatively: Claude wrote it, I'm reviewing it.)
