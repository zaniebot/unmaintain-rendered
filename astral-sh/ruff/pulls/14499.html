            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. I'm just surprised that creating an union from one element would result in a different return type than just that type (shouldn't <code>infer_type_expression</code> refine that type already?). Looking at the <code>UnionBuilder::add</code>, it seems that <code>UnionBuilder::default().add(ty).build() == ty</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure why mypy and pyright do this! I can find plenty of comments in both bug trackers from maintainers clearly stating that <code>bool</code> is a subtype of <code>int</code>. And even more weirdly, mypy sometimes does simplify <code>bool | int</code>: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=2566490340562ba079a91c53e88c1141</p>
<p>It seems like pyright just generally doesn't simplify subtypes out of unions, it's not specific to <code>bool | int</code>: https://pyright-play.net/?code=MYGwhgzhAECCBc0B0KBQpIwEIApYEpEUlVUATAUwDNoqd9oBaAPjmgB9osi1UAnCgDcKYEAH0ALgE8ADhRx18%2BIA</p>
<p>In any case, while interesting, I don't think this is a TODO for us to change, so I would remove this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think these two lines are testing anything about union annotations. <code>a2</code> is annotated as simply <code>int</code>, not a union, and <code>a</code> has inferred type <code>Literal[&quot;&quot;]</code> (as seen in the error message), from the assignment on line 39, again unrelated to its declared union type.</p>
<p>So I don't think these two lines are relevant tests for this PR or this file.</p>
<p>What would be relevant is trying to assign something outside of the union to <code>a</code> or <code>a1</code>, and seeing that it issues an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion"># error: [invalid-assignment] &quot;Object of type `bytes` is not assignable to `int | str`&quot;
a = b&quot;&quot;

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think there are any tests for this arm? It would mean adding a test with an annotation like <code>x: Union[int]</code>.</p>
<p>Pyright emits a diagnostic on this, mypy doesn't. I don't really feel like it should be an error -- it is a useless use of <code>Union</code>, but there is a unique and clear interpretation. There could be a lint rule against it.</p>
<p>I agree with @MichaReiser that I don't see why we use <code>UnionType::from_elements</code> here when it should always simplify back to a single type. I think this is completely equivalent, but more efficient:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is extremely subtle, but with this change, we now fail to infer a type for the <code>ast::Expr::Tuple</code> expression itself. We only infer types for the sub-expressions via <code>self.infer_type_expression(elt)</code>, but we don't store a type for the overall <code>ast::Expr::Tuple</code> (only for the whole slice expression).</p>
<p>In other words, when we have something like <code>Union[str, int]</code>, we do infer types for the whole slice expression <code>Union[str, int]</code>. We also infer types for <code>int</code> and <code>str</code>, but we do not infer/store a type for the <code>int, str</code> tuple expression.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the test that would have caught this is currently deactivated (see #14391), but I hope we can re-activate it soon.</p>
<p>I'll open a PR with a fix (Edit: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14510).</p>
