            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think you&#x27;re both right!</p>
<p>I was looking at it pretty narrowly through the lens of &quot;what would be required to respect the gradual guarantee here&quot; -- and it seemed obvious that, to respect the gradual guarantee, if we intersected with <code>Any</code> when the second argument to <code>isinstance()</code> was of type <code>Any</code> and we intersected with <code>int</code> when the second argument was of type <code>type[int]</code>, we should therefore also intersect with <code>int &amp; Any</code> when the second argument was of <code>type[int] &amp; Any</code>.</p>
<p>But if we&#x27;re making these changes to intersections, then it does definitely make sense to make equivalent changes to unions -- it&#x27;s sound behaviour and consistent behaviour, even if it&#x27;s not strictly &quot;necessary&quot; to support the gradual guarantee in the same way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Although now that I think harder about it, maybe it <em>is</em> necessary to support unions here in order to support the gradual guarantee, since you could have <code>type[int] | Any</code>, and that <code>Any</code> could materialize to <code>type[int]</code></p>
