# Move readme dev details to CONTRIBUTING.md and fix contradictions

Following up on #2018/#2019 discussion, this moves the readme's development-related bits to `CONTRIBUTING.md` to avoid duplication, and fixes up the commands accordingly 😄

There already is a `## Contributing` section in the README ... now that you have moved the contents of `## Development` to CONTRIBUTING.md we have two sections that basically say the same ... I think it would make sense to replace the current Development section with the current Contributing section (moving it up).

@not-my-profile I hadn't noticed the Contributing section (on line 3445, in my defense). Merged the two. 😄

I think `Contributing` is a better title than `Development`.
