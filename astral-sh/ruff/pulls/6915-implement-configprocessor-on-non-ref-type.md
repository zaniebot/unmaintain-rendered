## Summary

This PR implements `ConfigProcessor` on the `struct` itself rather than `&T`. 

It also changes the `resolve` functions to use dynamic dispatch rather than being generic over `ConfigProcessor`. 
Dynamic dispatch isn't a problem here as the `ConfigProcessor` isn't called in a hot code path

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan

This PR removes about 13684 llvm lines (0.75%)

`cargo test`

<!-- How was it tested? -->
