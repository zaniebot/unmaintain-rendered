            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Right now it seems like there are too many situations where:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a typing error on a line that all other type checkers detect</li>
<li>The user has suppressed that error for Reasons with a type: ignore comment</li>
<li>But we don't yet detect the typing error due to a missing feature, leading us to complain about the unused ignore comment</li>
</ol>
<p>The rule feels like more of a lint anyway, and mypy's version is opt-in. I'd like for it to be enabled by default for the GA release, but right now it feels like we're getting a lot of user questions about it. Let's make it disabled-by-default until we're closer to feature-parity with other type checkers.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo test</code></li>
<li>I ran ty locally on a file that just had <code>x = 1 + 2  # type: ignore</code> on it and verified that no diagnostics were reported by ty</li>
</ul>
