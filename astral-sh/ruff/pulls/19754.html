<p>This PR fixes the issue mentioned in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19736#issuecomment-3151903662 ~~but I can't test it without merging it on <code>main</code> because GitHub Actions still pickup the old version of the workflow file.~~ and is tested by manually triggering the workflow, refer to the comment on this PR (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19754#issuecomment-3153894179) which has the commit hash.</p>

<p>I did not, thank you for pointing that out.</p>
<p>I triggered it and it works, refer to the comment in this PR (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19754#issuecomment-3153894179) which has the commit hash.</p>

<p>It's because the <code>GITHUB_OUTPUT</code> only populates the output for that specific step and it cannot be accessed via the environment variable, you need to access it using the <code>steps.&lt;name&gt;.outputs.&lt;key&gt;</code> format. Refer to my initial approach in this PR (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19754/commits/d213e76cc8f3ad45f389d961f828493950e3f744) but then I realized there's no need to do this output game when I can just get the value from the file itself. I think the reason the <code>pr-number</code> requires going through the output loop is because it's being used as an input to another step while the conformance commit hash is directly being utilized in the shell script.</p>
