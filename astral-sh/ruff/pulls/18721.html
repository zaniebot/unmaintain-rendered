            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The change meant that we never finished type-checking <code>dd-trace-py</code>, meaning mypy_primer runs never finished. Apologies -- I should have checked my analysis in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18705#issuecomment-2978338496 more thoroughly before merging #18705.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Mypy primer runs are successfully finishing on https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18722, which is based on top of this branch. (I wouldn't expect primer runs to finish on this PR, because <code>ty_old</code> is the <code>main</code> branch here, which is still a version of ty that will never finish checking dd-trace-py.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Note: @sharkdp thinks the bug is in <code>all_members</code>, which means there's probably a way of triggering a hang from exactly the wrong autocomplete request. This revert doesn't fix the underlying bug, but it means mypy_primer runs start finishing again, which is important!)</p>
