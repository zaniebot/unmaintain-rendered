Uh, I might actually need to fix this real quick. This used to be a `ParseError`, but now it will be preview-gated with the other semantic syntax errors. We should probably emit it regardless of preview to preserve the old behavior? cc @MichaReiser @dhruvmanila

I think it's fine. It shouldn't break any existing setup. It's just that we may report fewer diagnostics.
