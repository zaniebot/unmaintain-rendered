## Summary

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

I noticed this since my code for finding missing safety fix sections flagged it, there is a missing `/` causing part of the new changes to be a normal comment instead of a doc comment

## Test Plan

<!-- How was it tested? -->

N/A, no functionality/tests affected
