### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package bincode@2.0.1 --precise 3.0.0
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for `bincode`.
    ... required by package `ruff v0.14.10 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/ruff/crates/ruff)`
versions that meet the requirements `^3.0.0` are: 3.0.0

package `ruff` depends on `bincode` with feature `serde` but `bincode` does not have that feature.


failed to select a version for `bincode` which could resolve this conflict

I need to understand what's new in 3.0.0. Is it just because bincode is now unmaintained? Are there any other changes?

I don't think version 3.0.0 is real but we should probalby consider migrating to something else

### Renovate Ignore Notification

Because you closed this PR without merging, Renovate will ignore this update. You will not get PRs for *any* future `3.x` releases. But if you manually upgrade to `3.x` then Renovate will re-enable `minor` and `patch` updates automatically.

If you accidentally closed this PR, or if you changed your mind: rename this PR to get a fresh replacement PR.
