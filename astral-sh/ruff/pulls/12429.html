            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, thanks for the PR! This looks like it could be really useful for some projects.</p>
<p>For us, I think it might be less useful than some other projects, however, so we'll decline this PR:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a pretty frequent release schedule, so contributors won't usually have to wait more than a few days before their feature that's been merged into <code>main</code> is out -- keeping track of whether a feature has been released or not isn't usually too difficult</li>
<li>We use GitHub releases, so it's fairly easy to track when we publish releases</li>
<li>As maintainers, we already get lots of notifications from this repo, and we're worried that this make our inboxes even harder to deal with :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for the PR, though, we really appreciate the contribution!</p>
