            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/556.</p>
<p>On Windows, system installations have different layouts to virtual environments. In Windows virtual environments, the Python executable is found at <code>&lt;sys.prefix&gt;/Scripts/python.exe</code>. But in Windows system installations, the Python executable is found at <code>&lt;sys.prefix&gt;/python.exe</code>. That means that Windows users were able to point to Python executables inside virtual environments with the <code>--python</code> flag, but they weren't able to point to Python executables inside system installations.</p>
<p>This PR fixes that issue. It also makes a couple of other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly all <code>sys.prefix</code> resolution is moved inside <code>site_packages.rs</code>. That was the original design of the <code>site-packages</code> resolution logic, but features implemented since the initial implementation have added some resolution and validation to <code>resolver.rs</code> inside the module resolver. That means that we've ended up with a somewhat confusing code structure and a situation where several checks are unnecessarily duplicated between the two modules.</li>
<li>I noticed that we had quite bad error messages if you e.g. pointed to a path that didn't exist on disk with <code>--python</code> (we just gave a somewhat impenetrable message saying that we &quot;failed to canonicalize&quot; the path). I improved the error messages here and added CLI tests for <code>--python</code> and the <code>environment.python</code> configuration setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Existing tests pass</li>
<li>Added new CLI tests</li>
<li>I manually checked that virtual-environment discovery still works if no configuration is given</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd love it if somebody who has a Windows machine setup for development could do some manual testing to check that pointing <code>--python</code> to a system-installation executable now works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this TODO can be resolved by propagating whether the <code>python</code> setting was obtained from a CLI flag or from a configuration file, and adding a new <code>SysPrefixPathOrigin</code> variant that captures this information. For now I'm deferring this to a followup.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually already have the fix locally — it was originally part of the same patch, but I split it out from this PR as I realised it wasn't directly required to fix the bug here and the patch was starting to sprawl over too much code :P</p>
