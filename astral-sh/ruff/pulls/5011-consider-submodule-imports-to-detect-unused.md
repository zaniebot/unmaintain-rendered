# Consider submodule imports to detect unused imports

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-06-11 02:28_

## Summary

Take the below code as an example:
```python
import foo.bar
import foo.some
```

Here, a single binding is created (`foo`) for both imports and the binding created for `foo.bar` will shadow the one created for `foo.some`. Now, if the binding `foo` is unused, then it means all of the bindings shadowing this is unused as well.

There's a conflict which I've commented down below. This is resulting in 2 test failures.

## Test Plan

`cargo test`

fixes: #60
fixes: #4655

So, it seems that there are some conflicting behavior between `flake8` and `pylint` (we've adopted `flake8` behvaior):

```python
import foo
import foo.bar
```

`flake8` will only trigger a violation of unused import on line 2 while `pylint` triggers for both lines. It's the same for the below code as well:

```python
import foo
import bar as foo
```

I would argue to actually mark both as unused import similar to `pylint`. When called with the `--fix` flag, both these imports are removed even though the diagnostics suggest that the first import _isn't_ unused:

```console
$ ruff check --no-cache --isolated --select=F401,F811 src/F401.py
src/F401.py:2:8: F811 Redefinition of unused `foo` from line 15
src/F401.py:2:8: F401 [*] `foo` imported but unused
Found 2 errors.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Hmm, I'm not totally certain on the right behavior here. Given the example from #60 
```python
import multiprocessing.pool
import multiprocessing.process

z = multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool()
```

Wouldn't we end up flagging `multiprocessing.pool` as unused? It feels unintuitive, though may be correct.

> Wouldn't we end up flagging `multiprocessing.pool` as unused?

@charliermarsh Do you mean `multiprocessing.process` as `multiprocessing.pool` is being used in your code.

But to answer your question, no it won't flag them. I've added a test case for the mentioned case: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5011/files#diff-cdbee39a5dfd985e12efeff0edaae1b8f79c8fdc2655e64ad12160cf84659930

(Sorry for the delay, I missed this in the notifications)

Hash maps are kind of expensive (48 bytes or something in size and require an allocation per scope). Could we instead move the name to `Binding`, recompute it on demand (implement a helper on `binding` that uses `BindingId` to extract the name, I would prefer this approach), or store it as a another `IndexVec<BindingId, &'str>` on the semantic model (since we need an entry for **every** name).

@charliermarsh Any thoughts on how to proceed here? I'm totally fine with rejecting this solution altogether :)

@dhruvmanila - Sorry for the delay (again), but let's close this out for now. I appreciate the work but submodule imports are complicated and I'm having trouble reasoning about the change, whether it's correct, and how it should be reflected in other rules (no fault of yours -- it just requires some investigation on my part, and I don't feel it's worth investing time in right now).
