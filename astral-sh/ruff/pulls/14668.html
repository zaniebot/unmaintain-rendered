            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Resolves <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14547">astral-sh/ruff#14547</a> by delegating narrowing to <code>E</code> for <code>bool(E)</code> where <code>E</code> is some expression.</p>
<p>This change does not include other builtin class constructors which should also work in this position, like <code>int(..)</code> or <code>float(..)</code>, as the original issue does not mention these. It should be easy enough to add checks for these as well if we want to.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t see a lot of markdown tests for malformed input, maybe there&#x27;s a better place for the no args and too many args cases to go?</p>
<p>I did see after the fact that it looks like this task was intended for a new hire.. my apologies. I got here from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13694">astral-sh/ruff#13694</a>, which is marked help-wanted.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this test does not (yet) do what you intended. We do not have narrowing support for <code>if x: …</code>, so even if you would get rid of the argument length check, we wouldn&#x27;t see any narrowing here. This could be fixed by using <code>bool(x is not None, 5)</code> instead.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the test does not go far enough, because you currently <em>do</em> perform narrowing for illegal <code>bool</code> calls like <code>bool(x is not None, y=5)</code> with a keyword argument. I think we would eventually issue a diagnostic for this call (in call signature checking, not here), but we should probably not narrow in this case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>bool()</code> is <code>False</code>, which makes the body of this unreachable. Existing type checkers do not issue diagnostics in unreachable code blocks (i.e. would not yield any <code>reveal_type</code> results here).</p>
<p>Maybe we could change it to <code>if not bool()</code>, but also, I&#x27;m not really sure if this test adds a lot of value. Like what would be a reasonable scenario (code change) where this would fail? So maybe we can just remove it.</p>

<p>That leads to a panic in the Rust code, but it would not lead to a test failure here (even if that panic would not show up for some reason).</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m okay with the <code>not bool()</code> test now. Thanks for the update.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This match statement becomes a bit odd, in that we match on a set of conditions specific to constraint functions like <code>isinstance</code>, and then check a totally different case in the catch-all arm.</p>
<p>I think it would be clearer if we rework this so that we just match on <code>callable_ty</code> itself, and make the first arm match on <code>Type::FunctionLiteral</code>, with the &quot;is known&quot; and &quot;is a constraint function&quot; checks moved into the <code>if</code> guard of that arm. Then this branch can, in parallel fashion, match on <code>Type::ClassLiteral</code>, etc.</p>
