            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was wondering if we&#x27;ll also need access to the <code>if</code> portion of the generator here, but I think we won&#x27;t; that expression should be handled separately as a <code>Constraint</code>, it&#x27;s not part of the <code>Definition</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We&#x27;ve inherited some awfully confusing naming from the CPython grammar and AST :( If we have <code>[y for x in [] for y in x]</code>, that&#x27;s a single &quot;list comprehension&quot;, whose AST node has a <code>generators</code> attribute containing two... Comprehensions, <code>for x in []</code> and <code>for y in x</code>. So not only is the term &quot;generator&quot; overloaded here from its usual meaning, but we&#x27;re also using the term &quot;comprehension&quot; itself to mean two entirely different things, one of which is part of the other 🤯</p>
<p>(To be clear, this is not a critique of this PR, just a lament for the state of naming in this part of the AST. We could fix this in our AST, but then we&#x27;d be inventing our own naming scheme that doesn&#x27;t match the CPython AST, and that doesn&#x27;t seem great either.)</p>
<p>One way to maybe clarify this naming a bit would be to switch from <code>list_comprehension</code>, <code>dict_comprehension</code>, etc all through these method names to instead use <code>listcomp</code>, <code>dictcomp</code>, etc when we are referring to the outer expression, and reserve the full word &quot;comprehension&quot; for the thing actually named <code>Comprehension</code> in the AST, which is just the inner <code>for x in y</code> part. I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call that <em>clear</em>, but given what we&#x27;re working with, it might at least be better? It at least matches the names used in the AST and avoids using the word &quot;comprehension&quot; to mean two different things.</p>
<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t like the names <code>infer_comprehensions_scope</code> and <code>infer_comprehension_scope</code> for these two methods. The individual &quot;Comprehension&quot; nodes inside a list/set/dict/gen-comp are not different scopes, so the use of &quot;scope&quot; here is misleading.</p>
<p>If we go with my suggestion above to rename e.g. <code>infer_list_comprehension_expression</code> to <code>infer_listcomp_expression</code>, then I think we could name these two just <code>infer_comprehensions</code> and <code>infer_comprehension</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the parallel code above in <code>infer_first_comprehension_iter</code> you changed all the naming from <code>generator*</code> to <code>comprehension*</code>, which is reasonable since <code>generators</code> attribute is a list of <code>Comprehension</code> nodes. Let&#x27;s at least be consistent and use the same naming both here and in <code>infer_first_comprehension_iter</code>.</p>

<p>I think, if we want, we <em>can</em> change the names in our AST as we&#x27;ve done so in the past as well (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8064">astral-sh/ruff#8064</a>, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6379">astral-sh/ruff#6379</a>, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6253">astral-sh/ruff#6253</a>, etc.). There are other recommendations here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/6183</p>

</blockquote>
<p>From my perspective, both <code>listcomp</code> and <code>list_comprehension</code> seems equivalent as the former seems like a short version of the latter. Is the reason for recommending <code>listcomp</code> because of it&#x27;s presence in the CPython AST?</p>

<p>Makes sense. I can change this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve not renamed the <code>list_comprehension</code> to <code>listcomp</code> as I feel like the &quot;expression&quot; prefix in <code>list_comprehension_expression</code> gives a signal that this is different than a simple &quot;comprehension&quot;. Regardless, I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion, so I&#x27;m happy to rename it if you think <code>listcomp</code> is better.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, mostly what my suggestion was aiming for was to hew very closely to the AST naming, in hopes that this would at least give some guideposts to readers. But I&#x27;m OK with your approach and relying on <code>_expression</code> to distinguish.</p>
