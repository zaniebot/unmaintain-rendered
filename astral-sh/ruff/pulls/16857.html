            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>base.sha</code> appears to be the commit of the base branch when the pull request was opened, not the base commit that's used to construct the test merge commit — which can lead to incorrect &quot;determine changes&quot; results where commits made to the base ref since the pull request are opened are included in the results.</p>
<p>We use <code>git merge-base</code> to find the correct sha, as I don't think that GitHub provides this. They provide <code>merge_commit_sha</code> but my understanding is that is equivalent to the actual merge commit we're testing in CI.</p>
<p>I tested this locally on an example pull request. I don't think it's worth trying to reproduce a specific situation here.</p>
