            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Our type ordering/normalization previously relied on <code>PartialOrd</code>/<code>Ord</code> instances that were auto-generated for <code>salsa::interned</code> structs. These implementations compare by salsa ID, which is not necessarily deterministic (depends on <em>when</em> a particular type has been interned, and can therefore depend on file checking order).</p>
<p>Besides not being deterministic, it was also incorrect. When comparing two equal unions <code>A1 | B1</code> and <code>A2 | B2</code>, it was possible for one union to be ordered incorrectly (e.g. if both <code>A1</code> and <code>B1</code> were interned nominal instances), leading to incorrect type-relation results.</p>
<p>Writing these <code>ordering</code> functions by hand is exhausting and error-prone. This is why I only went so far as to fix the linked bug. Much more work would be involved to implement this for structs like <code>FunctionType</code> or <code>CallableType</code>. We should probably look into auto-generating these methods somehow?</p>

<p>I&#x27;m mainly questioning whether we need to override everywhere. We definitely should override it if it otherwise leads to incorrect ordering. I don&#x27;t think we have to override in cases where it&#x27;s only about determinism because ids are then a very convenient and fast way to arbitrarily sort items (if the only goal is that they have a fixed ordering but don&#x27;t require a specific semantic ordering)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not quite clear to me what you&#x27;re fixing in this pr (at least one case seems semantic)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think our prior assumption was that ordering of types need only be deterministic within a given run of <code>ty</code>, because we should always normalize types as needed to ensure that type ordering differences don&#x27;t have semantic effects. So if we fix the specific bugs where we fail to normalize or allow type ordering differences to make a semantic difference, that should make it unnecessary to establish a universally consistent type ordering.</p>

<p>Haha, fair. Although salsa might solve this if the rematerialized structs retain their relative order</p>
