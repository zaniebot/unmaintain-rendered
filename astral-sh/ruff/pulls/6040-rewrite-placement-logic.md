# Rewrite placement logic

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2023-07-24 20:58_

## Summary
This is a rewrite of the main comment placement logic. `place_comment` now has three parts:

- place own line comments
  - between branches
  - after a branch
- place end-of-line comments
  - after colon
  - after a branch
- place comments for specific nodes (that include module level comments)

The rewrite fixed three bugs: `class A: # trailing comment` comments now stay end-of-line, `try: # comment` remains end-of-line and deeply indented try-else-finally comments remain with the right nested statement.

It will be much easier to give more alternative branches nodes since this is abstracted away by `is_node_with_body` and the first/last child helpers. Adding new node types can now be done by adding an entry to the `place_comment` match. The code went from 1526 lines before #6033 to 1213 lines now.

It thinks it easier to just read the new `placement.rs` rather than reviewing the diff. 

## Test Plan

The existing fixtures staying the same or improving plus new ones for the bug fixes.

   * between branches
   * after a branch
 * place end-of-line comments

this could likely also be merged to avoid recomputing indents but i stopped the yak shave there.

`comment` is a rather large struct. I would try to avod cloning it (Consuming the commnt is also intentional to ensure a comment can only ever be placed once)


```suggestion
        let comment = match handle_own_line_comment_after_body(comment, locator) {
            CommentPlacement::Default(comment) => comment,
            placement => {
                return placement;
            }
        }
    } else {
        match handle_end_of_line_comment_around_body(comment, locator) {
            CommentPlacement::Default(comment) => comment,
            placement => {
                return placement;
            }
        }
    };
```

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/comments/placement.rs`:764 on 2023-07-26 13:24_

Nit (applies to all handle functions): I would expect `expr_slice` to come before `locator` because it is, together with the comment, the main data the method operates on. 

---

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/comments/placement.rs`:108 on 2023-07-26 13:28_

Nit: The `if` is hard to read because of the formatting. It is also a rather complicated condition (I had to think for a while what it means if next is none). That's why I think assigning the result to a variable with a descriptive name will help future readers.

---

_@MichaReiser approved on 2023-07-26 13:31_

This is awesome. It makes it so much easier to reason about the overall flow and precedence. Thanks for doing this. 

I've a few nits. I didn't read through all placement.rs lines because I assumed a lot is also just moved code. Let me know if you want me to review a specific part more thoroughly
