### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema (python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema)</summary>

### [`v0.30.0`](https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.rst#0300)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema/compare/0.29.4...0.30.0)

-   Update vendored schemas: azure-pipelines, bitbucket-pipelines, buildkite,
    circle-ci, cloudbuild, dependabot, github-workflows, gitlab-ci, mergify,
    readthedocs, renovate, taskfile, woodpecker-ci (2024-11-29)
-   Fix caching behavior to always use URL hashes as cache keys. This fixes a
    cache confusion bug in which the wrong schema could be retrieved from the
    cache. This resolves :cve:`2024-53848`. Thanks :user:`sethmlarson` for reporting!
-   Deprecate the `--cache-filename` flag. It no longer has any effect and will
    be removed in a future release.
