            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I expect you'll call me pedantic here, but this feels like it confuses the <em>type</em> being (not) callable with <em>instances of the type</em> being (not) callable. What about something like this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After considering, I think what makes most sense is to just change this message to say <code>Object of type 'foo | bar' is not callable.</code> the same as we'd do for a non-union non-callable type. There's really no difference.</p>
<p>I think your objection might also apply to the existing <code>Union element '{}' of type '{}' is not callable.</code> and <code>Union elements {} of type '{}' are not callable.</code> messages, but since those aren't touched in this PR and it's not clear to me how to improve them, I'll let you propose a separate change to them if you want.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a mis-interpretation of what a &quot;type&quot; means, since &quot;the type <code>Foo</code>&quot; inherently means instances of Foo, so &quot;the type <code>Foo</code> is not callable&quot; already means &quot;instances of Foo are not callable&quot; -- as distinct from saying &quot;the type <code>Type[Foo]</code> (or <code>type</code>, or <code>Literal[Foo]</code>) is not callable&quot;. So I'm not totally convinced we want to make our error messages more verbose to extra-clarify this. But if there are ways to word them that aren't super verbose and make this clearer, I don't have a problem with that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To elaborate, &quot;object of type X is not callable&quot; feels correct to me whereas &quot;type X is not callable&quot; does not feel correct. It is the object that has that type — the object that is an instance of the type — that is not callable. The not-callable type itself is not a subtype of the Callable protocol, but the type itself is actually callable, of course (for the vast majority of types); that's how you create instances of the type, of course: by calling it. Or, well, perhaps you could argue that in fact you call the [constructor method of the] <em>class</em> rather than the <em>type</em> to construct instances of the not-callable type — but I suspect that's a subtlety that'll be lost on most of our users.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it seems like neither pyright nor mypy even considers this problem, because they simply issue a separate diagnostic for each element in the union that isn't a subtype of <code>Callable</code>, rather than trying to consolidate them into a single diagnostic like we do 😄</p>
