            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thanks for working on this! I know it's still a work in progress, but I wanted to check if there had been some previous discussion of this in an issue or elsewhere? My understanding is that we mostly intentionally don't implement all of the same configuration options as isort, so I'm not sure we will want to add several new options, especially all at once.</p>
