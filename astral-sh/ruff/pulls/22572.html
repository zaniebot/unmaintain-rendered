            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thanks for working on this! I know it&#x27;s still a work in progress, but I wanted to check if there had been some previous discussion of this in an issue or elsewhere? My understanding is that we mostly intentionally don&#x27;t implement all of the same configuration options as isort, so I&#x27;m not sure we will want to add several new options, especially all at once.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ntBre talked about in reference to issue #13389. Google&#x27;s styleguide requires some of these options and I just wanted to sketch out a commit so I can further Google&#x27;s open-source projects to use the ruff formatter/linter. Is there any reason that these options wouldn&#x27;t be included? The overhead is extremely minimal to support them fully as the committed changes are, in my opinion, very small.</p>

<p>Ah I see, thanks!</p>

<p>There are a couple of general reasons mentioned in #13389 and its parent issue, #6190, related to the maintenance burden and potential conflicts with every new option.</p>
<p>I think the <code>line-length</code> setting here could be problematic, in particular, because it could conflict with our existing top-level <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#line-length">line-length</a> setting. I&#x27;m not sure about the other two settings yet. Maybe @amyreese would have some insight.</p>

<p>Agree, I don&#x27;t think we should add another <code>line-length</code> setting. It&#x27;s also not clear to me why that would be necessary</p>
<p><code>group-by-package</code> is probably fine. Although I&#x27;m not sure how it interacts with all other settings.</p>
<p><code>lexicographical</code> also seems mostly fine</p>
