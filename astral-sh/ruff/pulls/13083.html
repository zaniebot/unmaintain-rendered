Thank you for contributing to Ruff! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

- Does this pull request include a summary of the change? (See below.)
- Does this pull request include a descriptive title?
- Does this pull request include references to any relevant issues?
-->

<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This pull request adds anchor tags to the elements referenced in the table of contents section of the readme used on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ruff/">PyPI</a> as an attempt to fix #7257. This update follows <a href="https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer/issues/169#issuecomment-808577486">this suggestion</a> to add anchor tags (with no spaces) after the title that is to be linked to.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<ul>
<li>This has been tested on GitHub to check that the additional tags do not interfere with how the read me is rendered; see: https://github.com/calumy/ruff/blob/add-links-to-pypi-docs/README.md</li>
<li>MK docs were generated using the <code>generate_mkdocs.py</code> script; however  as the added tags are beyond the comment <code>&lt;!-- End section: Overview --&gt;</code>, they are excluded so will not change how the docs are rendered.</li>
<li>I was unable to verify how PyPI renders this change, any suggestions would be appreciated and I can follow up on this. Hopefully, the four thumbs up/heart on <a href="https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer/issues/169#issuecomment-808577486">this comment</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer/issues/169#issuecomment-1765616890">this suggestion</a>  all suggest that this approach should work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it should work on PyPI as well based on https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sdk-py/blob/main/README.md?plain=1 and https://pypi.org/project/databricks-sdk.</p>
