Hm I don't love what I have but that's a bit confusing too. I think I will make this a bit clearer when I merge with #7390 which adds documentation for the exact code selection concept.

```suggestion
The nursery category has been deprecated and all rules in the nursery are now considered to be in preview. For backwards
```
