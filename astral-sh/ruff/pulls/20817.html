            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR removes the &quot;ty is pre-release software...&quot; warning from the CLI.
I think it's dramatically underselling where ty is today (compared to when we released the alpha earlier this year).
While there are still a few crashes and some missing language features, I think that's
covered sufficiently by the fact that ty is released as an alpha version.</p>
