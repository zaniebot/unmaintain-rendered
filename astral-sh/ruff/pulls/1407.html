            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On that topic, do we mirror the current API 1:1, i.e. should this also resolve settings by looking into the filesystem?</p>
<p>There was some discussion on the issue itself, but no clear direction yet (at least for me).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think we should. Similar to the Rust API (which doesn't accept settings... but should).</p>
<p>I think the rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If settings are provided, use those.</li>
<li>Else, if filepath is provided, infer.</li>
<li>Else, use defaults.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Most pieces are in place. Since maturin doesn't support binary+library in one package (at least I didn't find a way), I had to switch to the lower-level setuptools-rust. I need to do some more CI adjustments for that, so I'll be moving that into a separate PR.</p>

<p>For the record, it's also not in a state where I'm waiting for a review. I can still do some cleaning up, adding docs and function signatures to the library, adjust CI etc.</p>

<p>Not yet, supporting both lib and bin will complicate bindings detection and our auditwheel Rust implementation, but it's been worked on slowly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I really think that this is too soon ... we have not even stabilized the Rust API ... I have been refactoring our Rust API a lot recently but it's still very much not ready to be used by any third party, since it's very much subject to change drastically.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I agree -- I was excited for this but I've realized that it's too soon. Let's close for now, since it's getting a bit stale anyway.</p>
