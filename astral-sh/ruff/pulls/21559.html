<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This change makes ruff server emit LSP diagnostics with severity level in more situations. Specifically, if the diagnostic didn't have a &quot;secondary code&quot; (I'm not super familiar what that is.) ruff server would previously emit <em>no</em> severity.</p>
<p>This isn't good, because we always have an internal severity, so the information is right there. Editor experience is degraded without the severity information. For example, I use Helix. Themes typically don't consider the case of diagnostics without severity, and the fallback style is very ugly on most themes. Another functional problem is that Helix has a &quot;diagnostics picker&quot;, which can filter by severity. This allows users to focus on errors before warnings. It doesn't work without the severity information.</p>
<p>I also added <code>tags(diagnostic)</code> to the same code path, because the information also doesn't seem to depend on the &quot;secondary code&quot;. However, I haven't noticed this information missing in my own use of ruff, so I didn't confirm the difference in my own testing.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I saw diagnostics without severity in my editor (Helix), made the fix, installed ruff, restarted LSP in Helix, confirmed that diagnostics now have severity.</p>
<p>A very simple file to confirm this just contains <code>if</code>, which will emit a &quot;Expected an expression&quot; diagnostic. With this PR, it has the severity &quot;error&quot;, without it it has none.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. Hmm, this seems like an oversight to me from our diagnostic refactor. @ntBre could we always use <code>diagnostic.severity</code> here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh no we can't because all diagnostics should remain errors on the CLI, but we want to reduce the severity of some errors to warnings in the editor only</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh right, yes. I wasn't sure if you meant could we have used the <code>diagnostic.severity()</code> in <em>this branch</em> all along (which is what I answered), or if we could just use <code>diagnostic.severity()</code> for both cases now. I think the changes in this PR make sense to me since we do the remapping you said.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would do a small refactor here to also show the diagnostic id in case the secondary code is missing. This should also allow us to make the two code paths more similar</p>

	(severity(code), code))
} else {

let tags = tags(diagnostics); // or inline into the struct construction below
let code = lsp_types::NumberOrString::String(code.to_string());
