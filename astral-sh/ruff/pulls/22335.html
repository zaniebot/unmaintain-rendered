            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This commit fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1652, improving support for LSP clients that don't support pull diagnostics by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented support for the <code>didSave</code> notification type:<ul>
<li>Registered handler and advertise this capability on server init</li>
<li>Updated tests: init snapshots now include the new capability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On <code>didSave</code> for any document, we call <code>publish_diagnostics_if_needed</code> on any open documents.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think simply iterating over <code>text_document_handles</code> here will result in duplicate diagnostics for notebooks because each cell is represented as its own text document.</p>
<p>I think we want to add a new method to <code>session</code> that returns an iterator over all <code>file_documents</code>. That is, all <code>TextDocument</code> where <code>notebook</code> is <code>None</code> and all <code>NotebookDocument</code>s.</p>

<p>We'll need to extend this a little to properly support notebooks. We should also add an E2E test (ideally including a notebook and a regular text document), see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/dea48ecef06803502a265488e4a16b3e35778a57/crates/ty_server/tests/e2e/publish_diagnostics.rs#L18</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser is there anything else I should keep in mind re notebooks? I've actually never used them so I kind of forgot the feature even existed, hence their omission from the first draft.</p>
<p>Mainly, if I add an appropriate end to end test that covers both regular files and notebooks, do I still need to manually test with notebooks in my editor, too, or is the test enough for us to be confident it works?</p>

<p>An E2E test should be sufficient. I'm also more than happy to give it a try if I think any extra testing is necessary</p>
