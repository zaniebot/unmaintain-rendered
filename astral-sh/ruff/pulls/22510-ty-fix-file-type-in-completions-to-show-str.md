# [ty] Fix `__file__` type in completions to show `str` instead of `str | None`

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2026-01-11 22:28_

## Summary

The type inference system already correctly special-cases `__file__` to return `str` for the current module (since the code is executing from an existing file). However, the completion system was bypassing this logic and pulling `__file__: str | None` directly from `types.ModuleType` in typeshed.

This PR adds implicit module globals (like `__file__`, `__name__`, etc.) with their correctly-typed values to completions, reusing the existing `module_type_implicit_global_symbol` function that already handles the special-casing.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2445.

_Comment by @sinon on 2026-01-12 09:39_

A related PR which is the semantics side for handling
`from a import __file__ as a_path`: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22333 - with that PR, existing current module semantic overrides and now this there might soon be at least 3 places where these special casings for `__file__` (and other per-file dunder attributes) are being specified 🤔 Maybe fine for now but probably worth raising a follow-up issue to re-examine if the 3rd case lands (as there might end up being more if users then also want the completion typing correct for the `from a import __f<CURSOR>` case too to match this)

_Review comment by @BurntSushi on `crates/ty_python_semantic/src/semantic_model.rs`:250 on 2026-01-12 13:44_

Do we still need to get completions from the `builtins` module below if we're doing this?
