            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This fixes the theme toggle so it has the most useful setting on by default: following the system dark/light mode</p>
<p>See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#automatic-light-dark-mode</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>It follows the official docs exactly. If the docs get published for each PR branch, we can also check there if it works as intended.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That is a good idea, unfortunately it doesn't seem to work for me (firefox on ubuntu 22.04). Other tabs change theme, but the ruffs docs don't. I can see the &quot;Linting the CPython codebase from scratch&quot; figure switch themes though so i'm surprised the rest of the page doesn't.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It says the change is only in tag <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/changelog/#4.18.0">insiders-4.18.0</a>, and the little heart says “sponsors only”.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how building ruff’s docs works. Does the presence of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/mkdocs.insiders.yml">mkdocs.insiders.yml</a> mean that the docs can be built with and without insiders “mode”?</p>
<p>If that assumption is correct, my change should probably live in the mkdocs.insiders.yml instead.</p>
