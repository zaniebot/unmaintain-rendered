            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the PR!</p>
<p>Regarding the sympy diagnostics: an annotation of <code>Unknown</code> should never result in an error, if there is any possible annotation it could be replaced with that would not be an error. I haven't looked at the PR code changes in detail yet, but if we are emitting lots of new errors due to this signature full of <code>Unknown</code>, that suggests this PR is doing something incorrect (maybe using a subtype check where it should be using an assignability check? Not sure)</p>
<p>I think it's clear that we can't land this without fixing that -- let me know if you need help figuring out the cause</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem I was trying to show was that the type was <code>(Unknown, Unknown, /) -&gt; Unknown</code> and not <code>(Unknown, /) -&gt; Unknown</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, sorry, I missed that! That makes sense. I think it's a case of https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/491 then. The fact that this comes up with decorated methods where the decorator is annotated to return a <code>Callable</code> does increase the priority on doing something different there.</p>
<p>In that case maybe we can land this with those new diagnostics -- the same issue already affects any normal method, this just makes it show up in a few more cases with dunder comparison methods.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think when we are talking about something (possibly) not being callable or bound, then we need to be speaking in terms of the dunder method, not the operator. It doesn't make sense to say &quot;operator '==' is not callable&quot;, it makes sense to say &quot;method <code>__eq__</code> is not callable&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This change looks a bit suspicious -- it seems like we now ignore the passed-in <code>policy</code>, except that we consider it below in some code that now looks wrong (since we are now always using &quot;no-object-fallback&quot; policy here).</p>
<p>I think we need to determine whether this method needs to accept a passed-in policy (in which case we should ensure that policy is correct at the call sites and we should not override it here) or not (in which case we should just remove the argument).</p>
