<p>GitHub made the interface for single-template repositories worse. While they might fix it, it encouragement to just do this work. They still haven&#x27;t fixed the teeny tiny emojis which makes me think this won&#x27;t be fixed quickly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with Micha that this might require some more thought but I&#x27;d be ok with including &quot;Bug report&quot;, &quot;Feature request&quot;, and a &quot;Blank issue&quot;.</p>
<p>For Ruff, there are two places where users can ask questions - discussions or issue tracker. We haven&#x27;t provided any strong recommendation on where to ask questions and we leave it to the user wherever they feel comfortable. For this reason, I&#x27;m not sure if we should include a &quot;Question&quot; template.</p>
<p>It might be useful to have a single place where we collect all these questions. I very much prefer discussions for user queries because of separate threads.</p>
<p>So, we could possibly replace the &quot;Question&quot; template with redirecting the users to the discussion or include the following two links in the &quot;Question&quot; template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion - https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions</li>
<li>Searching resolved questions: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues?q=is:issue%20state:closed%20label:question</li>

<p>This is a great point. We can link to the Discussions page instead.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t think transferring should be much of an issue as GitHub provides a one-click solution to this. My main motivation for keeping questions in a single place is for visibility and provide an easy way to search through existing resolved queries. This is not to say to transfer all existing issues but just to divert users to use a single place to store all queries.</p>

<p>Why: because they sometimes turn into bug reports which then requires transferring issues (which creates noise because it results in extra notifications). I also sometimes go over existing issues to see if they&#x27;ve been resolved, and I&#x27;d prefer if I don&#x27;t have to do this for discussions and issues.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting an explicit entry because it is automatically created (refer to the screenshot in the PR description)?</p>

<p>That seems reasonable, I&#x27;ll remove it. A potential solution would be to add a &quot;needs-triage&quot; label explicitly but we could leave that for future as we decided (in the past) to not move forward with it.</p>
<p>This does mean that the main benefit of using issue templates would be to provide suggestions based on what the user is intending to open an issue about. For example, if it&#x27;s a bug report, we&#x27;re asking them to check existing issues and optionally include the playground link for better reproduction.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s fair. At least if we use the same fields. We could consider explicitly asking for the rule code for bug reports.</p>
