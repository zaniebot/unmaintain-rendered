Can you first merge the RustPython, re-tag, and then update this PR with the updating tag?

Oh. Are we crating tags now for every change? Makes sense. I'll add some documentation to make this clear because I didn't create a tag last time (I thought we only do so when merging RustPython but that's obviously not sufficient)

Yeah, sorry, every time we update in Ruff we need to tag -- otherwise, we run the risk of breaking old Ruff builds when we rebase.

I'll go through the last upgrades and create the necessary tags. Does cargo support tags?

It does. I'll change it to use a tag instead

_Review comment by @charliermarsh on `Cargo.toml`:60 on 2023-06-23 19:18_

I think if you use a tag, then every time you run a Cargo command, it does a lookup to match the tag to a SHA. We ran into this once and reverted it -- it was extremely annoying.

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `Cargo.toml`:60 on 2023-06-23 20:32_

Created tags from 0.0.4 to 0.0.6
