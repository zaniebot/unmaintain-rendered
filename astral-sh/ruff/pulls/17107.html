            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/13520">python/typeshed#13520</a> the typeshed definition of <code>typing.Any</code> was changed from <code>Any = object()</code> to <code>class Any: ...</code>. Our automated typeshed updater pulled down this change in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17106">astral-sh/ruff#17106</a>, with the consequence that we no longer understand <code>Any</code>, which is... not good.</p>
<p>This PR gives us the ability to understand <code>Any</code> defined as a class instead of <code>object()</code>. It doesn&#x27;t remove our ability to understand the old form. Perhaps at some point we&#x27;ll want to remove it, but for now we may as well support both old and new typeshed?</p>
<p>This also directly patches typeshed to use the new form of <code>Any</code>; this is purely to work around our tests that no known class is inferred as <code>Unknown</code>, which otherwise fail with the old typeshed and the changes in this PR. (All other tests pass.) This patch to typeshed will shortly be subsumed by <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17106">astral-sh/ruff#17106</a> anyway.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Without the typeshed change in this PR, all tests pass except for the two <code>known_class_doesnt_fallback_to_unknown_unexpectedly_*</code> tests (so we still support the old form of defining <code>Any</code>). With the typeshed change in this PR, all tests pass, so we now support the new form in a way that is indistinguishable to our test suite from the old form. And indistinguishable to the ecosystem check: after rebasing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17106">astral-sh/ruff#17106</a> on this PR, there&#x27;s zero ecosystem impact.</p>
