# Ruff 0.11.0

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

Follow-up release for Ruff v0.10 that now includes the following two changes that we intended to ship but slipped:

* Changes to how the Python version is inferred when a `target-version` is not specified (#16319)
* `blanket-noqa` (`PGH004`): Also detect blanked file-level noqa comments (and not just line level comments).

## Test plan

I verified that the binary built on this branch respects the `requires-python` setting ([logs](https://www.diffchecker.com/qyJWYi6W/), left: v0.10, right: v0.11)

Any suggestions for how we could phrase this instead?

How about:

>This is a follow-up to release 0.10.0. Because of a mistake in the release process, the `requires-python` inference changes were not included in that release. Ruff 0.11.0 now includes this change as well as the stabilization of the preview behavior for `PGH004`.

Should we delete the rest of the section and end the note above by saying "The description of this change can be found in the changelog entry for 0.11.0" or something along those lines?

Looks good! Possible re-wording suggestion and a question on whether we should further edit the 0.10 changelog.

It looks like we could use a `NOTE`[^1] here if we want:

> [!NOTE]
> Because of a mistake in the release process, the `requires-python` inference changes are not included in this release and instead shipped as part of 0.11.0.

I'm not sure if that will render everywhere this file is displayed, though, maybe only on GitHub.

I think so, especially since they're so close together. We could even strikethrough the headline? That might be going too far, though.
