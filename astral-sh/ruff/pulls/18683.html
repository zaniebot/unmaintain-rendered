            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! This looks right to me from a quick skim, but I think this will need to be gated behind preview since UP008 is a stable rule, as was done in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17644.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I kind of preferred the old text for the first sentence/paragraph here. The second paragraph looks good, though.</p>
<p>I think you'll also need a reference link for <code>[preview]</code>, at least that's what I saw in other rules with a quick grep.</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">/// This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing the arguments from a call
/// may delete comments that are attached to the arguments.
///
/// In [preview], the fix is marked safe if no comments are present.
///
/// [preview]: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/
</code></pre>
<p>I guess we can do without the very last sentence if we bring back the old first bit.</p>
