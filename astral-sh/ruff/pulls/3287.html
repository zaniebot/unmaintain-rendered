            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a reason you can't just use <code>run: pipx run ruff==0.0.253</code>? It's a single line and far less complicated than this action. The <em>only</em> reason to make an action IMO (which itself should be a composite action running the pipx line above) would be to allow Dependabot to update GHA pinned versions, which this implementation doesn't allow!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>LOL 🤦  -- I didn't mean for this to be a PR in here [ until I worked it all out ].  Had been running PRs in my own repo/branch.</p>

<p>@henryiii -- to your point, that is reasonable.  BUT, so would --&gt;</p>
<p><code>uses: charliemarsh/ruff@v0</code> And that could accept more parameters.</p>
<p>This is partially a knowledge and patterns/practices thing for my teams of Data Engineers.  I am looking to arrive at appropriate actions to use, rather than them running bash/etc commands directly in actions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's nothing wrong with using <code>run:</code> actions and supported tools like <code>pipx</code>. That's what Actions was made for. You should look for an action only if it provides a benefit over using <code>run:</code>. <code>charliemarsh/ruff@v0</code> would provide no benefit over just directly using <code>pipx run ruff</code>, and it would require wrapping every option in a pass-through - not ideal at all. An action should only be added if it provides a benefit - better caching, pinning with auto-updates, simper setup, etc.</p>
<p>I'd say an action that uses a release and does not use the source code (which would always be true of a Ruff action, I think) should be in a separate repo anyway, like the pre-commit support already is. (FYI, you might look into pre-commit, it has an action &amp; supports lots of things too - see https://scikit-hep.org/developer/style &amp; https://scikit-hep.org/developer/gha_basic for some details).</p>
