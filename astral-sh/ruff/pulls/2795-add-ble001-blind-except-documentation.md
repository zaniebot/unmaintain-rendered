# Add BLE001 blind-except documentation

_Pull request opened by @Zeddicus414 on 2023-02-12 03:22_

I think that I did everything correctly. I'm hoping to help some more with the documentation.

I think we should merge BLE001 into E722 as per #2714, so I'd prefer us to only document the latter for now (#2796), since duplicating the documentation will make merging the rules harder.
