### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>indexmap-rs/indexmap (indexmap)</summary>

### [`v2.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/blob/HEAD/RELEASES.md#290-2025-04-04)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/indexmap-rs/indexmap/compare/2.8.0...2.9.0)

-   Added a `get_disjoint_mut` method to `IndexMap`, matching Rust 1.86's
    `HashMap` method.
-   Added a `get_disjoint_indices_mut` method to `IndexMap` and `map::Slice`,
    matching Rust 1.86's `get_disjoint_mut` method on slices.
-   Deprecated the `borsh` feature in favor of their own `indexmap` feature,
    solving a cyclic dependency that occured via `borsh-derive`.
