# Implement unused argument detection (`ARG`)

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-12-07 16:56_

This PR implements `flake8-unused-argument`, though the prefix differs (`ARG`) and I've split out the check into multiple distinctive codes for lambdas, function,s methods, class methods, and static methods.

Resolves: #870.
