            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the new lifetime parameter and the <code>settings</code> method were bad suggestions from me that really complicate things and might even be impossible. Sorry about that. There's definitely at least one place where a <code>settings</code> method can't be used because it borrows the whole <code>Checker</code> instead of just the field like the field access. I think that may be the problem here too because I ran into this same group of functions even without the new lifetime parameter.</p>
<p>The easiest fix of just replacing every <code>checker.settings</code> access with <code>checker.context.settings</code> and making those fields <code>pub(crate)</code> might be the way to go.</p>

<p>Can you go into more details? I would really prefer if we could lock down some of the <code>Checker</code> fields. Giving direct access has complicated refactors like this in the past (and do now) because moving the field always requires updating all uses</p>
