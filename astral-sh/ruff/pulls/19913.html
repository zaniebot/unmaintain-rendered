            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <code>ProjectFilesWalker</code> discovers all the files to check in a ty project by spawning multiple threads that walk the directory tree.
The walker's output is a <code>Vec</code> or <code>Set</code> of all the <code>File</code>s. The way this works today is that we first collect all file paths (multi threaded)
into a single <code>Vec</code>, and the main thread then interns the paths to their <code>File</code>'s.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that <code>system_path_to_file</code> is fairly expensive when called for many files because it does a <code>stat</code> call internally.</p>
<p>The ideal solution would move the <code>system_path_to_file</code> call to the walker threads. That would also eliminate the shared <code>Vec</code> that collects all paths. Unfortunately, this isn't possible because <code>&amp;dyn Db</code> isn't <code>Send</code> nor does <code>&amp;dyn Db</code> implement <code>Clone</code> (Salsa does have a <code>fork_db</code> feature but this isn't publicly exposed as of today). We also can't add a <code>fork</code> method to <code>ty_project::Db</code> that returns a cloned <code>Self</code> because the <code>Db</code> trait must be dyn compatible.</p>
<p>~~The solution I've taken here is to move the stat files into the walker threads, which fixes most of the waterfall effect and is much simpler than exposing <code>fork_db</code> properly in salsa.~~</p>
<p>I implemented the ideal solution thanks to @ibraheemdev's suggestion to add a <code>dyn_clone</code>!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we could. I had a versio where I did just that.</p>
<p>I considered it to be fine because <code>Files::try_system</code> also doesn't return a <code>Result</code> but the file directly (even if the path maps to a directory). This where I consider the distinction between <code>system_path_to_file</code> which makes sure it adds a query dependency on status (so that your query re-runs if the status changes) and protects you from getting a <code>File</code> that points to a directory or doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm going to revert all of this thanks to @ibraheemdev's suggestion</p>
