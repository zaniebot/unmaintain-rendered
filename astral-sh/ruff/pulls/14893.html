            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR changes our zizmor configuration to also flag low-severity security issues in our GitHub Actions workflows. It's a followup to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14844. The issues being fixed here were all flagged by <a href="https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/audits/#template-injection">zizmor's <code>template-injection</code> rule</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detects potential sources of code injection via template expansion.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions allows workflows to define template expansions, which occur within special <code>${{ ... }}</code> delimiters. These expansions happen before workflow and job execution, meaning the expansion of a given expression appears verbatim in whatever context it was performed in.</p>
<p>Template expansions aren't syntax-aware, meaning that they can result in unintended shell injection vectors. This is especially true when they're used with attacker-controllable expression contexts, such as <code>github.event.issue.title</code> (which the attacker can fully control by supplying a new issue title).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To fully remediate the vulnerability, you should not use <code>${{ env.VARNAME }}</code>, since that is still a template expansion. Instead, you should use <code>${VARNAME}</code> to ensure that the shell itself performs the variable expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I tested that this passes all zizmore warnings by running <code>pre-commit run -a zizmor</code> locally. The other test is obviously to check that the workflows all still run correctly in CI 😄</p>
