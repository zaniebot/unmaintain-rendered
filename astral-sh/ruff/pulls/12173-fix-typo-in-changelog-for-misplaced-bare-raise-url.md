# Fix typo in CHANGELOG for misplaced-bare-raise URL

_Pull request opened by @ThomasFaivre on 2024-07-03 17:23_

Hi all!

## Summary

Fix a typo.

## Test Plan

URL was tested with curl.



Not much left to say, except that I originally saw this issue on the blog post: https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.5.0
Not sure how it is related to the CHANGELOG.md file, so the post might need fixing as well.

Thanks for this incredible tool!
