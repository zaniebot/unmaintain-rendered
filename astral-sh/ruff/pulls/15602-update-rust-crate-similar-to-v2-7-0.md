### [`v2.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/similar/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#270)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/similar/compare/2.6.0...2.7.0)

-   Add optional support for `web-time` to support web WASM targets.  [#&#8203;73](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/similar/issues/73)
-   Crate will no longer panic wheh deadlines are used in WASM.  At worst
    deadlines are silently ignored.  To enforce deadlines enable the
    `wasm32_web_time` feature.  [#&#8203;74](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/similar/issues/74)
