<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR implements two new rules as described in #20766.</p>
<p>Main questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>where to put visibility check code and <strong>all</strong> parsing</li>
<li>where to put rules (new group or the existing group where it very clearly would fit in)</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Should trigger D1002 - undocumented public module variable (annotated)
public_var: int = 1

# Should NOT trigger - has docstring
documented_var: str = &quot;hello&quot;
&quot;&quot;&quot;This variable is documented.&quot;&quot;&quot;

# Should NOT trigger - private variable
_private_var: int = 2

class MyClass:
    # Should trigger D1001 - undocumented public class attribute (annotated)
    class_var: int = 10

    # Should NOT trigger - has docstring
    documented_class_var: str = &quot;test&quot;
    &quot;&quot;&quot;This class variable is documented.&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Tested with snapshots.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for working on this! However, I think we should try to reach a decision on whether we want to include this rule in Ruff before moving onto an implementation. I probably should have mentioned this explicitly on the issue, but that's why I added the <code>needs-decision</code> label (and typically add that label to any new rule request).</p>
<p>Every rule adds some maintenance burden, and in my experience the docstring rules are especially error prone. At a minimum we should wait a little while and see if others are interested in this rule. I'll also approve the workflow run so we can get a sense for the ecosystem impact, but that can be another useful factor.</p>
<p>I searched a bit for previous issues and only really found https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12434. I think there could be some overlap with the attribute-related pydoclint rules that haven't been implemented yet.</p>
