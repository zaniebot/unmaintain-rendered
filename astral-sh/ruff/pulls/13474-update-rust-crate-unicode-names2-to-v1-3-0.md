Technically, this means that our parser might accept unicode names that Python 3.12 doesn't because [it uses unicode 15](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/unicodedata.html) and this PR updates to unicode 16. I think that's fine for now but we may want to maintain our own table of unicode names that are available in newer unicode standards but not in a specific python version.
