# Add "D401" in missing ignore

In the pydocstyle documentation
(http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/6.1.1/error_codes.html) they give a list of codes to ignore to follow the google docstring conventions. The list in the README was missing the code "D401" compared to pydocstyles list.

My bad. Did not realize this was not implemented.
