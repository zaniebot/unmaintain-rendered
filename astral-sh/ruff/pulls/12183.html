            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR wraps the public-visible <code>Program</code> methods to use <code>Cancelled::catch</code> to prevent that any salsa cancellation tears down its thread.</p>
<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think this change is safe in Rust terms, but it is what rust-analyzer and other Salsa based compilers to (most implement the <code>UnwindSafe</code> marker trait but I prefer not to do this).
I&#x27;ve opened a Zulip thread to get more guidance but, for now, I think this is sufficiently &quot;safe&quot; (I hate this).</p>
Test Plan
<p>I ran <code>red_knot</code> with <code>RED_KNOT_SLOW_LINT=1</code> which adds an artificial 10s pause to the <code>lint</code> query. The query was correctly cancelled when I made changes to a file in the workspace directory without tearing down the entire rayon thread pool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t have a ton of context here, but I&#x27;m not too concerned about this personally. Unwind Safety is not the same as Safety in Rust-speak. Like, there&#x27;s no UB risk here. Violating unwind safety can lead to logic bugs around mutation or inconsistent state, but is never supposed to lead to UB. (I use the weasel word &quot;supposed to&quot; here because anyone can write unsound APIs in Rust that purportedly rely on unwind safety to avoid UB, but, well, that&#x27;s unsound. And the fault is on the code relying on unwind safety to avoid UB and <em>not</em> on the code using <code>AssertUnwindSafe</code>.) There have been rumblings about <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-deprecating-unwindsafe/15974">deprecating unwind safety altogether</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @BurntSushi. That&#x27;s very helpful. I share some of the sentiment from the linked thread. It was very unclear to me how big of a problem it is. The compiler erroring makes it extremely scary. I now feel less bad about this.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately yes. Salsa uses panics to abort queries when some input has changed to not waste time computing outdated results to error out and to recover from cyclic queries. I would rather prefer a <code>Result</code>, but I can see how this would hurt ergonomics quite a bit. But maybe something to bring up again, although I think it&#x27;s an unlikely change to be accepted because rust-analyzer would have to rewrite all their code to Result&#x27;s.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I see. It circumvents the &quot;cancellation&quot; problem. Yeah, I can see how panics would be a very attractive solution to that problem.</p>
<p>IIRC, Go&#x27;s runtime implements pre-emptive multi-tasking by spawning signals to interrupt CPU heavy code. It&#x27;s not the <em>same</em> problem as here, but it feels similarish. (I&#x27;m not suggesting the use of signals, but rather, pointing out the difficulty of arbitrary cancellation.)</p>
