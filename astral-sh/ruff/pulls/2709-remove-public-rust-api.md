# Remove public Rust API

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-10 04:07_

GitHub's dependency tracker indicates that this is unused, and it's not really supported. I'd rather remove it before people start depending on it. We'll introduce a proper public API later.

Closes #2514.
