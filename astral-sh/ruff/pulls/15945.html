            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR makes it possible to opt into diagnostic snappshotting
in mdtests. To opt in, add <code>snapshot-diagnostic</code> to the info string
on at least one of the code blocks in a single test. Like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Unresolvable module import

```py snapshot-diagnostic
import zqzqzqzqzqzqzq
```
</code></pre>
<p>This integrates with <code>insta</code> via external file snapshotting, so
one can just use <code>cargo insta</code> to manage the snapshots like you
would anywhere else.</p>
<p>While highly desirable, this doesn't support inline snapshotting.
I don't see an easy way to make this work with <code>insta</code>, so I think
we'd have to roll our own snapshotting system. I actually do think
that's probably worth doing, but this at least gets us some integration
with mdtests and full diagnostic output without too much effort.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This worries me, particularly in combination with non-rendered info string being used to mark a code block as snapshotted. I think it will be confusing to have code blocks in our mdtest files that look like they are asserting a particular code example is diagnostic-free when it isn't. In source form, this is somewhat mitigated by the presence of the <code>snapshot-diagnostic</code> tag (though I still think it's not ideal); in rendered form it could be very confusing.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to instead try without this special case, and just require the inline assertions too. I realize this could seem redundant, but I'm not sure it really is. I think out-of-file full snapshots are a pretty inconvenient way to make any kind of semantic assertions (I mean mostly for the reader here; snapshotting makes it pretty convenient for the <em>writer</em>. But I think readability of tests is very important!), so I don't think we want to be relying on out-of-file snapshots for testing semantics, only for testing diagnostic display.</p>
<p>So maybe this partly depends how we use the out-of-file snapshot feature. If we mostly just take existing semantic tests that we wanted to have anyway, add a snapshot-diagnostic tag to some of them, and then also have full diagnostic snapshotting, then I think it's fine (and preferable) if we still require the inline comment assertions. But if we end up needing a lot of edge-case tests of diagnostic rendering that aren't really doubling as semantic tests, I could see it getting irritating to have to still provide the inline comments.</p>
<p>If we envision mostly the latter case, then I would rather segregate our diagnostic-snapshot tests entirely into separate files, that are clearly marked as solely testing diagnostic output, not semantics. In this case I think not requiring inline comments is OK. But if we are going to have intermixed tests in the same file, or tests serving double duty as both tests of semantics and diagnostic rendering, then I don't want to permit leaving out the inline assertions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm wondering about the rationale or need for this. It seems confusing. Is it difficult to implement snapshotting for some files in a test and not others? If so, then I wonder if we should find a different way to signal the need for snapshotting, that is scoped to the markdown heading and not to the code block. If not, then it seems less confusing to me to only snapshot the code blocks explicitly marked for snapshotting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just a quick (not full) response for now:</p>
<p>The main reason I went with this approach is because I perceive needing to write inline assertions for tests specifically for diagnostics to be pretty annoying. Like, just thinking about my recent work on ruff when I upgraded <code>annotate-snippets</code>, I had to go through something 1000+ snapshots. If I didn't have tooling to let me automatically update snapshots, that would have taken me way longer. So I guess where I'm going with this is that I perceive the inline assertions to be very manual, and I worry about the work required to update them when diagnostics change.</p>
<p>With all that said, the inline assertions also contain a lot less information. And are probably less susceptible to churn. So maybe this is fine. But there's definitely still some work involved in creating them in the first place that I can imagine being annoying if I want to write a test for diagnostics and not semantics.</p>
<p>I was also thinking that it would be nice for the semantic tests to also double as diagnostic tests. But maybe that's not a good idea?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a sense of how to enforce this?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I thought about this, and it felt really confusing to me to enable diagnostics for only one file instead of just everything in the test. I guess &quot;snapshot diagnostics from everything that would be emitted by <code>red-knot check</code>&quot; makes more sense to me than &quot;snapshot diagnostics only from this file.&quot; I see the former as more holistic and the thing we most want to test.</p>
<p>But I don't have nearly as much experience as you @MichaReiser in working on diagnostics and testing them. Do you have different instincts here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's pretty easy to implement. See my other comment above for why I went this direction.

<p>Yeah, makes sense. For inline assertions that just assert an error code (the majority), I don't think changes to diagnostic rendering will cause churn; those assertions should only need to change if semantics or rule codes change. We do sometimes use the inline assertions to assert that some semantic information is present and clearly worded in a diagnostic message; these might be more likely to churn with changes to diagnostic rendering, if the rendering change also implies a different way of wording the message.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If we want to go in this direction (segregate snapshot tests, don't have tests doing double duty) then I think perhaps just using a file-wide marker (rather than section-wide or per-code-block) to choose snapshotting would both enforce this separation and also address the other question of scoping of the <code>snapshot-diagnostics</code> option?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think there's existing markdown syntax that lends itself naturally to this. One way to leverage existing mdtest syntax would be to make it an option in the toml config that can be optionally provided (as its own code block), but this is pretty verbose, and I'm not sure I like having mdtest-specific (as opposed to red-knot) configuration in those toml blocks.</p>
<p>So beyond that, I guess it could be something like adding <code>[snapshot]</code> to the end of the header line? Or on the next non-empty line after the header?</p>

If I roll that part back and still require the inline assertions (with the snapshot essentially just being an opt-in add-on at that point), are you okay with diagnostic tests being inter-mingled here? Or do you think it's still worth separating them out and using a file-scoped option?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm okay with test-level opt-in to snapshotting. The only drawback is that I could see it being useful to only select a single (or few) diagnostics to be snapshotted to avoid having to write extra diagnostic tests (we might still want to do that for complex diagnostics):</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/d082c1b2026afdc0fda0d90553f0d71157877242/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/binary/custom.md#L81-L107</p>
<p>The syntax I've in mind is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a / 0 # error[snapshot]: [division-by-zero]

# or 
a / 0 # snapshot: [division-by-zero]
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice if we could just snapshot one diagnostic as an example instead of writing an extra test for the diagnostic that otherwise duplicates that test case.</p>
<p>Or a similar one https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/5e9259c96c910fe9031b7781867c8b82bffa0b26/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/binary/integers.md#L73-L102</p>
<p>The mdtest framework would collect all diagnostics for all assertions marked as <code>[snapshot</code>] for a single test and write them to the same snapshot file.</p>
<p>The counterargument why having a separate test is useful is that it provides better isolation and prevents otherwise unrelated changes (e.g. adding a new expression to one such test) to change the diagnostic output because the line numbers change.</p>

<p>I don't think this costs us much in terms of how the snapshot is rendered by GitHub -- it already does not apply MarkDown rendering to this file, due to the <code>.snap</code> file extension:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Overall this is awesome!</p>
<p>I have similar concerns to @carljm:</p>
<ul>
<li>To me it's pretty counter-intuitive that adding <code>snapshot-diagnostics</code> to one code fence would enable snapshotting for all embedded files in the mdtest suite. I would prefer a mechanism that makes it more obvious that it toggles the setting for the whole mdtest (if that's the way we want to enable snapshotting), such as an HTML comment at the top of the file (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15945/files#r1942686379)</li>
<li>I'm also not sure I'm keen on having mdtest automatically ignore unmatched diagnostics if there are no inline assertions and diagnostic snapshotting is enabled. It feels too implicit and error-prone to me, and I don't find adding an inline assertion to be particularly arduous if you only assert the error code (omitting the error message). One of the reasons I'm most excited about snapshotting is I think we can assert the full error message much less in our inline assertions; the full error message feels like something that's much better covered by our snapshots, enabling us to keep our inline assertions concise, readable, and focussed on whether we capture Python's semantics correctly.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another consideration is how we'd envision inline snapshots to work.</p>
<ul>
<li>With <code>error[snapshot]</code>: I'd expect that the md test framework is in full control of the ``` code block and it adds it if there's any <code>error[snapshot]</code> and otherwise removes it. It isn't something a user ever has to write.</li>
<li>With a test-level marker: It's up to users if they want an inline snapshot or out of bound snapshot. Out of bound snapshots use the test level marker (e.g. what Alex suggested with a <code>&lt;!-- snapshot-diagnostics --&gt;</code>) and inline snapshots use <code>output</code>.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is it possible to change the snapshot extension to <code>md.snap</code> so that we get markdown rendering on Github? (you might also have to insert an artificial newline at the start of the file to have the title separated from <code>---</code>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Andrew tried that, but unfortunately the MarkDown rendering made it completely unreadable, as GitHub thought we were trying to make an HMTL table. See discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15945#discussion_r1943048249 :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think for now I'd prefer not to spend more time fiddling with this. The existing <code>.md.snap</code> files don't render well either: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/a3f802acb4aacb7a6ff3d8daaae4dd9cf3620f8d/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pylint/rules/snapshots/ruff_linter__rules__pylint__rules__unreachable__tests__if.py.md.snap#L4</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, so I've at least put the full path to the mdtest file here.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about a link. Since this already isn't rendering well as Markdown on GitHub. But if we get that working then I think just turning it into a relative link that GitHub understands should be straight-forward.</p>
