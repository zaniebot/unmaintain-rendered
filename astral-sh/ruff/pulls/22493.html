<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This PR fixes #20811 , current approach reverses the order in <code>BtreeSet</code> however as pointed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20811#issuecomment-3398958832 here we cannot use I<code>IndexSet</code> to preserve config order since Settings derives <code>CacheKey</code> which isn't implemented for <code>IndexSet</code>, another approach to preserve the original order might be to use <code>Vec</code> however lookup time complexity might get affected as a result.</p>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I have tested it locally its working as expected ,
