            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This is a first step toward <code>global</code> support in red-knot (#15385). I went through all the matches for <code>global</code> in the <code>mypy/test-data</code> directory, but I didn&#x27;t find anything too interesting that wasn&#x27;t already covered by @carljm&#x27;s suggestions on Discord. I still pulled in a couple of cases for a little extra variety. I also included a section from the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/load-before-global-declaration/">PLE0118</a> tests in ruff that will become syntax errors once astral-sh/ruff#17463 is merged and we handle <code>global</code> statements.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I figured out how to use <code>@Todo</code> properly, so please let me know if I need to fix that. I hope this is a good start to the test suite otherwise.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And typically (for easier reading of the later diff that fixes the TODO!) we try to put these messages as close as we can to the spot where something will change:</p>
<pre><code>A `global` statement causes lookup to skip any bindings in intervening scopes:

```py
x = 1

def outer():
    x = &quot;&quot;

    def inner():
        global x

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: you could use declarations here (<code>x: int = 1</code> and <code>x: str = &quot;&quot;</code>) to get rid of the <code>Unknown |</code> in the types, which is not really relevant to the point of this test and kinda just noise? But it&#x27;s fine either way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: in this case I probably wouldn&#x27;t call out the pyright/mypy behavior difference. The reason is that both of them do narrow the global type of <code>int | None</code> to eliminate the <code>None</code>, based on the local assignment. The fact that narrowing is done at all is the key behavior this test asserts, and it is in line with both mypy and pyright, which typically means we don&#x27;t bother commenting on their behavior.</p>
<p>The question of whether <code>x = 1</code> narrows to <code>int</code> or to <code>Literal[1]</code> is really a separate issue of how eager type checkers are to use literal types, which may be relevant for us to comment on somewhere, but probably not here.</p>
<p>(Another way of saying this is that we could write this same test using non-literal types -- e.g. <code>x: C | None</code> at global scope and <code>x = C()</code> in the function -- and in that case we would see identical behavior from mypy and pyright, and the test would still be testing the same thing we care about here. The literal-types difference is something unrelated to <code>global</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a useful test case, but despite happening to use a <code>global</code> statement, it&#x27;s not related to <code>global</code>. The same case could be constructed without <code>global</code>, just making <code>g</code> a local in <code>f</code> and using an <code>assert</code> (or <code>if</code> with early return, or whatever) to narrow its type instead. In other words, the test is really about how nested functions can or cannot make use of narrowed types in the outer scope. Which is a topic we do need to address, but it&#x27;s not related to <code>global</code>. So I don&#x27;t think we should include this test here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a pretty basic unremarkable test for how <code>global</code> should work -- it&#x27;s fine that you happened to get it from mypy, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful to preserve that information here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Again not sure the provenance information (from ruff tests) is useful here.</p>
<p>Typically we would go ahead and put a TODO comment right above each and every specific line that should error, rather than a single blanket TODO comment here. That makes it much clearer to a future contributor exactly where errors should and should not appear (and on which line(s)), and makes the TODO-fixing diff much simpler to review for correctness.</p>
