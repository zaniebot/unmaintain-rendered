# Fix typo in docs of PLR6301

---

_Pull request opened by @timobrembeck on 2023-10-05 20:37_

## Summary
The example code for [PLR6301 (no-self-use)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/no-self-use/#example) contains f-strings without placeholder expressions, which is discouraged according to [F541 (f-string-missing-placeholders)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/f-string-missing-placeholders/).
For such a trivial change, I didn't open a separate issue.
