            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I was reading through ruff&#x27;s pydocstyle rules as part of my work on rule recategorisation, and found the docs for the rules regarding docstring sections surprisingly hard to parse. Specifically, I found it hard to distinguish which rules were merely enforcing stylistic conventions, and which ones were guarding against incorrect reStructuredText syntax that would likely cause errors if you were using the docstrings to generate documentation with Sphinx. Additionally, many of the rules have docs that start with a paragraph that&#x27;s a basic primer on how multiline docstrings work (which is essentially the same for all the rules), and only move on to information that&#x27;s specific to the individual rule in later paragraphs.</p>
<p>This PR has the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a &quot;newspaper style&quot; of prose, where the topic is summarised first and explained in more depth in later paragraphs. For each rule, use the first sentence of the &quot;Why is this bad?&quot; section to give a clear description of why the antipattern is bad:<ul>
<li>Is the rule just enforcing stylistic consistency, or is it also guarding against incorrect RST syntax?</li>
<li>Does it apply to all docstring conventions, or just one or two?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use &quot;multiline&quot; consistently everywhere, rather than &quot;multi-line&quot;. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/m/multi</li>
<li>Use slightly clearer and/or more concise language in several places.</li>
<li>Give more complete explanations in a few places.</li>
<li>Rework some examples to make the violations slightly more obvious.</li>
</ul>
