            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This introduces <code>GotoTarget::Call</code> that represents the kind of ambiguous/overloaded click of a callable-being-called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">x = mymodule.MyClass(1, 2)
             ^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to <code>GotoTarget::Expression</code> for the same span but enriched
with information about the actual callable implementation.</p>
<p>That is, if you click on <code>MyClass</code> in <code>MyClass()</code> it is <em>both</em> a
reference to the class and to the initializer of the class. Therefore
it would be ideal for goto-* and docstrings to be some intelligent
merging of both the class and the initializer.</p>
<p>In particular the callable-implementation (initializer) is prioritized over the callable-itself (class) so when showing docstrings we will preferentially show the docs of the initializer if it exists, and then fallback to the docs of the class.</p>
<p>For goto-definition/goto-declaration we will yield both the class and the initializer, requiring you to pick which you want (this is perhaps needlessly pedantic but...).</p>

<p>Pyright jumps to the definition of the class. I'm leaning towards aligning the behavior for now (although it is somewhat unexpected, so maybe what you have is best)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Something I've vaguely been considering is another variant of DefinitionsOrTargets that has two lists of definitions: one is the &quot;right&quot; answer and one is &quot;fallback&quot;. So docstrings would consider both but goto-def would be opinionated and just pick one?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok I've rebased this on top of #20148 and minimized its intelligence, making this a reasonably safe change. I'm going to land this now (feedback is the best way to iterate on exact UX of this I think).</p>
