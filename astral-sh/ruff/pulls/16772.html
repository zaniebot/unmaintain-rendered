Summary


<p>This PR follows the discussion from #1014 and add a new opt-in rule <code>TID254</code> which is requiring relative import for sibling (and nested) modules.
It requires the <code>linter.flake8-tidy-imports.relative-sibling-imports</code> setting to be <code>true</code> to avoid users having enabled all <code>TID</code> to have their imports rewritten if they did not choose to as it is one of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports">2 suggested PEP8 alternatives</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, explicit relative imports are an acceptable alternative to absolute imports, especially when dealing with complex package layouts where using absolute imports would be unnecessarily verbose:</p>
<pre><code>from . import sibling
from .sibling import example
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Fixes #1014</p>
Test Plan


<p>Multiple test cases have been added to the test suite, with associated expected snapshots, and it has been tested on some external codebases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on this. It might take me a while before I get to thinking through the implications of this change. The concerns are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It creates a new rule that doesn&#x27;t exist upstream. We&#x27;ve made exceptions for some categories in the past but it comes with its own set of problems, which is why we&#x27;re more hesitant to keep doing that (e.g. what if upstream adds a TID254...)</li>
<li>Rules that require explicit opt-in with an option tend to be confusing for users. I see the motivation here, but it still applies. What&#x27;s the rationale for not integrating this into TID252?</li>
<li>I&#x27;d have to double check if this rule doesn&#x27;t conflict with any other rule (that&#x27;s not really a concern, only a thing that needs doing)</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi 👋🏼</p>
<p>Thanks for the prompt response.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll answer the bullet points in the same order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It creates a new rule that doesn&#x27;t exist upstream. We&#x27;ve made exceptions for some categories in the past but it comes with its own set of problems, which is why we&#x27;re more hesitant to keep doing that (e.g. what if upstream adds a TID254...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I took the liberty of submitting this pull request as the TID namespace already diverged from the upstream (<code>TID253</code> doesn&#x27;t exist in <code>flake8-tidy-import</code>), so this PR doesn&#x27;t introduce this problem, it takes benefit from the fact the problem already exists (I know, weird thinking).
I actually submitted an upstream PR 2 years ago (<a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-tidy-imports/pull/441">adamchainz/flake8-tidy-imports#441</a>), I didn&#x27;t have feedback since, and I stop hoping for (I didn&#x27;t insist either as the maintainer doesn&#x27;t seem happy about it, and I didn&#x27;t want to pressure him)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rules that require explicit opt-in with an option tend to be confusing for users. I see the motivation here, but it still applies. What&#x27;s the rationale for not integrating this into TID252?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, I can, the initial PR (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/3986">astral-sh/ruff#3986</a>) was doing that.
It was more about the semantic: the rule is advertising &quot;Prefer absolute imports over relative imports from parent modules&quot; and this PR is doing the opposite for siblings. It would mean that the same rule could say &quot;Prefer absolute imports over relative imports from parents modules&quot; and &quot;Prefer relative imports over absolute imports for siblings modules&quot;.
But if this is acceptable, I&#x27;ll rework this PR to make this a TID252 setting and change the documentation sentence for something more generic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;d have to double check if this rule doesn&#x27;t conflict with any other rule (that&#x27;s not really a concern, only a thing that needs doing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If TID252 <code>ban-relative-imports</code> is set to <code>all</code>, it is by design contradictory with this rule. That&#x27;s why I documented that it should be set to <code>parents</code> in the docstring.</p>
<p>What would be acceptable to you if I just integrate it with TID252?</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply use a 3rd <code>ban-relative-import</code> value like <code>parents-with-relative-siblings</code> with would ensure no conflict at the cost of being a bit contradictory with the <code>ban</code> term</li>
<li>Keep the separate setting with a warning about the conflict?</li>
<li>Another better approach</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#x27;ll do any necessary change to have this feature merged because I still have the need for this and from #1014, I don&#x27;t seem to be the only one.</p>
