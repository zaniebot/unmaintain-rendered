<p>Partially addresses https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/242</p>
<p>The solution isn't ideal, but our problem is that the module resolves first queries if certain first-party files exist and only then resolves the standard library modules. The issue with that is that any query that depends on a resolved standard library module now depends on non-existing LOW durability files, negating the benefit of giving standard library files high durability.</p>
<p>This PR changes the durability of the <code>File::status</code> to at least medium. This is still not perfect because it means that all standard library queries that depend on module resolution still have a MEDIUM durability instead of HIGH, but it's better than what we have today, and it should allow Salsa to take the &quot;fast-incremental path&quot; more often.</p>
<p>This possibly helps with https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14024</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So just to make sure I understand the effect here: module resolutions that only use typeshed files (but first have to verify that some first-party paths don't exist) will now be MEDIUM instead of LOW durability, meaning we won't have to re-resolve those paths on any change to a first-party file. Adding a previously-not-existent first-party file will count as a MEDIUM durability input change, and cause those queries to have to re-execute. Is that an accurate summary?</p>
<p>Looks good!</p>
