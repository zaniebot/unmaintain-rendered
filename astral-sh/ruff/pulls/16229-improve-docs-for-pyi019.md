# Improve docs for PYI019

---

_@AlexWaygood_

## Summary

I noticed our docs here were a little lacking. In particular, the fix does quite a lot of different things, and I think it's worth spelling it all out a bit more clearly.

## Test Plan

- `uvx pre-commit run -a`
- I re-read it multiple times to make sure it all made sense
