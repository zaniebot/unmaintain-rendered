            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The root issues with this implementation is that ty_python_semantic doesn't really provide a way to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>~~hey there's a string literal here, is this a type annotation?~~</li>
<li>hey this substring of a string annotation, what type is it?</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>~~currently assume <em>every</em> string literal that is shaped like a type annotation <em>is</em> one (and <em>not</em> a <code>str</code>)~~</li>
<li>~~can't implement <code>goto_type_definition</code> for types we find in type annotations~~<ul>
<li>can only report <code>goto_type_definition</code> to be the type of the whole string, and not the substring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>~~find-and-replace functionality may erroneously edit random strings that happen to match?~~</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully I don't <em>think</em> adding the necessary APIs to ty_python_semantic (or whatever) is actually that hard..? perhaps famous last words.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I thought of a way to technically ask the inference engine &quot;hey is this string an annotation?&quot; (ask what the string infers to, and check if that's literally the string it is. if it's not, it must be a type annotation.)</p>
<p>This leaves the only real issue being &quot;way to ask the type of a substring of an annotation&quot;. I think this is technically shippable but a bit dubious.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This doesn't look to horrible and I wouldn't mind merging it, except that it's probably not that useful either because it is limited to names.</p>
<p>Looking at this, it's also not a go to definition specific problem. E.g. rename also doesn't consider references in stringified annotations (I think).</p>
<p>I don't have a great idea for how to support this holisticly from the top of my mind. One idea that we floated in the past and might work here is to support virtual documents.</p>
<p>A virtual document (or file) is a snippet from within another file but it gets its own <code>File</code> id (it probably has to be an id layered on top of <code>File</code> but conceptually its an id that can be a real file or a virtual file).</p>
<p>We'll need a similar feature if we ever want to support embedded code, e.g. some SQL inside python. We wouldn't want to re-parse that sql statement for formatting and linting, it should only be parsed once.</p>
<p>I think this idea is also similar to how rust analyzer handles macros.</p>
<p>https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/59ef84506deb45e6d4336935d0d4be54c3386814/crates/hir-expand/src/lib.rs#L1074-L1077</p>
<p>This is obviously a pretty big change. I'd be okay punting on this for the beta but we should create an issue outlining the problems we've run into.</p>
