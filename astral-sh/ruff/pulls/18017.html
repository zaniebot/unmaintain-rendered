            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>This is a question for everyone. Are there any other implicit method calls to non-dunder methods? Should we rename the rule to <code>possibly-unbound-implicit-call</code> to make it more explicit that this is about implicit calls and less about calls to dunder methods (e.g. calling a possibly unbound dunder method gives a possibly-unbound-attribute` error).</p>
<p>The other thing that isn&#x27;t clear to me is why we have a call-possibly-undounb-method specifically for dunder calls but not for other call related errors. Should we just remove the error code altogether and instead use a custom message or note instead?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In Python 3.14, <code>fractions.Fraction</code> implicitly calls <code>as_integer_ratio</code>. There are plenty of other implicit calls (search for <code>getattr</code> and <code>hasattr</code> in the CPython source) but that seems to be the most user-facing and well-documented one.</p>
