### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>astral-sh/setup-uv (astral-sh/setup-uv)</summary>

### [`v6.3.1`](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/releases/tag/v6.3.1): 🌈 Do not warn when version not in manifest-file

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv/compare/v6.3.0...v6.3.1)

##### Changes

This is a hotfix to change the warning messages that a version could not be found in the local manifest-file to info level.

A `setup-uv` release contains a version-manifest.json file with infos in all available `uv` releases. When a new `uv` version is released this is not contained in this file until the file gets updated and a new `setup-uv` release is made.
We will overhaul this process in the future but for now the spamming of warnings is removed.
