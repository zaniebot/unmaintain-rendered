            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>[Summary is now out of date, but is preserved for posterity. See conversation below.]</p>
<p>This PR adds Python 3.14 to the list of versions that we allow users to select for the <code>target-version</code> setting. The motivation is that this will allow us to detect if the target version is Python 3.14 or higher in #14623 and, if so, we can recommend using the faster function <code>Path.scandir()</code> in that rule rather than <code>Path.iterdir()</code>.</p>
<p>This PR <em>does not</em> generally declare that Ruff <em>supports</em> Python 3.14. I'm pretty hesitant to do that while Python 3.14 is still in its alpha period, since there might be many APIs (and even new syntax) added between now and the point when the first 3.14 beta is released. However, I don't see much harm in allowing users to <em>select</em> Python 3.14 as their target version now, even if we don't yet officially declare that we support Python 3.14.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The alternative to doing this is that we just open an issue reminding us to update the rule being added in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14623 when we formally declare support for Python 3.14, after the first 3.14 beta is released. But I think it's pretty likely we'll just forget about that issue, and won't actually update the rule when the time comes.</p>

<p>I don't disagree with this but I also don't see a significant benefit to it. I don't mind adding it to the list if we think adding https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14623 now is the right choice but I would otherwise wait until we have an actual use case for it (or I'm worried that we'll get bug reports for Python 3.14 features)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14623 was rejected, so there's no longer a strong reason to add <code>Py314</code> variants to the various enums we have around the repo. I don't think it's awful to allow users to select it before we officially support it, but it's at least a bit weird, so I've abandoned that for now. All that's left are some minor refactors that should make adding support for Python 3.14 a bit easier when the time comes to do so.</p>
