<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR is a more holistic fix for https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9534 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9159.</p>
<p>When we visit the AST, we track nodes that we need to visit <em>later</em> (deferred nodes). For example, when visiting a function, we defer the function body, since we don't want to visit the body until we've visited the rest of the statements in the containing scope.</p>
<p>However, deferred nodes can themselves contain deferred nodes... For example, a function body can contain a lambda (which contains a deferred body). And then there are rarer cases, like a lambda inside of a type annotation.</p>
<p>The aforementioned issues were fixed by reordering the deferral visits to catch common cases. But even with those fixes, we still fail on cases like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from __future__ import annotations

import re
from typing import cast

cast(lambda: re.match, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Since we don't expect lambdas to appear inside of type definitions.</p>
<p>This PR modifies the <code>Checker</code> to keep visiting until all the deferred stacks are empty. We <em>already</em> do this for any one kind of deferred node; now, we do it for <em>all</em> of them at a level above.</p>
