            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Follow-up from #18401, I was looking at whether that would fix the issue at https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/247#issuecomment-2917656676 and it didn't, which made me realize that the PR only inferred <code>list[T]</code> when the value type was tuple but it could be other types as well.</p>
<p>This PR fixes the actual issue by inferring <code>list[T]</code> for the non-tuple type case.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Add test cases for starred expression involved with non-tuple type. I also added a few test cases for list type and list literal.</p>
<p>I also verified that the example in the linked issue comment works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def _(line: str):
    a, b, *c = line.split(maxsplit=2)
    c.pop()

<p>Yeah, I noticed that as well. I'm not exactly sure why that is happening. I plan to look at it in a bit.</p>

<p>Some other edge cases that look like they're maybe not-yet covered in <code>unpacking.md</code>, and could be good to add as tests. It looks like we have the correct behaviour on all of them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">() = []

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what's the value of the empty list / tuple test case. What is it that you had in mind to test that for? I remember there being similar test cases in the corpus source which seems more useful for these as it would test whether the inference is being done as expected or not.</p>
<p>The single unpacking elements examples that you've provided is being tested by way of being surrounded by other elements, not in isolation. For example, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bdf83fd246f54a51ae3038a176be7e382e219632/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/unpacking.md?plain=1#L117-L124">this</a> is the <code>list[Unknown]</code> case and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bdf83fd246f54a51ae3038a176be7e382e219632/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/unpacking.md?plain=1#L126-L133">this</a> is the <code>list[Literal[1]]</code> case in your example.</p>
<p>I'll go ahead and merge this PR but happy to follow-up with the empty list / tuple test cases if you think it's useful.</p>

<p>It's just a weird edge case that only works by virtue of unpacking at runtime: a zero-length list on the right-hand side is assigned to a zero-length target list on the right-hand side. It's useful to show that we model the runtime accurately: that we understand such code as valid and do not emit any diagnostics on it.</p>
