<p>We may not want this because the type display implementations are not guaranteed to be valid Python, however, unless they're going to highlight invalid syntax this seems like a better interim value than &quot;text&quot;? I'm not the expert though. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/749#issuecomment-3026201114 for prior commentary.</p>
<p>edit: Going back further to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17057#discussion_r2028151621 for prior context, it turns out they <em>do</em> highlight invalid syntax in red which is quite unfortunate and probably a blocker here.</p>

<p>I tried in VS Code and everything looks kind of nice, actually. I don't see any invalid syntax highlighting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess that would be dependent on the color scheme.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think this should be fine. I'm not even sure whether the red color is coming from it being a syntax error. For the color scheme that I use (Gruvbox), the keywords are highlighted as red, so I only see the red color for keywords e.g., in <code>&lt;class 'Foo'&gt;</code> the &quot;class&quot; is red colored but it's not due to the syntax error.</p>
