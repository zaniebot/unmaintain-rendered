# [ty] Split `ParamSpec` mdtests to separate legacy and PEP 695 tests

---

_@dhruvmanila_

## Summary

This is another small refactor for https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21445 that splits the single `paramspec.md` into `generics/legacy/paramspec.md` and `generics/pep695/paramspec.md`.

## Test Plan

Make sure that all mdtests pass.

Going to merge this without review as this is just a mechanical refactor, the tests are as-is.
