### [`v0.31.0`](https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.rst#0310)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/python-jsonschema/check-jsonschema/compare/0.30.0...0.31.0)

-   Update vendored schemas: azure-pipelines, bamboo-spec, buildkite, circle-ci,
    dependabot, gitlab-ci, mergify, readthedocs, renovate, taskfile (2025-01-07)
-   Drop support for Python 3.8
-   Rename `--format-regex` to `--regex-variant` and convert
    `--format-regex` to a deprecated alias.
    It will be removed in a future release.
-   Regular expression interpretation in `"pattern"`, `"patternProperties"`, and
    `"format": "regex"` usages now uses unicode-mode JS regular expressions by
    default. (:issue:`353`)

    -   Use `--regex-variant nonunicode` to get non-unicode JS regular
        expressions, the default behavior from previous versions.
    -   Custom validators may be impacted by the new regular expression
        features. Validators are now always modified with the `jsonschema`
        library's `extend()` API to control the `pattern` and
        `patternProperties` keywords.
