<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Implement support for RDJson output for <code>ruff check</code>, as requested in #8655.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Tested using a snapshot test. Same approach as for e.g. the JSON output formatter.</p>
<h2>Additional info</h2>
<p>I tried to keep the implementation close to the JSON implementation.</p>
<p>I had to deviate a bit to make the <code>suggestions</code> key work: If there are no suggestions, then setting <code>suggestions</code> to <code>null</code> is invalid according to the JSONSchema. Therefore, I opted for a slightly more complex implementation, that skips the <code>suggestions</code> key entirely if there are no fixes available for the given diagnostic. Maybe it would have been easier to set <code>&quot;suggestions&quot;: []</code>, but I ended up doing it this way.</p>
<p>I didn't consider notebooks, as I <em>think</em> that RDJson doesn't work with notebooks. This should be confirmed, and if so, there should be some form of warning or error emitted when trying to output diagnostics for a notebook.</p>
<p>I also didn't consider <code>ruff format</code>, as this comment: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8655#issuecomment-1811446160 suggests that that wouldn't be compatible.</p>
<p>I'm new to Rust, any feedback is appreciated. :slightly_smiling_face: I implemented this in order to have a productive rainy saturday afternoon, I'm not knowledgeable about RDJson beyond the sources linked in the issue.</p>
