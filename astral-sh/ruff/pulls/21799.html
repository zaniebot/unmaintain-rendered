            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Basically, when one writes <code>rando&lt;CURSOR&gt;</code>, ty should
suggest <code>import random</code> as a completion. And similarly,
<code>random.randint(0, 1)</code> should provide a fix to import
<code>random</code> when it isn't already in scope. Previously,
we didn't include modules in our <code>all_symbols</code>
implementation. This PR adds support for that.</p>
<p>Note that this includes matching submodules in completions
returned. This doesn't match what we do elsewhere, but it was
very easy to do. I think it'd be nice to get experience with it
and see about doing it in <code>import</code> and <code>from</code> as well. It is very
easy to back this out and only include top-level modules though.</p>

<p>Also: this statement isn't true in several senses, most notably <code>from collections import abc</code>. I assume you mean something more nuanced.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was thinking about <code>from</code> not being able to do <code>import collections.abc</code> in order to make <code>collections.abc</code> available. We <em>could</em> reuse a <code>from collections import abc</code> import and rewrite the text under the cursor. But this PR doesn't go that far.</p>
<p>Anywho, I expanded on this comment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">                // If the request is for a module itself, then we
                // assume that it can never be satisfies by a
                // `from ... import ...` statement. For example, a
                // `request for collections.abc` needs an
                // `import collections.abc`. Now, there could be a
                // `from collections import abc`, and we could
                // plausibly consider that a match and return a
                // symbol text of `abc`. But it's not clear if that's
                // the right choice or not.
                let member = request.member?;
</code></pre>
<p>And added a test covering your example (where we today add a <code>import collections.abc</code>).</p>
