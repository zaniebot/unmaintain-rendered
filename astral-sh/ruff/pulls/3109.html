            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I am almost done, I just need to know what to make this rule run on. It looks like <a href="https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/blob/main/src/tryceratops/analyzers/call.py#L140">the original rule</a> was hooked into the Module AST item, but I dont see that option in ruff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@colin99d - So I haven't looked at the rule deeply, but <code>Module</code> is just the top level of the AST: the module body, a list of statements. I guess this rule wants to do a full AST traversal, but we typically have <code>ast.rs</code> do the traversal and call out to the rules at the appropriate time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok I got it figured out! Just need to make one small change with the line number I report, and this will be good to go.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm really very very genuinely sorry to do this again, but... I don't think we should merge this rule. It's marked as experimental in <code>tryceratops</code>, and while I try to avoid injecting too much of my own opinion into which rules are accepted, I feel like this rule is sort of misguided in that handling expected failure modes explicitly can be clearer and <em>more</em> readable than hiding them under exception handling.</p>
<p>I know I asked for help closing out the <code>tryceratops</code> ticket, so I feel extra bad closing this PR. I didn't do a good job of validating that we <em>actually</em> wanted each of the remaining rules -- I tend not to look at them closely until I see a PR, but I will try to do better going forward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh, I was actually going to start the description of this rule with &quot;I am morally against this rule, but here it is anyway&quot;. I definitly agree that this rule makes code worse.</p>
