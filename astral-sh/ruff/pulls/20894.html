            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Currently I get a GitHub notification every time I sync my Ruff fork with <code>astral-sh/ruff</code>. The notification informs me that <a href="https://github.com/AlexWaygood/ruff/actions/runs/18496851594">the <code>ci</code> workflow failed</a>, because it tried to run various jobs on Depot or codspeed runners that my fork doesn't have access to. This is kinda annoying, and -- while I don't really <em>need</em> to sync my fork on regular basis, since I have the ability to create branches directly on the upstream repo -- I'm guessing this also occurs for all our third-party contributors who have forks of Ruff.</p>
<p>The solution to this is not to run CI jobs on forks if they require a Depot or Codspeed runner. Unfortunately there doesn't appear to be a way to say &quot;run this workflow on all pushes to <code>main</code>, but skip the whole workflow if it's a fork&quot; -- you have to include the <code>if github.repository == 'astral-sh/ruff'</code> check in each separate CI job inside the workflow.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to say that contributors who have forks should simply disable GitHub Actions altogether on their forks. But running CI from a fork can be pretty useful, especially if you're a third-party contributor, as a way to test changes without opening a PR upstream (which can result in notifications for the upstream maintainers, even if the PR is opened in draft mode).</p>

<p>hmm, where exactly would I put this condition at the top of the file? I'd love to do that if it's possible, but I didn't think it was</p>

<p>I don't think this would fix the issue I'm trying to fix, because the specific issue I'm trying to fix is that these jobs are being run on pushes to the <code>main</code> branch of the <code>AlexWaygood/ruff</code> repo. I.e., that would be a <code>push</code> event rather than a <code>pull_request</code> event.</p>
<p>But I'd also like these jobs that can't be run on forks disabled if I make a pull request against my own fork (which I don't do that often, but have done in the past, for testing purposes!) 😄</p>
<p>The expression I'm using here is basically identical to the example GitHub has in its docs for <code>if</code> conditions, FWIW: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#example-only-run-job-for-specific-repository. And it's also what we already use elsewhere in this workflow file: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4b7f184ab7848fee4f6641600b4f52a06e772e7a/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L1015</p>

<p>I guess the ideal would be to use a different runner based on whether this is a fork or not. But I don't know how easily this is possible (and it won't work with codspeed).</p>

<p>With Claude's help, I think I figured this out! (Except for Codspeed, of course)</p>
