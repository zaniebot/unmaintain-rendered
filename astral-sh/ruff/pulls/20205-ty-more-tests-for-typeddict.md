# [ty] More tests for TypedDict

---

_@sharkdp_

## Summary

A small set of additional tests for `TypedDict` that I wrote while going through the spec. Note that this certainly doesn't make the test suite exhaustive (see remaining open points in the updated list here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/154).
