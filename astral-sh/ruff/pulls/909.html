            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh, hi. I tried to bring the logic as close to the original as possible, but in debugger_call it was not completely successful. I will be glad to receive feedback.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@karpa4o4 - I did some small refactors to use <code>match_call_path</code> and friends, which are some utilities we have to do this kind of &quot;Is a function call an invocation of a specific member, in a specific module?&quot; logic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh, thanks. Sorry, I forgot to write &quot;Closed&quot; in the pull request description. So issue <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/546">#546</a> stays open.
Can I help with the implementation of some other rule?</p>

<p>Definitely! There's a bunch of unclaimed stuff in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/827, if you're interested in those? Alternatively, there's https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/458 but it's a bit more involved as I'd like it to be integrated with some of the existing docstring checks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, or https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/870 -- we only need the first rule (U100). It'd probably look like the implementation we have for <code>unused_variables</code>, but we have to check for <code>BindingKind::Argument</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh, hi. Unfortunately I could not do the issues that you described above. But now I want to participate in the development of ruff again, can you tell me how I can help?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries! If you're interested, you could consider working on the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/2056"><code>tryceratops</code></a> plugin.</p>
