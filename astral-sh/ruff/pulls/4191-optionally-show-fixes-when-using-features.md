# Optionally show fixes when using `--features ecosystem_ci` with cargo and `--show-fixes` at runtime

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2023-05-02 14:22_

Example command: `cargo run --bin ruff --features ecosystem_ci -- --ecosystem-ci --no-cache --select F401 --show-fixes crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/pyflakes/F401_9.py`

Before, `--show-fixes` was ignored:

```
crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/pyflakes/F401_9.py:4:22: F401 [*] `foo.baz` imported but unused
Found 1 error.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

After:

```
crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/pyflakes/F401_9.py:4:22: F401 [*] `foo.baz` imported but unused
ℹ Suggested fix
1 1 | """Test: late-binding of `__all__`."""
2 2 | 
3 3 | __all__ = ("bar",)
4   |-from foo import bar, baz
  4 |+from foo import bar

Found 1 error.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

Nit: Update the documentation.

_@MichaReiser reviewed on 2023-05-02 14:31_

I like the addition of showing fixes as part of diagnostics, but I'm not sure if our current implementation is "production-ready," as stated in the source code:

https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/b14358fbfe3d59dead9cc3efcded6c0468f2bda3/crates/ruff/src/message/diff.rs#L10-L17

What's your reasoning behind adding a new CLI option vs enabling it when `--show-source` is enabled? My concern is that we start to have too many options and it would be better to just be opinionated about it.

i didn't see the comment you now linked :no_mouth:. Any preferences where to put it instead? i'd add a (possibly doc(hidden)) `--format ecosystem-checks` otherwise special-cased similar to the json

Not sure. Could we hide it behind a Rust feature for now? Do we enable all features when building the `debug` artifact on CI? 

---

_Comment by @konstin on 2023-05-02 19:35_

I added `--format ecosystem-ci`, that's the best compromise i could find that also supports `pip install ruff` as baseline

---

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff/src/settings/types.rs`:236 on 2023-05-03 09:40_

Is it possible to restrict this variant to a rust feature?

---

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff_cli/src/printer.rs`:184 on 2023-05-03 09:40_

What happens if you run `--fix --show-fixes` with the default text emitter? But I guess that would already have been a problem before. 

---

_@MichaReiser approved on 2023-05-03 09:44_

This is okay with me. I don't particularly like it but I don't know of a better compromise. 

I would prefer it if we could restrict the variant to a rust feature to not ship it in production, assuming we build with `--all-features` when creating the debug build.

We could even go as far as to limit the `Diff` implementation to that feature too (or test) to make it clear that the implementation may not be production ready yet.

`--fix --show-fixes` currently has no effect over `--fix`, at least i didn't see any different output

Since this broke `cargo test --features all`, i switched to a top level flag that gets patched through by optional fields instead

Will this work with the CI job that uses the binary built by  `cargo test`  (or build?) Or is fixes comparison not enabled for CI?

LGTM

It may be good to update the PR summary and mention that this only applies for builds where the ecosystem feature is enabled.
