            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR improves the <code>is_safe_mutable_class</code> function in <code>infer.rs</code> in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses <code>KnownClass::to_instance()</code> for all &quot;safe mutable classes&quot;. Previously, we were using <code>SpecialFormType::instance_fallback()</code> for some variants -- I'm not totally sure why. Switching to <code>KnownClass::to_instance()</code> for all &quot;safe mutable classes&quot; fixes a number of TODOs in the <code>assignment.md</code> mdtest suite</li>
<li>Rather than eagerly calling <code>.to_instance(db)</code> on all &quot;safe mutable classes&quot; every time <code>is_safe_mutable_class</code> is called, we now only call it lazily on each element, allowing us to short-circuit more effectively.</li>
<li>I removed the entry entirely for <code>TypedDict</code> from the list of &quot;safe mutable classes&quot;, as it's not correct. <code>SpecialFormType::TypedDict.instance_fallback(db)</code> just returns an instance type representing &quot;any instance of <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>&quot;, which I don't think was the intent of this code. No tests fail as a result of removing this entry, as we already check separately whether an object is an inhabitant of a <code>TypedDict</code> type (and consider that object safe-mutable if so!).</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw that entry as well, was confused, and made a mental note to check it again. Thanks for fixing it.</p>
