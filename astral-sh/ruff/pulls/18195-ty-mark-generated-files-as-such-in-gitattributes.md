It's sometimes nice to see how these files render but I guess it's not preventing me from doing just that

I was wondering if they are completely hidden or if there is still a way to get to the diff. I guess we can revert this if we'd rather see them anyway.

you can still see the diff, you just need to click a "show diff for this generated file" button in the "Files changed" tab

And on the command line you can add `-a` to any `git diff` command
