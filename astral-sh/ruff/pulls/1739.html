<p>The previous terminology &quot;checks&quot; and &quot;plugins&quot; was so confusing that at least I didn&#x27;t understand that convention and mistakenly placed <code>banned_attribute_access</code> in <code>flake8_tidy_imports/checks.rs</code>.

I believe grouping functions by topic to be more useful and intuitive.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m unlikely to do this right now. It&#x27;s useful to have all the functionality for one plugin defined in a single module. If we split the code in that way, then we probably need to make the same change for <code>settings.rs</code>, etc. The current system would even allows us to put each plugin in its own crate.</p>
<p>Separately, I&#x27;m unlikely to enforce the requirement that every rule go in its own file. It&#x27;s just convenient in practice to put multiple small checks in the same file sometimes. And there are a few instances where it&#x27;s necessary for multiple checks to share an implementation (i.e., if there&#x27;s shared work, like in detecting duplicate dictionary keys). Maybe we do this eventually, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth prioritizing right now.</p>

<p>Right, but we&#x27;re changing the terminology!</p>

<p>I get this, but it&#x27;s not just that they have different signatures. It&#x27;s a fundamentally different API. I think it&#x27;s useful to know which API a rule is adhering to when you call it. I&#x27;m willing to be convinced that this is incorrect, and that we should just drop the distinction.</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve reflected on this a bit more, and I&#x27;m leaning towards dropping the <code>rules</code> vs. <code>rules_mut</code> distinction. The <code>_mut</code> naming convention typically kicks in when you have mutable and non-mutable variants of the same function, which isn&#x27;t the case here. I think part of my inertia comes from the fact that we already have this distinction, and it&#x27;s easier to undo it than to reintroduce it. But it&#x27;s probably not worth the confusion that you&#x27;re referencing.</p>
