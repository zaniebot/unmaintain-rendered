<p>But this certainly doesn't seem to do any harm!</p>

<p>It's because we're running the same version of primer on this commit and the commit prior to this commit and then diffing the two sets of diagnostics. Since the same version of primer is being run on both commits, the same psycopg config is being used for both primer runs.</p>
