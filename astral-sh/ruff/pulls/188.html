            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR changes <code>--exclude</code> to use regular expressions rather than globs, which matches Black's behavior. We also now match Black's default list of exclusions, and support a <code>--extend-exclude</code> command-line argument and <code>pyproject.toml</code> field.</p>
<p>Resolves #176.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could you do something like Black does where multi-line regexes are treated as if they had a VERBOSE flag set? You can see an example of usage here:
https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-format</p>
<p>It could maybe make some sense to have a single regex instead of a list of them for performance but it's not like a user can't just use a single regex when you give them ability to put regexes in a list. Having it be a string may make it more obvious it's a regex though, not sure.</p>
<p>I also wonder whether it would make sense to have something in similar vein to <code>--force-exclude</code> which is present in both flake8 and black as it can be useful with editor integration and other tools. Might make more sense to make a separate feature request for it though, it's just something I thought about just now :smile:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did consider that but I kind of hate that setup (lol), I always found it really confusing and hard to get right as a user. But my preferences aren't that important here. Do you think that would be more approachable / conventional for users?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah sorry -- not a clear response. It's in reference to the multi-line regex; as in, I tend to prefer a list of patterns to a multi-line regex.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think a list of globs is more approachable than a regex but way more limiting. As for a list of regexes vs multi-line regex, I'm not really sure. I've seen Black and pre-commit accept a single regex where the former auto-switches to verbose when it sees a multi-line string and the latter requires you to do it using standard inline flags (prefixing the regex with <code>(?x)</code>, not sure if Rust's regex engine supports it?).
It varies between tools - flake8 and isort offer a list of globs, pylint offers a list of regexes like you do in this PR.</p>
<p>I like the verbose flag for regexes so I might not really be objective here. I find it somewhat less clunky than specifying a list of regexes (when I use a list I sort of expect to just be able to specify globs and not have to escape dots) but as I said earlier this kind of implementation is not unheard of (pylint does it).</p>
<p>By the way, I think it would be worth documenting how files are matched against the specified patterns so that the user knows whether they need to put <code>^</code> (e.g. <code>re.match()</code> vs <code>re.search()</code>) and against what kind of path format it's matched against (e.g. is it path relative to project directory or something else).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, that's really helpful (and very impressed by your breadth of knowledge). I'm wondering if I should just revert back to a list of globs, which seems simplest...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, my plan here is to just mimic isort and flake8 -- so you can provide a list of globs, and we'll check both the basename and absolute path. The logic looks like this:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I missed your comment about this, I'll try testing it out tomorrow. Mostly curious about how the matching against absolute path vs basename works in particular I want to check whether matching it against two different strings makes it difficult to do some things.</p>
<p>I have a question about an idea from my earlier comment:</p>

<p>Should I make a new issue for it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah new issue would be great. Right now, I think the excludes &quot;overpower&quot; the files provided on the command-line so we basically have --force-exclude behavior for all excludes. (So, I'll need to change files passed directly to &quot;override&quot; excludes, and then add --force-exclude.)</p>
