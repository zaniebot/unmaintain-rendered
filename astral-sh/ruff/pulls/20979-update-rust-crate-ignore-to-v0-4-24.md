@BurntSushi any suggestions on what we should change on the ruff/ty side as part of this update? I see from the commits that there's a new global `cwd` option. Is this something we have to or should set now?

Yeah, the [`WalkBuilder::current_dir`](https://docs.rs/ignore/latest/ignore/struct.WalkBuilder.html#method.current_dir) method lets you set the directory used for matching gitignore patterns from global gitignore exclusions or files added via [`WalkBuilder::add_ignore`](https://docs.rs/ignore/latest/ignore/struct.WalkBuilder.html#method.add_ignore). If you _don't_ set it, then it will automatically be pulled from [`std::env::current_dir`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/fn.current_dir.html) for every use of `WalkBuilder::build{_parallel}`.

The main reasons to use `WalkBuilder::current_dir` explicitly are:

1. You have a [slightly different way of discovering the current working directory](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/36b7597693c994ffaf023b95d2e18aeeda7d9286/crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs#L1292-L1312).
2. You use many `WalkBuilder::build{_parallel}` calls but only want to query `std::env::current_dir` once.
3. You don't want your libraries inspecting process global state for $reasons.

If those don't apply to ruff, then I think you can just leave it.

Thanks, that's helpful

2. applies for both ty and ruff (although I consider this more a nice to have rather than being very performance critical)
1 and 3: Apply for ty where we want to sue `OsSystem::current_directory` over `std::env::current_dir` (they should be the same but for consistency's sake)
