            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>When working on improving Ruff integration with Zed I noticed that it errors out when we try to resolve a code action of a <code>QUICKFIX</code> kind; apparently, per @dhruvmanila we shouldn&#x27;t need to resolve it, as the edit is provided in the initial response for the code action. However, it&#x27;s possible for the <code>resolve</code> call to fill out other fields (such as <code>command</code>).
AFAICT Helix also tries to resolve the code actions unconditionally (as in, when either <code>edit</code> or <code>command</code> is absent); so does VSC. They can still apply the quickfixes though, as they do not error out on a failed call to resolve code actions - Zed does. Following suit on Zed&#x27;s side does not cut it though, as we still get a log request from Ruff for that failure (which is surfaced in the UI).
There are also other language servers (such as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/c1c9e10f72ffd2e829d20ff1439ff49c2e121731/crates/rust-analyzer/src/handlers/request.rs#L1257">rust-analyzer</a>) that fill out both <code>command</code> and <code>edit</code> fields as a part of code action resolution.</p>
<p>This PR makes the resolve calls for quickfix actions return the input value.</p>
