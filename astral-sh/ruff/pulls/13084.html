            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR has the <code>SemanticIndexBuilder</code> visit function definition annotations before adding the function symbol/name to the builder.</p>
<p>For example, the following snippet no longer causes a panic:</p>
<pre><code>def bool(x) -&gt; bool:
    Return True
</code></pre>
<p>Note: This fix changes the ordering of the global symbol table.</p>
<p>Closes #13069</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe this means that we&#x27;d understand the return annotation as referring to <code>builtins.bool</code> rather than referring to the first-party function <code>bool</code>. That mimics the evaluation order at runtime:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def bool() -&gt; bool:
...   ...
...   
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool.__annotations__
{&#x27;return&#x27;: &lt;class &#x27;bool&#x27;&gt;}
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool.__annotations__[&#x27;return&#x27;] is bool
False
</code></pre>
<p>And it also seems to be what pyright does: https://pyright-play.net/?code=CYUwZgBARg9jA2AKAlBAtAPmneAuAUBEQHSn74BOIAbiAIbwD6ALgJ4AOIisCylN9Jm07ccKPvgAeEALwQAKhQCuIKbOwIU-WgxYcuk5EA</p>
<p>But interestingly, mypy just understands the return annotation as being a forward reference to the function that the return annotation is part of: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=6dd88ac3463dc662ab1a50ed0456685c</p>

<p>That feels right to me - it was the same experiment as yours that motivated the reordering.</p>
<p>P.S. Not sure what the deal is with CodSpeed? I don&#x27;t think I touched anything linter-related... I hope!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While we&#x27;re fixing the order of things here, I think this also belongs above the definition of the function name:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def bool(x = bool):

&gt;&gt;&gt; bool()
&lt;class &#x27;bool&#x27;&gt;

<p>Would you be open to also adding a test for this and fixing the ordering?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In an ideal world, I&#x27;d prefer to have inference tests that validate we get the semantics right, rather than just corpus tests that validate we don&#x27;t panic.</p>
<p>But at the moment it&#x27;d be a pain to write those inference tests; we don&#x27;t have <code>Call</code> support yet, so you can&#x27;t easily get access to the return type of a function by e.g. doing <code>y = x()</code> and then checking the type of the <code>y</code> symbol, you&#x27;d have to instead scrabble through the AST to find the return annotation expression node, and then assert on its type. So this is more just a note for future, not something that needs to be changed in this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Done! Added another &quot;no panic&quot; test and then a mostly copy-pasted unit test that doesn&#x27;t really check for much but is a baby step towards the sort of thing you mentioned in your other comment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does this test fail before this PR? Just looking at the test, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that this test would be impacted by the bug we are fixing in this PR.</p>
<p>The test I was thinking of would go in <code>types/infer.rs</code>, not here, and would assert on the inferred type for the return (or default) expression. The test <code>local_inference</code> in that file is an example of an existing test that finds an AST node and then asserts on its type. But like I said, I wasn&#x27;t necessarily expecting we&#x27;d add such a test in this PR.</p>
<p>Unless I&#x27;m missing something and this test does actually check for this bug, I would say let&#x27;s remove this test. If you want to try your hand at adding the above style of test, that&#x27;s great but not required!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! As I mentioned in my other comment, I think the new copy-pasted test doesn&#x27;t add enough value to be worth adding right now, so we can remove it. The inference test we eventually want would be at the type-inference level, not the semantic level. Everything else looks great!</p>
