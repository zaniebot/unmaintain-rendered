@diego-pm That part of the readme is auto-generated from code, so you might want to fix those in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/2045b739a9b0e8e6c8a4e490886216e5889b0e2a/src/flake8_import_conventions/settings.rs#L31-L37

and run `cargo +nightly dev generate-all` to regenerate the readme.
