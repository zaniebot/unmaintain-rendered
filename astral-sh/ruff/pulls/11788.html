            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks good. I encourage you to land PRs without review if you consider them trivial or feel very certain about them. It&#x27;s not that I mind reviewing them, but it can help you to move quicker (a bit less rebasing etc)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m okay with this if it unblocks your work on type narrowing, but in the long term, I&#x27;m not sure we should represent <code>None</code> as a distinct kind of type. Mypy and pyright have both had a lot of bugs because of the extent to which they special-case <code>None</code> (pyright particularly), and I&#x27;d like us to think hard about whether we need to do so to the same extent that they&#x27;ve done.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s actually special about <code>None</code>? Three things, I think:</p>
<ol>
<li>When we see <code>None</code> in a type annotation, we should immediately desugar that to <code>Instance(types.NoneType)</code> (or <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/4da35728277ee15c16f578ecf62acfc71b8caadf/stdlib/_typeshed/__init__.pyi#L308-L311">the typeshed backport</a> for Python less than 3.10)</li>
<li>When printing the type to users in diagnostics, we should immediately resugar it from <code>Instance(types.NoneType)</code> to <code>None</code></li>
<li>We need to understand internally that <code>NoneType</code> has exactly one instance, <code>None</code>, so that you can use identity checks such as <code>x is not None</code> for type narrowing</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, I say &quot;three things&quot;, but actually, the third point isn&#x27;t unique at all! Other singletons exist in Python, such as <code>...</code>, <code>NotImplemented</code>, <code>typing.NoDefault</code> on py313+, etc. Mypy and pyright both support narrowing unions including <code>types.EllipsisType</code> with <code>x is not ...</code>, and I think we should too. And maybe it would be reasonable for a user to narrow a <code>bool | str</code> union via a <code>x is not True and x is not False</code> check.</p>
<p>So does <code>None</code> really need to be its own variant in the enum here? Or should we have a more generalised way of representing builtin types that only have 1 or 2 possible instances, and that can therefore be narrowed via identity checks?</p>
<p>As I say, I&#x27;m fine with this for now, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a good question, and I debated the same thing while working on this PR.</p>
<p>I went with this for now basically because otherwise I would have had to wait for typeshed to be ready, and I needed some representation of <code>None</code> for type narrowing to work. But I think it will probably be better to switch to <code>Instance(types.NoneType)</code> once we have typeshed in place. I&#x27;ll add a TODO for that.</p>
