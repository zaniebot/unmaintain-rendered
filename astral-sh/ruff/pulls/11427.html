            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR adds a workflow that will create an automated PR every two weeks to update our vendored typeshed stubs. Two notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In order for a GitHub Action to be able to create automated PRs, we will need to tick this checkbox in our repo settings:</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/assets/66076021/7ca99c44-5cde-47af-8b9d-c00fc356d7ff" alt="image" /></p>
<hr />
</li>
<li><p>CI will not be triggered on these automated PRs unless the PR is closed and reopened by a maintainer. I think there are workarounds for this limitation, but we haven't succeeded in figuring out how to do them properly at typeshed or mypy, where we also have workflows to trigger automated PRs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>A GitHub workflow cannot be tested unless it is run, and a workflow cannot be run unless it is already merged to the <code>main</code> branch of a repository. So, that's what I did -- with my Ruff fork! I temporarily merged this PR to the <code>main</code> branch of my Ruff fork, and ran the workflow. You can see a demo PR here that was automatically created by running this workflow from my fork: https://github.com/AlexWaygood/ruff/pull/9</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, good point. Eventually these updates will have user-facing impacts, so at that point we will want these updates listed in our changelog. But right now, <code>red_knot</code> is a separate crate to the rest of Ruff, so these changes are indeed strictly internal right now. So I'll change it for now so that it adds the <code>internal</code> label.</p>
