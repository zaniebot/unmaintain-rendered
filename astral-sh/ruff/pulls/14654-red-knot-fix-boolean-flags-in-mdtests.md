# [red-knot] Fix Boolean flags in mdtests

---

_Pull request opened by @sharkdp on 2024-11-28 13:22_

## Summary

Similar to #14652, but now with conditions that are `Literal[True]` (instead of `Literal[False]`), where we want them to be `bool`. Red knot is becoming too powerful for this :smile:.
