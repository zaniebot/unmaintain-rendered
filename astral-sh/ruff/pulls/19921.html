<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>(Implements https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8360)</p>
<p>This PR introduces a new formatter option, <code>function-arg-extra-indent</code>, which enables extra indentation (8 spaces instead of 4) for function arguments that span multiple lines.</p>
<p>This option can be configured via the CLI or configuration files, and is intended to improve readability in accordance with PEP-8 recommendations.  This option defaults to &quot;disabled&quot;, <strong>which means guarantees backward compatibility</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation includes updates to the formatter internals, configuration schema, CLI, documentation, and adds relevant tests and fixtures to verify the new behavior.</p>
<h3><em>Additional context:</em></h3>
<p>This feature is probably one of the most controversial topics in <code>Black</code>'s issue board.  Many people are frustrated that <code>Black</code> doesn't add such a feature.  Discussions on both sides are filled with emotions, most notably this one:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1178</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some additional feature requests:</p>

<li>https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1127</li>
<li>https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2117</li>
</ul>
<p>A similar feature request was posted on Ruff's issue board: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8360.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<ul>
<li>Added and updated unit and integration tests to cover both enabled and disabled states of the <code>function-arg-extra-indent</code> option.</li>
<li>Verified output via new and existing test fixtures.</li>
<li>Confirmed correct CLI and config file parsing, and checked documentation updates for accuracy.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for working on this. It's great to see that you're excited about this feature. Unfortunately, I don't see a direct path for us to merge this PR because it doesn't make progress towards answering the fundamental questions raised in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8360#issuecomment-1891659341 and I currently don't have the capacity to make progress on those decisions myself. That's why I'll close this PR because it isn't actionable at the moment.</p>
<p>I still believe the PR is valuable in the future because it demonstrates that this feature can be implemented with minimal complexity.</p>
<p>Thanks again and I'm sorry for not a more positive outcome.</p>
