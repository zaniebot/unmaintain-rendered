Summary


<p>(Implements <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8360">astral-sh/ruff#8360</a>)</p>
<p>This PR introduces a new formatter option, <code>function-arg-extra-indent</code>, which enables extra indentation (8 spaces instead of 4) for function arguments that span multiple lines.</p>
<p>This option can be configured via the CLI or configuration files, and is intended to improve readability in accordance with PEP-8 recommendations.  This option defaults to &quot;disabled&quot;, <strong>which means guarantees backward compatibility</strong>.</p>
<p>The implementation includes updates to the formatter internals, configuration schema, CLI, documentation, and adds relevant tests and fixtures to verify the new behavior.</p>
<em>Additional context:</em>
<p>This feature is probably one of the most controversial topics in <code>Black</code>&#x27;s issue board.  Many people are frustrated that <code>Black</code> doesn&#x27;t add such a feature.  Discussions on both sides are filled with emotions, most notably this one:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for working on this. It&#x27;s great to see that you&#x27;re excited about this feature. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see a direct path for us to merge this PR because it doesn&#x27;t make progress towards answering the fundamental questions raised in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8360">astral-sh/ruff#8360</a>#issuecomment-1891659341 and I currently don&#x27;t have the capacity to make progress on those decisions myself. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll close this PR because it isn&#x27;t actionable at the moment.</p>
<p>I still believe the PR is valuable in the future because it demonstrates that this feature can be implemented with minimal complexity.</p>
<p>Thanks again and I&#x27;m sorry for not a more positive outcome.</p>
