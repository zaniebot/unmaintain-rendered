            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A small refactor. The exact number of dots at the beginning of a relative import isnt relevant to the <code>isort</code> classification (and never will be). All that matters is whether there are any dots at the beginning or not. Using a boolean here improves readability and makes it clearer what the argument is for when the function is called from other rules elsewhere in Ruff.</p>
<p>In the process, this fixes what I believe is a small bug in the <code>flake8-type-checking</code> code, where we're always passing <code>level=0</code> into the <code>categorize()</code> function. I think this means we may be miscategorising some imports there which would otherwise be categorised as first-party imports due to them being relative imports.</p>

<p>It felt unlikely that it would actually come up in practice, and the ecosystem report strengthened my supposition there, so I wondered if it was really worth putting it in the changelog... but definitely don't feel strongly</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like it.</p>
<p>I would be inclined to even use an <code>enum</code> with a <code>Relative</code> variant to improve readability on the call site but what you have here is good with me too.</p>
