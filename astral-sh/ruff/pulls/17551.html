            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Passing a non-protocol class to <code>get_protocol_members</code> fails at runtime. This PR adds logic to red-knot so that we detect that error and warn the user about it.</p>
<p>Stacked on top of #17550</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing mdtests updated and extended. Snapshots added!</p>
<p>Screenshot of what the diagnostics look like in the terminal:

<p>It&#x27;s because you&#x27;re using stacked PRs, once the PR that&#x27;s below this one has the ecosystem check completed, you can re-run here so that it can find the base ecosystem report which would be part of that PR.</p>

<p>Hrm, I&#x27;ve tried rerunning the job several times now (and the PR below this one has definitely completed its CI!).</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s possibly because the PR below this one (#17550) had the Linux build skipped entirely in its CI run? I&#x27;m not sure why -- PRs that only change <code>.md</code> files don&#x27;t seem to have any tests run on them right now, which is sorta problematic for red-knot PRs 😆</p>

<p>Ah, yeah that&#x27;s probably the case. The Ruff ecosystem checks needs a base report to compare against. This is usually from <code>main</code> but as this is a stacked PR, it&#x27;ll fetch it from the previous PR (which is correct) but that doesn&#x27;t exists and so this workflow fails.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it&#x27;s kinda weird to link to the typing spec here, as it&#x27;s not designed as user-facing documentation. But the typing-module docs don&#x27;t go into the details here; PEP 544 is a snapshot of a decision that was taken years ago rather than up-to-date documentation; and it feels like an admission of defeat to link to the mypy docs 😆 I think the typing spec is maybe the least bad option</p>

<p>That suggests that the ideal solution is to eventually describe this in our own (public-facing) documentation. So I think linking to the typing spec is fine as a placeholder, maybe with a TODO comment in the code to update it to the public docs once they&#x27;re written.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes. Or for us to invest resources into improving type-checker-agnostic docs for <code>Protocol</code>! A TODO here sounds like a good idea whatever the case, though (I&#x27;ll add tomorrow; it&#x27;s late here)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a lovely diagnostic, and a great example for what we can be doing with the new diagnostic framework in other cases -- but it&#x27;s also a lot of code for an extremely narrow case (misuse of one specific function)!

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I know what you mean.</p>
<p>I think there might be ways to make the diagnostic APIs a little less verbose? The code here isn&#x27;t that complicated, just a little boilerplate-y. And I think the way you get a reputation for having &quot;excellent error messages&quot; like rustc is by paying attention to lots of little details like this.</p>
