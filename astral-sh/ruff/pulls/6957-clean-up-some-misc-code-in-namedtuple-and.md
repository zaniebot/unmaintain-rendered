# Clean up some misc. code in NamedTuple and TypedDict conversion

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-08-28 21:04_

- Use `Option` instead of `Result` everywhere.
- Use `field` instead of `property` (to match the nomenclature of `NamedTuple` and `TypedDict`).
- Put the violation function at the top of the file, rather than the bottom.
