Thanks for your contribution. 

We're hesitant to officially recommend Snap as an installation method because multiple projects discourage its use or even remove the mention from their documentation.

* [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#snap-do-not-use)
* [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/6ffb4b7466c914a2683847b5fb4e30ea16749e94)
