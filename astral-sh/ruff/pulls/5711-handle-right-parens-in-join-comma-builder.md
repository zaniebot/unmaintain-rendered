## Summary

The `JoinCommaSeparatedBuilder` only tested if the first token after the node is a `,`. 
However, this always fails for expressions with parentheses, because the parentheses are not part of the expression's range. 

This PR changes the `JoinCommaSeparatedBuilder` to skip right parens. However, we need to be careful, because `nested(call(arg),)` only the outer call has a trailing comma
in this example, not the inner arg. The way this is implemented is by also passing an approxiamted end of the sequence (normally the end of the enclosing node, but we don't always know precisely), and only search between the end of the last node and the end of the sequence. 

I further went along and also fixed an issue where single argument call expressions were always parenthesized because `is_expression_parenthesized` doesn't know that the parens from the arguments belong to the call. The way to solve this is by handling parentheses
manually inside of `FormatCallExpr` if the call only has a single argument.

I tested this locally, black preserves the parentheses, regardless of what the text says
