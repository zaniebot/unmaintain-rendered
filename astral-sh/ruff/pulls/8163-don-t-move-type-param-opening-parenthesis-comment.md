# Don't move type param opening parenthesis comment

---

_@dhruvmanila_

## Summary

This PR fixes the issue to avoid collapsing the type param declaration if
there's a comment after the opening parenthesis. For example,

```python
type foo[  # comment
    A,
    B
] = int
```

Here, we'll preserve the comment on the same line as is being done for other
similar type of nodes.

## Test Plan

Add a new test case for it, update the snapshots, and validate the ecosystem
check.
