            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a vague memory of intentionally making the opposite decision here.</p>
<p>I think the key question we need to ensure we are answering consistently is, do instances of subclasses of the built-in <code>tuple</code> type also inhabit our <code>Type::Tuple</code> types? My memory is that in other places we assume they can, but I would have to double-check. If they do, then we cannot say that the empty <code>Type::Tuple</code> is always-falsy, since the empty instance of a subclass of <code>tuple</code> could be truthy.</p>
<p>The potential problem with saying they do not, is that we do need to allow code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f(t: tuple[int, str]): ...

class MyTuple(tuple[int, str]): pass

f(MyTuple((1, &quot;foo&quot;)))
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, if we say they do not, then our <code>Type::Tuple</code> can no longer correspond to the semantics of a <code>tuple</code> annotation.</p>

<p>Ah yes, https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/215 is still unresolved... I have a long reply in my head I've been meaning to write up there for a while :-) maybe I should set an explicit goal for myself to do that on Monday...</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the change to the code here is correct even if we disagree on the assertion being made in the mdtest!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think the code change is correct, but we should add a TODO comment above the assertions (and maybe also above similar assertions for subtyping, if we have those already?) that we either need to special-case enforcement of Liskov on <code>__bool__</code> and <code>__len__</code> for tuple subclasses, or stop assuming that empty tuples are falsy and non-empty tuples are truthy.</p>
