            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>The <code>apprise</code> project has outdated (and completely wrong) stub files that frequently lead to very confusing errors (usually true positives). Evaluating ecosystem impact on this project is therefore irritating and usually not very helpful. I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of time looking through ecosystem diffs on this project (until I remember — oh, it&#x27;s &quot;apprise&quot;), and I don&#x27;t think that it was ever helpful. I therefore suggest to skip evaluating on <code>apprise</code>. If there are no objections, we can also think about removing that project upstream (in <code>mypy_primer</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If memory serves correctly, this project was originally added to primer because mypy introduced a regression in one release that meant that it started crashing on any code that imported <code>apprise</code>. So the strangeness of the code has some advantages as well as disadvantages: it helps test edge cases that we might not have thought of, because they just don&#x27;t occur in &quot;well-written&quot; code.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to continue running it as part of mypy_primer (so that we catch any crashes on the project we might introduce in ty) but filter it out of the diff report?</p>

<p>That&#x27;s certainly possible, yes. We would probably have to start a second <code>mypy_primer</code> process in the CI job.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess the other alternative is that we keep it and just keep in mind that it might not be worth digging into its results.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have strong feelings.</p>
