            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Updates Github Actions macOS runner images to use macOS 13, since runners using 12 will be unavailable on/around December 3rd of this year.</p>
<p>Closes #13231</p>
<p>For more info, see that issue, as well as <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10721">actions/runner-images#10721</a>. There will be a 10-hour brownout on each Monday in November.</p>
Test Plan
<p>I did not. 😎 (until after the checks passed)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this PR and making us aware of the runner deprecation.</p>
<p>We intentionally downgraded the macOS runner in the past because using newer macOS versions resulted in binaries that are incompatible with macOS 11 (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11146">astral-sh/ruff#11146</a>, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9834">astral-sh/ruff#9834</a>). However, that means that we&#x27;ll loose macOS 11 support, unless we find another way to cross compile binaries to macOS11.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did some research and my general reading is that macOS only supports building for the same or newer versions but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to build for older macOS versions. That means, this PR drops support for macOS12 unless we find another way of running the release job in a macOs12 image.</p>
<p>I found some references of <code>MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET</code> but it&#x27;s unclear to me if that would have any effect, considering that the macOS13 image doesn&#x27;t have the the macOS12 SDK installed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, good news. I think I narrowed down why Ruff 0.2 was crashing and we should be fine to just upgrade to the macos 14 runners.</p>
<p>I compared the dynamically linked libraries and they&#x27;re mostly unchanged (ignoring versions)</p>
<pre><code>ruff 0.2
    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 2202.0.0)
    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1226.0.0)
    /usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.0.0)
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1336.61.1)

ruff 0.6.9
    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 2503.1.0)
    /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/CoreServices (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1226.0.0)
    /usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.0.0)
    /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1345.120.2)
</code></pre>
<p>I also compared the dynamically linked symbols and they are almost identical: https://www.diffchecker.com/x9Nond5g/</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I went back to analysing the ruff 0.2 crash stack frame and I stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/issues/8369">realm/realm-swift#8369</a> where one user suggests that this is an XCode bug that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15_1-release-notes#Resolved-Issues">was fixed</a> in 15.1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed: Binaries using symbols with a weak definition crash at runtime on iOS 14/macOS 12 or older. This impacts primarily C++ projects due to their extensive use of weak symbols. (114813650) (FB13097713)</p>
