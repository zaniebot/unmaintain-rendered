            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Implement proper handling for calling intersection types. Previously, calling an intersection type would return a <code>@Todo</code> type that suppressed errors but provided no useful type information.</p>
<p>Now, when calling an intersection type:</p>
<ul>
<li>We check each positive element of the intersection for callability</li>
<li>If at least one element is callable, the intersection is callable</li>
<li>The return type is the intersection of the return types from all callable elements</li>
<li>If no elements are callable, a proper error is reported</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a partial fix for #1858. Further improvements could include better handling of signatures and parameter validation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This comment is misleading. <code>Bindings</code> does not represent a &quot;union or intersection&quot; -- it always represents a union (possibly size one) of callables, each element of which is an intersection (possibly size one).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Each input binding should have a length-one <code>.elements</code>, because in our DNF representation of types, intersections cannot contain unions. So we can just assert that invariant (with a comment) instead of flat-mapping.</p>
<p>If we did need to handle input unions here, we would need to distribute them, not just flat-map (the flat-map effectively turns an input union into an intersection, which is wrong.) But that&#x27;s a bit complex, so no reason to do it when it should never happen.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How is this method used? Do callers implicitly assume it&#x27;s a union? Can flattening the union and intersection cause callers to treat the returned bindings incorrectly? Do we need to instead update callers to understand the two-level structure?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the handling of <code>UnionDiagnostic</code> and <code>IntersectionDiagnostic</code> needs to be layered instead. If we have an intersection inside a union, and multiple bindings in that intersection fail with the same priority, we should report those errors with <em>both</em> union and intersection context. (Let&#x27;s add a test demonstrating this. It should be a test with snapshotted diagnostics.)</p>
