# [red-knot] mypy_primer: capture backtraces

---

_@sharkdp_

## Summary

`mypy_primer` is not deterministic (we pin `mypy_primer` itself, but projects change over time and we just pull in the latest version). We've also seen occasional panics being caught in `mypy_primer` runs, so this is trying to make these CI failures more helpful.
