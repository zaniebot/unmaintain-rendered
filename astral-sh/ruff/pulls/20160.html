            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We have the ability to defer type inference of some parts of definitions, so as to allow us to create a type that may need to be recursively referenced in those other parts of the definition.</p>
<p>We also have the ability to do type inference in a context where all name resolution should be deferred (that is, names should be looked up from all-reachable-definitions rather than from the location of use.) This is used for all annotations in stubs, or if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is active.</p>
<p>Previous to this PR, these two concepts were linked: deferred-inference always implied deferred-name-resolution, though we also supported deferred-name-resolution without deferred-inference, via <code>DeferredExpressionState</code>.</p>
<p>For the upcoming <code>typing.TypeAlias</code> support, I will defer inference of the entire RHS of the alias (so as to support cycles), but that doesn't imply deferred name resolution; at runtime, the RHS of a name annotated as <code>typing.TypeAlias</code> is executed eagerly.</p>
<p>So this PR fully de-couples the two concepts, instead explicitly setting the <code>DeferredExpressionState</code> in those cases where we should defer name resolution.</p>
<p>It also fixes a long-standing related bug, where we were deferring name resolution of all names in class bases, if any of the class bases contained a stringified annotation.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added test that failed before this PR.</p>
