# Revert disjointness->disjointedness

---

_@DimitriPapadopoulos_

## Summary

Partially revert #14880. While `disjointness` is missing from the [OED](https://www.oed.com/search/dictionary/?q=disjointness) and [SCOWL (And Friends)](http://app.aspell.net/lookup?dict=en_US-large;words=disjointness), it is commonly used in mathematics to describe disjoint sets.

## Test Plan

CI tests.
