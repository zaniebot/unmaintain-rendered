            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Fixes #14114. I don&#x27;t think I can really describe the problems with our current architecture (and therefore the motivations for this PR) any better than @carljm did in that issue, so I&#x27;ll just copy it out here!</p>
<hr>
<p>We currently represent &quot;known instances&quot; (e.g. special forms like <code>typing.Literal</code>, which are an instance of <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>, but need to be handled differently from other instances of <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>) as an <code>InstanceType</code> with a <code>known</code> field that is <code>Some(...)</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to handle a known instance as if it were a regular instance type (by ignoring the <code>known</code> field), and in some cases (e.g. <code>Type::member</code>) that is correct and convenient. But in other cases (e.g. <code>Type::is_equivalent_to</code>) it is not correct, and we currently have a bug that we would consider the known-instance type of <code>typing.Literal</code> as equivalent to the general instance type for <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>, and we would fail to consider it a singleton type or a single-valued type (even though it is both.)</p>
<p>An instance type with <code>known.is_some()</code> is semantically quite different from an instance type with <code>known.is_none()</code>. The former is a singleton type that represents exactly one runtime object; the latter is an open type that represents many runtime objects, including instances of unknown subclasses. It is too error-prone to represent these very-different types as a single <code>Type</code> variant. We should instead introduce a dedicated <code>Type::KnownInstance</code> variant and force ourselves to handle these explicitly in all <code>Type</code> variant matches.</p>
Possible followups
<p>There is still a little bit of awkwardness in our current design in some places, in that we first infer the symbol <code>typing.Literal</code> as a <code>_SpecialForm</code> instance, and then later convert that instance-type into a known-instance-type. We could also use this <code>KnownInstanceType</code> enum to account for other special runtime symbols such as <code>builtins.Ellipsis</code> or <code>builtins.NotImplemented</code>.</p>
<p>I think these might be worth pursuing, but I didn&#x27;t do them here as they didn&#x27;t seem essential right now, and I wanted to keep the diff relatively minimal.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code>. New unit tests added for <code>Type::is_subtype_of</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I might resolve conflicts and land this, if that&#x27;s OK with you? I&#x27;m realizing that I think I want to represent a TypeVar (not as a type, but the type of the typevar&#x27;s own symbol, e.g. <code>T</code> in <code>def f[T](): ...</code>) as a <code>KnownInstanceType</code> with fallback type <code>typing.TypeVar</code>.</p>
