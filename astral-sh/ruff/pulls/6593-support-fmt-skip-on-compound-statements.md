The pattern is always the same. Test if there's a trailing skip comment and, if so, call `SuppressedClauseHeader`. The enclosing node remains responsible for formatting the body and the trailing comments.

We could wrap this in a `ClauseHeader` struct but it would result in the same level of nesting because it would need to accept a `Format` object to write the content. It may be worth adding considering that @tjkuson needs it in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6592 to collapse `...` bodies.

_Comment by @MichaReiser on 2023-08-15 16:44_

@charliermarsh The PR has two commits:

1. Repeats the code to check whether there's a suppression comment. Plain and simple but with some repetitive code. 
2. Introduces a new `clause_header` formatter that checks the suppression and formatting the `:`, the trailing colon comment, and any potential leading comments. 

I'm undecided whether 2 is over-engineer. Wdyt?

The formatting of the case header has been moved into the `format_with`. The `clause_header` implementation now takes care of writing the `:` and the trailing colon comments.

The `ClauseHeader` abstractin could potentially also be useful in `placement.rs`

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-08-15 17:02_

Haha yeah, this is a close one, but I like what you have in the second commit, it doesn't feel over-engineered to me and is more declarative + feels very consistent with the other design patterns in the formatter.

Nit: `type_` to match field?

_Review comment by @charliermarsh on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/clause.rs`:87 on 2023-08-16 13:45_

Should we destructure these (and enumerate the fields) so that we're forced to update them if we modify the AST nodes?

---

_Review comment by @charliermarsh on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/clause.rs`:142 on 2023-08-16 13:45_

Nit: document that this returns the _first_ keyword in the clause (e.g., `async` in `async for`).

I don't like fields that end with an underscore... But I can rename it to `type_expression`
