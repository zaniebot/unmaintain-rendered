Out of interest, is there a reason only the default rule selection is used for most repos rather than selecting all rules?

> @wookie184 #6943 / #3590

Thanks for the context and for documenting that! I'd not considered that for projects using ruff would be checked on their config rather than just the default selections. That makes more sense, though I agree with your comment in #6943 too.
