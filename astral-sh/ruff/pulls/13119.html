Summary
<p>As noted in #10569, E741 should not be active in <code>.pyi</code> files as the file author does not control the variable name. Instead, this is deferred to the author of the package for which the stub file is substituting for.</p>
<p>My rust skills are being stretched here. I assume there is a more elegant way of implementing the check <code>checker.source_type != PySourceType::Stub</code> in the <code>ambiguous_variable_name</code> function so that it is only implemented in one place (similar to <code>non_unique_enums</code>); however, I can&#x27;t get the borrow checker to agree to this.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Added a new test case were <code>E741.py</code> was duplicated and renamed to <code>E741.pyi</code> and a snapshot to confirm that no errors were raised for this new case as E741 should be disabled in <code>.pyi</code> files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @calumy, this is great! I pushed a few small fixups to your PR:</p>
<ol>
<li>I made the change preview-only for now; we can stabilise it in Ruff 0.7. Strictly speaking we could <em>probably</em> get away with doing this in a patch release, since it&#x27;s a reduction in scope rather than an increase in scope -- but it&#x27;s still a big <em>change</em> in scope, so I feel much safer doing it in preview only first :-)</li>
<li>I added some docs on how it works differently for <code>.pyi</code> files</li>
<li>I made it a bit more DRY by putting the check for whether it&#x27;s a stub file in the <code>ambiguous_variable_name()</code> function itself, so we don&#x27;t have to repeat it everywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>LMK if you&#x27;d like me to explain any of it, very happy to do so :-)</p>

<p>All makes sense to me; thanks for laying it out clearly.</p>
