            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Resolves https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/18818</p>
<p>The change fixes the false negative described in the issue, but I want to ensure it doesn't break other scenarios.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why the original implementation only checked shadowed bindings with <code>only_binding()</code>, but I changed it to check any binding with <code>resolve_name()</code>. All existing tests pass, including my new test case, so the change appears to work correctly.</p>
<p>However, I'd appreciate feedback on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why <code>only_binding()</code> was chosen initially</li>
<li>What edge cases my change might introduce</li>
<li>Whether this broader scope could cause false positives</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo nextest run</code> and <code>cargo insta test</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My guess is that we are checking <code>only_binding</code> to be cautious about Ruff's ability to handle control flow.</p>
<p>I'll have to think of a less-contrived example, but I think your modification would trigger here, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if True:
    nums = []
else:
    nums = {1, 2, 3}
for num in nums:
    nums.add(num + 5)
</code></pre>
<p>But it's possible this is overly cautious. Let's see what the ecosystem report looks like.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I searched this for another PR earlier, and it seems like we have a pretty even split between <code>only_binding</code> and <code>resolve_name</code>, and I couldn't really tell which one should be used in the handful of cases I looked at.</p>
<p>I guess I kind of lean toward <code>resolve_name</code> in general, but <code>only_binding</code> is more conservative, as you said. Definitely curious to hear your thoughts, though! Maybe we can standardize or document when each one should be used, either way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I think it's okay to use <code>resolve_name</code> here. But let's gate this behind preview since it might add diagnostics.</p>
<p>@LyricalToxic Can you add a method to <code>ruff_linter::preview</code> and gate your change behind that? Then you'll have to write add a test for it as well. Finally, add a little blurb to the documentation about the preview behavior (it doesn't have to be super technical).</p>

<p>Indeed, this triggers now but didn't before.</p>
<p>I don't think trading false-negatives with false-positives is a good trade here. Instead, we should look into if we can improve our inference by doing any of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resolve all visible bindings and check if they all resolve to a dict</li>
<li>Change <code>only_binding</code> to return the only binding that's unconditionally visible at this point (this might be hard?).</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing so would also fix https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18861 and other places where we rely on type information without introducing new false positives.</p>
