### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

Slightly annoying. This requires updating `get_size2` first

---

_Comment by @MichaReiser on 2025-09-16 08:41_

@ibraheemdev is updating `get_size2` maybe something you could look at as a smaller in-between task? It's obviously not urgent

Upstream PR https://github.com/bircni/get-size2/pull/35

I'm still somewhat inclined to just vendor get-size2.
