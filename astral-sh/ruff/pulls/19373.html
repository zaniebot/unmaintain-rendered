            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>It took me some time to figure out that as an outside contributor I can't reproduce the docs. This is because the Ruff docs use Material for MkDocs Insiders, which is closed source.</p>
<p>While CONTRIBUTING.md has terse comments to point outside contributors to a fallback, it does not go into much detail.</p>
<p>This PR adds a Note admonition to highlight to new contributors that they can't fully reproduce the docs locally, with a relevant link to the features that are missing from the OSS version.</p>
<p>I arrived here through a rabbit hole via https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/19362 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/19369</p>
