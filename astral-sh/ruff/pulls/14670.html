            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Resolves https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13868 by adding an environment variable <code>MDTEST_FILE_FILTER</code> which can be used to specify a substring for tests to be filtered by. I was working around this when implementing another PR by deleting all the other tests in a file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>maybe this printing is too prescriptive of the exact command to be run / not windows-friendly enough? happy to reword, though i think keeping at least the print for the env var name is useful and solves the discoverability problem</p>
<p>i also sort of wish we were able to print a further filter for the test name itself, e.g. <code>-- mdtest__unpacking</code>. i didn't find a simple+robust way to generate this name</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>just doing a simple case-sensitive substring check. this could also be changed to do a glob or regex, though then we have to think about escaping if we want to print the expected filter for a given test. shouldn't be too big of a deal, so happy to implement another solution if we want to</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the PR @connorskees! I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>This is probably the easiest version of this feature to implement, so I'm fine with landing it for now and then iterating. But there are a bunch of things I'm not really a <em>massive</em> fan of here. Again, we don't necessarily need to make any of these changes here in this PR, I'm just noting them for posterity:</p>
<h2>Usability on Windows</h2>
<p>We don't have any people working at Astral right now who develop primarily on Windows, but I'm sure we have contributors (or potential contributors) who use Windows primarily. I used to use Windows primarily, and setting environment variables is kind of a pain on Windows. I'm not sure there even is a way to set them ephemerally as part of a single process. Ideally I think this would be a CLI flag rather than an environment variable. (But, as I say, I'm sure that's harder to implement, so I'm fine with going for an environment variable for now.)</p>
<h2>Other tests are still shown by <code>cargo test</code> as having run even though all subtests are skipped</h2>
<p>E.g. here's what I see if I create a deliberate failure in multiple test files, but then only select one subtest (using <code>MDTEST_TEST_FILTER='A single bare `except`' cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic --test mdtest</code>):</p>
<details>

</details>

<p>Ideally all the mdtests except for <code>test mdtest__exception_control_flow</code> would show as <code>... SKIPPED</code>. Otherwise it gives the impression that you're running more tests than you actually are.</p>
<h2>Very long command needed</h2>
<p>To select <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/exception/control_flow.md#a-single-bare-except">this test</a> I need to type this command at the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>MDTEST_TEST_FILTER='A single bare `except`' cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic --test mdtest
</code></pre>
<p>That's really quite a long command, and note that I need to include the backticks around the word &quot;except&quot;, which isn't obvious if you're reading the name of the test from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/exception/control_flow.md#a-single-bare-except">the rendered Markdown on GitHub</a>. It might be better if, as well as being able to select tests by name, <code>red_knot_test</code> assigned each subtest a unique &quot;test ID&quot;, and we also allowed selecting tests by their test IDs. The framework could tell you the IDs of the tests that failed in its error report, allowing you to easily rerun just those tests using e.g.</p>
<pre><code>MDTEST_TEST_ID=42 cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic --test mdtest
</code></pre>

<p>That's true. However, the test runner printing the command for you somewhat mitigates this. I don't like numbers, but maybe we can come up with another identifier.</p>

<p>This probably requires our own test runner. We could try extracting the full test name using <code>module_path</code>, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14670/files/249b8134a37aae59e51cb0f93e7d65c7ba191879#diff-3ac9b4142b5271acdd34e8027226477c72f0ecf71e1dfc2b3a7295b13a7d8e0f</p>
<p>@connorskees do you want to give this a try in a follow up PR?</p>
