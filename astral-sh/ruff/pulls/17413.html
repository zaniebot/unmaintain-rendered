            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This reworks the assignability/subtyping relations a bit to handle typevars better:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For the most part, types are not assignable to typevars, since there's no guarantee what type the typevar will be specialized to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An intersection is an exception, if it contains the typevar itself as one of the positive elements. This should fall out from the other clauses automatically, since a typevar is assignable to itself, and an intersection is assignable to something if any positive element is assignable to that something.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Constrained typevars are an exception, since they must be specialized to <em>exactly</em> one of the constraints, not to a <em>subtype</em> of a constraint. If a type is assignable to every constraint, then the type is also assignable to the constrained typevar.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We already had a special case for (3), but the ordering of it relative to the intersection clauses meant we weren't catching (2) correctly.  To fix this, we keep the special case for (3), but fall through to the other match arms for non-constrained typevars and if the special case isn't true for a constrained typevar.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This comment is true, but I have a hard time understanding how it's relevant to the code below. Would we write this arm any differently if constraints had to be disjoint? It would still be the case that the lhs type must be a subtype of <em>all</em> constraints (separately; not just the union of them) in order to be a subtype of the constrained typevar, which seems like the more important point to make here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My thinking was that the possibility of non-disjoint constraints is the only reason that this arm is needed. If the constraints are disjoint, I don't think there's any lhs that could be a subtype of all of them, is there?</p>
