<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Per @ntBre in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19111, it would be a good idea to make the tests no longer have these syntax errors, so this PR updates the tests and snapshots.</p>
<p><code>B031</code> gave me a lot of trouble since the ending test of declaring a function named <code>groupby</code> makes it so that inside other functions, it's unclear which <code>groupby</code> is referred to since it depends on when the function is called. To fix it I made each function have it's own <code>from itertools import groupby</code> so there's no more ambiguity.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Updated tests and snapshots.</p>
