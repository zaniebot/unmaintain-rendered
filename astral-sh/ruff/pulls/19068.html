            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In particular, <code>while 1:</code> is a <a href="https://grep.app/search?f.lang=Python&amp;case=true&amp;q=while+1%3A">surprisingly common idiom</a> (due to the fact that the <code>bool</code> type was a surprisingly late addition to Python); and also, the truthiness of float literals and complex literals is actually easier to determine from the raw AST than the evaluated type</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A bit of a wash on the benchmarks? A bunch of the instrumented ones are showing small slowdowns, but some of the walltime ones are showing small speedups. No changes bigger than 1%.</p>
<p>Semantically, though, I do think it's confusing if <code>while True:</code> is understood differently to <code>while 1:</code>, even if that's only a temporary state we're in</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Should we limit the complexity and the potential inconsistency between this and type inference here? For example, whether or not empty tuples should be considered always-falsy was a recent matter of debate. And it seems extremely unlikely that someone would use something like <code>if f&quot;&quot;</code> of <code>if 0j</code>.</p>
<p>I would personally say the <code>ast::Number::Int(_)</code> change and <code>ast::Expr::NoneLiteral</code> seem like reasonable additions. Everything else, I would remove again. It only adds code complexity, and we do perform additional work for no gain (if those patterns are never used).</p>
