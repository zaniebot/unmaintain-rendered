            <div class="timeline-body"><p>E.g., I&#x27;m not sure that the positive-errors in <code>PGH005_1.py</code> are actually picked up by pre-commit, since the pre-commit regex seems to ignore any lines that start with four spaces.</p>

<p>Thanks for looking @charliermarsh yeah I was confused about this but raised the PR to get another set of eyes on it. I think you are right that it&#x27;s not intended to work on indented comments (it looks to be used for linting PEP rst files).</p>
<p>In that case, does it even make sense to add this rule? I was looking for a good first issue but can close this and find another one to work on</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@martinabeleda - Thanks tons for getting involved! Yeah, I think this rule probably <em>doesn&#x27;t</em> make sense to include. I&#x27;m sorry to mislead. I&#x27;m gonna go ahead and edit the pygrep issue to remove any RST-specific rules. I wish I&#x27;d caught those before!</p>
<p>My top suggestion right now is to take something from the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/998"><code>flake8-simplify</code></a> task. The nice thing is that you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/blob/d3cb9556a5255969f83a8329df8f635da41f595d/flake8_simplify/rules/ast_for.py"><code>flake8-simplify</code> source</a> for any given rule as a hint on how to implement it. Just comment in the issue if you&#x27;d like to work on something there, I&#x27;d love your help!</p>
