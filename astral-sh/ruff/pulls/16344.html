<p>This is mainly on me for not noticing this during the last release but I noticed in the last changelog that there's only 1 bug fix which didn't seem correct as I saw multiple of them so I looked at a couple of PRs that are in &quot;Rule changes&quot; section and the PRs that were marked with the <code>bug</code> label was categorized there because</p>
<ol>
<li>It <em>also</em> had other labels like <code>rule</code> and <code>fixes</code> (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16080, https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16110, https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16219, etc.)</li>
<li>Some PRs didn't have the <code>bug</code> label (but the issue as marked as <code>bug</code>) but <em>only</em> labels like &quot;fixes&quot; (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16011, https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16132, etc.)</li>
</ol>
