            <div class="timeline-body"><p>LGTM. This is now stricter than what I had in mind as it disallows us to use a newer MSRV than stable - 2 -- without exception. I wonder if we should relax the phrasing to leave us some wiggle room.</p>

<p>I'll go with whatever we agree on here, but to me that seems like a significant change that I'd want to be sure we're aligned on beyond just the two of us.</p>

<p>I was mainly looking to document that MSRV bumps aren't considered breaking in terms of semver. Not breaking downstream packagers is in our own interest</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My opinion is that the best way to not break downstream packagers is to set a clear policy and stick to it.</p>
<p>If we plan to do N-2, I think that should be documented somewhere, just for the benefit of future-us remembering what we decided, if nothing else.</p>
<p>If you'd like to propose a different version of this PR, maybe it would be simplest for you to put up an alternative PR?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As I said. I'm okay with the current version. It simply means that we no longer have the option to make an exception</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, will go ahead and land for now. If you feel it's important that we carve out an option for exceptions, we can discuss and consider that as a separate change.</p>
