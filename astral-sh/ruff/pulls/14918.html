            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>There&#x27;s a functional change here, and a few cosmetic changes.</p>
<p>The functional change is that we currently consider <code>Literal[str]</code> to be disjoint from <code>type[Any]</code>. But they&#x27;re not disjoint: <code>Any</code> here could be materialized as <code>str</code> or <code>object</code>; in those materializations, the two types would clearly overlap, and therefore <code>type[Any]</code> overlaps with <code>Literal[str]</code>. This PR fixes our logic in <code>Type::is_disjoint_from</code> to reflect that.</p>
<p>Also included in this PR are cosmetic changes to <code>Type::is_subtype_of</code>. The main reason for these changes is that currently we have <code>Type::SubclassOf(target_class))</code> branches in <code>match</code> statements where the <code>target_class</code> variable actually has type <code>ClassBase</code> rather than <code>Class</code>; this is quite confusing. A secondary reason for these changes is that it should be impossible for us to encounter <code>Type::SubclassOf(SubclassOfType { base })</code> instances in this <code>match</code> statement where <code>base</code> is not a <code>ClassBase::Class()</code> variant, since all other <code>ClassBase::Class()</code> variants are not fully static exit, and therefore we immediately early in <code>is_subtype_of()</code> here if we encounter one of them:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/6e11086c981f0ffb179fdaa78fa0837aa0283cda/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types.rs#L607-L612</p>
<p>The changes to <code>Type::is_subtype_of()</code> clarify that we shouldn&#x27;t be dealing with any other <code>ClassBase::Class()</code> variants in this <code>match</code> statement; we should therefore be using <code>Class::is_subclass_of()</code> rather than <code>Class:is_subclass_of_base()</code>.</p>
<p>As a result of the above changes, <code>Class::is_subclass_of_base()</code> actually becomes unused, so this PR removes it as well. I think this is probably also for the best: a <code>ClassBase</code> and a <code>Class</code> are two different things, and it feels like it blurs the two concepts to have a method that asks whether a class is a &quot;subclass of&quot; a <code>ClassBase</code>. If we need to ask this question again in the future, it&#x27;s not that much more verbose to just do <code>class.mro(db).contains(&amp;base)</code>.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code>. The new test case for the <code>is_not_disjoint_from</code> test is the only one added in this PR that fails on <code>main</code>, but the other added test cases seem useful anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Took me a bit to realize that we don&#x27;t need to handle <code>SubclassOf(object)</code> here (like the previous code did), because <code>Instance(type)</code> is equivalent to <code>SubclassOf(object)</code>, and we check equivalence first in <code>is_subtype_of</code>. Might be worth a comment, because (taken on its own) this case now appears incomplete.</p>
<p>TBH I think all these type-algebra methods would be easier to read if every case were commented with a Python-type-syntax example of what the case is checking, but that&#x27;s out of scope for this PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. I think I do prefer always explicitly unpacking to a <code>Class</code>, and avoiding methods that blur the line between a <code>ClassBase</code> and a <code>Class</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah... I think on balance the early returns at the top of this function make it more robust, but they definitely (for me, at least) make it a little harder to reason about how the big <code>match</code> expression works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Uhhh I actually think this branch is still wrong and no tests fail if I delete it entirely. But I think we do need something here.</p>
<p><code>Instance(enum.EnumMeta)</code> should be a subtype of <code>type[object]</code> but not a subtype of <code>type[type]</code>. Because instances of <code>enum.EnumMeta</code> (example: the class <code>enum.Enum</code>) are subclasses of <code>object</code> but not subclasses of <code>type</code>.</p>
<p>I think I&#x27;ve spent too many hours thinking about <code>type[]</code> now because my head&#x27;s spinning and I can&#x27;t figure out what logic I need to add to make sure that that works as expected 🙃</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think this case, as currently written, is wrong: &quot;instances of <code>type</code>&quot; is not a subtype of &quot;subclasses of <code>type</code>&quot;.</p>

<p><code>Instance(enum.EnumMeta)</code> should be a subtype of <code>type[object]</code> but not a subtype of <code>type[type]</code>. Because instances of <code>enum.EnumMeta</code> (example: the class <code>enum.Enum</code>) are subclasses of <code>object</code> but not subclasses of <code>type</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I think the most we can say here is that <code>Instance(&lt;any subclass of type&gt;)</code> is a subtype of <code>SubclassOf(object)</code>. Which is a generalization from what we have already, which is that <code>Instance(type)</code> is equivalent to <code>SubclassOf(object)</code>. We probably do need to add a case for this here in <code>is_subtype_of</code>.</p>

<p>Sounds fine, though I also think it would be fine if this PR at least removes the <code>is_subtype_of</code> case that we know is wrong and doesn&#x27;t fail any tests if removed, since we&#x27;ve established that much here. Just makes the follow up PR on is_subtype_of that much easier to review.</p>
