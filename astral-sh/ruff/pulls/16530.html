            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR closes #15199.</p>
<p>The change I just made is to set all variables to type <code>Unknown</code> if unpacking fails, but in some cases this may be excessive.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>a, b, c = &quot;ab&quot;
reveal_type(a)  # Unknown, but it would be reasonable to think of it as LiteralString
reveal_type(c)  # Unknown
</code></pre>
<pre><code># Failed to unpack before the starred expression
(a, b, *c, d, e) = (1,)
reveal_type(a)  # Unknown
reveal_type(b)  # Unknown
...
# Failed to unpack after the starred expression
(a, b, *c, d, e) = (1, 2, 3)
reveal_type(a)  # Unknown, but should it be Literal[1]?
reveal_type(b)  # Unknown, but should it be Literal[2]?
reveal_type(c)  # Todo
reveal_type(d)  # Unknown
reveal_type(e)  # Unknown
</code></pre>
<p>I will modify it if you think it would be better to make it a different type than just <code>Unknown</code>.</p>
Test Plan
<p>I have made appropriate modifications to the test cases affected by this change, and also added some more test cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It might be worth expanding your previous comment to state that this behavior is only for the <em>current</em> unpacking and if there are any unpacking in the outer context or a nested unpacking which are valid, then the inference still happens correctly.</p>
<p>This matches the behavior of mypy: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.13&amp;gist=d1986f8345de346c91188f530b71a3e9&amp;flags=show-traceback,strict.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this should be <code>Unknown</code> as well. Otherwise, once this todo is fixed, we might start inferring it as <code>list[Unknown]</code> which could seem like a special case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can simplify this entire branch because (a) we want to avoid the <code>list[Unknown]</code> as I mentioned above and (b) every element would need to be <code>Unknown</code>.</p>
<p>So, we should keep the error reporting and then directly create a vector of <code>Unknowns</code> that is exactly equal to the number of targets:</p>
<pre><code>return Cow::Owned(vec![Type::unknown(); targets.len()]);
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the value of this is not exactly what it represents because in <code>tuple_ty_elements</code> method, we would return a vector of unknowns that&#x27;s exactly the same length as the number of targets but that&#x27;s mainly because the error message is a little bit different in that case.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any action item here except that I&#x27;d probably rename this variable to something like <code>length_mismatch</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for doing this! There are couple of changes around simplification and using <code>Unknown</code> even in the case of starred unpacking but otherwise this looks good.</p>
