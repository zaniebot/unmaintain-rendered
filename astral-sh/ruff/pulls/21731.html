            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ideally I guess we'd also include some tests where we mock out a virtual environment that <em>does</em> include <code>typing_extensions</code>, and then check that the <code>typing_extensions</code> suggestions are still included.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should still include <code>typing_extensions</code> suggestions if it's a stub file, even if <code>typing_extensions</code> isn't installed into the environment. Stub files are never executed at runtime, so the typeshed version of <code>typing_extensions</code> is fine for them.</p>
<p>Ideally we would also include <code>typing_extensions</code> suggestions inside <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks (which are also not executed at runtime), but that won't produce great results until/unless we implement https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1553, so I wouldn't worry about it too much right now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>types</code> <em>probably</em> should <em>always</em> be considered non-shadowable, yes, because it is imported as part of the Python interpreter's startup process so it's very difficult to shadow it in first-party code (even though theoretically possible).</p>
<p>But the main thing I was actually objecting to was the comment! You say &quot;we don't want to pretend as if these modules are always available at runtime&quot; -- but there's no pretence with the <code>types</code> module. It just <em>is</em> always available at runtime!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>no, that's not true -- most stdlib modules can be shadowed by user code. The first-party search paths have precedence over the stdlib search path (emulating the fact that <code>.</code> is the first entry on <code>sys.path</code> at runtime).</p>
<p>But certain &quot;builtin&quot; modules have special-casing baked deep into the Python interpreter, and these modules skip normal module resolution. These &quot;builtin&quot; modules, a subset of the Python stdlib, must <em>always</em> be resolved to locations in the standard library. Ty emulates this, because it accurately reflects what happens at runtime, and also adds a few other modules which aren't <em>actually</em> builtin at runtime but where we're very likely to crash if the module is resolved to a non-stdlib location (<code>types</code>, <code>typing_extensions</code>)</p>
