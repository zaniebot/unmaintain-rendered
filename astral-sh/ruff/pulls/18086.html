            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The PR add the <code>fix safety</code> section for rule <code>SIM103</code> (#15584 )</p>
<h3>Unsafe Fix Example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Foo:
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return 1
    
def foo():
    if Foo() == 1:
        return True
    return False

def foo_fix():
    return Foo() == 1
    
print(foo()) # True
print(foo_fix()) # 1
</code></pre>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>I updated the code snippet example, because I thought it was cool to have a correct example, i.e., that I can paste inside the playground and it works :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think the part about comments is true. The code checks for comments in the fix range and avoids a fix in that case (although that happens way earlier in the code than the fix generation, so it's not that clear).</p>
<p>I wanted to say that the boolean condition part wasn't true either because we do try to add <code>bool</code> calls in cases where it doesn't look like a boolean, but your clever example does change the behavior. Do you think it's worth mentioning <code>__eq__</code> or the other comparison methods that could cause problems? Maybe a second sentence like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the fix will try to wrap non-boolean values in a call to <code>bool</code>, custom implementations of comparison functions like <code>__eq__</code> can avoid the <code>bool</code> call and still lead to altered behavior.</p>

<p>You are right. I delete this part.</p>

<p>Fine for me. I update the fix safety section.</p>
