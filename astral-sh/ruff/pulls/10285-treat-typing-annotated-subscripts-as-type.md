# Treat `typing.Annotated` subscripts as type definitions

---

_@charliermarsh_

## Summary

I think this code has existed since the start of `typing.Annotated` support (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/333), and was then overlooked over a series of refactors.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10279.
