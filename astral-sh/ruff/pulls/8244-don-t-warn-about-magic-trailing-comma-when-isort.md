# Don't warn about magic trailing comma when `isort.force-single-line` is true

_Pull request opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-10-26 06:43_


## Summary

Based on [this feedback](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8185#issuecomment-1780092525). Avoid warning about `force-wrap-aliases` and `split-on-trailing-comma` if `force-single-line` is true (which creates a dedicated import for each imported member).

## Test Plan

Ran `ruff format . --no-cache` and verified that the warning show up when `force-single-line=false` and aren't shown when `force-single-line=true`

(issue with `pypa/build` fixed upstream, by the way, not related to this PR)

(I accidentally merged in main not realizing this has a different upstream, but I'll fix it up before merging.)
