# Require --preview for `ruff server`

---

_@snowsignal_

## Summary

Fixes #10367.

While the server is still in an unstable state, requiring a `--preview` flag would be a good way to indicate this to end users.

@snowsignal can you add `server` to the rooster config in the pyproject.toml so they get a dedicated section?
