# `ruff server`: Implement settings resolution snapshot tests

---

_@snowsignal_

## Summary

Closes #11112.

This PR implements snapshot tests which verify that the resolved configuration, taken from a filesystem configuration value and a set of resolved editor settings, remains consistent. We test this consistency with multiple configuration preferences.
