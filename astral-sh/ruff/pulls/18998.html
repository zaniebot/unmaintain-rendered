            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Simplifies literal <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> conditions to <code>ALWAYS_TRUE</code> / <code>ALWAYS_FALSE</code> during semantic index building. This allows us to eagerly evaluate more constraints, which should help with performance (looks like there is a tiny 1% improvement in instrumented benchmarks), but also allows us to eliminate definitely-unreachable branches in control-flow merging. This can lead to better type inference in some cases because it allows us to retain narrowing constraints without solving <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/690">astral-sh/ty#690</a> first:</p>
<pre><code>def _(c: int | None):
    if c is None:
        assert False
    
    reveal_type(c)  # int, previously: int | None

<p>closes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/713">astral-sh/ty#713</a></p>
Test Plan
<ul>
<li>Regression test for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/713">astral-sh/ty#713</a></li>
<li>Made sure that all ecosystem diffs trace back to removed false positives</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Very nice!</p>
<p>Theoretically we could also simplify constraints such as <code>not True</code> <code>not False</code>, or <code>not not True</code>, etc. But it probably wouldn&#x27;t be worth the added complexity -- I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d write code like that?! I can find a few examples on grep.app, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like a useful pattern...</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I also grepped for some common patterns of definitely-true/false conditions and the only other thing that seemed frequently used <em>and</em> feasible to unambiguously detect in semantic index building was the <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> and <code>if not TYPE_CHECKING</code> pattern. I seem to remember that we don&#x27;t look up if it originates from <code>typing</code> anyway? So maybe that&#x27;s worth doing?</p>
<p>Another thing that could be very valuable for performance would be to detect certain frequently used patterns that will <em>definitely</em> lead to an <em>ambiguous</em> truthiness result later. But I&#x27;m not sure what kind of patterns that might be...</p>

<p>Yeah, I think that could be worth doing!</p>
