Not related to this PR but I think we should rename `EqCmpop` to `EqCmpOp` ... just because RustPython doesn't follow the convention doesn't mean that we shouldn't.

Weirdly CPython does the same thing though: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/8d69828092f734cd9275459173a0f89bde109659/Grammar/python.gram#L726

@not-my-profile  That'a autogenerated from python.asdl.
I actually was considering to specially renaming them in RustPython too.

No objection to me from renaming.
