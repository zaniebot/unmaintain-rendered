            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I'm working on adding a rules table to Red Knot's configuration.
What's special about rules is that we intentionally want to defer validating
the rule names so that we can <em>warn</em> about incorrect rule names rather than just abort.
By warning I mean we'd create a diagnostic. This is a functionality that has been requested for ruff (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14443).</p>
<p>The one problem I ran into when creating the diagnostic is that we don't always
have a file. For example, the rule could have been enabled on the CLI.
(actually, I didn't run into this yet but we will once we add <code>--ignore</code> and <code>--error</code> and <code>--warn</code> CLI flags).</p>
<p>This PR makes <code>file</code> an <code>Diagnostic</code> an <code>Option</code> to account for the case where we don't have a file.  Doing so has the disadvantage that it's now technically possible for a diagnostic to have a range but not an associated <code>File</code>. I intentionally decided not to design the &quot;perfect&quot; solution because the API is likely to change with @BurntSushi's work
on Diagnostics.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo test</code></p>
