# Remove long `Iterator::chain` sequence in `RuleCodePrefix::iter`

---

_Pull request opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-03-18 09:27_

## Summary

This PR removes the `Iterator::chain(...)` sequence in `RuleCodePrefix::iter()` with `Vec::expand` to avoid an overlong-recursive types. 

The existing `RuleCodePrefix::iter` method chains all rule group iterators together. This leads to very long recursive types `Chain<Map<Chain<Map<Chain<Map.....>>>>` (proportional to the number of rule groups). 

This PR rewrites the macro to use `Vec::extend` instead, which removes the long recursive type (at the cost of introducing a potential allocation). 

## Alternatives

An alternative would be to use a stack allocated array by unrolling the `Linter::iter` methods (generated by `EnumIter`). 
I don't think it's worth the extra complexity, considering that `RuleCodePrefix::iter` isn't a hot function.

## Test Plan

`cargo test`
