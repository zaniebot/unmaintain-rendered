            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR detects unparenthesized assignment expressions used in set literals and comprehensions and in sequence indexes. The link to the release notes in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6591 just has this entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Assignment expressions can now be used unparenthesized within set literals and set comprehensions, as well as in sequence indexes (but not slices).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>with no other information, so hopefully the test cases I came up with cover all of the changes. I also tested these out in the Python REPL and they actually worked in Python 3.9 too. I'm guessing this may be another case that was &quot;formally made part of the language spec in Python 3.10, but usable -- and commonly used -- in Python &gt;=3.9&quot; as @AlexWaygood added to the body of #6591 for context managers. So we may want to change the version cutoff, but I've gone along with the release notes for now.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>New inline parser tests and linter CLI tests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it might be related to the fact that <code>parse_slice</code> is used for both sequence indexes (<code>data[x := 1]</code>) and slices (<code>data[x := 1: 2]</code>) but the unsupported syntax kind is only to be raised for the former. We have the same check for the latter case down below on 893 which raises a syntax error.</p>

<p>I'm on PTO this week and don't have my laptop on me. But I hear that we have other CPython core devs on the team who might be able to help with this kind of question ;)</p>
<p>In general, I think we should definitely follow CPython's implementation rather than CPython's documentation when it comes to the Python version that things like this became legal syntax. That seems like it should avoid false positives. In cases where the syntax was added unofficially for one or two versions prior to it being added to the language spec, it's very possible that people started using the new syntax accidentally even if it wasn't &quot;officially&quot; supported by the language</p>

I remembered later last night that the parser tests have separate <code>## Error</code> and <code>## Unsupported Syntax Error</code> sections.

<p>Those are regular <code>ParseError</code>s though, so I might leave that for a follow-up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, @dhruvmanila is right, that's what I meant. I initially checked it right after <code>let lower = ...</code> and then had to move it into this <code>if</code> to avoid a duplicate with the <code>ParseError</code>, so I thought it was worth noting, but I see how it could be confusing. I think I'll just delete this comment because it's pretty clear in hindsight what's going on.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Great idea. I may have gone slightly overboard on the variant docs, but I'm thinking these might be a good start if we end up wanting to show these to users eventually.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that totally makes sense. I left the existing <code>Walrus</code> variant alone for now but cleaned up all of the walruses in this PR. I'll do another cleanup pass for the already-merged variants separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the reviews! I think I have handled all of the comments, but I'm definitely happy to wait for Alex to come back to discuss the version. 3.9 sounds like a safer way to go than 3.10, but there's no rush.</p>
