            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>As you can see from the drastically reduced <code>KNOWN_FAILURES</code> list, a lot of the remaining panics in the corpus test are caused by pulling types for every subexpression of a type annotation. Consider for example the type annotation <code>tuple[int, ...]</code>. If we insist on being able to infer types for each and every subexpression of annotations, then we also need to infer a type for the ellipsis.</p>
<p>In the current changeset, I simply stop the <code>PullTypesVisitor</code> from descending further into annotation expressions. This disables the check even for annotations like <code>int | str</code> where we can — and do — assign correct types to subexpressions.</p>
<p>I am aware that this might not be the right fix. I&#x27;m opening the PR to discuss how to proceed here. Two alternative approaches that I can think of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adapt type inference to infer types for each and every subexpressions of annotations. For the ellipsis in the example above, we would perhaps infer <code>Type::Unknown</code> (or maybe <code>tuple[int, …]</code>, somewhat recursively?).</li>
<li>Adapt type inference to infer types for <em>most</em> subexpressions of annotations, with certain exceptions. We adapt the <code>PullTypes</code> visitor to ignore those exceptional expressions.</li>
</ol>
Test Plan
<p>Ran corpus test with reduced known-failures list.</p>

<p>If it&#x27;s technically possible and inferring types for annotations is just something we aren&#x27;t doing yet, then I&#x27;d rather acknowledge the shortcoming by using <code>KNOWN_FAILURES</code>. Mainly because the long-term goal is that the linter uses the same API as the test, and it should be possible to query the type of every expression.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t know. This is what I tried to discuss in the PR description.</p>

<p>I would assume it&#x27;s technically possible. It&#x27;s just not clear to me what something like the ellipsis in a <code>tuple[int, ...]</code> annotation would have a as a type?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m definitely not trying to get rid of entries in <code>KNOWN_FAILURES</code> if there is an actual known limitation. I am trying to solve it.</p>
<p>It looks to me like pyright/pylance go with alternative approach no. 2, as you get &quot;mouse over&quot; types for the <code>tuple</code> and <code>int</code> sub-expressions, but nothing for the ellipsis.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the case 2. In that case it would probably be best to change the <code>HasTy</code> interface to return <code>Option&lt;Type&gt;</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Theoretically, I would say the first approach is the correct one (though the type should be <code>*tuple[int, ...]</code>, to be exact). However, the average user is likely to be confused by it, so here&#x27;s another approach to consider: Infer the type internally but don&#x27;t show it to the user, or only show conditionally.</p>
