            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Adds support for goto-* for builtins to the playground</p>
<p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9cabbcf-e043-4160-be17-5156d653984e</p>
<p>It's not the most elegant approach with the inline banner but it works pretty well and has the benefit that it doesn't complicate the Playground as much as if we would need to integrate this into the tabs navigation.</p>
<p>Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/751</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is awesome!! A few <em>tiny</em> nits from playing around with it locally (none blocking):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Would it be possible to add a key binding so that pressing &quot;Esc.&quot; exits the file-within-a-file?</p>
</li>
<li><p>It seems like the &quot;Diagnostics&quot; panel can't be resized when you're looking at at vendored file -- is that expected? It's a bit annoying if you had it huge before you jumped to the vendored file and now you can't resize it without jumping out of the vendored file again 😄</p>
</li>
<li><p>It looks like the &quot;vendored files cannot be run&quot; message is displayed in a black font in the &quot;run&quot; tab even if you're in dark mode, which doesn't work great ;-)

</li>
<li><p>It surprised me a bit here that <code>tuple</code> was towards the bottom of my screen after I jumped to its definition and the file-within-a-file opened up -- I'd expect <code>tuple</code> to be right at the top after jumping to its definition:</p>

<p>That's monaco. I don't think I can do anything about that</p>

<p>If claude can figure it out in 1min, otherwise no</p>
