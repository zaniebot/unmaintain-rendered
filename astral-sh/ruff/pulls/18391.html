            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR unifies the remaining differences between <code>OldDiagnostic</code> and
<code>Message</code> (<code>OldDiagnostic</code> was only missing an optional <code>noqa_offset</code> field) and
replaces <code>Message</code> with <code>OldDiagnostic</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest functional difference is that the combined <code>OldDiagnostic</code> kind no
longer implements <code>AsRule</code> for an infallible conversion to <code>Rule</code>. This was
pretty easy to work around with <code>is_some_and</code> and <code>is_none_or</code> in the few places
it was needed. In <code>LintContext::report_diagnostic_if_enabled</code> we can just use
the new <code>Violation::rule</code> method, which takes care of most cases.</p>
<p>Most of the interesting changes are in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18391/files/8156992540f4e81f914a9534e99241b1e14382a1">this range</a> before I started renaming.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing tests</p>
Future Work
<p>I think it&#x27;s time to start shifting some of these fields to the new <code>Diagnostic</code>
kind. I believe we want <code>Fix</code> for sure, but I&#x27;m less sure about the others. We
may want to keep a thin wrapper type here anyway to implement a <code>rule</code> method,
so we could leave some of these fields on that too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alright, we&#x27;re finally back under the codspeed threshold, but the macro changes in the last commit feel potentially hacky to me. There are also still some ~2% perf regressions, but I think I handled all of the hot spots. The remaining new code in the flamegraphs looks pretty broadly distributed, which I think means it&#x27;s just from the new <code>Diagnostic</code> construction.</p>
<p>One big thing I noticed is that all of the rules in <code>check_tokens</code> unconditionally push diagnostics and then a <code>retain</code> cleans them up at the end. Changing all of the <code>report_diagnostic</code> calls in that call graph to <code>report_diagnostic_if_enabled</code> should be a big help because both <code>Diagnostic</code> construction <em>and</em> the <code>to_rule</code> call in the final <code>retain</code> are expensive. But I think that&#x27;s a better fit for a follow-up.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll leave this in draft because I&#x27;m a bit uncertain about the proc macro changes, especially, but I think it&#x27;s ready for at least a quick review.</p>
<p>For a little more context on the proc macro changes, my goal was to make the conversion of <code>NoqaCode</code> to <code>Rule</code> less expensive by avoiding calling <code>Rule::from_code</code>:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/87a15f7e4cf328e6485cee98960d19f51a955ef4/crates/ruff_linter/src/registry.rs#L18-L26</p>
<p>which both requires formatting a <code>NoqaCode</code> into a <code>String</code> to call and then reparses the <code>NoqaCode</code> into its parts. I moved <code>Linter::common_prefix</code> out of the <code>RuleNamespace</code> trait so that it could become <code>const</code>, which enabled me to pass its output to the <code>match</code> in <code>generate_rule_to_code</code>.</p>
<p><code>Rule::from_code</code> was already faster than parsing a rule from a kebab-case rule name, which I saw in the performance report after <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18391">astral-sh/ruff#18391</a>/commits/bba7f6df7112a1fbfca53b72a73b21ab3d27edb6. The macro changes drop the worst-case performance regression from -4.8% to -2%. That difference might be small enough not to mess with the macros anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn&#x27;t realize this before but it&#x27;s pretty scary that <code>check_tokens</code> could remove diagnostics that were added outside <code>check_tokens</code> (we aren&#x27;t in control of where the context comes from).

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I skimmed through the changes and had two thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would it have been easier to replace the usages of <code>Message::to_rule</code> instead of trying to optimize its performance, given that this is probably something we want to do anyway (because we can&#x27;t add <code>Rule</code> to <code>Diagnostic</code> or have it anywhere in our shared rendering logic). I skimmed through the usages and I think most places can easily be replaced by testing against the noqa code.</li>
<li>For the <code>noqa</code> code. One thing I mentioned in one of your previous PRs is that we could change the <code>NoqaCode</code> representation from <code>String, String</code> to <code>&amp;&#x27;static str, </code>usize<code>there the</code>usize is the split point between prefix and suffix. Using a pre-computed offset allows both <code>prefix</code> and <code>suffix</code> to return a <code>&amp;str</code> instead of a <code>String</code>. I&#x27;m not sure if this would have been helpful here.</li>

<p>I tried that first, but my attempts turned out to be much larger refactors than expected or didn&#x27;t help the performance like I hoped. For example, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18391/commits/d04d40dfc3dd2966ac00e3ae3992ec4fe6560635">this commit</a> was a slight regression from the commit before it and also made <code>cmp_fix</code> very awkward. This could still be the right approach since we&#x27;ll need it later, though, like you said.</p>

<p>Ah I did forget about that one. I tried using <code>NoqaCode(Linter, &amp;&#x27;static str)</code> instead of the current <code>NoqaCode(&amp;&#x27;static str, &amp;&#x27;static str)</code>, but not <code>(&amp;str, usize)</code>.</p>
<p>I can give both of these another try, but I&#x27;ll probably start in a separate PR since I think they can be handled separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I spent a while today looking into refactoring <code>NoqaCode</code> to be a <code>(&amp;&#x27;static str, usize)</code>, and I think it&#x27;s basically impossible. The <code>Linter::common_prefix</code> code is generated in the <code>RuleNamespace</code> derive macro, while the rest of the rule code is generated in the <code>map_codes</code> macro, so there&#x27;s nowhere that has access to both the prefix and suffix strings to generate a single <code>&amp;&#x27;static str</code> combining them.</p>
<p>Even with a const <code>common_prefix</code> method like I added here, we can&#x27;t actually call that const function in the macro, so we still can&#x27;t get access to it at macro-expansion time. We can get two separate const <code>&amp;&#x27;static str</code>s, but I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any way to combine them, at least without some wild transmutes through byte arrays, which is what the crates I found mentioning this did.</p>
<p>I think I need to do one more pass here to check the sites of <code>to_rule</code> calls[^1] that were added as part of the <code>OldDiagnostic</code> and <code>Message</code> merger to see if it&#x27;s worth keeping the macro changes that added <code>NoqaCode::rule</code>, but otherwise this is up to date and the perf looks even better than before (worst case is -1%, down from -2%).</p>
<p>[^1]: To clarify, <code>to_rule</code> is still removed, they were added here before I rebased on the PR removing them, and I replaced them with <code>noqa_code().and_then(|code| code.rule())</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One challenge with the approach you&#x27;ve taken here is that I don&#x27;t think we can store a <code>NoqaCode</code> on <code>ruff_db::Diagnostic</code>.

<p>I don&#x27;t know how much that changes to your refactor. I guess we could call <code>Rule::from_code</code> in the places where we need to go back from code to <code>Rule</code>.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be a larger refactor, I think. But it would be somewhat nice if <code>diagnostic.build_fix</code> would return an <code>Option&lt;FixBuilder&gt;</code> that&#x27;s only <code>Some</code> if we should generate a fix. But that&#x27;s probably a larger refactor too. This would have the advantage that we still have a reference to <code>Rule</code> inside of <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code>. But I fear this would be another large and very painful refactor and I&#x27;m not sure if its&#x27; worth it.</p>
<p>Actually. I don&#x27;t think that would work because we always want to generate a fix to show it to users even when it shouldn&#x27;t get applied.... Although, looking at the code here I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s how Ruff currently works. Either way, I think this coudl simplify things actually...</p>
<p>Instead of what I wrote above. <code>DiagnosticBuilder::with_fix</code> or <code>set_fix</code> could still check if the fix should be applied and then wrap the <code>Fix</code> in a <code>FixWithFixability</code> which is an enum with two variants: <code>Fix(Fix)</code>, <code>DisplayOnly(Fix)</code> where <code>DisplayOnly</code> is a fix that we only want to show but not count in statistics or apply when applying code fixes.</p>
<p>Either way. I think that would be a separate refactor</p>

<p>I think this is a step in the right direction. What&#x27;s unclear to me is how we can avoid the <code>noqa_code.rule()</code> calls entirely (or in most cases). I left a few suggestions but that might require some more larger refactors (or maybe not?).</p>
<p>The reason why I think we should avoid <code>NoqaCode::rule</code> is because: a) it&#x27;s slow and b) I don&#x27;t think we should store a <code>NoqaCode</code> on <code>ruff_db::Diagnostic</code> (we can, but I would prefer not to)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I looked into this a bit originally, and it&#x27;s just a big refactor. Every rule reachable from this function needs to be updated to check if its rule is enabled before emitting a diagnostic. But it will make things simpler and more performant too.

<p>I&#x27;ll tackle that separately!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess if there&#x27;s one <code>NoqaCode</code> per rule and ~900 rules, this adds ~900 constants (which might get inlined?) and ~900 <code>match</code> arms. Is that a lot? I don&#x27;t really have a good intuition for the effects of these kinds of changes on code size.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m still hoping we can revert this part of the PR if we can recover the perf hits in other ways, hopefully from your other suggestions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I guess we could check it in <code>report_diagnostic</code>, but that would be another case that would require returning an <code>Option&lt;DiagnosticGuard&gt;</code> right?</p>
<p>It looks like we could also just apply the per-file ignores to the <code>LinterSettings</code> at the top of <code>check_path</code> (or possibly even earlier). This changes one RUF100 snapshot from</p>
<pre><code>        0       │-RUF100_2.py:1:19: RUF100 [*] Unused `noqa` directive (unused: `F401`)
              0 │+RUF100_2.py:1:19: RUF100 [*] Unused `noqa` directive (non-enabled: `F401`)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not only would this be more correct, it should also be faster because we can skip the rules entirely. I&#x27;m not sure if we want to change how we construct <code>LinterSettings</code> (we probably shouldn&#x27;t if it requires a deep clone). But checking the rule set as resolved for this file inside <code>is_enabled</code> definetely makes sense</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I&#x27;m playing with this a bit today. It&#x27;s easy enough to apply the per-file ignores at the top of <code>check_path</code>, but it does look like it needs a deep clone.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>&quot;Some&quot; might have been a bit of an understatement. I think every, or nearly every, place we currently check if rules are enabled uses <code>settings.rules.enabled</code>, so it would be a pretty big refactor (making <code>LinterSettings::rules</code> private &quot;only&quot; causes 88 compilation errors, so maybe it&#x27;s not <em>every</em> rule). I guess I&#x27;d end up touching all of those call sites with a wrapper too, though. I was picturing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>struct ResolvedLinterSettings&lt;&#x27;a&gt; {
    settings: &amp;&#x27;a LinterSettings,
    per_file_ignores: RuleSet,
}

impl&lt;&#x27;a&gt; ResolvedLinterSettings&lt;&#x27;a&gt; {
    fn new(settings: &amp;&#x27;a LinterSettings, path: &amp;Path) -&gt; Self {
        Self { settings, per_file_ignores: fs::ignores_from_path(path, &amp;settings.per_file_ignores) }
    }

    fn enabled(&amp;self, rule: Rule) -&gt; bool {
        self.settings.rules.enabled(rule) &amp;&amp; !self.per_file_ignores.contains(rule)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>or I guess cloning <code>self.settings.rules.enabled</code> and combining it with <code>per_file_ignores</code> more eagerly.</p>
<p>Do you like that idea, or would you prefer trying to pass down the updated rules table?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh you&#x27;re right. I thought we added a <code>checker</code> (or <code>context</code>) <code>is_rule_enabled</code> method but it seems everyone just calls <code>settings.rule.enabled</code> directly :( But given that there are only 74 references, this might not be too bad to refactor (and we now have the right place to add the methnod -&gt; LintContext)</p>

<p>If not, I think I came up with a very simple solution, just applying both the applicability from your other comment and this <code>should_fix</code> check in <code>DiagnosticGuard::set_fix</code>. I&#x27;ll open a PR soon to see what you think.</p>
