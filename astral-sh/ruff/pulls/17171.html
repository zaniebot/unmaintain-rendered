<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I decided to disable the new <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#needless_continue"><code>needless_continue</code></a> rule because I often found the explicit <code>continue</code> more readable over an empty block or having to invert the condition of an other branch.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo test</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I kinda wonder if we should propose add something to <code>std</code> to make this nicer. I like the way the <code>x.push_str(&amp;format!(&quot;...&quot;))</code> construction reads much nicer, but I guess this approach avoids an intermediate allocation. But this approach has the very ugly <code>let _ = ...;</code> construction.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would be great. I definitely don't love it and it has the downside that later refactoring the code to eg use a Write instead of a string now incorrectly suppresses errors (instead of Rust telling you that this might now fail)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, I'd like to know what the motivation to pin the Rust version to the latest release in <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code> was? Were there any interesting features that this project required to adopt that quickly (literally on the same day of Rust release)?
The reason for my question is that IIUC you're essentially making it impossible for any distro out there to keep up with packaging and everyone is required to rely on <code>rustup</code> to get the exact toolchain version needed to build the project. Before I dive into any further discussion I'd first like to know where my lack of understanding the matter resides and therefore what the real motivation here was/is.</p>

<p>We're aware that always using the latest version is challenging for downstream packagers. That's why we only use the latest Rust version for local development (and in our release pipelines) but maintain backwards compatibility with <code>latest - 2</code> as the MSRV with which ruff compiles (see <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/#minimum-supported-rust-version">versioning policy</a>). That means Ruff can still be built with Rust 1.84 today.</p>
<p>I think what you're running into is that you clone Ruff's repository and invoke <code>cargo build</code> directly. Cargo then picks up the version specified in <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code>. The version in <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code> is the version <em>we use</em> and using the latest Rust version is desired because it gives us new clippy rules and enables new compiler optimizations in the release artifacts built as part of our pipeline.</p>
<p>I understand is that you want to use a different Rust version. You have a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>rustup override set &lt;version&gt;</code></li>
<li>Use a toolchain override shorthand <code>cargo +stable</code></li>
<li>Use the <code>RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN</code></li>
<li>Delete the <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use any rust version that's compatible with our MSRV (1.84 today). It can be newer or older than the version in our <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code> but it can't be older than the MSRV.</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<p>Hmm, have you considered adopting the latest &amp; greatest primarily in nightly CI builds to get early feedback on new stuff but move the upstream dependency on a slower pace to essentially not &quot;test in production&quot; and by production means all local dev setups? Kinda what Fedora Rawhide is for and commonly consumed in projects' CIs.</p>

<p>Our use case is actually quite different (ties to <code>cargo vendor</code>, not important), but yes, the result is the same. We work in the secure software supply chain field with a strong compliance with the strictest <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/">SLSA</a> levels which, among other things, means that builds are network-isolated, hence no rustup updates (also no rustup package). The other major factor (as if network isolation weren't enough :) ) is strict provenance, to put it simply - consuming packages via source tarballs is preferred over binaries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a toolchain override shorthand cargo +stable
Use the RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN
Delete the rust-toolchain.toml</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may actually consider some of ^this, thanks for the pointer, I admit I didn't pay thorough attention when reading https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html before dropping a comment on this PR. That said, if you say that <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code> is for development and to consume optimizations early for your binary artifacts, would you consider excluding the file from the Python sdist since based on the premise (and based on your backwards compatibility claim) it's irrelevant to have it there for released packages.</p>
