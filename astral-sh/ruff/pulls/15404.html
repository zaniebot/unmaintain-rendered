<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The recent release of Pygments (<a href="https://github.com/pygments/pygments/releases/tag/2.19.1">2.19.1</a>) allows the pinned version to be removed as the PYI alias for Python syntax highlighting has been removed.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Follow the steps outlined in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#mkdocs to get the documentation site running locally.</li>
<li>Spot test rules pages that have PYI code blocks to ensure that syntax highlighting remains e.g. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/ruff/rules/complex-if-statement-in-stub/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/ruff/rules/complex-if-statement-in-stub/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am unable to test the insiders build but would assume that it functions locally as I do not have access to MkDocs Insiders, but I would like to assume that it functions in the same way as the non-insiders build.</p>
