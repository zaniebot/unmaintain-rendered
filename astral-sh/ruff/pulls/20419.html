<p>Prior to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/25c13ea91c7535f14bda2d23595fa3ba311752fe, the walltime benchmarks CI job took around 10-11 minutes. It now seems to be taking around 17-18 minutes to complete, which is a pretty major slowdown and somewhat annoying if you're waiting for benchmark results on a PR! See e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/17738649543/job/50411336184</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think @silamon is on to something. Codspeed now enables perf profiles for wallspeed benchmarks (you now see a flamegraph for walltime benchmarks too). I can't say just yet if they'll be useful or if our flamegraphs are too large but it's certainly nice to have more than just: It got slower or faster</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/ruff/branches/alex%2Fsubtyping-between-protocols?runnerMode=WallTime has some flamegraphs for https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20368#issuecomment-3292968246 but I don't find them useful personally. The regression in CI time is very significant, however; I'm finding it very frustrating waiting for CI to finish on #20368!</p>
