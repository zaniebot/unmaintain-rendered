<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Found a comment that looks to be intended as docstring but accidentally is just a normal comment.</p>
<p>Didn't create an issue as the readme said it's not neccessary for trivial changes.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Can be tested by regenerating the docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that I specifically didn't make changes like this when I vendored <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/annotate-snippets-rs/blob/32dc46465e7b76295a3dc29c3e89b3e3f9f936aa/src/renderer/mod.rs#L100-L101">upstream <code>annotate-snippets</code></a> in order to minimize the diff with upstream as much as possible. Otherwise, there is a lot I would have changed and fixed up in the vendored code. :-)</p>
