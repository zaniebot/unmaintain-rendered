            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11724#issuecomment-2148183543</p>
<p>Code from the linked issue that produces instable formatting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
'''


'''
</code></pre>
<p>This turned out to be something entirely different than I expected.
I initially thought that it was an issue with the docstring rendering, which uses <code>trim</code> instead of <code>PythonWhitespace::trim</code>.
But I learned the better when I compared the generated IR for the above snippet and the same snippet but with <code>\u{15}</code> (the non visible character in the snippet above) with <code>a</code>.
Both snippets generate the same IR! That means this is a bug in the <code>Printer</code> and not in the Python formatter.</p>
<p>It turns out that the fix is relatively simple.</p>
<p>The <code>Printer</code> omits <code>hard_line_break</code> IR elements or only renders a single <code>\n</code> for a <code>empty_line</code> IR elements when the
current line is all empty. The problem is that the <code>Printer</code> uses the line width to determine if the line is empty.
However, using the line width here isn't correct because a line can be non-empty but has a zero width if it only consists of zero-width characters, which is exactly what we have in the reported instability.</p>
<p>I considered removing this behavior but we rely heavily on it in <code>suite.rs</code> and I'm not going to touch this to fix this bug!
So what I did instead is to change the <code>Printer</code> to keep track of the start of the current line and test if the current formatted line is empty.</p>
<p>I don't suspect that this changes performance much because it only adds a single write after a newline character. Testing whether the line gets a bit more expensive
because it now needs to dereference into the buffer, but I think in total, this is just noise.</p>
<p>And I was wrong lol. THis has a huge perf impact. Let's see if I can do better</p>
<h2>Backwards compatibility</h2>
<p>It's hard to be a 100% sure, but I'm confident that it doesn't have widespread impact because zero-width characters are rare, even more so zero-width lines only consisting of zero-width characters.</p>
<p>The only zero-width character that Python allows outside strings and comments is the form-feed character. Ruff does not preserve line-feed characters except in suppressed ranges. The existing implementation used a work-around to avoid this very specific printer behavior. This PR allows to remove the work around and the tests keep passing.</p>
<p>For strings, we write the entire string content as a single text, preserving line breaks as is.</p>
<p>For comments: That's the issue discovered here. Existing code would already have the trailing line stripped and reformatting the same code wouldn't insert the trailing line after the zero-width characters line.</p>
<p>So we should be good</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added test. All existing tests keep passing.</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Thanks to @jasikpark for finding the instability and helping me to reproduce the issue.</p>
