Would it be possible to also take `&Expr` in `ForwardReference` and unify the branches or doesn't that work because the expression is created outside the AST an needs to be owned?

I was unable to unify them due to the owned value. For `ForwardReference`, the enum needs to own it while for others we receive it via the AST checker.

Maybe pass `semantic` and `locator` directly, to avoid an additional dependency on `Checker`?

Maybe... `Any`? Or `Object`? Or a special `Unknown` type?

Oh, good point. `Any` or `Object` would make more sense. Adding a new type would require handling it elsewhere so I'm leaning away from it.
