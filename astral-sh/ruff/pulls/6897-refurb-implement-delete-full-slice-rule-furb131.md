---

_@SavchenkoValeriy_

## Summary

This PR is a continuation of #6702 and me replicating `refurb` rules (#1348). It adds support for [FURB131](https://github.com/dosisod/refurb/blob/master/refurb/checks/builtin/no_del.py.

## Test Plan

I included a new test + checked that all other tests pass.
