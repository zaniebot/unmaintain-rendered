### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>ParkMyCar/compact_str (compact_str)</summary>

### [`v0.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#090)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0)

##### February 24, 2025

#### Breaking Changes 💥

-   Removed deprecated methods `CompactString::new_inline(...)` and `CompactString::from_static_str(...)`.
    -   Implemented in [`fix: delete methods that are documented as deprecated in v0.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/429)
-   Changed the `CompactStringExt::join_compact` and `CompactStringExt::concat_compact` to take a
    reference (i.e. `&C`) to a type `C: IntoIterator<Item = &str>` instead of ownership of a type `C`
    where `&C: IntoIterator<Item = &str>`.
    -   Fixed [`issue#412`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/issues/412) which made the
        `CompactStringExt` more ergonomic.
    -   Implemented in [`feat: tweak the CompactStringExt trait so join_compact and concat_compact work better`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/418)

#### Changes

-   Fixed the `borsch` feature in `no_std` environments.
    -   Implemented in [`fix: The borsch feature with no-std`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/428).
-   Implemented the [`zeroize::Zeroize`](https://crates.io/crates/zeroize) trait for `CompactString`.
    -   Implemented in [`feat: Add support for zeroize::Zeroize`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/421).
-   Fixed the `CompactString::retain` method to not set length if the predicate panics.
    -   Implemented in [`fix: retain not set len if predicate panics`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/413).
-   Implement `sqlx::postgres::PgHasArrayType` for `CompactString`.
    -   Implemented in [`impl sqlx::postgres::PgHasArrayType`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/399).
-   Bump the [`markup`](https://crates.io/crates/markup) dependency to `v0.15`.
    -   Implemented in [`deps: upgrade to markup v0.8`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/415).
-   Bump the [`rkyv`](https://crates.io/crates/rkyv) dependency to `v0.8`.
    -   Implemented in [`deps: upgrade to rkyv v0.8`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/409).
-   Bump the [`sqlx`](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx) dependency to `v0.8`.
    -   Implemented in [`deps: upgrade to sqlx v0.8`](https://redirect.github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/408).

### ⚠️ Artifact update problem

Renovate failed to update an artifact related to this branch. You probably do not want to merge this PR as-is.

♻ Renovate will retry this branch, including artifacts, only when one of the following happens:

 - any of the package files in this branch needs updating, or 
 - the branch becomes conflicted, or
 - you click the rebase/retry checkbox if found above, or
 - you rename this PR's title to start with "rebase!" to trigger it manually

The artifact failure details are included below:

##### File name: Cargo.lock

```
Command failed: cargo update --config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true --manifest-path Cargo.toml --package compact_str@0.8.1 --precise 0.9.0
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `compact_str = "^0.8"`
candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.9.0
location searched: crates.io index
required by package `salsa v0.19.0 (https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa.git?rev=095d8b2b8115c3cf8bf31914dd9ea74648bb7cf9#095d8b2b)`
    ... which satisfies git dependency `salsa` (locked to 0.19.0) of package `red_knot v0.0.0 (/tmp/renovate/repos/github/astral-sh/ruff/crates/red_knot)`

```
