# [red-knot] Restructure attribute-access and descriptor-protocol test suites.

---

_@sharkdp_

## Summary

This is a pure restructuring of the `attributes.md` and `descriptor_protocol.md` test suites. They have grown organically and I didn't want to make major structural changes in my recent PR to keep the diff clean.
