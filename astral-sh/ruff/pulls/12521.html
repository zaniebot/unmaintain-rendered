<p>We should also adjust the display for types to include their module name; that&#x27;s not done yet here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does that mean that type narrowing with big int literals won&#x27;t be supported because they always infer to <code>int</code>?</p>
<p>Should we use the parsers <code>Int</code> type?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>LGTM. It would be great if we could extend our benchmark with some more real world code soon. Maybe as a goal for next week? Just so that we know what the &quot;cost&quot; of the changes</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we discussed this when I added the <code>IntLiteral</code> type. We probably can use the parser&#x27;s <code>Int</code> type to support big integers. I think I even tried doing that, but ran into some complexities (I just don&#x27;t remember what they were now.)</p>
<p>This only impacts integer literals outside the i64 range. In my experience these are extremely uncommon (2^63 is a really large number, as you can see in the massive integer literal I added in the test here.) So I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really worth adding complexity or cost to the implementation to support them. Tracking exact literal values of integer types is a best-effort feature anyway; there are many cases where we&#x27;ll just have to fallback to &quot;it&#x27;s an int.&quot; But we can see if it causes anyone problems in practice.</p>
