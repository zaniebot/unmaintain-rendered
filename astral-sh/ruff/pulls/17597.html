            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Protocol classes are abstract and thus cannot be directly instantiated (although concrete subclasses of protocols can be!). This PR adds logic to detect attempts to instantiate them, and report such attempts as diagnostics.</p>
<p>I also factored out some common code from <code>diagnostics.rs</code> into <code>class.rs</code>.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing mdtests updated, and snapshots added.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you sure that it&#x27;s clearest to use the term &quot;abstract&quot; for this? I can see why it&#x27;s not unreasonable, but both mypy and pyright just say &quot;Cannot instantiate protocol class &#x27;MyProtocol&#x27;&quot;. It seems like introducing the term &quot;abstract&quot; might be unnecessary complexity, and evoke only-sort-of-related things like ABCMeta? It just forces us to explain below that inheriting Protocol makes a class &quot;implicitly abstract&quot;, which seems unnecessary when we could just as well say &quot;it inherits Protocol, making it a protocol class, and protocol classes can&#x27;t be instantiated&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, fair point. In my mental model, protocol classes are banned from being instantiated for exactly the same reason that ABCs with abstract methods are banned from being instantiated: both classes represent abstract interfaces to some extent (with the former really just being an extension of the latter in terms of how far you take that idea). But using the term &quot;abstract&quot; probably doesn&#x27;t help our users, who won&#x27;t necessary have the same mental model!</p>
