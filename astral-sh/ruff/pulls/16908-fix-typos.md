_Pull request opened by @InSyncWithFoo on 2025-03-22 02:40_

## Summary

The noun is spelled "descend<strong><em>a</em></strong>nt" and the adjective "descend<strong><em>e</em></strong>nt".

## Test Plan

[From the English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/descendent#Usage_notes):

> The adjective, "descending from a biological ancestor", may be spelt either with an <i>[a](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ant)</i> or with an <i>[e](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ent)</i> in the final syllable (see [descendant](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/descendant)). However, the noun <i>descendant</i>, "one who is the progeny of someone", may be spelt only with an <i>[a](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ant)</i>. Compare also <i>[dependent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dependent#English)</i> and <i>[dependant](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dependant#English)</i>.
