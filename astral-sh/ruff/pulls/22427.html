<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Adds support for <a href="https://github.com/best-doctor/flake8-annotations-complexity">flake8-annotation-complexity</a> as requested by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2323.</p>
<p>As per the disucssion in #2323 the following has been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds TAE002 to mirror <code>flake8-annotations-complexity</code></li>
<li>Ignores <code>typing.Annotated</code> for the purpose of annotation complexity</li>
<li>Considers PEP-604 union syntax as complex as <code>Union</code> (+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before merging, we should round-off any discussion over the formatting of the rules and associated codes. Currently it's adhering to the upstream however we may wish to split this into multiple rules like: <code>complex-argument-type-annotation</code>, <code>complex-return-type-annotation</code>, <code>complex-variable-annotation</code>, and so forth. In this case, we should move these to be under the <code>RUF</code> group instead of adding the <code>TAE</code> group.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<ul>
<li>Added unit tests</li>
<li>Added integration snapshot tests</li>
</ul>
