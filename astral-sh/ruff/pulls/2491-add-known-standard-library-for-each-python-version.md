Can we add a note that this file is autogenerated?

Do we need to add `sphinx` as a dep?

We would have to do the parsing ourselves.
I could do it if you think it is worth it.

Sorry, I meant: should it be added to `pyproject.toml`?

Isort does not have sphinx as a dependency.
I can add it anyway.

But, did you have to install Sphinx for this to work? I'm confused.

It's alright, I can always fix it later if needed.

Yes, I guess they install it manually to run every new Python release.
