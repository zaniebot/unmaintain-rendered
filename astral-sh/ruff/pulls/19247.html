            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, this looks like what I had in mind in #19242. My only hesitations are that this is a bit of a divergence from the upstream linter and also an expansion of the rule. However, I think we might diverge in the general implementation of these rules, and we could gate the expansion behind <code>preview</code> if we&#x27;re worried about that part.</p>
<p>I also think these are probably pretty niche modules to import, so I&#x27;m not sure how much impact this will have either way.</p>
<p>@MichaReiser what do you think? To summarize the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>S412 only flags <code>from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler</code>, not other ways of importing</li>
<li>The upstream linter also flags calls to the insecure code (<code>wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler()</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggested flagging the whole module import (this PR) as an easy fix that looks to be in line with our other S rules, but a more robust fix might be flagging calls like upstream. That could be a bigger change that might also affect our other S rules.</p>

<p>The rule itself is still preview</p>
<p>Hmm not sure. Does the same security concern exist for <code>IISCGIHandler</code>, <code>BaseCGIHandler</code>, <code>SimpleHandler</code>, .... If not, restricting the entire <code>handlers</code> import is too restrictive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The upstream linter also flags calls to the insecure code (wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler())</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should rename the rule if we do so because it then flags the usages and not the imports</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What claude thinks:</p>

I&#x27;ll fetch the specific wsgiref handlers documentation to analyze each handler individually.Based on the wsgiref.handlers documentation and my HTTPoxy research, here&#x27;s a specific analysis of each handler&#x27;s vulnerability status:

<strong>VULNERABLE Handlers:</strong>
<strong>wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler</strong>
<p><strong>VULNERABLE</strong> - This is explicitly mentioned in the HTTPoxy documentation as vulnerable. Python code must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable, and this usually means using wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler. This handler uses <code>sys.stdin</code>, <code>sys.stdout</code>, <code>sys.stderr</code> and <code>os.environ</code>, making it directly susceptible to environment variable pollution from HTTP headers.</p>
<strong>wsgiref.handlers.IISCGIHandler</strong>
<p><strong>VULNERABLE</strong> - This is a specialized subclass of <code>CGIHandler</code> designed for Microsoft&#x27;s IIS web server. Since it inherits from <code>CGIHandler</code> and operates in the same CGI environment where <code>os.environ</code> gets polluted by HTTP headers, it has the same vulnerability.</p>
<strong>wsgiref.handlers.BaseCGIHandler</strong>
<p><strong>VULNERABLE</strong> - This is the base class for CGI handlers that <code>CGIHandler</code> inherits from. The documentation states it&#x27;s &quot;intended for use with software other than HTTP origin servers&quot; and is designed for &quot;gateway protocol implementation (such as CGI, FastCGI, SCGI, etc.)&quot;. Since it operates in CGI-like environments where HTTP headers become environment variables, it&#x27;s vulnerable.</p>
<strong>NOT VULNERABLE Handlers:</strong>
<strong>wsgiref.handlers.SimpleHandler</strong>
<p><strong>NOT VULNERABLE</strong> - The documentation specifically states this is &quot;designed for use with HTTP origin servers&quot; and &quot;If you are writing an HTTP server implementation, you will probably want to subclass this instead of BaseCGIHandler.&quot; Since regular WSGI environments keep user-supplied values in a separate WSGI &#x27;environ&#x27; map, they are not vulnerable. The os.environ[&#x27;HTTP_PROXY&#x27;] remains unchanged when a Proxy header is sent.</p>
<strong>wsgiref.handlers.BaseHandler</strong>
<p><strong>NOT VULNERABLE</strong> - This is an abstract base class for running WSGI applications. It&#x27;s designed for HTTP origin servers, not CGI environments. The documentation shows it maintains separate environment handling and doesn&#x27;t directly expose <code>os.environ</code> to HTTP header pollution.</p>
<strong>Key Distinction:</strong>
<p>The vulnerability comes down to whether the handler operates in a <strong>CGI environment</strong> where:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP headers are mixed into environment variables</li>
<li><code>os.environ[&#x27;HTTP_PROXY&#x27;]</code> can be set by a malicious <code>Proxy:</code> header</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CGI-based handlers</strong> (CGIHandler, IISCGIHandler, BaseCGIHandler) are vulnerable because they operate in environments where this header-to-environment variable mapping occurs.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP origin server handlers</strong> (SimpleHandler, BaseHandler) are not vulnerable because they maintain proper separation between HTTP headers and environment variables, keeping user-supplied data in separate WSGI environ dictionaries.</p>


<p>So I think outright banning the package isn&#x27;t the right fix.</p>

<p>:facepalm: My mistake, didn&#x27;t notice that</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/252e2f710ea376a38c4545dd758e03d331c1eaad/Lib/wsgiref/handlers.py#L487-L508">implementation</a> of <code>BaseCGIHandler</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class BaseCGIHandler(SimpleHandler):
    origin_server = False
</code></pre>
<p>but I guess the <code>origin_server</code> might make all the difference. I&#x27;m not too familiar with CGI, so I&#x27;m happy to defer to Claude.</p>
<p>I think we may need to rename and reimplement the rule to catch calls in that case. I suspect, but still haven&#x27;t confirmed, that this is the case for the other <code>flake8-bandit</code> rules too.</p>
