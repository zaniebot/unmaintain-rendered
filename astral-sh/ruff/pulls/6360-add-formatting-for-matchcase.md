Otherwise, the node level is `NodeLevel::TopLevel` for the `case` nodes which is coming from the match statement. This will be problematic as the empty lines between case nodes should be at max 1.

These parentheses are preserved in black as well.

Oh actually, even if the line length is more than 88, this adds the parentheses thus not breaking on multiple lines. I'll have to look into it as using `Parenthesize::IfRequired` isn't correct because otherwise the parentheses in this example won't be preserved.

_Review comment by @konstin on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/resources/test/fixtures/ruff/statement/match.py`:90 on 2023-08-11 09:30_

Does it make sense to add the following test case already?
```python
   case ( # a
        "case with comments" # b
        # c
    ):
        pass
```

Not really that useful atm as everything between (and including) the parentheses will get formatted into `NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED_Pattern`.

This is solved. The heuristic is that if the expression already had parentheses, preserve that otherwise don't do anything even if it goes beyond the line length.

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/other/match_case.rs`:40 on 2023-08-11 12:20_

Preserving parentheses should be the default behavior if you call `expression.format()`. 

```suggestion
           guard.format().fmt(f)?
```

Or you can use `Parenthesize::Optional` if it should use the same breaking logic as other expressions: e.g. that `case a if a == [1, 2, 3]` doesn't add parentheses and instead breaks after the `[`.

---

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/tests/snapshots/format@statement__match.py.snap`:195 on 2023-08-11 12:23_

You may want to use `Parenthesize::Optional` which preserves Parentheses. Whether you want to use `guard.format()` or `maybe_parenthesize` depends on if parentheses should always be added if they don't fit on the line or only if they don't bring their own parentheses (`e.g. [a, b, c, d]` doesn't need addtional parentheses because it has its own). 

I would expect it to be `maybe_parenthesize` because it is used in all positions where expressions are formatted inside a statement.

Ok, thanks! Regarding your example, black have the same behavior where it breaks after `[` instead of parenthesizing the expression.

`Parenthesize::Optional` would break the expression into multiple lines which black doesn't do:

```python
match long_lines:
    case "this is a long line for if condition" if aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh == 1 and bbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaa == 2:  # comment
        pass
```

Running black on the above snippet wouldn't give any difference but if we use `Optional`, then we parenthesize the `if` expression:

```python
match long_lines:
    case NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED_Pattern if (
        aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh == 1 and bbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaa == 2
    ):  # comment
        pass
```
