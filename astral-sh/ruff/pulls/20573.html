            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Currently we have lots of tests for subtyping and assignability where one type is nominal and the other type is a protocol type. However, we have few tests for subtyping/assignability between two types where both types are protocols, which is a different code path. This PR adds that missing test coverage.</p>
<p>Specifically, this PR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds missing tests for subtyping/assignability between two protocols with attribute members</li>
<li>Adds missing tests for subtyping/assignability between two protocols with <code>@property</code> members</li>
<li>Adds missing tests for subtyping/assignability between two protocols with method members</li>
<li>Adds missing tests for subtyping/assignability (in both directions) between two protocols where one has a method member and the other has a <code>@property</code> member</li>
<li>Adds missing tests for subtyping/assignability (in both directions) between two protocols where one has a method member and the other has an attribute member</li>
<li>Adds missing tests for subtyping/assignability (in both directions) between two protocols where one has an attribute member and the other has a <code>@property</code> member</li>
<li>Fixes some pre-existing bugs in our tests for protocols with <code>@property</code> members</li>
<li>Adds regression tests for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1089">astral-sh/ty#1089</a></li>
