# Rename `ruff_linter::Diagnostic` to `OldDiagnostic`

---

Summary
--

It's a bit late in the refactoring process, but I think there are still a couple of PRs left before getting rid of this type entirely, so I thought it would still be worth doing.

This PR is just a quick rename with no other changes.
