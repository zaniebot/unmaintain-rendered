You are welcome!

What is the practice followed with the branch?
Should I delete it or do I leave it for reference?

You're welcome to do with it whatever you wish (it's your branch, not ours! :-)

That said, _most_ people delete a branch once the associated pull request has been merged, just to keep their forks tidy.
