### [`v1.3.2`](https://redirect.github.com/squirrelchat/smol-toml/releases/tag/v1.3.2)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/squirrelchat/smol-toml/compare/5ed3ead57e7cff51ecd1543c4dc6a8e0825458bd...v1.3.2)

Fixes the issue reported in [#&#8203;37](https://redirect.github.com/squirrelchat/smol-toml/issues/37) -- the library would fail to parse a document containing a one-line string, with an escaped double-quote, preceded by an escaped backslash, such as `key = "value \\\" value"`.

*Apologies for the lack of proper v1.3.1 tag; this release addressed GHSA-pqhp-25j4-6hq9 by adding a maximum depth while parsing.*

Additionally, releases are now published to NPM with [provenance attestations](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)

##### What's Changed

-   fix: improve string end detection when preceded by an escaped backslash by [@&#8203;cyyynthia](https://redirect.github.com/cyyynthia)
-   fix: enforce maximum depth when parsing/stringifying by [@&#8203;cyyynthia](https://redirect.github.com/cyyynthia)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/squirrelchat/smol-toml/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.2
