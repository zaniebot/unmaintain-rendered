            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The plan I have right now (I need to implement):</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the information about which imports are faulty to figure out which import members exist and track them (e.g. <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> in <code>from X import Y, Z</code>)</li>
<li>Change the original import to not be faulty</li>
<li>Add an AST checker that gets triggered and finds which members are now out of scope [sub-step: ensure that the members are NOT just variables with the same name)</li>
<li>Ensure that the out-of-scope members are now fully qualified</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it&#x27;s likely that this may &quot;false-fix&quot; certain things with complex variable assignments with the same name as the module (bad practice but may exist), any ideas on that?</p>
