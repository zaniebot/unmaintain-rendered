            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I initially split the lifetime out into three distinct lifetimes on
near-instinct because I moved the struct into the public API. But
because they are all shared borrows, and because there are no other APIs
on <code>DisplayDiagnostic</code> to access individual fields (and probably never
will be), it's probably fine to just specify one lifetime. Because of
subtyping, the one lifetime will be the shorter of the three.</p>
<p>There's also the point that <code>ruff_db</code> isn't <em>really</em> a public API, since
it isn't a library that others depend on. So my instinct is probably a
bit off there.</p>
