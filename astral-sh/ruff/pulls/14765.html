<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Airflow 3.0 removes various deprecated functions, members, modules, and other values. They have been deprecated in 2.x, but the removal causes incompatibilities that we want to detect. This PR deprecates the following names.</p>
<ul>
<li>in <code>DAG</code><ul>
<li><code>sla_miss_callback</code> was removed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in <code>airflow.operators.trigger_dagrun.TriggerDagRunOperator</code><ul>
<li><code>execution_date</code> was removed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in <code>airflow.operators.weekday.DayOfWeekSensor</code>, <code>airflow.operators.datetime.BranchDateTimeOperator</code> and <code>airflow.operators.weekday.BranchDayOfWeekOperator</code><ul>
<li><code>use_task_execution_day</code> was removed in favor of  <code>use_task_logical_date</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of rules we will extend https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44556</p>
