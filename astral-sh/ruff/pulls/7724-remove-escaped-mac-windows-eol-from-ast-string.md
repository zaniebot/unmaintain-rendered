# Remove escaped mac/windows eol from AST string value

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-09-30 19:06_

## Summary

This PR fixes the bug where the value of a string node type includes the escaped mac/windows newline character.

Note that the token value still includes them, it's only removed when parsing the string content.

## Test Plan

Add new test cases for the string node type to check that the escapes aren't being included in the string value.

fixes: #7723

What about \r with no \n after it? That’s also a valid newline pattern.

It's also covered here. We'll match on \r and peek to see if it's followed by \n and if so we'll skip that character.
