# Remove triple-quoted string ranges computation

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-09-18 07:00_

## Summary

This is a follow-up PR for #7435 to remove the now unused triple-quoted string
ranges from the indexer.

> From https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7325#issuecomment-1720728203:
>
> [...] Except if we plan to to re-use the multiline-string ranges for `add-noqa` as well:

Micha raised a point about it but I don't think that's going to be a problem as
it was never used in `add-noqa` in the first place. In the context of f-string
we would actually be using the f-string ranges instead as even single-quoted
f-string can be multi-line.
