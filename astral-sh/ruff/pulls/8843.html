Summary
<p>This PR is part of #970, it adds the <code>W9011</code> error rule.</p>
<p>The rule checks that a return documentation is part of the docstring for functions that return something.
Exactly how the docstring is checked depends on the setting <code>pylint.convention</code>, which can take the same values as <code>pydocstyle.convention</code> (Google, NumPy, or Pep257). The Pep257 option checks for reST style docstrings.</p>
Test Plan
<p>The example from <a href="https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/warning/missing-return-doc.html">pylint documentation</a> is used, and extended to cover more cases.</p>

<p>~Should we avoid raising this for code with a return of <code>None</code>? There are a lot of cases in the ecosystem checks where a return would be meaningless.~ It looks like you implemented this, actually. Could you take a look at the ecosystem checks and see if they are false positives or correct? This rule is introducing <em>a lot</em> of violations.</p>

<p>I looked through the ecosystem checks and most violations are true positives. Since this rule only checks for docstrings following reST, some violations are for <a href="https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/blob/594c12ad5230522a12008445217e71726cc60611/disnake/abc.py#L1803">following other documentation styles</a>.</p>
<p>The only case I would consider potentially problematic is that <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4495de73bc8ede5717e631942477384655a4ce0d/airflow/api/auth/backend/kerberos_auth.py#L105">private functions are not ignored</a>. I&#x27;m not quite sure what the best behavior would be in that case, on one hand it makes sense to document private functions too, but on the other hand, private functions are internal affairs where a bit more leeway can be given.</p>
<p>Do you have an opinion on what would be preferable in this case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given the number of projects that opt-in to PLW without using reST docstrings, I&#x27;m a little worried about adding this rule. Perhaps there&#x27;s a way we can shrink the scope to only effect projects using that docstring style? Maybe there&#x27;s a pattern in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/017e82911595bab746172b7976f993b715be4d79/crates/ruff_linter/src/checkers/ast/analyze/definitions.rs that we should follow?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Turns out the pylint rule ignores private functions, so let&#x27;s ignore them here as well.</p>
<p>Regarding this only applying to reST docstrings:
An easier solution might be to include support for Google and Numpy styles as well. Pylint does support those docstring styles, but the examples are only with reST docstrings.</p>

<p>That sounds reasonable. However, I think that is out of scope for this PR (and should probably be handled by someone with more contributing experience than me).</p>
<p>Would it be reasonable to simply re-use the pydocstyle convention setting with an additional way to specify it in <code>[tool.ruff.lint.pylint]</code>? If I understand the code correctly, one could still specify different conventions in pydocstyle and pylint (although I don&#x27;t see why anyone would do that!)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Implemented an option <code>pylint.convention</code> that allows setting the docstring convention. If unset, the rule doesn&#x27;t check anything, which might be a more sane default than checking all conventions.</p>
<p>Should eliminate any ecosystem violations since they would have to opt-in to the rule by setting the convention. This also brings the behavior slightly closer to that of pylint, which requires an explicit flag to check docstrings.</p>
<p>I still think the convention should be a general setting, but since that would involve deprecation of the current pydocstyle convention setting, it&#x27;s out of scope here and probably should have it&#x27;s own issue with discussion first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for creating this PR and sorry for the long time it has taken us to move this forward.</p>
<p>We are holding off from adding any new Pylint extension rules until #1774 . The reason for is that using pylint extension rules in pylint requires explicit opt-in. This would be different when using Ruff where the rule would automatically be enabled when you use the <code>PYL</code> selector (or <code>ALL</code> for what it matters). The alternative is to mirror Pylint&#x27;s approach, where we create a new group for each extension, but we would rather not do that because it doesn&#x27;t reflect what rule groups are intended for.</p>
<p>That means we can&#x27;t accept the rule right now, even though I think the rule itself would be useful. Our goal is to have a better place for this kind of rules once #1774.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry for giving that feedback so late, and I plan to go through open issues (especially the pylint one) to flag rules ahead of time. Thank you again or taking the time to contribute to Ruff.</p>
