# Rename `FixKind` to `FixAvailability`

---

_@konstin_

**Summary** `FixKind` feels to generic, i suggest renaming it to something like `FixAvailibility`.

Commands used:

```bash
rg FixKind --files-with-matches | xargs sed -i 's/FixKind/FixAvailability/g'
rg fix_kind --files-with-matches | xargs sed -i 's/fix_kind/fix_availability/g'
rg FIX_KIND --files-with-matches | xargs sed -i 's/FIX_KIND/FIX_AVAILABILITY/g'
cargo fmt
```

`rg -i "fix.kind"` doesn't show any matches anymore.

I think this is more akin to "availability" -- it's an indicator of how often the rule is fixable, which is separate from the confidence of the fix itself which is the `Applicability`.

Looks like a typo in `Violation::FIX_AVAILIBITYd` (which was already present before, but worth fixing).
