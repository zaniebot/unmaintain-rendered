### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>rayon-rs/rayon (rayon)</summary>

### [`v1.11.0`](https://redirect.github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/blob/HEAD/RELEASES.md#Release-rayon-1110--rayon-core-1130-2025-08-12)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/compare/v1.10.0...v1.11.0)

- The minimum supported `rustc` is now 1.80.
- `iter::repeatn` has been renamed to `iter::repeat_n` to match the name
  stabilized in the standard library. The old name still exists as a deprecated
  function for compatibility.
- Fixed a bug in `in_place_scope` when the default global registry uses the
  current thread, like on WebAssembly without threading support.
- `binary_heap::Iter` no longer requires a temporary allocation.
- Relaxed trait bounds on many of the public structs.
- Implemented `IntoParallelIterator for Box<[T]>` and its references.
- Implemented `FromParallelIterator<_> for Box<str>` via `String`.
