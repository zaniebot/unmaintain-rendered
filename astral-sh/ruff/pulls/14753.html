            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR is related to #13778 and updates the return type of <code>parse_identifier</code> in the parser to return a result-like structure where both <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code> variant uses an <code>Identifier</code>. The type of the variant will indicate the type of <code>ExprContext</code> to use by the caller.</p>
<p>Previously, the <code>ctx</code> field on <code>ExprName</code> would only be set to <code>Invalid</code> when the identifier itself was invalid or missing. But, in case a keyword was found, then it would still set it to <code>Load</code> / <code>Store</code>. This becomes problematic because red knot will start displaying diagnostics for unresolved reference:</p>
<pre><code># Name `pass` used when not defined
for x in pass:
	pass
</code></pre>
<p>This PR resolves that by setting the <code>Invalid</code> context even in those scenarios so that the semantic model will avoid recording a use of this &quot;keyword as identifier&quot;.</p>
Test Plan

<p>The downside of doing this will be that Red Knot won&#x27;t be able to offer a refactoring to rename all uses of <code>pass</code> in identifier positions to a non-keyword name.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For example, typescript reports two diagnostics for:</p>
<pre><code>if (let &gt; 0) {

}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>    Identifier expected. &#x27;let&#x27; is a reserved word in strict mode.
    Cannot find name &#x27;let&#x27;.
</code></pre>
<p>Which I think is correct because I can now use the editor features to find all references to <code>let</code> or even jump to its definition and rename the variable and all its references using the rename refactor.</p>

<p>Ok, I think that might be useful.</p>
<p>For context, I remember we discussed this in our 1:1 but I made this change quite a while ago. When I wrote some tests in #14754, I saw those unresolved reference diagnostics which I didn&#x27;t find helpful.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll close this for now, we can revisit if there&#x27;s any requirement.</p>
