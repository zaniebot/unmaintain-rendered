# Format implicit string continuation

## Summary

This Branch adds support for formatting implicit string continuations. We could probably come up with something faster that combines the `preferred_quote` with the detection of implicit continuation but I don't think that it's worth optimizing just yet. 

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan

I added new unit tests because black's test suite has not a single implicit continuation. 

I ran the stability check against the cpython project.

It seems that `StmtExpr` is the only one where we don't want to break string continuations. So I added an explicit exclude.

What's flat string layout?

Not for this PR, but i like the way black reflow implicit concatenations in the preview style

_Review comment by @konstin on `crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/stmt_expr.rs`:14 on 2023-06-26 08:27_

Using implicit concatenations on statement level feels strange to me, do we have any examples of that in the wild

Yeah me too. We should be able to implement it using the `fill` IR

Hmm I don't know. Is there a good way finding this out using your scripts? This was probably the hardest part of this PR (figuring out the rule when this is happening), which is why I would prefer not removing it until we're sure that we don't need it. I could add a TODo to experiment removing it once we have a ecosystem check in place.
