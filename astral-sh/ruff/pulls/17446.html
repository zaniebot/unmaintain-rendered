            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>We currently have special-casing that avoids false positives for <code>typing.Protocol</code>, but the special-casing doesn&#x27;t currently recognise <code>typing_extensions.Protocol</code> as also being a valid class base, etc. Due to various bugfixes and performance optimisations having been backported via typing_extensions, <code>typing_extensions.Protocol</code> is a different symbol to <code>typing.Protocol</code> on most Python versions: it would be wrong for us to infer <code>Literal[True]</code> as the result of the expression <code>typing_extensions.Protocol is typing.Protocol</code>, for example. Nonetheless, they should be treated identically by a type checker in terms of their semantics. This PR implements that.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing mdtests have been updated to reflect that we no longer issue false-positive diagnostics on classes inheriting from <code>typing_extensions.Protocol</code>.</p>

<p>This shows the cost of treating the symbols <code>typing_extensions.Protocol</code> and <code>typing.Protocol</code> as inhabiting distinct types: if they were understood by us as inhabiting exactly the same type, then we wouldn&#x27;t infer a union type for the <code>Protocol</code> symbol <a href="https://github.com/konradhalas/dacite/blob/9898ccbb783e7e6a35ae165e7deb9fa84edfe21c/dacite/data.py#L1-L4">here</a>, so we wouldn&#x27;t emit that diagnostic. I think instead of my current approach, I&#x27;ll switch to treating them as inhabiting exactly the same type, but rework some of the logic around <code>KnownInstanceType</code> so that we no longer assume a type is a singleton type if it&#x27;s a <code>KnownInstanceType</code>. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily hold true if the symbol could originate from either <code>typing</code> or <code>typing_extensions</code>.</p>
