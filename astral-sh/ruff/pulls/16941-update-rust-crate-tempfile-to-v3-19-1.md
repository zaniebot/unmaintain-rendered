### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>Stebalien/tempfile (tempfile)</summary>

### [`v3.19.1`](https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#3191)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/compare/v3.19.0...v3.19.1)

-   Don't unlink temporary files immediately on Windows (fixes [#&#8203;339](https://redirect.github.com/Stebalien/tempfile/issues/339)). Unfortunately, this seemed to corrupt the file object (possibly a Windows kernel bug) in rare cases and isn't strictly speaking necessary.
