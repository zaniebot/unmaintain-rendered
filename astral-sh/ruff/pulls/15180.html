<p><code>quoted-type-alias</code> (<code>TC008</code>) can be applied more liberally for annotated type aliases defined inside a <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> block.</p>
<p>This also disables <code>TC008</code> in stub files, since that use-case is already covered by <code>quoted-annotation-in-stub</code> (<code>PYI020</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alright, this is a little too liberal right now. I had my suspicions.</p>
<p>I'll go more conservative and only remove the subscript/attribute exception. Recursive type aliases should also result in TC008 in a typing only context, but it might be too much work to carve out that exception.</p>

<p>Do you have any references that I could read why it is okay to apply TC008 more eagerly in typing only context? Having a more detailed explanation might also be useful for users reading the Changelog</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The exceptions TC008 currently carves out for attribute and subscript access only are there because some types will only be subscriptable at type checking time (E.g. a class is made generic in a <code>pyi</code> file, but the class in the corresponding <code>py</code> file is not generic, so it can't be subscripted at runtime) and some attributes will be internal to the stubs (E.g. convenience type aliases like <code>webob.request._FieldStorageWithFile</code>, if you import <code>webob.request</code> and access the attribute as <code>webob.request._FieldStorageWithFile</code> at runtime, it will be a <code>NameError</code>).</p>
<p>Neither of these cases are relevant in typing only contexts like type checking blocks or stub files. Since they will never be evaluated by CPython, only by static analysis tools, which includes most if not all runtime type checkers. So we only really need to adhere to what type checkers consider correct.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As for references. I don't think this is something that's explicitly specced out anywhere, except maybe in some specific type checker's documentation. These are just some nuances/heuristics I have learned over the course of many hundreds of hours of working with mypy and to some degree pyright and pytype via typeshed contributions.</p>
<p>Once ruff performs deeper analysis it might be possible to detect some of these errors without having to carve out large sweeping exceptions like these two. Although it would involve analyzing both the stubs and the actual source for modules with external stubs.</p>

<p>I was interested whether this would impact runtime type checkers but it seems they replace all types declared in <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks with <code>Any</code> (<a href="https://typeguard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html#notes-on-forward-reference-handling">source</a>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But that's getting out of scope, since it has nothing to do with execution context. I'll create a follow-up PR for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this PR <em>introduce</em> a false positive that you then plan to fix in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15201? Or does this false positive that you identify here already exist on <code>main</code>?</p>
<p>If the former, then I think the false positive should be fixed in this PR, because otherwise there's a chance that we review and merge this PR, then look at your other PR, decide it's not the correct fix, and we're stuck with a false positive on <code>main</code> for a prolonged period of time. But if the latter, then I'm happy for things to be split into two PRs, as you've done :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This preview rule seems to already overlap with our stable rule <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/quoted-annotation-in-stub/"><code>PYI020</code></a>. If you run <code>uvx ruff check --select=PYI,TC --preview</code> on this snippet saved as a <code>.pyi</code> file, you already get two diagnostics (one from PYI20, one from TC008) using the latest version of Ruff:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">type Y = &quot;list[str]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This PR makes the problem worse; with this PR branch, running <code>cargo run -- check foo.pyi --select=TC,PYI --preview --no-cache</code> means that the problem is extended to old-style type aliases. Now we get duplicate diagnostics on this as well in a stub-file context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import TypeAlias

X: TypeAlias = &quot;list[str]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>We'll need to decide how to resolve the overlap between the two rules before we can consider stabilising <code>TC008</code>. I think PYI020` is likely to be a rule that stub authors will already have enabled (since it's already stable, and since the whole category is focussed on writing better stubs), so my instinct is to say that it would be best if TC008 did not emit any lints at all regarding stub files. That feels like the way of resolving the overlap between the rules that will be least disruptive to users.</p>
<p>This is obviously not a perfect solution. In an ideal world, I think we'd have a single rule (probably <code>TC008</code>) that just adjusted its behaviour depending on whether it was analyzing a stub file or a runtime file (what you're doing now). Perhaps that's something we could do as part of rule recategorisation. As it stands, however, this would require deprecating PYI020. That feels unnecessarily disruptive to me, considering that it's a stable rule with no known problems in its implementation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood Maybe this means we want to disable TC010 in stubs as well. Although the overlap there should be much smaller, if there is one. It only seems to apply to type expressions that are contained within value expressions, like a <code>cast</code> or a generic subscript in the rhs of an assignment or a function default. And it's also possible that PYI020 doesn't apply in that specific context, so there isn't actually any overlap.</p>

<p>@AlexWaygood Maybe this means we want to disable TC010 in stubs as well. Although the overlap there should be much smaller, if there is one. It only seems to apply to type expressions that are contained within value expressions, like a <code>cast</code> or a generic subscript in the rhs of an assignment or a function default. And it's also possible that PYI020 doesn't apply in that specific context, so there isn't actually any overlap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PYI020 bans all quotes in all type expressions in stubs (with very narrow exceptions for <code>Literal</code> and <code>Annotated</code>), so yes, it looks like there's overlap there as well, which we should fix.</p>
