            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/22683</p>
<p>The rule skipped annotated assignments without a value. This seems an unintentional change that was introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8634. This PR re-enables detecting duplicated class fields where a later declaration is an annotated assignment without a value.</p>
<p>We might have to preview gate this change if there are many ecosystem hits. Although I doubt that, given that this is unlikely very common.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added regression test.</p>
