            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR tweaks Ruff's internal usage of the new diagnostic model to more closely
match the intended use, as I understand it. Specifically, it moves the fix/help
suggestion from the primary annotation's message to a subdiagnostic. In turn, it
adds the secondary/noqa code as the new primary annotation message. As shown in
the new <code>ruff_db</code> tests, this more closely mirrors Ruff's current diagnostic
output.</p>
<p>I also added <code>Severity::Help</code> to render the fix suggestion with a <code>help:</code> prefix
instead of <code>info:</code>.</p>
<p>These changes don't have any external impact now but should help a bit with #19415.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>New full output format tests in <code>ruff_db</code></p>
<h2>Rendered Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Full diagnostic output from <code>annotate-snippets</code> in this PR:</p>
<pre><code>error[unused-import]: `os` imported but unused
  --&gt; fib.py:1:8
   |
 1 | import os
   |        ^^
   |
 help: Remove unused import: `os`
</code></pre>
<p>Current Ruff output for the same code:</p>
<pre><code>fib.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
  |
1 | import os
  |        ^^ F401
  |
  = help: Remove unused import: `os`
</code></pre>
<p>Proposed final output after #19415:</p>
<pre><code>F401 [*] `os` imported but unused
  --&gt; fib.py:1:8
   |
 1 | import os
   |        ^^
   |
 help: Remove unused import: `os`
</code></pre>
<p>These are slightly updated from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19464#issuecomment-3097377634 below to remove the extra noqa codes in the primary annotation messages for the first and third cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not coming up with much to do about the perf regression. At first I thought using a <code>SmallVec</code> for the subdiagnostics might help, as I think we discussed briefly before, but that made things slightly worse. Looking at the flamegraphs on codspeed, the difference is just from the extra <code>IntoDiagnosticMessage</code>/<code>Display</code> call rather than any <code>Vec</code> allocations.</p>

<p>It's not clear to me if this is indeed better. I find the code mostly redudant as it's already rendered in the diagnostic summary. But it's hard to judge from the changes in this PR. Can you show how the full diagnostic rendering is changing and what you propose to be the final rendering?</p>

<p><code>note</code> might also be useful in some situations, but <code>help</code> would I think be perfect for things like this, where we're trying to steer the user directly towards a potential solution:</p>

<p>The main difference from the current Ruff diagnostic is that the filename is on the second line, and the main/only difference from current ty diagnostics is <code>F401 [*]</code> replacing <code>error[unused-import]</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe it was a bad idea to split this out from #19415 since the final product is a combination of the two. I just thought it might be a little easier to do this mostly-internal rearrangement separately.</p>

<p>I think the repeated <code>F401</code> makes ltitle sense. It also prevents any lint to set a more specific message for the primary annotation (which is a very prominent and useful message!).</p>
<p>Keeping <code>suggestion</code> as a sub diagnostic does make sense to me</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I see what you mean, but this isn't necessarily Ruff-specific, unless we think we would store the fix suggestion in a different part of the <code>Diagnostic</code> for ty (or not have &quot;fix suggestions&quot; in the same way). I can definitely add a note about this only currently being used by Ruff, if that would help, or rename it anyway.</p>
<p>The only other ambiguous method that I saw was <code>Diagnostic::body</code>, which is just an alias for <code>Diagnostic::primary_message</code>. It might help to delete that one now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the method is misleading because the first sub diagnostic isn't guaranteed to always be the fix suggestion. It can also be a second diagnostic that shows a second code frame (e.g. to highlight the definition side of a missing argument).</p>
<p>Overall, <code>Diagnostic</code> is intentionally unstructured to give rules a very flexible framework on how they want to structure their diagnostics and I suspect that we'll move Ruff into a similar direction.</p>
<p>This does raise the question on how we'll handle <code>suggestions</code> in the output formats that currently emit them as a separate field. We may need a different way to mark those.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This discussion makes me realize that we'll need to rework the cache before Ruff can make use of the new <code>Diagnostic</code> features. The cache only stores exactly the fields required by <code>ViolationMetadata</code>. This means, any extra field will be lost after deserializing the message again. Instead, what the cache should do is serialize/deserialize the entire <code>Diagnostic</code> as is.</p>
<p>We also need to review all other places where <code>suggestion</code> is used to ensure they don't make any assumption about how a diagnostic is structured.</p>

<p>The only thing I suggest changing is to add a <code>SubDiagnosticSeverity</code> (or similar) which is the same as <code>Severity</code> but it also has a <code>Help</code> variant.</p>
<p>This is a bit annoying but it allows us to skip the decision if we neeed/want a <code>Help</code> severity at the diagnostic level, which we don't need now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It might be helpful to add a comment here explaining that this type was added to represent the additional <code>Help</code> variant that <em>isn't</em> present on <code>Severity</code>. And that, in particular, if we wanted to add <code>Severity::Help</code>, it would be fine to delete this type and move back to one type.</p>
<p>I say this because it clarifies that <code>Help</code> is the only reason for this type's existence, and that there isn't some other need for it. So hopefully it's easier for someone down the line to remove it if we do add <code>Severity::Help</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh good idea. I'll sneak this into #19398 since I haven't merged it yet. Thanks for the reviews!</p>
<p>Let me know if you find anything else. I'll be working in the same area on <code>full</code> output next.</p>
