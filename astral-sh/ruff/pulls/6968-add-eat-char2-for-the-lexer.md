# Add `eat_char2` for the lexer

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-08-29 04:49_

## Summary

This PR adds a new helper method on the `Cursor` called `eat_char2` which is
similar to `eat_char` but accepts 2 characters instead of 1. It'll `bump` the
cursor twice if both characters are found on lookahead.

## Test Plan

`cargo test`
