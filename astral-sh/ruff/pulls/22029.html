<p>I feel like the behavior here is a clear improvement though -- are there major downsides? This seems similar to what Ruff does.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the major downside is that ty&#x27;s behaviour becomes harder to explain to users and reason about. I think the user confusion shown in the issue is pretty good motivation for changing our behaviour -- our behaviour is currently different to pyright&#x27;s, for no clear reason other than that we&#x27;re worried it might be a bit slower. But this doesn&#x27;t really fix that underlying issue -- we still don&#x27;t match pyright&#x27;s behaviour with this change. And with this change, there&#x27;s no longer really any rhyme or reason to which expressions we use deferred lookup for in stubs and which ones we don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>If we just use deferred lookup everywhere for stub files, that will match pyright&#x27;s behaviour, would simplify our code a fair bit, and would be a consistent rule that would be easy to explain to users</p>

I haven&#x27;t checked if this is actually true, but personally I&#x27;d be comfortable with &quot;has the same behavior as Ruff&quot; for these deferrals, since that behavior is also very proven.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(curious for @carljm&#x27;s thoughts here too, especially since it looks like <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22034">astral-sh/ruff#22034</a> does indeed make us more likely to run into cycles...)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m in favor of going ahead with this. Default values are in a gray area where they kinda don&#x27;t belong in a stub file in principle, since they are irrelevant to typing -- but it also can make a lot of sense to put them there for IDE / documentation purposes. And I think there&#x27;s no strong reason not to defer name resolution in them.</p>
<p>I think in practice this PR moves us pretty close to just deferring everywhere (in real-world stub files), because by now we defer almost all cases you are actually likely to see in a stub. So in practice I don&#x27;t suspect it will cause much confusion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think #22034 is probably the right idea in principle, but it means we&#x27;d either need to start ignoring more stuff as a special case in stub files that&#x27;s irrelevant there, change our <code>linter_no_panic</code> tests, or track down some new cycle issues. And none of those seem like high priority things to do right now.</p>
