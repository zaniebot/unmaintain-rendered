            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When poring over traces, the ones that just include a definition or symbol or expression ID aren&#x27;t very useful, because you don&#x27;t know which file it comes from. This adds that information to the trace.</p>
<p>I guess the downside here is that if calling <code>.file(db)</code> on a scope/definition/expression would execute other traced code, it would be marked as outside the span? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a concern, because I don&#x27;t think a simple field access on a tracked struct should ever execute our code. If I&#x27;m wrong and this is a problem, it seems like the tracing crate has this feature where you can record a field as <code>tracing::field::Empty</code> and then fill in its value later with <code>span.record(...)</code>, but when I tried this it wasn&#x27;t working for me, not sure why.</p>
<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot more we can do to make our tracing output more useful for debugging (e.g. record an event whenever a definition/symbol/expression/use id is created with the details of that definition/symbol/expression/use), this is just dipping my toes in the water.</p>

<p>Possibly, but I think it would make the trace output so verbose that it is no longer useful when working on other parts of the code.</p>
