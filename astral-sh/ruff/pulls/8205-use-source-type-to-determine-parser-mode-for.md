# Use source type to determine parser mode for formatting

---

_@dhruvmanila_

## Summary

This PR fixes the bug where if a Notebook contained IPython syntax, then the format command would fail. This was because the correct mode was not being used while parsing through the formatter code path.

## Test Plan

This PR isn't the only requirement for Notebook formatting to start working with IPython escape commands. The following PR in the stack is required as well.

Nit: I'd move the `fixes: #8204` to the PR up the stack so it's easier to trace later
