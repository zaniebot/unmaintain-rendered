            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Further work towards <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14169">astral-sh/ruff#14169</a>.</p>
<p>This adjusts our handling of <code>*</code> imports so that we pay attention to visibility constraints in the external module (the module symbols are being imported from) when we infer the boundness of symbols defined via a <code>*</code> import. I.e., for something like this:</p>
<pre><code>```toml
python-version = &quot;3.9&quot;
```

`a.py`:

```py
import sys

if sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 10):
    X = True
```

`b.py`:

```py
from a import *

print(X)
```
</code></pre>
<p>We will now correctly emit an <code>[unresolved-reference]</code> diagnostic on the use of <code>X</code> in <code>b.py</code>: the visibility constraints in <code>a.py</code> resolve to <code>Truthiness::AlwaysFalse</code>, so no symbols are actually bound in <code>b.py</code> as a result of the <code>*</code> import.</p>
Implementation
<p>When adding each <code>*</code>-import definition to the <code>UseDefMap</code>, we snapshot the <code>SymbolState</code> as it was prior to the <code>*</code> import definition (possibly) overriding any (possible) previous definitions. Then, in <code>symbol::symbol_from_bindings_impl</code>, we evaluate <code>*</code> import definitions to determine the boundness of the symbol in the external module. If the symbol is in fact unbound in the external module (due to visibility constraints resolving to <code>Truthiness::AlwaysFalse</code>), we determine that the <code>*</code> import did not in fact provide an additional binding for this symbol, and in the importing module we fall back to the <code>SymbolState</code> for that symbol prior to the <code>*</code>-import definition.</p>
<p>In order to be able to resolve <code>*</code> imports from <code>symbol.rs</code> as well as from <code>types/infer.rs</code>, several functions are pulled out of <code>infer.rs</code> into a new <code>import_resolution</code> module where they can be accessed from both <code>types/infer.rs</code> and <code>symbol.rs</code>.</p>
Problems with this approach
<p>This approach works well for symbols in the external module that are statically known to either be definitely bound or definitely unbound. But the logic in <code>symbol.rs</code> is still somewhat naive, and doesn&#x27;t work for possibly-unbound definitions in the external module. I&#x27;ve added a failing test in this PR to illustrate the issue: I don&#x27;t know how to fix it properly, and would welcome ideas. In addition to the new failing test, the PR does not address any of these TODOs, and ideally it would:</p>

Test Plan
<p>Existing assertions in mdtests updated; new ones added.</p>

<p>I suspect that the perf regression is mainly due to us inferring more types. You could run the CLI in <code>-vvv</code> and see if the ingredient counts change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice if the tracing calls would be implicit from the API (where infer uses one API and the other call site the other).

</blockquote>
<p>The way I believe this could be implemented is actually a third approach, I think?</p>
<p>The main problem (on <code>main</code>) seems to be that in a situation like the following, we consider <code>X</code> to be definitely overwritten by the star-import:</p>
<pre><code>X = 1

from module import *  # may define X
</code></pre>
<p>This is why you implemented the approach with storing the previous symbol state at the position of the star import, attempting to reinstate it if <code>X</code> is, in fact, not defined in <code>module</code> (given the evaluation of visibility constraints in <code>module</code>).</p>
<p>What if we did the following instead: we treat star-imports similar to a conditional branch. With the difference that we need to fill in the condition at a later point in time. Conceptually, we would replace <code>from module import *</code> with</p>
<pre><code>if &lt;placeholder&gt;:
    X = module.X
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of unconditionally overwriting the previous binding of <code>X</code>, we would keep the previous binding with a visibility constraint of <code>~&lt;placeholder&gt;</code>, and add the new binding &quot;<code>X = module.X</code>&quot; binding with a visibility constraint of <code>&lt;placeholder&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>During type inference, we would replace this placeholder with <code>AlwaysTrue</code> if <code>X</code> is definitely bound in <code>module</code>, with <code>AlwaysFalse</code> if <code>X</code> is definitely unbound in <code>module</code>, and with <code>Ambiguous</code> if <code>X</code> is possibly-bound in <code>module</code>. This replacement would be a TDD traversal, and the placeholders would need to include some information to which star-import they belong.</p>
<p>The advantage of this approach, I think, would be that we would not need the new <code>bindings_at_star_imports</code> field in the use-def map. And after the placeholders have been replaced, <code>symbol_from_bindings</code> should ideally just work as before.</p>
<p>I think it would be similar to Carl&#x27;s flattening suggestion, but the actual operation would be performed by the usual visibility constraints merging in the semantic index builder (those placeholder constraints could be AND-ed and OR-ed with other constraints, it would just be a new atomic constraint).</p>
<p>I hope this all makes sense, I&#x27;m unfortunately not that familiar with your previous star-import work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Quite apart from any of the big things I was stuck on (thank you all for your review comments!), I realised after sleeping on it that I could significantly simplify things by reviving the idea I had previously in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16923">astral-sh/ruff#16923</a>#discussion_r2009436905. There&#x27;s now no need for moving any logic from <code>infer.rs</code> into a new <code>import_resolution</code> submodule, and all the questions about &quot;Where do we do tracing?&quot; are now redundant 🥳</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried out @sharkdp&#x27;s suggested alternative implementation, and it appears to work beautifully... except that this PR is now triggering(?) a Salsa panic in some unrelated tests in a file I didn&#x27;t touch:</p>
<pre><code>  crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/properties.md:203 panicked at /home/runner/.cargo/git/checkouts/salsa-e6f3bb7c2a062968/296a8c7/src/tracked_struct.rs:832:21
  crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/properties.md:203 access to field whilst the value is being initialized
</code></pre>
<p>which looks like the same Salsa panic that @dcreager was running into in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17023">astral-sh/ruff#17023</a> before he applied <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17023">astral-sh/ruff#17023</a>/commits/ea125488ac59d27620144dafcced3050c1da2775 to that PR...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is so nice and clean now! Love it.</p>
<p>I think given our upcoming deadlines I would be inclined to merge this even with a significant regression (especially if that regression gets smaller percentage-wise when we check a larger codebase), and prefer to have someone spend dedicated time later looking for performance wins. But it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to at least look at some profiles (the CodSpeed ones are sadly useless, so they have to be generated locally) to understand which queries we spend more time in now.</p>

<p>We discussed this internally. It&#x27;s obviously far from ideal, but for now we&#x27;re going to eat the performance regression. We have some ideas for how to address it, but they may or may not work out, and we want to move onto other tasks for now. I&#x27;ll writeup a separate issue with our findings from looking at the tracing logs and various profiles.</p>
