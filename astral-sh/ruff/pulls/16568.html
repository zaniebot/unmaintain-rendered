            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This updates the <code>Signature</code> and <code>CallBinding</code> machinery to support multiple overloads for a callable.  This is currently only used for <code>KnownFunction</code>s that we special-case in our type inference code.  It does <strong><em>not</em></strong> yet update the semantic index builder to handle <code>@overload</code> decorators and construct a multi-signature <code>Overloads</code> instance for real Python functions.</p>
<p>While I was here, I updated many of the <code>try_call</code> special cases to use signatures (possibly overloaded ones now) and <code>bind_call</code> to check parameter lists.  We still need some of the mutator methods on <code>OverloadBinding</code> for the special cases where we need to update return types based on some Rust code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All of these updates will help separate call binding into two phases, since all of the <code>Signature</code>s that we construct no longer depend on the inferred argument types.  (We still have special case logic to update the return type of the call based on argument types, but that won't conflict with the two-phase change)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes. That's exactly what I am changing.</p>
<p>I see that you've extracted the known classes into separate arms with hard coded signatures. That's awesome as it improves the current code.</p>
<p>However, as we've decided yesterday I was going to add handling of <code>__new__</code>, which should enable signature inference from the typeshed.</p>
<p>Not a big deal. If this PR is merged first I'll rebase and adjust accordingly. If mine happens to be first, these additional arms may or may not be necessary.</p>
<p>This all looks great and I like simpler API to create the outcome! Thanks for keeping me updated too!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not suggesting that we have to solve this in your PR but raising multiple diagnostics doesn't seem to be a great user experience.</p>
<p>I think I'd expect a diagnostic in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed to call <code>FunctionType.__get__</code> because</li>
<li>No arguments provided for the required parameters <code>instance</code>, and <code>owner</code> of the overload defined here (...code frame)</li>
<li>No arguments provided for the required parameter <code>instance</code> of the overload defined here (...code frame).</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does raise an interesting question and may require us to rethink our diagnostic groups because I'd expect that we use the same pattern when one overload can't be called because of a missing argument and another because of an invalid argument type (or too many positional etc)</p>
<p>Unless emitting a single diagnostic would change your approach in this PR, then I think it's worthwhile to take a closer look on how we want to support this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It doesn't change the binding machinery.  For now, I've updated this PR to print out a single new <code>no-matching-overload</code> error, mimicking Alex's mypy link, which is only shown when there are multiple overloads in the thing you're trying to call.  If you call a non-overloaded function, you get the existing multiple diagnostics for each parameter error.</p>
<p>The information is there to add sub-diagnostics about how each particular overload failed, which I think we should tackle in future PRs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's a fair bit more complexity involved in fully binding overloads according to the spec. See https://github.com/python/typing/pull/1839 for the proposed spec, which isn't merged yet but will likely be merged in something similar to that form.</p>
<p>(Not suggesting to do more of it in this PR, just that the TODO comment could be broader.)</p>
<p>One particular item that might be worth noting in the context of your next steps around splitting call checking, is that the spec says overloads should first all be checked for arity match, and only matching ones should be checked for type assignability. I don't think this actually changes the effective semantics, but it should be better for perf. (It might just be what falls out naturally with call splitting.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure we should actually do this. It can cause a lot of bogus cascading errors due to getting an argument wrong at a call site. It is likely the case that subsequent code may be (correctly) written to handle only one or some of the possible overload results, and evaluating it as if it were required to handle any possible overload result will probably result in false positives.</p>
<p>I think this should just be <code>Unknown</code> (or arguably <code>Never</code>, but we've typically preferred <code>Unknown</code> in such cases) instead.</p>

<p>I don't think this needs to be addressed in this PR but I think using the term &quot;overloads&quot; for a function with a single signature (no <code>@overload</code>) is a bit confusing although I do see why that might be required. One possibility would be to use <code>Signatures</code> (plural) instead of <code>Overloads</code> which can either be a <code>Single</code> signature or an <code>Overloaded</code> variant which has a list of signatures.</p>

<p>Or alternately, do we not really need those per-arity methods, when it's this easy to just match directly on <code>overload.parameter_types()</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Went with this. The main drawback is that matching against the slice gives you <code>&amp;Type</code> references, so there are a couple of places where you have to add some dereferences.</p>

<p>I don't think this needs to be addressed in this PR but I think using the term &quot;overloads&quot; for a function with a single signature (no <code>@overload</code>) is a bit confusing although I do see why that might be required. One possibility would be to use <code>Signatures</code> (plural) instead of <code>Overloads</code> which can either be a <code>Single</code> signature or an <code>Overloaded</code> variant which has a list of signatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Per discussion in Discord, I've renamed this to <code>CallableSignature</code> and <code>Signature</code>. As part of #15460 we'll need to add a third level to this to track the signature of a <em>union</em> of callables, and we want to reserve the concise name <code>Signatures</code> for that, since it will soon become the type that the rest of the type inference code refers to most often by name. So we'll end up with a three-level structure: <code>Signatures</code>, which is a possible union of <code>CallableSignature</code>s, each of which is a possibly overloaded collection of <code>Signature</code>s.</p>
<p>We'll also want to mimic that structure on the binding side, where (as of this PR) we have <code>CallOutcome</code> / <code>CallBinding</code> / <code>OverloadBinding</code>, but I suggest tackling that renaming separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe we can choose something else as an example here, because <code>int</code> is a supertype of <code>bool</code>, which would mean that the second overload would never be selected(?).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I specifically called out the arity thing (that's step 1 and 2 in the proposed spec), but there are also a number of other wrinkles, like union-argument expansion (step 3), preference for variadic signature matches to variadic arguments (step 4), and special handling for non-fully-static argument types matching multiple arguments (step 5). Not at all urgent, but at some point would be good to broaden this TODO comment even more to cover these things, as long as we haven't yet implemented them.</p>
<p>EDIT: oh, actually perhaps this is sufficiently covered by the TODO on CallBinding below.</p>
