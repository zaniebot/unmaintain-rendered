<p>Looks like we're green now, but mypy primer seems unhappy (sorry if that means I shouldn't have opened it, but I'm not sure how to proceed with primer failures)</p>

<p>The mypy_primer run was failing due to a network error. I re-ran it now and it fails with</p>
<pre><code>fatal[panic] Panicked at crates/ty_python_semantic/src/symbol.rs:927:21 when checking `/tmp/mypy_primer/projects/trio/src/trio/_core/__init__.py`: `internal error: entered unreachable code: If we have at least one declaration, the scope-start should not be definitely visible`
</code></pre>
<p>This might be related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/365#issuecomment-2885927976. I am planning to fix that bug as soon as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18041 is merged (which makes significant changes to the semantic index builder, and has a much higher impact). I suggest that we wait with this PR until these two things have been resolved.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the conclusion that this is unreachable code is actually correct -- <code>type(x)</code> will never return a <code>GenericAlias</code> at runtime, so <code>type(x) is A[str]</code> can never be true, only <code>type(x) is A</code> can be.</p>
<p>This test probably warrants some expansion, but it doesn't need to happen in this PR. We have an issue open for improving how we handle narrowing against generic types.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, figured it out.</p>
<p>The failing file is <code>src/trio/_core/__init__.py</code>, which contains this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># Windows imports
if sys.platform == &quot;win32&quot;:
    from ._run import (
        current_iocp,
        monitor_completion_key,
        readinto_overlapped,
        register_with_iocp,
        wait_overlapped,
        write_overlapped,
    )
# Kqueue imports
elif sys.platform != &quot;linux&quot; and sys.platform != &quot;win32&quot;:
    from ._run import current_kqueue, monitor_kevent, wait_kevent
</code></pre>
<p>And the failure repros locally if I run with <code>--python-platform=&quot;linux&quot;</code>. Otherwise locally my platform defaults to darwin, and the issue doesn't appear.</p>
<p>Since the repro is an <code>if</code>, not a loop with <code>break</code>, it seems clear this is an issue introduced by this PR; it's not https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/365#issuecomment-2885927976</p>
