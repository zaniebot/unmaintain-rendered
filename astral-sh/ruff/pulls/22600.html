<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes #18775</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>The SIM910 (<code>dict-get-with-none-default</code>) and SIM911 (<code>zip-dict-keys-and-values</code>) rules were silently deleting comments when applying fixes.</p>
<p>For example, SIM910 would transform:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ages = {&quot;Tom&quot;: 23, &quot;Maria&quot;: 23, &quot;Dog&quot;: 11}
age = ages.get(  # comment
    &quot;Cat&quot;, None
)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>...</code></pre>
<pre><code>
into:

```python
for k, v in d.items():
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This fix marks such transformations as <strong>unsafe</strong> when comments would be deleted, requiring users to explicitly opt-in with <code>--unsafe-fixes</code>.</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>Uses the established <code>CommentRanges::intersects()</code> pattern already used by other rules in the codebase (as suggested by @MichaReiser in the issue). When comments exist within the expression's range, the fix is marked as <code>Applicability::Unsafe</code> instead of <code>Applicability::Safe</code>.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Please give us some time before pinging maintainers. We already get a lot of notifications and more notifications doesn't help us to get things done faster. BurntSushi also doesn't work at this part of the code base at all.</p>
