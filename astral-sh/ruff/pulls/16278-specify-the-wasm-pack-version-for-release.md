# Specify the `wasm-pack` version for release workflows

---

_@ntBre_

This PR uses the same version specified in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14465 for the CI workflow to prevent random versions from being pulled like in the 0.9.7 [release](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/13436100909/job/37539387595).
