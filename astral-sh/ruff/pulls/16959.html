            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Further work towards https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14169. If something like this exists in a <code>foo.py</code> module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f():
    global a
    a: bool = True
</code></pre>
<p>and a <code>bar.py</code> module has this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from foo import *

reveal_type(a)
</code></pre>
<p>then we will now recognize <code>a</code> as bound in <code>bar.py</code>. We don't <em>yet</em> reveal <code>bool</code> as the inferred type, but that depends on fixing https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/220.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Assertions in existing mdtests are modified, and some new assertions are added</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know how hot this code path is but we could consider using hashbrown's hash table to only compute the hash key once (for <code>global_declarations_in_scope</code> and <code>exports</code>). But that's probably a premature optimization :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I think it makes sense now, seeing how you use it as a nested visitor. You could use <code>std::mem::take</code> to take the exports and then assign it to the inner visitor but not sure if that's worth getting rid of the lifetime.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do we need the second lifetime here or could we use <code>'a</code> in places of both <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code> (without the borrow checker getting upset?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for not getting to clarity on this sooner, but I feel like we shouldn't support this. While this PR doesn't add a lot of complexity, fully supporting this pattern will, because it means that the types of symbols in an outer scope can depend on an arbitrary nested scope.</p>
<p>I think it is reasonable to require that if you use <code>global</code> in a function and assign to that name, the name must explicitly exist in the global scope.</p>
<p>If we do end up deciding we have to support this pattern, I want to add full support for it altogether (that is, not do star-import support for it separately from actual type inference support) so we can see the full picture of what it requires.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yes, after discussing this with you the other day, I agree that we probably shouldn't do this right now. Let's add support for <code>global</code> statements generally first, and see where we land on that. We can possibly revive this after we do that, but it doesn't seem like a priority in any event.</p>
