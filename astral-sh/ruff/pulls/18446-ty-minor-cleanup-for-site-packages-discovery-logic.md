# [ty] Minor cleanup for `site-packages` discovery logic

---

_@AlexWaygood_

## Summary

- Remove an unnecessary clone (fixing a TODO in the code)
- Improve docs for the `SitePackagesDiscoveryError` enum and rename a few variants
- Remove `SysPrefixPath::new_impl()`. The indirection is unnecessary; it can all easily be inlined into `SysPrefixPath::new()`.

## Test Plan

Existing tests all pass
