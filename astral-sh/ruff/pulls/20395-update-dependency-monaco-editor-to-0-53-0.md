### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>microsoft/monaco-editor (monaco-editor)</summary>

### [`v0.53.0`](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0530)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/compare/v0.52.2...v0.53.0)

- :warning: This release deprecates the AMD build and ships with significant changes of the AMD build. The AMD build will still be shipped for a while, but we don't offer support for it anymore. Please migrate to the ESM build.

##### New Features

- Next Edit Suggestion support.
- Scroll On Middle Click
- Edit Context Support

##### Breaking Changes

- Internal AMD modules are no longer accessible. Accessing internal AMD modules was never supported. While this is still possible in the ESM build, we don't encourage this usage pattern.
- The [browser-script-editor scenario](https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/a4d7907bd439b06b24e334bdf2ab597bcae658b5/samples/browser-script-editor/index.html) for unbundled synchronous script import and editor creation no longer works. Instead, a the ESM build should be used with a bundler, such as vite or webpack.
- Custom AMD workers don't work anymore out of the box.
