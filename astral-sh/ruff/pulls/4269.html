            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this! Looking through the codebases, I think most of the errors flagged in the ecosystem check are false positives. Could we try implementing this by looking at the token stream, rather than using a regex on the physical lines? (A regex will also be more expensive in practice.)</p>
<p>E.g., in the <code>tokens.rs</code> checker, we could look at <code>Comment</code> tokens, see if they're blank, and track some state to see if they're part of a multi-line comment. Would that work?</p>

<p>It should be possible to use <code>Indexer.comment_ranges</code> to avoid iterating over all tokens.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff has the <code>Indexer</code> data structure that exposes the range of all comments (<code>Indexer::comment_ranges</code>). You can use this with <code>Locator.slice(range)</code> to retrieve all comments and call the rule at the top level (module) once. This should be faster than running a regex on every line.</p>
<p>I think we should also be able to replace the regex all together by manually skipping the <code>#</code> and then testing if <code>text.trim().is_empty()</code>.</p>
