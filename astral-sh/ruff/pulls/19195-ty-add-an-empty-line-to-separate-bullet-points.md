# [ty] Add an empty line to separate bullet points

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2025-07-08 04:01_

Without the newline, the rendering would just combine all the bullet points in a single line like in https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/configuration/#exclude_1. With the empty line, it would be similar to https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/configuration/#include_1.
