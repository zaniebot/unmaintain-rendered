            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Given that no new failures appeared over the past two weeks, and seeing the fuzzing results from @dhruvmanila in #13778, I think we can re-enable these tests. We also had one regression that would have been caught by these tests, so there is some value in having them enabled.</p>

<p>Fantastic, unfortunate timing on my end :smile:. I accidentally ran <code>cargo nextest run -p red_knot_python_semantic</code> offline, instead of <code>-p red_knot_workspace</code>.</p>
<p>This new file also contains a self-referential type alias, so this is a known problem (#14672). I added it to the corresponding section in <code>KNOWN_FAILURES</code>.</p>
