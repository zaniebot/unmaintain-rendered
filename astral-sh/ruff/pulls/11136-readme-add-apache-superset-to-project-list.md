# README: add Apache Superset to project list

---

_@mistercrunch_

## Summary

Stoked to have found` ruff` and migrated over - quick testimonial ->

> Our smooth and fast migration to ruff allowed us to deprecate 4+ other disjointed tools (pycln, pyupgrade, black, isort, flake8) that each had their own CLI subcommands, different enabling/disabling semantics, and pre-commit hooks. I can't wait to add pylint to the list. It's such a no brainer to replace all this with the Ferrari of linters.`--add-no-qa` and `--ignore-noqa` are so convenient, but `--fix` takes it home!
