<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1039017663004942429/1070132471699607623/1258392448569184417">discussed</a> previously on Discord, and then found out <em>indention</em> was used in multiple places in the code. <em>indentation</em> was used more than <em>indention</em>, so figured it would be easier to replace the existing <em>indention</em> usage to <em>indentation</em>.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->
