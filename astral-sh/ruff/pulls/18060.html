            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This continues our recent work to pay more respect to the gradual guarantee when inferring the MROs of classes. Classes are now permitted to inherit from <code>type[Any]</code> and <code>type[Unknown]</code>: since these are <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/222">actually intersection types</a>, the same principle applies to these types as was established in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18055.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>mdtests added.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you why the order of the diagnostics in the snapshot is changing as a result of these changes, but -- alas! -- I cannot. It doesn't seem like a massive problem, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's quite interesting -- a lot of the primer reports are to do with <code>super()</code> rather than inheritance, as our <code>BoundSuper</code> type also users <code>ClassBase</code> as its inner data:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/41fa082414c7277082d7e19b307baea0a4771d4c/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types.rs#L8100-L8106</p>
<p>I think the same arguments about the gradual guarantee apply to <code>super()</code> usage on <code>type[Any]</code> as they do to inheritance from <code>type[Any]</code>, though. So this doesn't seem like a problem to me.</p>
<p>(The hits in operator and mypy are both inheritance-related; not <em>all</em> the primer hits are <code>super()</code>-related.)</p>
