# Correct parenthesized long nested-expressions example to match Ruff's output

---

_Pull request opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-07-02 14:56_

## Summary

The output shown for long nested-expressions didn't match Ruff's output. I must have used the output that I **want** rather than what Ruff does today. 

I copied the input into Black and Ruff and pasted the output into the readme

Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12138
