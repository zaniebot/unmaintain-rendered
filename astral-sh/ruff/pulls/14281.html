            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This adds a new diagnostic when possibly unbound symbols are imported. The <code>TODO</code> comment had a question mark, do I&#x27;m not sure if this is really something that we want.</p>
<p>This does not touch the un<em>declared</em> case, yet.</p>
<p>relates to: #14022</p>
Test Plan
<p>Updated already existing tests with new diagnostics</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an understand question from my side. When do we add a <code>possibly-unbound-xy</code> diagnostic because there are many situations where a value can be unbound. Do we want dedicated diagnostics for members (subscript), imports, variables? What about context managers, patterns, etc or should we rather have a single diagnostic code for all of them?</p>
<p>This discussion is entirely unrelated to this PR and shouldn&#x27;t prevent it from landing. It&#x27;s also something we can revisit later.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;ll actually get worse when we understand <code>sys.version_info</code> branches, because <code>types.NoneType</code> only exists on Python 3.10+, and our default Python version is 3.8, which means when we understand <code>sys.version_info</code> branches we&#x27;ll infer <code>types.NoneType</code> as always-unbound with the default target version rather than possibly-unbound.</p>
<p>The solution here is really to add a feature to <code>mdtest</code> so that we can set <code>--target-version</code> to Python 3.10 or higher in this test snippet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with adding a diagnostic for this. &quot;The member might be unbound&quot; <em>does</em> feel to me like a distinct thing to &quot;the module just doesn&#x27;t have this member&quot;, so I guess I agree with this being a separate error code... but I also absolutely see @MichaReiser&#x27;s point about this leading to the number of error codes exploding a bit :/</p>

<p>I understood something different from Micha&#x27;s question. I didn&#x27;t understand it to be about <code>unbound-x</code> vs <code>possibly-unbound-x</code> (I think these must be different error codes, and 2x for unbound error codes is a manageable level of &quot;explosion&quot;), but rather about how finely we divide the many different possible <code>x</code>. With this PR, we now have <code>unresolved-reference</code> and <code>possibly-unbound-reference</code> and now <code>unresolved-import</code> and <code>possibly-unbound-import</code>.</p>
<p>I think this is an area where it&#x27;s worth looking at what other type checkers do. I lean towards separate error codes, and my understanding from mypy is that users seem to demand rather finely-grained error codes. It&#x27;s also not clear to me what is the concrete <em>cost</em> of finer-grained error codes. It clearly provides more functionality, and the cost of &quot;longer reference docs&quot;, while real, doesn&#x27;t seem to outweigh the user flexibility.</p>
<p>Imports are different in that an unbound-import error may often come from code you don&#x27;t control. I think another useful guide may be &quot;which things raise different errors at runtime&quot;, which would suggest separate codes: unbound name references, nonexistent attributes, missing imports, and missing mapping keys all raise different exception types at runtime.</p>

<p>The cost here is mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each rule will come with some boilerplate and needs documenting. This is a one off cost but also leads to more code.</li>
<li>Users ideally don&#x27;t toggle rules at such a fine granular level and instead use e.g. a rule selector. But every rule adds some cognitive overhead (e.g. the list of rules becomes longer and more difficult to search, it&#x27;s harder for users to find the rules they care about).</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the discussion about rule names. I&#x27;ll leave the fine-grained rule name for now, assuming that we will do a overhaul at some point to enforce consistency across all rules. But let me know if you think something should be changed for this specific rule.</p>
