            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @yunchipang - thanks for looking into this! This is a pretty old rule that has survived many refactors of the code base, and I think the PR you're linking to isn't quite the one that originated the unsafe fix. So I don't think the reason you're giving for fix unsafety is correct - especially because, as you point out, Ruff will detect that situation and warn the user.</p>
<p>I think some hints for the unsafety are in this discussion: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6294</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>This fix is marked as always unsafe because the user may be intentionally re-exporting the import.
</code></pre>
