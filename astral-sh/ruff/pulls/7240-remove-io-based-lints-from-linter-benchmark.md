# Remove IO based lints from linter benchmark

---

_@MichaReiser_


## Summary

Remove IO based lint rules from the benchmark because IO is a source of flakiness (also affecting CodSpeed benchmarks).

## Test Plan

None. We have to see if this helps reducing the flakiness of our linter benchmarks

<!-- How was it tested? -->

@charliermarsh do you know if there are more? Or is this impossible because of the resolver?
