            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR fixes two bugs in our inference of protocol interfaces.</p>
<p>Firstly, we currently correctly record whether a protocol member is marked as a <code>ClassVar</code>... but only if the protocol originates from a <code>.py</code> file! If the protocol originated from a <code>.pyi</code> file, we were accidentally throwing this information away -- this is due to the fact that we iterate over both declarations and bindings to infer a protocol interface, and in a stub file <code>x: ClassVar[int]</code> is considered both a declaration <em>and</em> a binding, but the bindings iterator doesn't return any information about the qualifiers, and the information from the bindings iterator was overwriting any qualifiers information we'd obtained from the declarations iterator.</p>
<p>Secondly, we currently get subprotocols very wrong. For a situation like this, we infer <code>SubProto</code> as having a method member <code>method</code> that returns <code>int</code>, not <code>bool</code>, because we're incorrectly overwriting the information regarding the subprotocol with information about the parent protocol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Protocol

class BaseProto(Protocol):
    def method(self) -&gt; int: ...

class SubProto(BaseProto, Protocol):
    def method(self) -&gt; bool: ...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The polarity of these tests has changed. They previously asserted that <code>Foo</code> was not a a subtype of <code>HasXWithDefault</code>. Indeed, <code>Foo</code> does not have an <code>x</code> attribute with a default, so if the current tests reflect the intended behavior, can we add a comment why this is correct (is the fact that the protocol member has a default value irrelevant?)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do this sort of thing a lot in ty's code base: iterating over both bindings and declarations separately, hoping that there is a 1:1 relationship. This is not always the case. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class D: # maybe a protocol, maybe a dataclass with fields, …
    if condition:
        attr: int
    else:
        attr = &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is unlikely to be a problem for protocols in particular, I think. And it's certainly not something specific to this PR. But I think it would be very beneficial in a lot of places if we could somehow iterate over all <em>definitions</em> and then get the declared type (for <code>attr: int</code>), the inferred type (for <code>attr = &quot;&quot;</code>), or both (for <code>attr: int = 0</code>).</p>
<p>Here, it would eliminate the mutation of the entry. And the bug would probably not have happened in the first place if the iterator would yield either a <code>DeclaredType { ty }</code>, an <code>InferredType { ty }</code>, or <code>Both { declared_ty, inferred_ty }</code>. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19756 for a somewhat related problem that I fixed a few weeks ago.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I keep on changing my mind about this, and need to make a decision 😆 thanks for calling it out.</p>
<p>As the conformance-suite diff shows, the conformance suite tests include an example where a class with implicit instance attributes is considered a subtype of a protocol where the member is bound in the class body. I think you can make that sound, but only if you say that the instance attribute is <em>not</em> present on the meta-protocol (<code>type[HasXWithDefault]</code>), which would obviously imply that we'd do attribute lookup differently for <code>type[]</code> Protocol types than we would for <code>type[]</code> nominal types.</p>
<p>I was actually confused about why the conformance suite diff changed, though, and you made me look again and realise that this PR was fixing <em>another</em> bug. We were inferring this protocol as having an <code>x: Literal[0]</code> member rather than an <code>x: int</code> member:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class P(Protocol):
    x: int = 0
</code></pre>
<p>I'll add a comment by this test, and add another test that explicitly asserts that we infer the correct interface for members that have default values.</p>
