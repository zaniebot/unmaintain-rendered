            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure this is the right fix but I can see how any other fix is annoying.</p>
<p>The reason why I don't think we should enable <code>testing</code> in <code>ruff_dev</code> is because users can't select the <code>testing</code> rules and, therefore, they shouldn't be in the json schema. If they currently are, then that's a bug and we should remove them.</p>

<p>Oh, right. That makes more sense. Thanks for catching that, I've updated the PR.</p>
