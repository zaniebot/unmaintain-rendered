            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. I&#x27;ve to think about this. For future requests, please first open an issue and then give us some time to triage it before opening a PR because</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to be mindful of your time and avoid that you spend time implementing a feature that won&#x27;t make it into ruff</li>
<li>We now have two places to discuss the feature requests, and two notification for everyone subscribed to the Ruff repo</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will do so for future feature requests. As for this one, it is both so important and simple that I had already finished all the implementation by the time I knew it (client-side too, by the way).</p>
<p>In hindsight, creating #14666 was unnecessary (it is practically a duplicate of #14491, which I knew existed), for which I apologize.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ll close this considering that there are reasonable alternatives to get the rule -&gt; code metadata, that supporting rule names for <code>rule</code> only results in an inconsistent CLI experience, and it means that rule names require versioning.</p>
<p>I do like to keep the issue open because we want to support rule names for the <code>rule</code> command long-term.</p>
