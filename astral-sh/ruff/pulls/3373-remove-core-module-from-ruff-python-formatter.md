# Remove `core` module from `ruff_python_formatter`

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-03-06 23:27_

## Summary

This is a follow-up to #3371 to remove the remaining vestiges of the ambiguously-named `core` module from `ruff_python_formatter`, instead relocating those utilities to a `cst` module.

No functional changes.
