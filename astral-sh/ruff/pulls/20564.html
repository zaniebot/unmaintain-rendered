            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was picturing this in <code>visit_stmt</code> like we did for function definitions rather than in the deferred visit. I guess lambdas aren't statements, so the analogous code would actually fit here in <code>visit_expr</code>:</p>

<p>I think that should work because we push a <code>lambda</code> snapshot that gets used here like we do for functions. The one downside is that the popping for lambdas happens a bit farther down, unlike functions:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, it looks like there are some new false positives in the ecosystem report. I was hoping it was something simple with the scope popping, which is why I pushed a commit, but that didn't end up helping. We're flagging a case like this with F401:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import uuid


class C:
    uuid = lambda: str(uuid.uuid4())
</code></pre>
<p>and I don't fully understand why. We'll need to figure it out before we can merge this, though. Would you mind taking a look?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The issue was that the <code>DunderClassCell</code> scope was being added during lambda definition processing instead of during lambda body analysis, which caused false positives when lambdas within classes referenced module-level variables like <code>uuid</code>.</p>
<p>I fixed it by moving the scope logic from <code>visit_expr</code> to <code>visit_deferred_lambdas</code> (similar to how function definitions work) and changing the scope detection to check the entire scope hierarchy rather than just the current scope, ensuring <code>__class__</code> is accessible in lambdas within classes while preventing false positives for other variables.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah okay, I guess my earlier suggestion about moving it to <code>visit_expr</code> was wrong then. Thank you for debugging and sorry for the bad suggestion!</p>
