            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That Mkdocs recognizes links like <code>[`typing.Annotated`]</code> in the first place is probably because it uses <a href="https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown">@Python-Markdown/markdown</a>, an implementation of the original Markdown rather than CommonMark or GFM.</p>
<hr />
<p>I <em>think</em> that's all of them. More importantly, there should be a test somewhere so that such a link can't possibly be accidentally introduced again. Where would I even put that?</p>

<p>Possibly here? https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/scripts/check_docs_formatted.py</p>
<p>That's where all of the other custom docs checks appear to happen. Although the main purpose appears to be ensuring that the examples are formatted correctly, there are a couple of unrelated checks as well, like ensuring the required sections for rule docs are present.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is getting rid of the link in the references section (which is rendered), so I don't think we want to remove this. You could omit the explicit url portion of the reference, since it's technically redundant, although given that the labels in  the references section are sometimes changed to a more verbose, descriptive, style, I used an explicit link, so changing the label later on is easy. I don't think i have seen any shortcut links be used in other references sections.</p>

<p>Section headers and code blocks are easy to check for, but inline links aren't. I imagine that would take quite some manual parsing/regexes on top of a list of every option known to Ruff.</p>
