            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A followup to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16337. Restricting visibility has the advantage that we get unused-code warnings if a method, function or type becomes unused. And it also means that it's harder for external modules to accidentally use methods that are meant to be implementation details, and aren't meant to be for external use.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->
