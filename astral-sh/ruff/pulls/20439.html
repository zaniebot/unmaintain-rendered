            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR does the work necessary to make the &quot;import&quot;
part of &quot;auto-import&quot; work. That is, when an unimported
completion is found, it is now returned with an LSP text
edit for inserting an import that should bring that symbol
into scope.</p>
<p>The diffstat here is quite large, but a bulk of that are
tests. And this PR should be reviewed commit-by-commit.
Many of the commits are somewhat smaller refactorings.
The last commit is where the new <code>Importer</code> abstraction is
introduced, and it's where (arguably) most of the weeds are.</p>
<p>For now, I've not concerned myself with performance in order
to avoid getting distracted by it. In particular, every
unimported completion gets an edit generated for it. This
strikes me as sub-optimal, and indeed, it looks like the
LSP protocol has support for running &quot;commands&quot; in response
to a completion being selected. Future work might involve
taking advantage of that, but it's not clear to me yet how
expensive (relatively speaking) generating these edits
actually is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I was hoping we could eventually remove <code>Locator</code>. What I dislike about the type is that its lazy computation of the index is a bit of a footgun (which is why all those methods are marked as deprecated).</p>
<p>But <code>Locator</code> isn't much more than a <code>&amp;str</code> if you remove all methods that don't use a <code>LineIndex</code> (<code>&amp;str</code> also implements <code>LineRanges</code>). The only difference are the helper methods like <code>after</code>, <code>before</code> that work with <code>TextRanges</code>.</p>
<p>I don't think it's worth spending too much time but is there maybe a way we could decouple <code>Importer</code> from <code>Locator</code> (e.g. by just using a <code>&amp;str</code> and exposing some of those helper methods with a different trait on <code>&amp;str</code> which I think could be useful in other places too)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Neat!</p>
<p>But I'm not sure if this is actually needed, given that we only need <code>into_owned</code> in tests and only in tests that call <code>import</code> (or <code>import_from</code>) of which, I think, most tests only contain exactly one call.</p>
<p>I'm leaning towards creating the <code>Stylist</code> ad-hoc on demand. The only downside is that we compute the <code>line_ending</code> a few more times than necessary but that should be neglectable, given that most test files have very short lines (it only searches for the first line ending)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we'll want to support those for type-checking only imports. I think it's totally fine that this PR ignores those, but we should think about when we should add support for them.</p>
<p>Unlike Rust, importing a module has a runtime cost. Because of that, Python supports type-checking only imports, to avoid importing modules that are only needed to type some API.</p>
<p>The way type-checking only imports work in Python is that the imports are gated by an <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> guard (it's a well-known constant by type checkers or it can be imported from the typing module):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    import foo
</code></pre>
<p>Now, symbols imported in a <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> block aren't available at runtime. That means, they should only be suggested when in a type position (and e.g. not in the condition of an <code>if</code> statement).</p>
<p>It's also preferred to add the imports to an <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> block if the import is only used for type checking.</p>
<p>I don't know how far existing LSPs go here but Ruff has a few rules to help with this: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-type-checking-tc</p>

<p>I think it would be nice to make use of the LSPs lazy resolution of completion metadata (e.g. lazily resolve the <code>Type</code> of a `Completion) but I agree with your scoping that we should leave this to a separate improvement.</p>
<p>We probably also want some more advanced sorting of completion items to e.g. use the closest (and most high-level) re-export of a symbol over importing it from a very deeply nested submodule (or from a test!). But again, these are incremental improvements that we can make later.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess that's fine with me. I was trying to avoid bringing <code>ruff_diagnostics</code> into the ty world. And the type is very simple, so I don't think duplicating it is terrible. Moreover, I feel like <code>ruff_python_importer</code> should probably own the types that it returns, but that's a vague API design nit. But this is done now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a little more subtle than that. An <code>Importer</code> wants a <code>&amp;Stylist</code>. So if we create a <code>Stylist</code> on-demand, it can't be tied to the stack frame that creates an <code>Importer</code> <em>and</em> returns that importer.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different ways around this. A <code>Stylist</code> could always own its source for example. Or the tests could always be required to create an <code>Importer</code> in the same stack frame (or above) as where it's used.</p>
<p>But I found this to be simple and it follows a standard API pattern in Rust libraries for creating borrowed/owned versions of the same type. And I don't think the cost here is that big.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I kept both to avoid the unwraps and because I perceived there to be little-to-no cost in doing so. And if and when we ever refactor this to use namespace packages, the types will help a bit more I think since it will force us to confront the fact that a <code>File</code> may be missing.</p>

<pre><code>insta_settings.add_filter(r#&quot;\\(\w\w|\s|\.|&quot;)&quot;#, &quot;/$1&quot;);

<p>That <code>\s</code> is what threw me off here, since I don't think that usually helps with file paths. I'd guess that was probably copied from elsewhere.</p>
<p>In any case, just removing the <code>\s</code> alternation fixed things and makes this snapshot read better.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately whether either &quot;top-level&quot; or &quot;low-level&quot; should be hyphenated or not depends on the context of whether it's being used as a compound adjective (but this is definitely not worth worrying about :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I only added the <code>single_declaration</code> field in the return type of <code>place_from_declarations</code> recently. We could probably do something similar and add a <code>single_binding</code> or <code>single_definition</code> field in the return type of <code>place_from_bindings</code>, so as to avoid the additional traversal here?</p>
<p>A case where this (and the <code>single_declaration</code> / <code>single_binding</code> fields) would fail to return a single definition would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">if flag:
    x = 1
else:
    x = 2

# there are two live bindings of `x` at the end of the scope here, each with its own definition
</code></pre>
<p>I haven't thought through the implications here (I don't know what we use the definition field for, downstream), but it's maybe worth at least adding some tests for?</p>

<p>In helix, I just see suggested names without imports. They are from different modules and there is no way to tell which is correct.</p>

<p>Installed from the main branch. Here is what I see in LSP logs of helix:</p>
<pre><code> {
      &quot;additionalTextEdits&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;newText&quot;: &quot;from selectolax.parser import HTMLParser\n&quot;,
          &quot;range&quot;: { &quot;end&quot;: { &quot;character&quot;: 0, &quot;line&quot;: 7 }, &quot;start&quot;: { &quot;character&quot;: 0, &quot;line&quot;: 7 } }
        }
      ],
      &quot;insertText&quot;: &quot;HTMLParser&quot;,
      &quot;kind&quot;: 7,
      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;HTMLParser&quot;,
      &quot;labelDetails&quot;: { &quot;detail&quot;: &quot; (import selectolax.parser)&quot; },
      &quot;sortText&quot;: &quot; 56&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;additionalTextEdits&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;newText&quot;: &quot;from html.parser import HTMLParser\n&quot;,
          &quot;range&quot;: { &quot;end&quot;: { &quot;character&quot;: 0, &quot;line&quot;: 7 }, &quot;start&quot;: { &quot;character&quot;: 0, &quot;line&quot;: 7 } }
        }
      ],
      &quot;insertText&quot;: &quot;HTMLParser&quot;,
      &quot;kind&quot;: 7,
      &quot;label&quot;: &quot;HTMLParser&quot;,
      &quot;labelDetails&quot;: { &quot;detail&quot;: &quot; (import html.parser)&quot; },
      &quot;sortText&quot;: &quot; 57&quot;
    },
</code></pre>
<p>So I guess label details are not fully supported. Not sure why kind does not work though...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Checked how it's done in other LSP.s
Rust analyzer just appends it to label:</p>
<pre><code>        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;PatternMatchAs(use ruff_python_ast::PatternMatchAs)&quot;,
</code></pre>
<p>gopls puts it in the description (if it's a module import).:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;label&quot;: &quot;unsafeheader&quot;,
&quot;kind&quot;: 9,
 &quot;detail&quot;: &quot;\&quot;internal/unsafeheader\&quot;&quot;,

<p>It looks like even Zed does not support labelDetails yet, so perhaps it's better to put it somewhere else for now.</p>
