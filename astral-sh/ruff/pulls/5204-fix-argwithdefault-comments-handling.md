## Summary

This PR fixes a few issues with formatting arguments that were introduced when upgrading to the latest RustPython parser (#5192). 

* It upgrades RustPython again to pull in the fix that includes the range of the default argument in `ArgWithDefault` https://github.com/astral-sh/RustPython-Parser/pull/13
* It overrides the `visit_arg_with_default` function in the `CommentsVisitor`
* It fixes a nasty issue where both the `ArgWithDefault` and `Arg` resolved to the same comments. My understanding of the issue is that Rust re-orders the fields in `ArgWithDefault` so that `Arg` becomes its first field. The result is that both the `ArgWithDefault` and `Arg` are stored at the same memory offset (but they don't end at the same memory offset). I wonder if we have the same problem with `RefEquality` (CC: @charliermarsh). The way I fixed the issue is by including the node kind in the equality check. This is safe because we only have this problem for nodes that don't box their children (which is why `BinaryExpression isn't affected by it) and recursive types need boxing (the only way that the parent and child have the same kind).

## Test Plan


I added a new test for formatting arguments.

Is this upstream or downstream of the other RustPython upgrade PRs I have up?
