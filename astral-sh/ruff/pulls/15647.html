            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The AST generator creates a reference enum for each syntax group — an enum where each variant contains a reference to the relevant syntax node.  Previously you could customize the name of the reference enum for a group — primarily because there was an existing <code>ExpressionRef</code> type that wouldn't have lined up with the auto-derived name <code>ExprRef</code>.  This follow-up PR is a simple search/replace to switch over to the auto-derived name, so that we can remove this customization point.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess it's fine. My long term plan was to go from <code>Expr</code> to <code>Expression</code>, <code>Stmt</code> to <code>Statement</code> etc. That's why it was called <code>ExpressionRef</code>. I outlined some of my ideas in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/6183</p>
<p>Considering that I'll probably never have time to do this refactor in the short term, making it consistent seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Ah that's interesting, I hadn't seen that!  Skimming through your suggestions, I think I'm :+1: to pretty much all of them.  It would be a lot of churn in the diff to make those changes, but with the AST generator in place, it would at least be easier to implement them.</p>

<p>(Which, to clarify, means that I'm suggesting agreement in doing them, but in follow-on PRs.  I still like this one as-is to at least move the current abbreviation-using names to be more consistent.)</p>
