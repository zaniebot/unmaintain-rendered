            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Add documentation for <code>Tryceratops TC002</code> or as it's know in Ruff <code>TRY002</code></p>
<p>This is a copy from the upstream Tryceratops repository.
I think there should also be a section for linking the original repository and documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, I am unable to understand these explanations. I would write something like this instead (disregarding <code>BaseException</code>'s existence for clarity):</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">    /// ### What it does
    /// Checks for code which raises `Exception(...)` directly.
    ///
    /// ## Why is this bad?
    /// In order to handle such an exception, the handling code must use `except Exception`,
    /// which catches *any* raised exception, including failed assertions, division by zero,
    /// and others.
    ///
    /// Prefer to raise your own custom subclass of `Exception`. Then the handling code can
    /// catch only your specific exception type, without over-catching unintended
    /// exceptions.

<p>If I am allowed to write better explanations over using the existing ones I will do so!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Any idea why the build is failing? Could use some help on it, thought it was easy pickings but cargo is complaining.
Would not expect comments to fail an entire build but I also don't know much about rust so 🤷‍♂️</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@nm-remarkable - Thanks! I might top of the doc for consistency but will merge this. You need to run <code>cargo dev generate-all</code> since we auto-generate parts of the README etc. based on the inline documentation. But I can also run it prior to merging, not a big deal.</p>
