This major version update adds a change where it would add newlines after the title of content tabs (https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs) but then the `markdownlint` linter will complain as the code block style will become inconsistent (https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/md046.md). This is not caught by this PR because the `mdformat-mkdocs` dependency is pinned to `<4.0.0` in our pre-commit config: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bcd944347d972daa3a82ba38449778ebd56d70c0/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L29

We can move ahead with this PR but we should update the version specifier in our pre-commit config and possibly ignore `MD046`.

@dhruvmanila are you planning on owning this?

Yeah

I've made the following changes:
* Update `mdformat-mkdocs` to `4.0.0` in our pre-commit config and use `==` specifier for it
* Apply the formatting changes which adds a blank line after the title of content tabs
* Ignore `MD046` with a reference to why we're doing so

I tested this change by rendering the affected pages locally and everything looked the same as today.

Weird, I did a fresh run of pre-commit locally (i.e., after `pre-commit clean`) and it passed. I'll try to re-run once the CI is completed.

Ok, I see the issue. Now, `mdformat-mkdocs` also conflicts with the `mdformat-admon` plugin because both registers for `admonition` and `admonition_title` nodes.

_Comment by @dhruvmanila on 2024-12-16 08:18_

Oh, I didn't realize @AlexWaygood pinned the version because of these conflicts xD (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14992)

_Comment by @dhruvmanila on 2024-12-16 08:20_

I've asked the plugin author if this change means that we don't need the `mdformat-admon` plugin (https://github.com/KyleKing/mdformat-admon/pull/22#issuecomment-2544856589). Once that's resolved, we can merge this PR otherwise I'll see what the solution should be.

Haha, yeah, I merged a hotfix last night because the new release meant pre-commit started failing randomly on contributor PRs, which was understandably causing confusion 😄

You will need to remove all references to `mdformat-admon` because the mkdocs style for admonitions differs from the python-markdown version

We have a custom plugin (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4efbb90719a661226b455d682f5c11f6e3fa768e/scripts/_mdformat_utils.py) which was added a while ago which utilizes this as a library. I'll need to look into why that is so and if we can remove it. I don't think that should affect this but I might be wrong.

cc @augustelalande who (I think) wrote that script.

You may not need that custom script anymore because the latest version of `mdformat` reduces false positives for text escaping.

You can verify with:

```sh
> echo 'this > that or [that]' | uvx --with='mdformat==0.7.18' mdformat -
this \< that or \[that\]
> echo 'this > that or [that]' | uvx --with='mdformat==0.7.19' mdformat -
this > that or [that]
```

I tested locally, and after changes, pre-commit and the generate_mkdocs scripts work without issue: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15020/files
