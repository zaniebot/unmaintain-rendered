            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2203</p>
<p>The underlying issue was that the parser discarded any parsed decorators if they weren't followed by a function or class declaration because it had no place to attach them.</p>
<p>This PR synthesizes a function definition for decorators that aren't followed by a declaration. It feels a bit weird but I think it's fine. It isn't really much different from what we do for:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@decorator
def
</code></pre>
<p>where the function statement only consists of the <code>def</code> keyword. The only real difference is that what follows is completely made up. We have zero information that it's going to be a function definition. However, it shouldn't matter.</p>
<p>If it turns out that it does matter, we could then do what TypeScript does and introduce a <code>MissingDeclaration</code> node, which signifies that we expect the next thing to be a declaration but don't know what kind. I prefer to wait to introduce this node until we have a use case where making up a function is problematic.</p>
<p>Another alternative would be to convert the decorators into a sequence of <code>ExprStmt</code>. However, this complicates parsing a lot because we can only return a single statement where <code>parse_decorators</code> is called.</p>
<p>There's an existing comment suggesting synthesizing a binary expression using the <code>@</code> operator (which lacks the left-hand side). While this has the advantage that the synthesized node doesn't have an empty range, it doesn't feel much different from synthesizing a function. We make up a node, but it's very unlikely the user intended to write a binary expression, which can confuse downstream tools.</p>
<p>This PR also fixes the completion rendering in the playground to include the <code>=</code> for keyword arguments.</p>

<p>Nice. <code>True</code> still isn't suggested as a completion suggestion inside <code>@dataclass(frozen=Tr&lt;CURSOR&gt;)</code> (in the playground or VSCode), and the <code>=</code> is back to not being rendered on the completion label in the playground, but I can now hit &quot;enter&quot; on the playground after <code>@dataclass(frozen=True)</code> without <code>operator.truediv</code> being auto-imported 😆 And that would have been <em>very</em> annoying, so that seems like the most important thing</p>

<p>I believe this is unrelated and due to a bug in completions that causes suggestions inside decorator statements to be pruned a bit too aggressively. This can be reproduced on https://play.ty.dev/</p>
