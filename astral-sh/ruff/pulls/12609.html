            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>If a virtual environment&#x27;s <code>pyvenv.cfg</code> file contains the line <code>include-system-site-packages = true</code>, anything installed in the system Python installation&#x27;s site-packages directory will be accessible when the virtual environment is activated, <em>as well as</em> anything inside the virtual environment&#x27;s site-packages directory. That means that we could have 0, 1, or many <code>site-packages</code> directories that we&#x27;d need to consider as search paths -- currently we only contemplate the <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> possibilities. As such, it makes sense for the <code>site_packages</code> field on <code>Program</code> to be a <code>Vec</code> rather than an <code>Option</code>. This is the first commit of this PR.</p>
<p>The second commit of the PR updates some of the logic in the resolver to reflect the fact that if there are two <code>site-packages</code> directories on <code>sys.path</code> at runtime, any editable installs provided via <code>.pth</code> files in the first <code>site-packages</code> directory will take precedence over the second <code>site-packages</code> directory when it comes to module resolution.</p>
Test plan
<p><code>cargo test</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The paths in <code>Program</code> all must be resolved or it will be impossible to implement persistent caching. That means, any python and site package discovery <strong>must</strong> happen before setting the search paths on <code>Program</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense to me, but then I don&#x27;t understand why we&#x27;re setting <code>SystemPathBuf</code>s (which represent unvalidated, unresolved search paths) on <code>Program</code> at all, rather than <code>SearchPath</code>s (which represent validated, resolved search paths).

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The reason why I think we should do the validation outside of salsa is because I consider failing to resolve Python a fatal error. See this comment <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12376">astral-sh/ruff#12376</a>#issuecomment-2247800148</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I want to avoid making any changes that need to be undone when migrating to this model.</p>
<p>I also strongly prefer avoiding any refactors until we&#x27;ve figured out the error handling. We should instead focus on shipping the features that we&#x27;ve set out for this week.</p>

<p>Failing to resolve Python is a very different thing to failing to resolve the site-packages directories from a resolved path to a Python executable.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, but this is one of the features that I set out for the week, that we agreed a couple of weeks ago that it would be good for me to work on 😅</p>
<p>I&#x27;m okay with putting off larger refactors for now, but it&#x27;s unclear to me how to complete work on deriving site-packages from a Python executable unless we&#x27;re agreed on where that logic should be. Anyway, I can do other work for now, and we can discuss in Runes planning tomorrow.</p>
<p>I did some interesting work today experimenting with broader refactors — I&#x27;m very unsure what I have locally is the way we want to go, but I think it was interesting anyway. I&#x27;ll put it up tomorrow so you can see.</p>

<p>(In an LSP context, I definitely think it <em>shouldn&#x27;t</em> be fatal if e.g. the user deactivates a virtual environment so we try to fall back to the system site-packages directory instead, and we can&#x27;t. But I think we agree on that.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can&#x27;t imagine lazy iteration of <code>.pth</code> files saves us anything at all in any realistic scenario. It would require that there is a site-packages path, with editables installed into it, that the project never actually imports anything from; all imports are first-party. So yeah, I&#x27;d favor simplifying by just collecting all search paths eagerly.</p>
