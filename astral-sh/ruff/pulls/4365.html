            <div class="timeline-body"><p>#3511 mentioned some false positives for Bandit's &quot;hardcoded password&quot; rules. I think the confusion is that those rules test the <em>target</em> to determine whether a string might be a hardcoded password, but the diagnostics report the <em>value</em>. So, e.g., if you have <code>api_token = &quot;foo&quot;</code>, it tells you that there's a <code>Possible hardcoded password: &quot;foo&quot;</code>, rather than that the cause is assigning to <code>api_token</code>.</p>
<p>There are still some false positives (e.g., in torchmetrics, they have <code>split_token</code>, which gets flagged here), but we can only avoid those via special-casing. Making the diagnostics clearer at least provides the proper context.</p>
<p>Closes #3511.</p>
