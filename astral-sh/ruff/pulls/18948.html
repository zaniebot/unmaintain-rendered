            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR updates our unpacking assignment logic to use the new tuple machinery. As a result, we can now unpack variable-length tuples correctly.</p>
<p>As part of this, the <code>TupleSpec</code> classes have been renamed to <code>Tuple</code>, and can now contain any element (Rust) type, not just <code>Type&lt;'db&gt;</code>. The unpacker uses a tuple of <code>UnionBuilder</code>s to maintain the types that will be assigned to each target, as we iterate through potentially many union elements on the rhs. We also add a new consuming iterator for tuples, and update the <code>all_elements</code> methods to wrap the result in an enum (similar to <code>itertools::Position</code>) letting you know which part of the tuple each element appears in. I also added a new <code>UnionBuilder::try_build</code>, which lets you specify a different fallback type if the union contains no elements.</p>

<p>It feels like a fair amount of complexity was introduced to our tuple representation in order to support it also representing a tuple of union-builders. I think this is probably still simpler / less duplicative than having a separate unpack-targets implementation, but it seems like some of this complexity currently leaks out to external users of tuple types.

<p>I tweaked some things to make this less impactful on the existing <code>Type</code>-tuple callers. The main difference now is just that the iterators return <code>&amp;Type</code> instead of <code>Type</code>, so there are some additional copies.</p>
<p>I also separated out the <code>unpack_tuple</code> logic into two steps: resizing the rhs tuple of types to have the same length as the lhs tuple of targets, and then pairwise adding each type to the target <code>UnionBuilder</code>. I think the new <code>resize</code> method will also be helpful in the forthcoming PR to splat arguments into parameters.</p>
