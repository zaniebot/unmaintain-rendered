<p>Closes #16949</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Add a rule that checks that only a single <code>yield</code> statement is in <code>@contextlib.contextmanager</code> or <code>@contextlib.asynccontextmanager</code> decorated functions.</p>
<p>Later <code>yield</code> statements are executed in the cleanup stage of the contextmanager and result in a <code>RuntimeError</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager">docs</a></p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>I reused the <code>function_def_visit_preorder_except_body</code> from the <code>unused_async.rs</code> rule and moved it to <code>helpers.rs</code> alongside <code>class_def_visit_preorder_except_body</code>. While I don't use the latter, I moved both to maintain code locality.</li>
</ul>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added a testing fixture and <code>cargo insta</code> snapshot.</p>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've looked through these ecosystem changes.
They all come from branches in the control flow like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@contextmanager
def context():
   print(&quot;setup&quot;)
   if condition:
       print(&quot;condition&quot;)
       yield
   else:
       print(&quot;not condition&quot;)
       yield
    print(&quot;teardown&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The current implementation does not check for this; it should. I'm working on it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can we run the ecosystem tests again?</p>
<p>I try running them locally but get the same issues as #10436 (<code>error: invalid value 'RUF9' for '--ignore &lt;RULE_CODE&gt;'</code> in all repo's). It doesn't seem related to my changes and I also get the failure on the commit that passed in CI.
If you have any pointers how to fix that, I would greatly appreciate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>RUF9</code> rules are only available in test builds, so you have to build in the test or maybe dev profile. I've run into this a bit myself and don't remember exactly the command I ran to avoid it :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>The ecosystem checks should rerun automatically and update the comment. Are you seeing stale results? You could try pushing an empty commit to retrigger it, but CI might also check if relevant files changed, I'd have to double check.</p>
<p>I'll try to give this a review in the next day or two!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you've picked a really tough rule to implement because it requires such a careful analysis of control flow. I added a minimized version of the first ecosystem hit as a test case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@contextlib.contextmanager
def foo():
    if False:
        yield 1
        return
    yield 2
</code></pre>
<p>and it is a real false positive.</p>
<p>I think this rule's implementation might be simplified by the control flow graph work being tracked in #17065, so I'd probably recommend holding off on this for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for your work here and apologies for not noticing this or commenting on the issue earlier!</p>
<p>For now, the main other thing you could do is just go through the ecosystem results and see if there are any other interesting test cases. The two I randomly picked also had this early return form, so they may make up a majority of false positives.</p>
</div>
        </div>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/maxmynter">@maxmynter</a> on 2025-04-16 08:57</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I went through the ecosystem changes. Most are the return case you describe. Sometimes a little more complex:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    yield
finally:
    return
</code></pre>
<p>So an implementation that tracks returns over control flow branches would also need to consider cases like this one where the return does not follow in the same block.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/21e47ac0b39dc07122b67a95f0e92abd162a746f/ibis/backends/athena/__init__.py#L286">two</a> <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/440864e7c92511f1181899133d5cc87b4988dfdc/zerver/lib/context_managers.py#L36">other</a> <code>try</code>-<code>except</code> blocks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    yield 1
except:
    yield 2
</code></pre>
<p>which in principle is a true positive. If the <code>try</code> fails after the <code>yield</code>, there would be a second one in the <code>except</code> block.</p>
<p>However, I think it's a reasonable assumption that in the context of an <code>@contextmanager</code> the error prone code is prior to the <code>yield</code>.
Then we can assume that the control flow either passes the <code>yield</code>s in <code>try</code>-<code>else</code>-<code>finally</code> or <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>finally</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As for the ecosystem changes. No they are not stale for me. I think i got sidetracked by this <code>RUF9</code> error and not being able to execute locally.</p>

<p>You're certainly welcome to keep working on it, but I think it will be easier to implement and to review once we have more general control-flow graph support.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep that's the hope! However the initial version will probably have simplified handling for <code>try</code> statements (since those are quite the quagmire); I also haven't actually thought much about <code>yield</code> statements so it's possible I haven't modeled them correctly 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks Dylan!</p>
<p>I'd still lean towards waiting on the separate CFG work, and then the rule will grow capabilities as the CFG infrastructure improves, but I'm open to other thoughts too. The extra unit tests from the ecosystem check will still be very helpful for knowing where we stand throughout the process.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @ntBre, I saw your note but i've learned quite a bit in implementing this. That's why I went with <a href="https://astral-sh.notion.site/Astral-s-Values-0ed6a642bcc84e91af6836b2373572f5">bias toward action</a> knowing I'm happier with a working implementation that's idle for roadmap reasons, than to abandon this half finished.
I also think it would be cool to have a substantial rule contributed to ruff  🤩 (i made <code>RUF102</code> last week, but it's rather simple).</p>
<p>In the latest commit's i've changed to the assumption that any failures in a <code>try</code> block happen before a <code>yield</code>.
This is also my recommentation. I think it's a sensible hypothesis in the context of <code>@contextmanager</code> and otherwise we would either just accumulate over branches (with many false positives) or have special cases for pre/post <code>yield</code> errors which let's complexity of the implementation explode.</p>
<p>It seems that this adresses the ecosystem change issues.</p>
<p>So if you are up for it I would love to try to get this over the finish line. Of course, I understand if you have too much on your plate or just want to wait. That's a risk I took willingly.</p>
<p>In that case, @dylwil3, What is the timeline for #17065?
I'm full time on OSS contributions for another three weeks and if it's done in time, I would love another jab at this one using the CFG. Also let me know if I can help with this or in any other capacity!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The goal is to have the stacked PRs ready to review by Monday - but it's hard to predict with confidence the timeline after that since it depends on the results of code review. Optimistically, a reasonable implementation will be merged in by the following Monday which you can then play with here.</p>

<p>Absolutely! At the moment there's a few parts of the design that I'd like to stabilize, but then I'd be happy to help divvy up the work - thanks for offering!</p>

<p>I'll mark this as draft until then and this probably doesn't need a review before the CFG is ready (unless of course someone is bored; in that case i'd appreciate any pointers to improve my Rust).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@maxmynter as these things go sometimes, CFG work has been slowed in favor of some higher priority tasks. My apologies! I'm personally okay with moving forward with the rule as it currently exists as long as we feel confident about getting no/rare false positives (this is preferred even if it means having more false negatives).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is this condition ever transiently <code>true</code> while traversing and then reset back to <code>false</code>? I'm wondering because an alternative approach here would be to store a <code>&amp;Checker</code> in the <code>YieldPathTracker</code> and call <code>report_diagnostic</code> as soon as we see an extra yield. I think this would have two main benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can emit multiple diagnostics if there are more than two <code>yield</code>s</li>
<li>We can capture a more helpful diagnostic range from the problematic <code>yield</code> statement</li>
</ol>
<p>And a third point closely related to these is that we're currently refactoring our diagnostic infrastructure in a way that should allow us to attach multiple spans/pieces of info to a diagnostic soon. We could potentially emit a multi-part diagnostic here with pieces like:</p>
<ul>
<li>This <code>yield</code> in</li>
<li>This context manager is an error because of</li>
<li>This earlier <code>yield</code> in the same path</li>
</ul>
<p>each with their own range/code snippet, which would be pretty cool. We can't do that now, but I feel like the <code>&amp;Checker</code> approach would make that change easy in the future.</p>

<p>I also think this type could use some docs explaining the meaning of the stacks and how they are modified while traversing the AST. I'm writing this before reading much of the code below, but I'm also wondering if these stacks are manipulated independently or if it might make more sense to have a single stack of something like <code>Scope</code>s, where each scope has its own <code>yields</code> and <code>returns</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The heuristic of this rule assumes that an error in a <code>try/except</code> occurs before the yield statement. Thus it's assumes the data flow and thus yield accumulation to either follow <code>try-&gt;else-&gt;finally</code> or <code>except-&gt;finally</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore this is valid but those two aren't:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># (15) Invalid: Unguarded yield in finally
@contextlib.contextmanager
def yield_in_finally():
    try:
        yield
    except:
        pass
    else:
        return
    finally:
        yield

# (16) Invalid: No returning except accumulates yields
@contextlib.contextmanager
def yield_in_no_return_except():
    try:
        pass
    except:
        yield
    else:
        yield
        return
    yield
</code></pre>
<p>I agree about the comments though. They are stale. An earlier version of the rule was also accumulating <code>yields</code> in the full <code>try-&gt;except-&gt;else-&gt;finally</code> path. But this had changes in the ecosystem tests for cases like these:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
     some_flaky_setup()
     yield &quot;success&quot;
except CommonFlakinessError:
    yield &quot;alternative&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore I moved this from invalid to valid cases. The same is true for the 3 succeeding test cases. I removed all the stale <code>#RUF060</code> comments there too.</p>
<p>I think in the context of a contextmanager it makes sense, that the error prone code preceds the <code>yield</code> and we only count <code>yield</code>s in the abovementioned path.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>
<h2>Ok to only report along max yield path?</h2>
<p>Currently, we accumulate <code>yields</code> greedily. Therefore we can only report diagnostics for yields along this path. Eg. here</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># (12) Invalid: Multiple yields in complex try/except/else/finally
@contextlib.contextmanager
def complex_try_except_else_finally(condition):
    try:
        if condition:
            yield &quot;in try if&quot;
        else:
            yield &quot;in try else&quot;
    except ValueError:
        yield &quot;in ValueError&quot;  # Unreported RUF062; only report on max yield path
    except TypeError:
        yield &quot;in TypeError&quot;  # Unreported RUF062; only report on max yield path
    else:
        yield &quot;in else&quot;  # RUF062
    finally:
        yield &quot;in finally&quot;  # RUF062
</code></pre>
<p>we only report along the try-else-finally pathway. Is that fine or should we accumulate all?
Computationally this may become more complex though as we multiply the number of scopes at every branch instead of only taking the maximum path.</p>
<p>In the above example we would need to track along the <code>try -&gt; ValueError -&gt; finally</code>, <code>try -&gt; TypeError -&gt; finally</code>, and <code>try -&gt; else -&gt; finally</code> pathways. Without it, not all offending violations are marked. However, fixing iteratively will eventually adress all violations.</p>
<h2>Don't report on yield followed by break in loop?</h2>
<p>Implementing this is quite involved because we would need to recursively check the body of the loop and the contained expressions while keeping track of their order. This breaks the symmetry on yield check. Thus,  we  would need to check for being nested in a loop everywhere and . if we are, check for a succeeding <code>break</code>. This also needs us to track the order in which we encounter the <code>yield</code> / <code>break</code>s.</p>
<p>Given we found no loops in the ecosystem checks (and <code>yield</code> out of a loop in a <code>contextmanager</code> decorated function is unorthodox, they are only allowed to yield once), I would suggest one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the heuristic and report yields in loops, users can <code># noqa</code> if they need to,</li>
<li>Drop the heuristic and ignore the fact that loops are repeatedly executed. We would just check the enclosed control flow like we do with e.g. <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would lean toward two because false positives are annoying. But i'm hesitant for the complexity added by adressing yield given that we did not see it occur anywhere.</p>
<p>If we really want to include the loop check, I would like that in a separate PR because this one is big already.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

    Rename `visit_preorder` to `visit_source_order` (#17046)

    ## Summary

    We renamed the `PreorderVisitor` to `SourceOrderVisitor` a long time ago
    but it seems that we missed to rename the `visit_preorder` functions to
    `visit_source_order`.
    This PR renames `visit_preorder` to `visit_source_order`

<p>We need a HashMap to track offending expressions as every expression can be part of multiple paths which may or may not be violating the rule. Thus they may be added repeatedly.</p>
<p>I now use the expressions to add the diagnostic at the specific <code>yield</code> instead of the full function.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(I'm finally taking a look at this today, thanks again for your work here!)</p>
<p>To your questions, I think it <em>would</em> be nice to report all of the violations, if it's not too much more programming work. I think we generally like to avoid situations where fixing one issue &quot;creates&quot; a second one that we didn't report initially. I don't think this is a blocker, though.</p>
<p>And I think I agree with you about not worrying about <code>break</code>. I had just reviewed a rule where <code>break</code> and <code>return</code> were also being used and the test cases here brought it to mind, but that would seem like a strange pattern in a context manager, as you said.</p>
<p>I'll take another look at the rest of the code now!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This check pops up in a lot of places, which doesn't feel quite right to me. I think a nicer API, if it's possible, would be to have <code>add_yield</code> perform this check. That way you don't have to worry about this in so many places, you just call <code>add_yield</code> whenever you encounter one, and a diagnostic is emitted if appropriate.</p>

<li>use a collection-emission pattern for the yield counting.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not really buying the separation of concerns thing here. To me, the whole concern is to emit diagnostics, so I think it makes sense to have the checker here and emit diagnostics as we find them. I tried this again locally, and it's both less code and avoids allocating an intermediate <code>Vec</code> if we just embed the <code>Checker</code>, which I think makes it a clear win.</p>

<p>All of my minor concerns are resolved, but I'm still thinking the implementation is more complicated than it needs to be. This is kind of a generalization of my comment below, but I just started deleting chunks of code and all of our tests still pass. Here's the patch I was working on locally:</p>

<p>My main thinking boils down to this: we're already using the <code>Scope</code> pushing and popping to manage scopes, and we're calling <code>add_yield</code> every time we encounter a <code>yield</code> expression, so it seems to me that we shouldn't have to do any post-processing on the nodes, we just push a <code>yield</code> every time we encounter it and emit a diagnostic if we've already seen too many in this <code>Scope</code>. You can see this in my <code>add_yield</code> implementation in the patch, which I think you already had mostly the same version of, I just tried to use it a bit more aggressively, I think:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    fn add_yield(&amp;mut self, expr: &amp;'a Expr) {
        if let Some(scope) = self.scopes.last_mut() {
            scope.yield_expressions.push(expr);
            if scope.yields_excessively() {
                self.emit_violation(expr);
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>If we call this every time we encounter a <code>yield</code> expression, and we've set up our <code>Scope</code> stack correctly, won't we automatically emit a violation in each of the correct places?</p>
<p>I could be wrong and just confused about all of the various <code>emit_*</code> and <code>handle_*</code> and <code>propagate</code> functions, but intuitively this is what I was expecting.</p>
<p>In any case, the code I deleted is not being tested, so we may need more extensive test coverage to make sure it's actually needed.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to keep dragging this out, I was hoping to approve and merge this today. I'm happy to keep playing with the code until I convince myself it's correct if I'm off base here.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>If we <code>break</code> then the <code>else</code> doesn't execute and we need to clear the <code>yield</code> from the else branch to not further accumulate them. Otherwise we would get a false positive on the next one.</p>
<p>We did say earlier that we don't want logic handling yields in loop bodies and heuristically assume them to happen multiple times. But I would argue that this here is a different case.</p>
<p>Applications for this pattern could be if we <a href="https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/for_-_else.html#else-clause">search</a> for a specific item in <code>something()</code>.</p>
<p>We should definitely add a test case for this.</p>
<p>Note: we can get rid of the scope clearing after the <code>finally</code> block because that always executes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you, @ntBre , for being pedantic. I'm learning a lot here. Plus, in this case it wasn't, I found edge cases this didn't handle before. And it should definitely not be possible to delete core logic without tests breaking.</p>
<p>So what changed?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Removed Tracker / Reporter Seperation</strong>: Embedded <code>Checker</code> directly and removed intermediate <code>violations</code> storing</li>
<li><strong>Simplified scope management</strong>: Switched from tracking expression references to simple yield counts</li>
<li><strong>Reworked visitor logic</strong>: Now only relies on <code>visit_stmt</code> and <code>visit_expr</code>, removed complex path-building methods and ~170 lines while keeping parity in logic</li>
<li><strong>Added 18 more test cases</strong> including the loop-else-break scenario</li>
<li><strong>Fixed false positives</strong>: Now correctly ignores <code>yield</code>s in <code>lambda</code> and generators</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the complexity around <code>try-except</code> is warranted. Mainly due to the fact that <code>finally</code> executes even when previous <code>try</code> or <code>except</code> branches <code>return</code>. We need to keep track of this state to know if we should continue to accumulate <code>yields</code> after the finally or if the branch is guarded by a <code>return</code>.</p>
