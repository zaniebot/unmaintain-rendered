            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The basics here look good, but there are a few more places we have to account for <code>pyw</code> files.</p>
<p>One such place is <code>PySourceType</code>. It's heavily used internally to query whether a file is a Python file, a stub file, or a notebook. We need to decide if we need to add a new variant or if it's okay to add <code>pyw</code> to <code>py</code> (might not be okay if <code>PySourceType</code> is used in any module resolution logic as <code>pyw</code> files aren't importable as far as I know). This will require reviewing where <code>PySourceType</code> is used (and how).</p>
<p>It might also be good to do a quick search for &quot;.py&quot; (or &quot;pyi&quot; because there are fewer instances) to see if there are other places where we check for the extension that need updating.</p>

<p>I tried looking through various places where this is used, but there really is an overwhelming number of places where it's used that I don't have context on, but what I've looked at so far usually seems reasonable.</p>
<p>I went ahead and added the mapping to the existing <code>Python</code> enum, and tests are passing, but I don't have a good idea what sort of tests I could add to help give signal on whether that is sufficient, or how to compare that with the alternative of adding a new enum type.</p>
<p>That said, I'm also not sure what you mean by &quot;module resolution logic&quot;, so if you can suggest specific crates/files to look at more closely, I'd be happy to dig further.</p>

<p>I did do that originally, though I searched for <code>ipynb</code> instead, but apparently I missed the exact one place that <code>PySourceType</code> showed up in the gigantic list of results. 😅🫠</p>

<p>Yeah, same here. We don't need to study each line for a very long time. It's okay if we miss something.</p>
<p>I only did a quick search. Most usages indeed do look good. The one I think we need to take a closer look is</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/b0279265e82903b57bb32f8bf04a2962740c5a8f/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_no_pep420/rules/implicit_namespace_package.rs#L72-L73</p>
<p>because it tries to resemble python's module resolution at runtime.</p>
