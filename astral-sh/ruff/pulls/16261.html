            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR prefixes the <code>Type::call</code> and <code>dunder_call</code> methods with <code>try</code> to make it more explicit that they return a <code>Result</code>
and add <code>call</code> and <code>dunder_call</code> methods that return the return-type without a <code>Result</code>. These new methods are intended
to be used outside of type checking.</p>
<p>This follows an existing pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also have Class::try_mro() and Class::mro(), which are similar. And Class::try_metaclass() / Class::metaclass()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main motivation for this change is https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16238 because it is somewhat common to call <code>bool</code> outside
of type checking -- Making it desirable to have to dedicated methods for it. Splitting the methods also helps improving performance
because we can skip some analysis when we don't care about errors.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The renaming of the existing methods to <code>Type::try_call()</code>, <code>Type::try_call_bound</code> and <code>Type::try_call_dunder</code> makes sense to me. I'm not sure I see the motivation for adding the unused <code>Type::call()</code>, <code>Type::call_dunder</code> and <code>Type::call_bound</code> methods, though. They seem like they should be fairly easy to add if we ever need them?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it helps establish the pattern and it more clearly communicates the idea. It also provides a place to document where they should be used. My last argument is that I'm often too lazy to add methods like this if I have to use them the first time and I only add them if I rewrote the same code like 10 times. Maybe that's a good thing but I want to take that burden from future me.</p>
<p>But I don't feel strongly. Removing them just means that we'll have some <code>op</code> <code>try_op</code> pairs whereas other methods don't. Which seems inconsistent (I like symmetry, you know ;))</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I lean towards leaving out the unused methods until we need them, since we should usually encourage people to use the methods that return <code>Result</code>s in most contexts anyway. But I also don't feel too strongly :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like the pattern, but I also think that we should omit methods that we don't currently need (and IMO it is not clear if we will ever need them.) I think the existence of <code>try_call</code> already strongly implies the pattern even if <code>call</code> doesn't exist (yet).</p>
<p>This will cause more rebase pain for @sharkdp on the descriptors PR :)</p>
