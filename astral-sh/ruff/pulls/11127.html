            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Okay, I must admit this PR does more than what the title says.</p>
<p>The changes not covered by the title are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It adds a new <code>lint_syntax</code> method that performs two checks. It mainly serves to see if file changes are correctly picked up. The implemented checks are:</li>
<li>Whether any line contains more than 88 characters (yeah, it should be the line width, but I didn&#x27;t bother for the prototype)</li>
<li>Whether any string literal uses single quotes instead of double quotes (again, a very dumb implementation. It even flags strings that contain double quotes, which normally would be considered okay)</li>
<li>It changes <code>Source</code> to use <code>SourceKind</code> instead of always an <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code>. This is necessary to support IPython notebooks. There&#x27;s absolutely no good reason why this is part of this PR and I&#x27;m happy to split it out if people find that useful. I think it doesn&#x27;t matter much.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main change of the PR is that red-knot now accepts an &quot;entry path&quot; and runs the analysis in watch mode. This is interesting because it tackles a few challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to wait for file changes or until the user presses Ctrl+C without using a spin loop. That&#x27;s not conceptually difficult, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never done before, so it took me a few approaches to get it right.</li>
<li>How can we ensure that we get a mutable reference to <code>program</code> after all scheduled analysis have been completed</li>
<li>How to cancel pending analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m undecided if the ultimate goal should be that this code is isolated and reused across the LSP, CLI watch mode and regular CLI. It would certainly be nice, but I could also see this be part of the &quot;Host&quot; specific code, and each host should have as much flexibility as possible to implement the most efficient scheduling for its needs.</p>
<p>Future Improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should ignore changes to files that are ignored in the settings and isn&#x27;t a dependency of Program</li>
<li>The current error handling is mostly unwrapping. We should do better.</li>
<li>File watching...: Correctly handle folders, new files, cases where a user deletes a file and creates a folder with the same name etc.</li>
<li>The invalidation logic requires more love, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s important to fully implement it right now because the PR proves the important point, that we can get a mutable Program (db)</li>
</ul>
Test plan
<p>I ran the CLI locally, then made changes to the test file by adding a new single quoted string and I then verified that the console showed the new diagnostic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I think what I want to do tomorrow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out if we can move the orchestration thread out of the main loop. I suspect that this should be straightforward by adding one more channel :laughing:</li>
<li>Add a <code>program.check(context)</code> and <code>program.check_file(id, context)</code> functions and move the logic for checking a program there. The <code>context</code> would expose a method to schedule a dependency so that it&#x27;s up to the host to decide if that should run on the same thread (queuing) or on a thread pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: I think I should also be able to move the <code>Arc&lt;AtomicUsize&gt;</code> counting the pending analysis into the orchestrator by adding a new <code>StartAnalysis</code> message (it means some more messaging but it allows isolating the logic and I could even use a regular <code>usize</code>)</p>

<p>I didn&#x27;t carefully follow every detail in <code>main.rs</code>; hoping that as you mentioned some of that will get broken up and be a little easier to follow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, not sure. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something I want to drip Ruff over. I think we probably want a <code>Change</code> that means <code>anything</code> happened to the file so that we can take the most defensive invalidation for that file.</p>

<p>All good. I&#x27;m not in a rush. Having the review next morning is still a perfectly quick review and I should have tagged you as reviewer! Thank you</p>
