            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, the reason I haven't gotten around to reviewing this (shame 🙈) is that I don't feel super qualified to comment on whether it's a useful rule, whether it'll have high accuracy and precision, and so on. I'd love to see this implemented in Bandit as a reference to guide us... But, from the Bandit issue, it seems like there's no clear timeline on when that would happen.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>bandit won't ever do it probably. The future is also <code>ruff</code>. I won't re-implement the same in Python for bandit.</p>

<p>hmm, I could ask people from my own company. And I asked here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/2811#issuecomment-1644006896</p>

<p>In my opinion, I think the best way to handle (SQL, command, ssh, LDAP, etc) injection issues would be to make use of Taint Analysis. But to do so, requires Bandit to maintain a symbol table and possible a call flow graph.</p>
