Now that we track all bindings from nested scopes, it could be practical to allow <code>global</code> variables without an explicit definition in the module scope. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    global x
    x = 1

def g():
    print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Before:</p>
<pre><code>warning[unresolved-global]: Invalid global declaration of `x`
 --&gt; test.py:2:12
  |
1 | def f():
2 |     global x
  |            ^ `x` has no declarations or bindings in the global scope
3 |     x = 1
  |
info: This limits ty&#x27;s ability to make accurate inferences about the boundness and types of global-scope symbols
info: Consider adding a declaration to the global scope, e.g. `x: int`
info: rule `unresolved-global` is enabled by default

error[unresolved-reference]: Name `x` used when not defined

6 |     print(x)
  |           ^

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I don&#x27;t think we should do this with our current capabilities. For code like this, which works fine at runtime, we&#x27;ll still emit an <code>unresolved-reference</code> diagnostic, and I think that&#x27;s confusing without the <code>unresolved-global</code> diagnostic:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    global x
    x = 42

f()
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>On this branch, we report:</p>
<pre><code>error[unresolved-reference]: Name `x` used when not defined
 --&gt; foo.py:6:7
  |
5 | f()
6 | print(x)
  |       ^
  |
info: rule `unresolved-reference` is enabled by default
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, as you pointed out, the query in <code>re_exports</code> still won&#x27;t take account of any <code>global</code> symbols in nested scopes -- it deliberately doesn&#x27;t recurse into subscopes when attempting to find symbols that might be imported by a <code>*</code> import.</p>
<p>Changing either of those pieces of behaviour is something we could consider doing, but each would be somewhat involved and would have tradeoffs to consider. I don&#x27;t think we should remove the <code>unresolved-global</code> lint unless we do both of them, however.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense, and I think it&#x27;s reasonable to close this as a won&#x27;t-fix-for-now-at-least.</p>
<p>But now you&#x27;ve got me thinking about how we currently define the &quot;public type&quot;. Right now we have two notions, as I understand them:</p>
<ul>
<li>the &quot;local type&quot;(?) taking account of control flow through the local scope</li>
<li>the &quot;public type&quot; taking account of all reachable bindings in the current scope, and now/soon unioning that with all reachable bindings in nested scopes</li>
</ul>
<p>What if there was a third notion?</p>
<ul>
<li>the union of all reachable bindings in nested scopes <em>only</em> (not including the current scope)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then maybe when inferring the local type (i.e. calling <code>infer_local_place_load</code> from <code>infer_place_load</code>), we could fall back to nested bindings <em>only</em> (not later bindings in the current scope) when a local variable is unbound or possibly unbound? For example, we currently do this:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    global x
    x = 42
reveal_type(x)  # Unknown (unbound)
f()
reveal_type(x)  # Unknown (unbound)              &lt;-- false positive
if secrets.randbelow(2):
    x = 1
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[1] (possibly unbound)  &lt;-- incomplete
x = 2
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[2]
f()
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[2]                     &lt;-- incorrect
</code></pre>
<p>But if we wanted to, I think we could achieve this without any new analysis:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    global x
    x = 42
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[42] (possibly unbound)  &lt;-- false negative
f()
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[42] (possibly unbound)
if secrets.randbelow(2):
    x = 1
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[42, 1] (possibly unbound)
x = 2
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[2]
f()
reveal_type(x)  # Literal[2]                      &lt;-- incorrect
</code></pre>
<p>Would that be worth pursuing? My default reaction is actually no (this is making things more complicated, and I&#x27;m not sure how common it is to see code that benefits from any of this), but let me know what you think.</p>

<p>Well, maybe -- it does if the function that sets the global has been executed before the import occurs, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t. So I guess we could consider it a &quot;possibly bound&quot; symbol.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we probably should fix the <em>incorrect</em> results in the above examples (not necessarily right now, but at some point). I&#x27;m not that tempted by the exact change proposed above because it doesn&#x27;t achieve that. (It&#x27;s not clear to me why the nonlocal writes should be considered if the name is locally unbound, but not otherwise.)</p>
<p>The <em>simplest</em> (but imprecise) way to do that is to union all inferred types of names that have nonlocal bindings with a possible binding of <code>Unknown</code>. This is basically &quot;pretend we can&#x27;t see what exactly the nonlocal bindings are, but we know they exist and therefore the name can be bound to <em>some</em> new value from outside the scope&quot;, which is how we handle external writes to fully public scopes like classes or modules (where it really isn&#x27;t feasible for us to see all the possible writes). But it feels weird to do this when in this case we clearly can see the precise nonlocal writes, and we do take them into account in the public type, just not in the local types.</p>
<p>The other approach (which would not be that hard; you were going to do it in the previous PR until I said not to bother) would be to <em>always</em> include nonlocal bindings as part of the possible type for any use of a local name. This is not wrong, but I&#x27;m worried about false positives if we just do that much without more precision.</p>
<p>We could perhaps improve this by considering the creation of any nested scope with any nonlocal writes to a symbol to be a conditional write to that symbol in the local scope&#x27;s control flow. That would mean we would only consider those nonlocal writes in places in control flow that are reachable from the definition of the nested scope. I think this is probably the best answer, but it definitely makes it a bit more complicated to implement.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think we should prioritize any of this right now; I&#x27;d rather have our priorities driven by real-world bug reports. But I will open an issue to track it.</p>
