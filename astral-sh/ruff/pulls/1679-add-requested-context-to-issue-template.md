[Issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) have better UX, for example: https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml

I did consider that... but I kind of intentionally wanted to keep the issue template very lightweight, and I worry that issue forms introduces more mental overhead.

I think we should move `CONTRIBUTING.md` back out of `.github` next to the `README.md` ... I think it's very much standard to have the file in the root of the repository ... I have never seen it in `.github/` ... I think we should make the file easily discoverable ... I was just confused where the file had gone.

Sure, that's fine.
