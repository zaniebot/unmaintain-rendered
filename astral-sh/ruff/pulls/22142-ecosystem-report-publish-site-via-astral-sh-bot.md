# Ecosystem report: publish site via astral-sh-bot

---

_Pull request opened by @woodruffw on 2025-12-22 15:59_

## Summary

Moves the periodic ecosystem report's publication to astral-sh-bot, rather than publishing it directly via the workflow.

Similar vein as #22098.

## Test Plan

Manually by yours truly. ~~WIP while I dispatch events manually.~~
