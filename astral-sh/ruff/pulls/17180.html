<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>part of: #15655</p>
<p>I tried generating the source order function using code generation. I tried a simple approach, but it is not enough to generate all of them this way.</p>
<p>There is one good thing, that most of the implementations are fine with this. We only have a few that are not. So one benefit of this PR could be it eliminates a lot of the code, hence changing the AST structure will only leave a few places to be fixed.</p>
<p>The <code>source_order</code> field determines if a node requires a source order implementation. If it’s empty it means source order does not visit anything.</p>
<p>Initially I didn’t want to repeat the field names. But I found two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ExprIf</code> statement unlike other statements does not have the fields defined in source order. This and also some fields do not need to be included in the visit. So we just need a way to determine order, and determine presence.</li>
<li>Relying on the fields sounds more complicated to me. Maybe another solution is to add a new attribute <code>order</code> to each field? I'm open to suggestions.
But anyway, except for the <code>ExprIf</code> we don't need to write the field names in order. Just knowing what fields must be visited are enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some nodes had a more complex visitor:</p>
<p><code>ExprCompare</code> required zipping two fields.</p>
<p><code>ExprBoolOp</code> required a match over the fields.</p>
<p><code>FstringValue</code> required a match, I created a new walk_ function that does the match. and used it in code generation. I don’t think this provides real value. Because I mostly moved the code from one file to another. I was tried it as an option. I prefer to leave it in the code as before.</p>
<p>Some visitors visit a slice of items. Others visit a single element. I put a check on this in code generation to see if the field requires a for loop or not. I think better approach is to have a consistent style. So we can by default loop over any field that is a sequence.</p>
<p>For field types <code>StringLiteralValue</code> and <code>BytesLiteralValue</code> the types are not a sequence in toml definition. But they implement <code>iter</code> so they are iterated over. So the code generation does not properly identify this. So in the code I'm checking for their types.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>All the tests should pass without any changes.
I checked the generated code to make sure it's the same as old code. I'm not sure if there's a test for the source order visitor.</p>

<p>I think it's worth finding a way to not have so much repetition between the field list and this new <code>source_order</code> field. Most types want to include all fields in the source order walk, in the same order they appear in the field list. So that should be the default, if <code>source_order</code> is missing.</p>
<p>For types that need special handling (like <code>ExprBoolOp</code>) you could instead have <code>custom_source_order = true</code>.</p>
<p>For fields that shouldn't be included in the walk, you could have a field-level <code>skip_source_order = true</code>.</p>
<p>And for the types whose fields aren't in order, can we just reorder the field list to be in source order? Is there anything else that depends on the current field ordering for e.g. <code>ExprIf</code>? If so (and therefore we can't reorder), then you could have <code>custom_source_order = [&quot;field&quot;, &quot;list&quot;]</code>.  (Or maybe a different name if you don't want to conflict with the first option mentioned above)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like the idea of <code>custom_source_order = true</code>. I think it's fine to hand write the visitor for the few nodes that have fields that need to be skipped or require visiting in a custom ordering.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the source code generators is to avoid boilerplate. Our goal isn't to write a full meta programming language :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the ideas, I added <code>skip_source_order</code> for fields &amp; <code>custom_source_order</code> for nodes. The toml looks less messy now.</p>
<p>I documented the new fields and source order generation.</p>
<p>For <code>ExprIf</code> I updated the field order. The snapshots required an update so I updated them.</p>
<p>(Sorry for the long delay I'll keep it shorter for next round)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be inclined to name the field <code>skip_visit</code> so that it can be shared between source order and the semantic order visitor. Or are there cases where we want to skip a field only in one but not the other (but maybe that's reason enough to hand write the visitor)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could make the generator script more clever and decide to automatically skip fields where the type is a primitive (<code>u32</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code>).

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd prefer to keep the field order as is because it represents the semantic order of the fields and instead override the order with <code>source_order</code>. This should also reduce the size of this diff</p>

<p>I think we should revert the AST field order changes and the changes to the <code>SourceOrderVisitor</code>. This PR should exclusively be around replacing the existing code without changing any semantics (or how structs are laid out in memory).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First off, this mapping is proportional to the number of types that fields can have, not proportional to the number of fields themselves or syntax nodes, so it's less worrisome to spell out all of the options. We already do that, for instance, in the definition of <code>SourceOrderVisitor</code>, since we have to explicitly list all of the <code>visit_[foo]</code> methods that a consumer might want to implement.</p>
<p>That said, I agree with Micha's suggestion to make this mapping only include the exceptions if possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's also another option, which I don't know yet if I <em>like</em>. But I want to write it up to see what I feel about it.</p>
<p>You could also do this with a trait over in <code>source_order.rs</code>, that is implemented for each possible field type, and encodes how to turn that into a method call on the visitor. So something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">trait FieldVisitor {
    fn visit&lt;'a, V: SourceOrderVisitor&lt;'a&gt;&gt;(&amp;'a self, visitor: &amp;mut V);
}

impl FieldVisitor for Decorator {
    fn visit&lt;'a, V: SourceOrderVisitor&lt;'a&gt;&gt;(&amp;'a self, visitor: &amp;mut V) {
        visitor.visit_decorator(self);
    }
}

/* and so on */
</code></pre>
<p>Things I don't like about this suggestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>More verbose than the mapping you've defined in the generator script.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I do like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less verbose in the for-loop in the generator script (see below).</li>
<li>&quot;How to visit each field&quot; is defined right next to the <code>SourceOrderVisitor</code> trait itself, making it less likely they'll get out of sync.</li>
<li>Only have to touch this trait and its impls when you add a new field <em>type</em>, not when you add a new syntax node or field.</li>
<li>I personally find it a bit easier to understand, since you can see the Rust code directly. And the logic becomes very straightforward: for each field, we call its <code>FieldVisitor::visit</code> method.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's an interesting trick.</p>
<p>Would the trait implementations be code-gened or hand written?</p>
<p>This is interesting. What I dislike about it is that it adds &quot;accidental&quot; complexity. It's something that's only necessary because we codegen the visitor.</p>
<p>I think I have a slight preference to keep the complexity in <code>generate.py</code> over spilling it into the generated nodes (and increase comp time a little)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right, I forgot about this one. This is only needed to determine the visitor function. For other expressions we use <code>visit_expr</code> but for annotations we have <code>visit_annotation</code>.
This could go to the generate script as well since we don't have a lot of annotations and it's not gonna change probably. WDYT?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like this idea too. One other thing that made the visitors hard without touching the code here was that some visit a slice of that type(like <code>visit_decorators</code>) and some visit a singular type.</p>
<p>I'm probably wrong but I feel this change is overall useful even if there was no code generation.
But the diff will probably be huge for this one. I can do another PR and see how does the code end up if we apply this change.</p>
<p>My reply to first comment starts here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This also makes me wonder. Is this, sort of, the inverse of skip_source_order because we need an entry for every type except the types in skip_source_order. Could we use this in some way to simplify the configuration/ make it easier to extend in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>@MichaReiser are you suggesting to generate the visitor name from the field name?
And for field types that are not straightforward have this table, so we remove most of the entries in the table.
Sorry I didn't get what does it have to do with <code>skip_source_order</code>.</p>
<p>I initially created the table for visitors that visit a sequence. I wanted to mark what visitors require a for loop.
Although for some like <code>visit_decorators</code> you can infer it's visiting a seq by the &quot;s&quot; at the end for <code>alias</code> it's not the case.</p>
<p>I'm thinking about this idea, to determine the visitor name:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lookup the table (for exceptional cases)</li>
<li>Convert the name to snake_case and build the visitor</li>
<li>Infer if it's visiting sequence by the <code>s</code> in the end</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully the point 3 can be gone after I send a refactor either just making it consistent or applying Douglas's suggestion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having said that. I think I'm also fine landing this PR as is and creating a separate PR to simplify this <code>type_to_visitor_function</code>. I let you and @dcreager decide on what you prefer. @dcreager can you go ahead and merge this PR if you're happy with it because I'll be out next week.</p>

<p>But you are right for value it should be annotation. I changed it to annotation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not a fan of inferring behavior from the presence of an <code>s</code> at the end of the name — that's seem too magical for what we're trying to accomplish here.  If that's what we would have to do to avoid the table, I'd rather keep the table.</p>
