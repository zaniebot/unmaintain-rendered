            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>No functional change here; this is another simplification split out from my outcome-refactor branch to reduce the diff there. This merges <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::infer_name_load</code> and <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::lookup_name</code>. This removes the need to have extensive doc-comments about the purpose of <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::lookup_name</code>, since the method only makes sense when called from the specific context of <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::infer_name_load</code>.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My only quibble is that I think it'd be clearer to say &quot;where we currently are in control flow&quot; rather than &quot;where we currently are in the AST&quot;, but this looks right.</p>
<p>FWIW I'm not sure if this is ideal, though -- I think the split between what we do in <code>infer_name_load</code> and <code>lookup_name</code> doesn't make a ton of sense, and the code might be clearer if we moved all the logic into <code>lookup_name</code> such that it is called for every name load? But not 100% sure without trying it.</p>

<p>Excellent idea. I tried it, and I think it helps quite a lot!</p>
