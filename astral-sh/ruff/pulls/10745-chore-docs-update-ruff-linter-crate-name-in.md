# chore(docs): update ruff_linter crate name in CONTRIBUTING.md

Reading through `CONTRIBUTING.md`, I happened to notice that it still referred to the `ruff_linter` crate as the `ruff` crate. `ruff` is a different crate, located in `crates/ruff`, which doesn't contain "the vast majority of the code and all the lint rules."
