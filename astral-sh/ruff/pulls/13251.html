            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This adds type inference for loop variables inside comprehension scopes. The type-inference tests are passing, but it seems to currently trigger a panic in the corpus tests.</p>
<p>Async comprehensions will require different logic, so for now loop variables in these are inferred as <code>Unknown</code> still. In order to distinguish between async comprehension definitions and synchronous comprehensions definitions, a new <code>is_async</code> field is added to <code>ComprehensionDefinitionKind</code> and various other structs for tracking comprehension definitions.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code> and <code>cargo test -p red_knot_workspace</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just pushed a test for that. It seems to work fine :)</p>
<p>I think the nonlocal name lookup happens automatically now, following https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/3c4ec82aee18c8438a5f807853edcf703e0816a0. We need to look it up in the parent scope because it is <em>not</em> valid for the iterable to reference any variables defined in <em>this</em> scope. But looking it up in the parent scope doesn&#x27;t mean that it will stop at the parent scope; it will continue iterating up through the parent scopes until it finds a definition (or infer <code>Unbound</code> if it can&#x27;t)</p>

<p>Haha, okay. I was shocked by the performance regression, so I had to take a quick look at why it was that bad. I was relieved to see that it was probably caused by the benchmark crashing.</p>

<p>Oh the PR also currently adds a <code>dbg!()</code> call in quite a hot location so that I can see what&#x27;s going on more clearly. I assume that doesn&#x27;t help 😄</p>
