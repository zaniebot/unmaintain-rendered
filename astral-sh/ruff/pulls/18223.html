            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The <code>__future__.annotations</code> import in <code>ruff.__main__</code> was not needed, as there are no forward references or type-check-only imports.</p>
<p>Instead, I manually stringified the <code>list[str]</code> annotation, for compatibility with older Python versions.</p>
<p>Since the <code>pyproject.toml</code> ruff config for <code>isort</code> requires <code>__future__.annotations</code> to be present everywhere, I assumed that there must be some reason for that, and did not change it. I instead used a local <code>.ruff.toml</code> to override it for the only the <code>ruff</code> python package.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Check that <code>python -m ruff</code> does not raise.</p>

<p>The future annotation was introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15090 to fix a runtime error. Nothing has changed to this file since then, so I think it's still needed</p>

<p>I can't see how a <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> would fix the <code>FileNotFoundError</code> reported in #15090 🤔</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But either way, this indeed won't work now on older Python versions. Let me fix that real quick.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: I believe it should also work with older Python versions now :)</p>

<p>Usually it's no problem. But it can make the life of runtime type-checkers more difficult, because it requires them to <code>eval</code> all annotations because of that. But in this case I doubt that it matters, so I can see how the additional complexity might not be worth it here.</p>
