# Link to the rules.md in the ty repository

---

_@MichaReiser_

## Summary

https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/292 adds a script that copies over the reference documentation into the ty repository because
I worry that it's somewhat confusing for users to find the ty documentation in the ruff repository (and github doesn't support relative links into submodules). 

This PR updates the in the schema/configuration reference to point to the `rules.md` in the ty repository.
