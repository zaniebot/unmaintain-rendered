            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PPC64 seems dead, and it&#x27;s only supported on one exact manylinux version (<a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel/issues/669">pypa/auditwheel#669</a>), so we should drop it.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s arguable whether this is a breaking change, since it doesn&#x27;t remove support for the platform (which is already barely support by manylinux), but it does make installation more complex on PPC64.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! I&#x27;d probably lean toward considering this a breaking change since we have a minor release coming up anyway, but I&#x27;m also happy to land it sooner if you prefer.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Shipping it as part of 0.15 makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I tried to find out why ppc64 support was added initially, but all I could find was <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/45">astral-sh/ruff#45</a>, which doesn&#x27;t mention a reason.</p>
<p>It seems easy enough to add them again if users miss them and we then at least know why we need to support them going forward.</p>
<p>I double checked that ruff-vscode doesn&#x27;t publish a PPC64 extension. So this looks good from my end</p>
