# Added Image Augmentation library Albumentations (13k stars) to Readme to "Who is using Ruff" section

---

_Pull request opened by @ternaus on 2024-02-21 22:08_

At [Albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations) we used latest versions of isort, flake8 and pyupgrade, but after adding ruff, we encountered hundreds of issues that we needed to address.

Ruff is an extremely powerful linter and formatter.
