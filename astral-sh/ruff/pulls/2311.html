            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Apologies for the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/2309">broken previous PR</a>. I think there isn't much test coverage around per-file-ignores and I'm still getting used to the codebase!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also haven't tested the interaction of having <code>RUF100</code> ignored per-file, which seems unlikely to be a very common case. <code>check_noqa</code> does mutate <code>diagnostics</code> however, so maybe the more correct but less efficient approach would be to pass <code>per_file_ignores</code> as an argument and have it checked again there.</p>
