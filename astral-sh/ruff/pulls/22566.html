            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Doesn't look like the end of the world to me. Yes, it adds quiet a bit of whitespace (about 40 lines per testfile). But it isn't that the files become completely unreadable or twice as long.</p>
<p>I wouldn't consider it a blocker for adopting ruffendocs but @AlexWaygood might feel differently (we would support <code>pyi</code> as language which I think would help with some of the most affected files, as long as they don't test any non-pyi behavior)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Definitely not the end of the world, but to me it still feels like a regression in readability/formatting that I'd rather not have :P</p>
<p>I also think the feature more broadly is a reasonable one -- to me it makes sense that you might want your documentation examples formatted more concisely than your production code! You just want to get the semantic meaning of the code across to the reader as quickly as possible in that scenario.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm curious what others on the ty think too :-)</p>
