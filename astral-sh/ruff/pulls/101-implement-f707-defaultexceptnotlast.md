For the future: if you add `CheckKind::DefaultExceptNotLast` to the list in `examples/generate_rules_table.rs`, then run `cargo run --example generate_rules_table`, it'll print out the Markdown table, which you can then paste in here.

Np, hopefully makes your life easier! (`examples` is a weird home for that script but I didn't want to introduce multiple binaries.)
