<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In response to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1177. This is my attempt at trying to modify the narrow mechanism of enum.</p>
<p>I implemented it this way because I didn't want to alter <code>fn is_single_valued</code> signature as it is used in 103 different places. Instead, I created a <code>fn is_single_valued_enum</code> and an optional parameter to modify if necessary the dunder methods checked by <code>fn overrides_equality</code>.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I added a test with the case exposed in the issue mentioned above.</p>

<p>To be honest, looking at the increased code complexity here, I'm not sure if it's even worth adding this functionality, for a use case that seems extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>If we want to move forward with this, I think we should aim to find a less invasive way to implement it. I find the meaning of the second parameter to <code>is_single_valued_enum</code> unclear (what does it mean if I pass in <code>Some([&quot;__eq__&quot;])</code>? What does it mean if I pass in <code>Some([])</code>? What does it mean if I pass in <code>None</code>?).</p>
<p>There are also a lot of <code>&amp;Vec&lt;…&gt;</code>  parameters here which could be <code>&amp;[…]</code> <em>if</em> we keep this implementation. I also see a lot of <code>.clone()</code>s that could probably be prevented.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that this is a rather negative feedback. I probably shouldn't have labeled https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20516 as a good-first-issue, given that it wasn't even clear if it was worth implementing this at all.</p>
