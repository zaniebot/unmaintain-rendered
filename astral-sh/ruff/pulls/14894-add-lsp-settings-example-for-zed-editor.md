> Have no tested docs locally (how to?)

Refer to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#mkdocs

It'll be useful to have a screenshot of the rendered docs in the PR description, no need to do that for all settings :)

Wonderful.
Thanks for the pointer to the mkdocs section of CONTRIBUTING.MD
It works as expected locally (screenshot added above).
