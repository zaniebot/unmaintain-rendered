Summary


<p>If a try-catch block guards the names, we don&#x27;t raise warnings. During this change, I discovered that some of the replacement types were missed. Thus, I extend the fix to types other than AutoImport as well</p>
Test Plan


<p>Test fixtures are added and updated.</p>

                expr.start(),
