### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>nextest-rs/quick-junit (quick-junit)</summary>

### [`v0.5.2`](https://redirect.github.com/nextest-rs/quick-junit/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#052---2025-11-10)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nextest-rs/quick-junit/compare/quick-junit-0.5.1...quick-junit-0.5.2)

##### Added

- A long-requested feature: deserialization support for reports! The new deserializer has undergone fuzzing and property-based testing, and it is known to work with JUnit reports generated by quick-junit. The deserializer should work with JUnit reports generated by other tools as well. If it doesn't, fixes are welcome.
- The new `proptest` feature allows for generation of arbitrary `Report`s.

##### Updated

Internal dependency update: `quick-xml` updated to 0.38.3.
