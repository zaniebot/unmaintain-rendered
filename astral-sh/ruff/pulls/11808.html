Summary


<p>This PR adds <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/refactor/too-many-ancestors.html"><code>pylint</code> rule <code>R0901</code></a>, which restricts the maximum number of parent classes a class can have (to a default value of 7).</p>
Test Plan


<p>This PR was tested using the workflow discussed <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/contributing/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Running tests with <code>cargo test</code> gives no failures.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for contributing this rule.</p>
<p>I worry that merging the rule as is today will be confusing to users and give them a wrong sense of &quot;safety&quot; where they think the rule would catch all inheritance chains with more than <code>x</code> parent classes. However, that&#x27;s not the case because Ruff doesn&#x27;t support multifile analysis, meaning Ruff can only reason about the ancestor chain in a single file.</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s more likely that such deep hierarchy chains are split across many files, meaning the rule will miss almost all violations in real projects, such that it has limited value today.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll close this PR for now but I think we can add this rule once multifile analysis is supported.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Thanks for taking the time to look over this!</p>
<p>If I&#x27;m allowed to push back a little on this... I don&#x27;t understand your comment at all :(. This PR (and to my understanding, the <code>pylint</code> rule associated with it) has nothing to do with the <em>depth</em> of the inheritance chain (which would definitely be an interesting rule to implement once multifile analysis is possible!), but about the <em>width</em> (if you can call it that) of the inheritance, i.e. the number of <em>direct</em> parent classes of a given class.
I&#x27;m by no means an expert on object-oriented Python, but to my knowledge this is information that is solely contained in a single file, where the class is defined.</p>
<p>Edit: @Pierre-Sassoulas I see you&#x27;ve looked at this PR, so perhaps you can comment on whether my understanding of the <code>pylint</code> rule is correct?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m sorry that I failed to communicate the decision clearly or may even be mistaken.</p>
<p>I re-read the rule documentation and I think there&#x27;s some confusion because the documentation sometimes uses the term parents and sometimes ancestors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parents</code>: The direct parents of a class. This maps to <code>class_def.bases</code></li>
<li><code>ancestors</code>: The transitive inheritance chain of a class. This requires traversing the entire inheritance chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I took a look at the Pylint implementation, and my understanding is that it asserts that <code>ancestors</code> is less than the configured minimum, whereas this implementation implements <code>parents</code>.</p>
<p>https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/blob/087d77adcd8455dbbbf6b43631d93abb2d1c5d67/pylint/checkers/design_analysis.py#L245-L279</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll need multifile analysis if we want to implement Pylint&#x27;s behavior (assuming I understand it correctly)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for giving some more detail! Apologies if I came across as overly defensive.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the documentation is a little confusing and mixes terms, and I wasn&#x27;t even aware myself that &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;ancestor&quot; refer to different things!
I&#x27;m not familiar enough with the ruff codebase to know whether multifile analysis is required to check all ancestors, so I&#x27;ll take your word for it.
How would you feel about slightly refactoring this PR to implement a new &quot;<code>too-many-parents</code>&quot; rule which clearly explains the difference, and adding a comment to #970 specifying that <code>R0901</code> shouldn&#x27;t be worked on until multifile analysis is available?</p>

<p>No worries. It was good that you asked for clarification because I honestly wasn&#x27;t aware of what specific behavior PyLInt implements (I just assumed ancestor without checking).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We could check all ancestors already today, but only if all classes are defined in the same file. That&#x27;s unlikely to be the case for many classes and significantly reduces the added value of the rule.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I prefer to wait until Ruff supports multifile-analysis to avoid that we have to deprecate this rule just in a few months because it overlaps with an other rule. I also think that only checking direct parents isn&#x27;t that useful, at least not in the spirit the rule is defined today (you could argue that inheriting from more than one base is considered bad).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @MichaReiser about pylint behavior. I reacted on the comment because I wasn&#x27;t aware that ruff had this single file limitation (same than flake8 ?), so it was interesting to me.</p>
