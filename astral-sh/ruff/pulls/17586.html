            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This mostly only improves things for incorrect arguments and for an
incorrect return type on a <code>__bool__</code> method. It doesn't do much
to improve the case when <code>__bool__</code> isn't callable and leaves the
union/other cases untouched completely.</p>
<p>I picked this one because, at first glance, this <em>looked</em> like a
lower hanging fruit. The conceptual improvement here is pretty
straight-forward: add annotations for relevant data. But it took me a
bit to figure out how to connect all of the pieces.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel like there's a couple of missing steps in the explanation here. We're emitting the diagnostic on the expression <code>10 and a and True</code>, and then we're showing them where the <code>NotBoolable.__bool__</code> method is defined. But we don't say anywhere why the user should care about the <code>NotBoolable</code> class, or why the return method of <code>NotBoolable.__bool__</code> is important.</p>
<p>I think we need to explicitly say:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>a.__bool__()</code> is implicitly called due to the use of the <code>and</code> operator</li>
<li>In order for boolean conversion to succeed, a <code>__bool__</code> method must return an instance of <code>bool</code></li>
<li><code>a</code> is an instance of <code>NotBoolable</code></li>
<li>Here is the <code>NotBoolable.__bool__</code> method. It returns <code>str</code>, which is not assignable to <code>bool</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You do step (4) here but you skip steps (1), (2) and (3) in the explanation!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this has overlap with go-to-definition; it requires adding APIs to not just get a symbol, but get the location(s) of its definition(s), and we don't currently have those APIs. I don't think they are inherently difficult to add over what we have now (the information is all there in the use-def map, it's just a Simple Matter of Programming), but it's a non-trivial amount of Programming.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think one fairly simple thing we could do here to improve this diagnostic (short of the below) would be to name the not-callable type we found for <code>__bool__</code>. That alone could really help someone to track down the source of the issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This API and <code>parameter_span</code> can both cause cross-module dependencies. We already discussed this with the improved invalid-call diagnostic, and I don't think there's anything to be done about that core fact -- it's just a reality of providing nice diagnostics.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it would be useful to call this out in the doc comment, or via some kind of naming convention? I don't really think it's likely we'd attempt to use these methods unless we really need them for diagnostics, so tbh I'm not sure how much that would benefit us.</p>

<p>Even the term &quot;assignable to&quot; is going to be pretty foreign to a newbie in Python typing. And if this type checker is successful, we'll have a whole bunch of users who are pretty new to Python altogether, let alone Python typing. (Mypy certainly does! I've seen many of their issues on the mypy tracker, and I've responded to many of their questions on StackOverflow.)</p>

<p>Sure, it doesn't need to block this PR, of course! I also don't think it would take very long at all to address this, though. But I'm happy to park this for now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know, but it goes to the definition of the <em>type</em>, which won't be useful for many invalid <code>__bool__</code> values. E.g. if we have</p>

<p>using <code>Type::definition</code> would go to the definition of <code>str</code> in typeshed, which is not useful; we want to go to the <code>__bool__ = &quot;foo&quot;</code> assignment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, 100%. I looked into doing this too, but seemed like more work that I wanted to bite off here. I even specifically wrote this test such that <code>NotBoolable1</code> and <code>NotBoolable3</code> are both not usable as booleans for different reasons, thinking that I could improve that case. And perhaps even include diagnostics for <em>all</em> (or at least more than 1) parts of a union. There's some refactoring involved so that we re-use the diagnostic generation for each of the base cases, and then some way to figure out how to tie off the recursion of union types themselves.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this is all pretty much the same conclusion I arrived at. I had indeed found <code>Type::definition</code>.</p>
<p>I'm at least happy that I wasn't missing something dumb. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is that not done in the couple lines above this one? Or am I misunderstanding? That is, I think <code>not_boolable_type</code> is the not-callable type, and its name is included in the main diagnostic message.</p>
<p>Or maybe you're saying I should repeat it here? That is, something like:</p>
<pre><code>`__bool__` on `{not_boolable_type}` must be callable
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I added this as a doc comment to this method and <code>parameter_span</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    /// # Performance
    ///
    /// Note that this may introduce cross-module
    /// dependencies. This can have an impact on
    /// the effectiveness of incremental caching
    /// and should therefore be used judiciously.
    ///
    /// An example of a good use case is to improve
    /// a diagnostic.
</code></pre>
<p>I think the cross module dependency thing is really subtle, so a naming convention might actually help here. But yeah, I also don't have a good feel for how much of a problem this will be in practice.</p>
