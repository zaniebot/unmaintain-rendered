            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This is to support <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18607">astral-sh/ruff#18607</a>.</p>
<p>This PR adds support for generating the top materialization (or upper bound materialization) and the bottom materialization (or lower bound materialization) of a type. This is the most general and the most specific form of the type which is fully static, respectively.</p>
<p>More concretely, <code>T&#x27;</code>, the top materialization of <code>T</code>, is the type <code>T</code> with all occurrences
of dynamic type (<code>Any</code>, <code>Unknown</code>, <code>@Todo</code>) replaced as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In covariant position, it&#x27;s replaced with <code>object</code></li>
<li>In contravariant position, it&#x27;s replaced with <code>Never</code></li>
<li>In invariant position, it&#x27;s replaced with an unresolved type variable</li>
</ul>
<p>(For an invariant position, it should actually be replaced with an existential type, but this is not currently representable in our type system, so we use an unresolved type variable for now instead.)</p>
<p>The bottom materialization is implemented in the same way, except we start out in &quot;contravariant&quot; position.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Add test cases for various types.</p>

<ul>
<li>pivot class which can be dynamic but neither <code>super(Any, ...)</code> or <code>super(..., Any)</code> is a valid call, but it is representable in our type system as this field can be <code>ClassBase::Dynamic</code></li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems okay for now! Something I&#x27;m working on this week is implementing proper subtyping logic for protocol instances. That involves taking account of the fact that read-only property members, and method members, on protocols act covariantly; write-only property members act contravariantly; and read/write attribute members on protocols act invariantly.</p>
<p>Because this is all unimplemented currently, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way you can test it properly. But it might make sense to add a TODO to the code here to make sure we add some tests once the complete assignability/subtyping logic is implemented for protocols.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think what you have here is correct. The variance of the typevar itself is relevant to subtyping of the type which is generic over this typevar; it&#x27;s not relevant to use of the typevar itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s correct to not pass in the outer variance to <code>Parameter::top_materialization</code>, or to hardcode contravariance below. Rather, the contravariance of parameters needs to &quot;flip the polarity&quot; of the outer variance. If the outer variance is covariant, it&#x27;s flipped to contravariant, and vice versa. (If the outer variance is invariant, it stays invariant.)</p>
<p>To test this, I think you could use e.g. the case of a callable type which has a parameter that is itself a callable type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is looking good! I think the main thing is we need to ensure nesting is right, by always flipping the polarity of the &quot;outer&quot; variance when we hit a contravariant context, not hardcoding variance.</p>
<p>Another observation here is that the implementation of <code>top_materialization</code> and <code>bottom_materialization</code> should be identical -- the only difference is whether we start with a variance of &quot;Covariant&quot; (top materialization) or start with a variance of &quot;Contravariant&quot; (bottom materialization). It might make sense to rename the method added in the current PR to just <code>materialize</code>, and then have <code>Type::top_materialization</code> and <code>Type::bottom_materialization</code> just be thin wrappers that call <code>materialize</code> with the right initial variance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When should this flip happen? Only when the variance position is contravariant? Or, should it also happen for covariant position? I&#x27;m asking because flipping would result in the following example not working:</p>
<p>Without flipping, the top materialization would be:</p>
<pre><code>from ty_extensions import top_materialization, static_assert, is_assignable_to, Not
from typing import Any, Callable

# revealed: (object, Never, /) -&gt; object
reveal_type(top_materialization(Callable[[Not[tuple[Any, int]], Any], Any]))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I&#x27;m not using <code>Not[Any]</code> because that&#x27;s equivalent to <code>Any</code></p>
<p>Because the <code>tuple</code> is in a contravariant position due to <code>Not</code> and the variance is passed through the tuple which results in <code>tuple[Never, int]</code> which is simplified to <code>Never</code>, and thus <code>Not[Never]</code> would become <code>object</code>.</p>
<p>And, that top materialization is then assignable to the original gradual type:</p>
<pre><code>static_assert(
    is_assignable_to(
        Callable[[object, Never], object], Callable[[Not[tuple[Any, int]], Any], Any]
    )
)
</code></pre>
<p>But, if we incorporated the flipping logic, the <code>Not</code> would mean the contravariant position of the parameter would be flipped to covariant. Now, if we pass this as is in the <code>tuple</code>, this would result into the top materialized type not being assignable to the gradual type:</p>
<pre><code>static_assert(
    is_assignable_to(
        Callable[[Not[tuple[object, int]], Never], object],
        Callable[[Not[tuple[Any, int]], Any], Any],
    )
)
</code></pre>
<p>But, if we did flip is back again because <code>tuple</code> is in a covariant position (so the covariant becomes contravariant again), it would result in the correct top materialization that was without the flipping logic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thw top materialization should always be the largest possible type we can materialize to. That means making the parameters of a Callable type as small as possible. Which means making the type inside a Not inside the parameter as large as possible. So that inner type should be <code>tuple[object, int]</code>, wrapped in a Not, wrapped in Callable.</p>
<p>&quot;Flipping&quot; means that when we enter a covariant context, the variance stays whatever it was, when we enter a contravariant context, its polarity flips from whatever it was to the opposite: covariant becomes contravariant, contravariant becomes covariant again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Regarding this suggestion for checking the subtyping with regards to <code>list[type[Any]] -&gt; list[T] (where T: type)</code>, the subtyping check is giving false that <code>list[T]</code> is not a subtype of <code>list[type[object]]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Any, Generic, TypeVar
from ty_extensions import is_subtype_of, static_assert

T_all = TypeVar(&quot;T_all&quot;, bound=type)

static_assert(is_subtype_of(T_all, type[object]))  # true

<p>I think that&#x27;s because the subtype relation between two specialization for an invariant position checks whether the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/deee6d9ad7383f5446227c4914d3834c9472084d/crates/ty_python_semantic/src/types/generics.rs#L401-L402">two types are equivalent</a> and here it isn&#x27;t.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>nah, the function here delegates to <code>SubclassOfType::materialize()</code>, which does work to figure out which <code>Type</code> variant it needs to return (it won&#x27;t always be a <code>Type::SubclassOf</code> type due to some eager normalizations we do):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, but this is subtle and probably should have a comment. <code>SubclassOfType::materialize</code> returns a <code>Type</code> for the overall materialization of the subclass-of type, not just for the inner type. The reason for this is that we don&#x27;t currently have a direct representation for <code>type[T]</code> (that is, subclass-of a typevar), but the materialization of <code>type[Any]</code> in an invariant position should be <code>type[T]</code> where <code>T</code> has no upper bound or constraints, and it turns out that this is equivalent to just <code>T&#x27;</code> where <code>T&#x27;: type</code> -- so that&#x27;s how we represent this <code>type[T]</code> we need to synthesize.</p>
<p>~~I think I did just spot another bug in looking at <code>SubclassOfType::materialize</code>, though. That method currently acts as if <code>type[...]</code> itself were bivariant (imposed no variance constraints). But in fact it is covariant. So both the <code>Contravariant</code> and <code>Invariant</code> branches there should be returning the type variable.~~ EDIT: never mind, this is wrong -- I was thinking in terms of collecting constraints in variance inference, but here we are just flipping variance, not collecting constraints. So <code>type[]</code> being covariant just means it doesn&#x27;t change the outer variance context.</p>
