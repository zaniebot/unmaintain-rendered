# Implement isort's `reverse_relative` setting

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-12 18:03_

This PR implements `reverse-relative`, from isort, but renames it to `relative-imports-order` with the respected value `closest-to-furthest` and `furthest-to-closest`, and the latter being the default.

Closes #1813.
