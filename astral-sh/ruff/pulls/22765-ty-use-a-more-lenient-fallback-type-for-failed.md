# [ty] Use a more lenient fallback type for failed `namedtuple()` and `NamedTuple` calls

---

_@AlexWaygood_

## Summary

This is stacked on top of #22718; review that first.

Currently if a user makes a bad `NamedTuple()` call like this:

```py
from typing import NamedTuple, reveal_type

Bad1 = NamedTuple()
Bad1()
```

then we emit errors on _both_ calls: one correct error for the bad `NamedTuple()` call (it's missing required arguments), and then another spurious error on the `Bad1()` call:

```
No overload of bound method `__init__` matches arguments
```

The reason for this second, spurious error is that we inferred `type[NamedTupleFallback]` for the result of the `Bad1()` call, and `NamedTupleFallback` has this `__init__` signature, which isn't appropriate in this context -- it actually reflects the arguments you need to pass to the `NamedTuple` function itself in order to _create_ a `NamedTuple` class, not the signature of the constructors that all `NamedTuple` classes have:

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/7e1f07e5c606990e3a67c2c7d0c7367740636904/crates/ty_vendored/vendor/typeshed/stdlib/_typeshed/_type_checker_internals.pyi#L63-L69

This PR updates the fallback type we use when `NamedTuple` parsing fails, so that it's more lenient and the spurious error is no longer emitted.

## Test Plan

mdtests updated

drive-by simplification; no functional change to this bit

Seems reasonable (assuming tests pass and ecosystem changes are clean).
