### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>mitsuhiko/insta (insta)</summary>

### [`v1.41.0`](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#1410)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/compare/1.40.0...1.41.0)

-   Experimental support for binary snapshots.  [#&#8203;610](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/610) (Florian Plattner)

-   `--force-update-snapshots` now causes `cargo-insta` to write every snapshot, regardless of whether
    snapshots fully match, and now implies `--accept`.  This
    allows for `--force-update-snapshots` to update inline snapshots'
    delimiters and indentation.

    For the previous behavior of `--force-update-snapshots`, which limited writes to
    snapshots which didn't fully match, use `--require-full-match`.
    The main difference between `--require-full-match` and the existing behavior of `--force-update-snapshots`
    is a non-zero exit code on any snapshots which don't fully match.

    Like the previous behavior or `--force-update-snapshots`, `--require-full-match`
    doesn't track inline snapshots' delimiters or
    indentation, so can't update if those don't match.  [#&#8203;644](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/644)

-   Inline snapshots only use `#` characters as delimiters when required.  [#&#8203;603](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/603)

-   Warnings for undiscovered snapshots are more robust, and include files with
    custom snapshot extensions.  [#&#8203;637](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/637)

-   Insta runs correctly on packages which reference rust files in a parent path.  [#&#8203;626](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/626)

-   Warnings are printed when any snapshot uses a legacy format.  [#&#8203;599](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/599)

-   `cargo insta --version` now prints a version.  [#&#8203;665](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/665)

-   `insta` now internally uses `INSTA_UPDATE=force` rather than
    `INSTA_FORCE_UPDATE=1`.  (This doesn't affect users of `cargo-insta`, which
    handles this internally.)  [#&#8203;482](https://redirect.github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/482)

-   `cargo-insta`'s integration tests continue to grow over the past couple of versions,
    and now offer coverage of most of `cargo-insta`'s interface.
