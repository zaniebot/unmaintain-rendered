            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a follow-up to #15180</p>
Summary
<p><code>|</code> is not a valid runtime operation between types pre Python 3.10, so we should avoid unquoting the type expression.</p>
<p>Additionally most type checkers don&#x27;t care about the execution context, so while they will allow <code>|</code> between types in stub files for convenience, they will still disallow it in type checking blocks, since those are treated as regular runtime code.</p>
Test Plan
<p><code>cargo nextest run</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The ecosystem results make sense to me now. Since airflow targets Python 3.9+ mypy would flag those type aliases if they were unquoted. So a TC008 shouldn&#x27;t trigger, despite there being no runtime effects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dangotbanned Yes, that&#x27;s this bug, it can also be hit in different contexts, it just previously wasn&#x27;t as likely to be hit in <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks, because those also weren&#x27;t handled properly yet.</p>
<p>Feel free to open an issue, if you think it makes it easier for others to discover that this issue is known and will be fixed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the ping. We decided that Alex should spend more time on Red Knot which leaves me as the main reviewer. I&#x27;ll try to take a look but I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ll get to it because it also requires familiarizing myself with the type checking rules. Sorry for the long wait.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Alright, no worries. This PR should be fairly easy to review, even with surface knowledge, the only thing you need to know is that the union syntax <code>|</code> is only allowed to be used at runtime starting with Python 3.10, prior to that it will raise a <code>TypeError</code>, since <code>type</code> did not provide a <code>__or__</code> method that returns <code>UnionType</code>.</p>
<p>However type checkers still allow you to use the new syntax in older Python versions in non-runtime contexts like implicit/explicit forward references. But type checkers generally don&#x27;t consider statements in <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks to be non-runtime. It is treated like any other code block, the only thing they do, is statically evaluate <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> to <code>True</code> (and entirely skip analysis of code that isn&#x27;t reachable this way).</p>
<p>There is a tiny bit of extra complexity for avoiding false negatives for <code>typing.Annotated</code>. This part should probably have been changed in #15180 in hindsight. All you need to know here is, that only the first argument to <code>typing.Annotated</code> is a type expression, so the rest of the arguments shouldn&#x27;t influence our decision whether or not we can unquote.</p>
<p>TLDR: Annotated type alias value expressions always need to be considered in runtime context, unless they&#x27;re explicitly wrapped in quotes. As a consequence, if a forward reference in the value expression uses <code>|</code>, we&#x27;re not allowed to remove the quotes if the target python version is 3.9 or below.</p>
