            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Any type assignable to <code>Iterable[object]</code> should also be considered iterable by ty. Currently we consider far too many types to be assignable to <code>Iterable[object]</code>; this is one of the causes of the crash in https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/764. As such, the property test added here is added as a flaky property test for now; the tests find many types for which this invariant currently does not hold true.</p>
<p>Note that there are many objects which are not assignable to <code>Iterable[object]</code>, but which we nonetheless consider iterable. This is a deliberate feature: as well as understanding the new-style iteration protocol (represented by <code>Iterable</code>), we also understand the old-style iteration protocol that works via the <code>__getitem__</code> dunder.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo test --release -p ty_python_semantic -- --ignored types::property_tests::flaky</code></p>
