            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR adds a new <code>hover</code> mdtest assertion. This exercises the same logic as the hover LSP action. It&#x27;s useful for when <code>reveal_type</code> would display a different infered type. (<code>reveal_type</code> is not transparent to bidirectional typing, so inserting a <code>reveal_type</code> call can sometimes <em>change</em> the type that we infer for an expression!)</p>
<p>I used Claude to help write large parts of this, but I have reviewed each step and the resulting diff in detail.</p>

<p>Hmmm, I&#x27;m not sure I agree. <em>One</em> of the best things about mdtest is how readable it makes our tests, but another of the best things about mdtest is how low-friction it is to write new tests. It&#x27;s so easy to add new assertions to an existing mdtest suite; it doesn&#x27;t come with nearly as much boilerplate as writing all our unit tests in Rust or even Python would. And I think that&#x27;s resulted in us writing lots and lots of assertions, and having a very robustly tested type checker -- great things happen when you make it easy to write tests!</p>

<p>That sounds like it might make sense to me... It seems quite counterintuitive to me that hovering over the first <code>[&quot;&quot;]</code> in the playground for this example gives a different type than hovering over the second <code>[&quot;&quot;]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import reveal_type

def needs_list_of_strings(x: list[str | None]): ...

def identity[T](x: T) -&gt; T:
    return x

needs_list_of_strings([&quot;&quot;])
needs_list_of_strings(identity([&quot;&quot;]))

<p>Fair enough! The additional code in <code>ty_test</code> to make it work also isn&#x27;t <em>free</em>, though -- there&#x27;s a maintenance burden there, and a small cognitive burden (I now have to think about whether a <code>reveal_type</code> assertion or a <code>hover</code> assertion will be more appropriate when I&#x27;m writing my tests!). I still feel like I&#x27;d be interested in a few more examples of where the current <code>reveal_type</code> behaviour is causing issues for your generics work.</p>

(I completely agree with your argument when talking about mdtest existing in the first place — the marginal ease of writing these over the previous Rust tests is <em>huge</em>! But I don&#x27;t think that argument applies with the same force when considering something like this.)</p>

<p>… but assuming that we <em>would</em> already propagate the type context through a <code>reveal_type</code> call (which acts like an identity function), we could also solve this use case with <code>reveal_type</code>, right? Then there would be no need for hover-assertions anymore? You could then do:</p>
<pre><code>x: list[Literal[1]] = reveal_type([1, 1])  # revealed: list[Literal[1]]
y: list[int] = reveal_type([1, 1])  # revealed: list[int]

<p>Yes, but... :joy:</p>
<p>The particular example I want to write a (hover) test for is this:</p>
<pre><code>def f[T](x: dict[str, T]) -&gt; None: ...

# TODO: should be dict[str, Unknown]
# ↓ hover: dict[str, T@f]
f({})
</code></pre>
<p>In a perfect world, I should be able to do this:</p>
<pre><code># TODO: should be dict[str, Unknown]
# revealed: dict[str, T@f]
f(reveal_type({}))
</code></pre>
<p>But this example is more complex than the annotated assignments you mention. We don&#x27;t just need to propagate the type context through from the outer call to the inner call; we also need to solve the specialization inference for both calls simultaneously (<code>T@f</code> and <code>_T@reveal_type</code>). (Or maybe allow that the inner one can refer to typevars of the outer one?)</p>
<p>I agree that we need to make that work — but it also seemed worth having an escape hatch that lets us test these expressions without relying on all of that machinery working correctly.</p>
<p>Maybe the escape hatch is to write that test over in <code>ty_ide</code>, where we already have hover tests that use <code>&lt;CURSOR&gt;</code> to indicate where the hover is triggered? But that also seemed less than ideal, since the test wouldn&#x27;t really be exercising the LSP action; it&#x27;s a test of our type inference behavior, which seems to properly belong in a <code>ty_python_semantic</code> mdtest.</p>

<p>(I&#x27;m also a little surprised that mypy, for example, has never needed this feature in its test suite. Mypy has a test framework that&#x27;s pretty darn similar to mdtest, and a test suite that&#x27;s much bigger than ours, but it still just uses <code>reveal_type</code> nearly everywhere)</p>

<p>Having the ability to write them in mdtests would certainly be nice. However, they often test for more than just the type (e.g. doc comments). This makes it difficult to replace them entirely unless we support snapshotting the entire hover but that doesn&#x27;t seem that urgent right now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Woah I completely missed this PR! I have occasionally briefly pined for this but I think ultimately mdtests end up being the wrong format for hover tests, which want to be much more (inline-)snapshoty (all of this is &quot;ui&quot; and so you want to see any changes to &quot;ui&quot;). The ty_ide tests are getting really unwieldy because from sheer volume of tests shoved in one file, but I think the solution there is just to split off a <code>tests/</code> dir with dirs and files.</p>

<p>Agree, we could even have fixtures discovered similar to what we do in the formatter&#x27;s cursor tests instead of having to write normal rust tests</p>
