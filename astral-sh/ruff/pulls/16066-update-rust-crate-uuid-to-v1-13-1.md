### [`v1.13.0`](https://redirect.github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/releases/tag/1.13.0)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/compare/1.12.1...1.13.0)

##### :warning: Potential Breakage

This release updates our version of `getrandom` to `0.3` and `rand` to `0.9`. It is a **potentially breaking change** for the following users:

##### no-std users who enable the `rng` feature

`uuid` still uses `getrandom` by default on these platforms. Upgrade your version of `getrandom` and [follow its new docs](https://docs.rs/getrandom/0.3.1/getrandom/index.html#custom-backend) on configuring a custom backend.

##### `wasm32-unknown-unknown` users who enable the `rng` feature without the `js` feature

Upgrade your version of `getrandom` and [follow its new docs](https://docs.rs/getrandom/0.3.1/getrandom/index.html#custom-backend) on configuring a backend.

You'll also need to enable the `rng-getrandom` or `rng-rand` feature of `uuid` to force it to use `getrandom` as its backend:

```diff
[dependencies.uuid]
version = "1.13.0"
- features = ["v4"]
+ features = ["v4", "rng-getrandom"]

[dependencies.getrandom]
version = "0.3"
```

If you're on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and using the `js` feature of `uuid` you shouldn't see any breakage. We've kept this behavior by vendoring in `getrandom`'s web-based backend when the `js` feature is enabled.

##### What's Changed

-   Update `getrandom` to `0.3` and `rand` to `0.9` by [@&#8203;KodrAus](https://redirect.github.com/KodrAus) in [https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/pull/793](https://redirect.github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/pull/793)
-   Support forcing `getrandom` on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` without JavaScript by [@&#8203;KodrAus](https://redirect.github.com/KodrAus) in [https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/pull/794](https://redirect.github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/pull/794)
-   Prepare for 1.13.0 release by [@&#8203;KodrAus](https://redirect.github.com/KodrAus) in [https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/pull/795](https://redirect.github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/pull/795)
