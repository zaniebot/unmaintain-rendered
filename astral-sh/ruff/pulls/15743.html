            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Another oversight in type equivalence, that I spotted by re-reading some of the code in <code>types.rs</code>. In this round of type-equivalence whackamole, we were not considering <code>tuple[P | Q] &amp; R</code> to be equivalent to <code>tuple[Q | P] &amp; R</code>. This bug only manifested if a union was nested directly inside a tuple nested directly inside a top-level intersection.</p>
<p>It sure would be easier to ensure we got all these cases right if unions only ever appeared in a canonical order 😉 I'm not <em>yet</em> pushing for us to reconsider the direction we went in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15516, but there <em>is</em> definitely a maintenance burden here.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>New mdtest added that fails on <code>main</code></li>
<li>Checked that all stable property tests continue to pass</li>
</ul>
