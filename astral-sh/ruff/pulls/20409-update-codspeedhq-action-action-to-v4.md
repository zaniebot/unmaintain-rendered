[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/CodSpeedHQ/action/compare/v3.8.1...v4)

##### 💥 BREAKING

It's now required to explicitly set the runner mode to `instrumentation` or `walltime` using either:

- the `mode` argument
- or the `CODSPEED_RUNNER_MODE` environment variable

> \[!TIP]
> Before, this variable was automatically set to `instrumentation` on every runner except for [CodSpeed macro runners](https://codspeed.io/docs/instruments/walltime) where it was set to `walltime` by default.

Find more details in [the instruments documentation](https://codspeed.io/docs/instruments).

Looking at several Codspeed runs prior to and following this commit, it looks like the walltime benchmarks now take 16-17 minutes to complete in CI following this update, whereas previously they took 10-11 minutes
