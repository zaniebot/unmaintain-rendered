# Allow EXE001 & EXE002 on WSL, fix issues with other cases of mounting non-unix filesystems

---

_Pull request opened by @MusicalNinjaDad on 2025-04-23 15:29_

Handle non-unix filesystems in a way which satisfies not only WSL (#3110, #5445, fixes #10084) but also non-WSL (#12941) cases.

## tl;dr
Seems to be a touch faster than current implementation on *normal* systems; simple to document & use; also supports cases like #12941 / external FAT-drives / ...

**The key changes are in: [`crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_executable/helpers.rs`](https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/forks-ruff/blob/wsl_shebang/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_executable/helpers.rs)**
```rust
// Some file systems do not support executable bits. Instead, everything is executable.
// See #3110, #5445, #10084, #12941
//
// Benchmarking shows better performance vs previous approach of checking `is_wsl()` 
// as long as we use a `OnceLock` and a simple test first (filemode of pyproject.toml).
#[cfg(target_family = "unix")]
static EXECUTABLE_BY_DEFAULT: OnceLock<bool> = OnceLock::new();

#[cfg(target_family = "unix")]
pub(super) fn executable_by_default(settings: &LinterSettings) -> bool {
    *EXECUTABLE_BY_DEFAULT.get_or_init(|| {
        is_executable(&settings.project_root.join("pyproject.toml")).unwrap_or(true)
            // if pyproject.toml is executable or doesn't exist, run a slower check too:
            && NamedTempFile::new_in(&settings.project_root)
                .map_err(std::convert::Into::into)
                .and_then(|tmpfile| is_executable(tmpfile.path()))
                .unwrap_or(false) // Assume a normal filesystem in case of read-only, IOError, ...
    })
}
```

## Open Questions

- [ ] Stick with this approach? (I'd suggest: yes)
  - Do you have any info on how often users will have no pyproject.toml available?
- [ ] Keep test workflow? (I'd suggest: yes, given the very targetted trigger, as long as pinning the SHAs won't lead to dependabot running it too often)
- [ ] Keep benches? (I'd suggest: keeping them disabled - is there a better way than just commenting out the section in `Cargo.toml`, it doesn't seem worth a cfg option?)

## Approach & Alternatives considered

### Recommended Approach: Check filemode of `pyproject.toml`, fallback to a `NamedTempFile`

- Using a `OnceLock` to ensure we only run this check once
- If `project_root/pyproject.toml` exists: check the filemode. If it's not executable - then files aren't executable by default
- If it is, or doesn't exist: create a `NamedTempFile` in `project_root` and check the filemode

#### Pros

- Single approach for all cases
- Guaranteed to catch all cases
- Faster than current implementation (if pyproject.toml exists)

#### Cons

- (Probably) has a very small performance cost (consistently at the edge of what I could measure) for EXE002 in the specific case when
  - no pyproject.toml is available in the project_root, or this has been accidentally set to executable (assuming this is a rare case?)
  - file is not executable & has no shebang (usual case)
  - not WSL (usual case)
  - project is small or user is linting a single file

### Alternative 1: Manual Override

See [617cf6d39abe9b1954c2f291bb23aeacb22d8c9e](https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/forks-ruff/blob/617cf6d39abe9b1954c2f291bb23aeacb22d8c9e/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_executable/mod.rs)

- Provide a environment-variable override
- Otherwise only test default filemode on WSL

#### Pros

- No risk of checking a tempfile unless using WSL
- Allows for cases like #12941
- Follows precedent of `RUFF_CACHE_DIR`

#### Cons

- Requires users to find the relevant documentation and set a specific variable
- Either invoves testing an env-var during the check (feels wrong);
- or threading the value through clap (such as RUFF_CACHE_DIR) which forces the inclusion of a [project-level config setting](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#cache-dir) and spreads the change over a much wider footprint in the codebase
- Very difficult to document well

### Alternative 2: Check filesystem type

I've not tried this one, but could envision:

- Use `std::os::linux::fs::MetadataExt` to identify the actual location of `project_root`
- Use `sysinfo[linux-netdevs]::Disks` to identify the corresponding filesystem
- Check against a list of known-incompatible filesystem types

#### Pros

- No risk of checking a tempfile
- Allows for cases like #12941

#### Cons

- Requires us to identify and maintain a list of incompatible filesystems (9s, FAT, xFAT, NTFS, CIFS, ...?) and will still miss some edge cases (mounting a share from a windows server via NFS)
- Will require special-case handling for symlinks

## Performance

I've added specific benchmarks for these lints, as they are disabled in the normal benches. Benching them is consistently inconsistent (!) - always giving fluctations of +/-2.x% on one or two of the four benches (different ones each time), when repeating on the same codebase.

However, this change does *consistently* show:

- an *improvement* of >3% on one or two of the benches (except NotExecutableNoShebang)
- fluctations on `NotExecutableNoShebang` *within the ranges* I've identified on repeated runs of the same bench on main (< +/-3%)

## Testing

To test this while working on it I've added the following test infrastructure:

- Specific test cases for EXE001 & EXE002 on non-unix filesystems
- A `cfg` option `test-environment` set via `RUFF_TEST_ENVIRONMENT`, to avoid including any system identification logic in the tests themselves
- (the naming of the tests & config value is not 100% semantically correct but best reflects the most likely use case)
- A github workflow which runs the tests for flake8_executable on: native linux, WSL using the windows filesystem, WSL using the native filesystem
  - it (only) triggers on changes to `**/flake8_executable/**` or itself
  - takes about 5 minutes to run, and an additional 3 minutes on first run.
  - and caches the WSL installation to save on windows runner time. This cache should rotate away quite quickly given the specific trigger.

As an aside - the test workflow nicely shows the performance penalty of using /mnt/c on WSL:
  - building ruff with crates/ & target/ on /mnt/c takes almost 15 minutes vs 90 seconds if target/ is on the native filesystem.
  - running the 30 EXE* ruff tests takes 10s (!!) if the fixtures are on /mnt/c and 0.6s if they are on the native filesystem. So users linting projects stored on /mnt/c will be taking a 20x performance penalty vs storing their codebase under $HOME.

Thank you. Your test setup is very impressive. 

There's a lot happening right now. I'm not sure when I'll get the time to review this PR.

Thanks - I fully understand and that quick note was really valuable.

I'd also personally much rather have red-knot available than this included in ruff ;)

I'll probably hang back on taking up other topics until I do get feedback on this (unless I get bored or randomly motivated) - so I can include any feedback on style etc from the start.
