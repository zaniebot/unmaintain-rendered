# Rename semantic model flag `LITERAL` to `TYPING_LITERAL`

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-12-04 17:16_

This PR renames the semantic model flag `LITERAL` to `TYPING_LITERAL` to better reflect its purpose. The main motivation behind this change is to avoid any confusion with the "literal" terminology used in the AST for literal nodes like string, bytes, numbers, etc.
