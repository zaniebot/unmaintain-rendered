            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR adds support for <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0800/">PEP 800</a>. Since ty&#x27;s implementation of disjointness was the original inspiration for the PEP, nearly everything was already implemented; this PR mainly consists of renaming internal concepts to match up with the terms used by the PEP, and hooking things up so that we recognize the effect the new <code>@disjoint_base</code> decorator has.</p>

<p>A bit of a bummer -- I thought this would improve our understanding of disjointness a fair bit now that typeshed <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/14599">has added <code>@disjoint_base</code></a> across all applicable stdlib classes. I expected to see at least some ecosystem hits.</p>

<p>Interestingly exactly the same increase is being reported over in #20085 -- not sure if this job is getting flaky again...?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>of course, unlike the classes that we hardcode as being disjoint bases, we don&#x27;t <em>know</em> that two arbitrary classes decorated as being disjoint bases are marked as such due to the way they&#x27;re implemented in a C extension. You could add that decorator to a class for whatever reason you like.</p>
<p>It holds true for all of typeshed&#x27;s disjoint bases, though, and it&#x27;s <em>probably</em> a good guess in general...?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In principle we could eliminate this method and always look at the typeshed fallback class (and its decorator), right? This is just a small performance optimization (maybe) at the cost of preserving some special-casing that we technically shouldn&#x27;t need anymore?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>heh, Codspeed says that removing the method is no regression at all! Which means that, excluding tests, this PR now removes lines of code on net 🚀</p>
