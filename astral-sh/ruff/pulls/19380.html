            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For what it's worth, in uv we tend to use the <code>--preview</code> flag for this. We warn if you use features that are in preview without providing the <code>--preview</code> flag, and providing the <code>--preview</code> flag explicitly turns off those warnings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be fine with adding this temporarily, seems like the easiest solution. And there's no risk of breaking anyone once we remove it. Should maybe start with <code>TY_</code> though for consistency (https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/env/)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel a bit conflicted about this. It's obviously the easiest solution but it's not what we want to do long term and we haven't received any user reports yet that they find it annoying.</p>
<p>It's also somewhat intentional that the warning is annoying because it was intended as a way to discourage using ty in production because we know it isn't ready yet.</p>
<p>What are the cases where the message get sinto your way? Could you use <code>--quiet</code> instead?</p>

<p>(Just for completeness, if you used <code>--preview</code> to solve this problem, I'd also expect <code>TY_PREVIEW</code> to exist.)</p>

<p>Mostly I find myself running <code>ty check</code> on lots of small examples (do other folks have different workflows?), and it's slightly annoying to see that warning every time. But I wouldn't go so far as to say it gets in my way :)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>IIUC that hides the diagnostic messages too, but I want to see those.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd prefer to either have a solution that works for users too (and that we recommend) or leave it as is (but I also don't feel strongly to object, it's just not high on my priority list).</p>
<p>We probably want to have something like a preview mode and we could add that instead.</p>
<p>A hacky solution for now would be to move the log message out of <code>lib.rs</code> and into another module so that it can be suppressed with <code>TY_LOG</code>: <code>TY_LOG=ty=info,ty::warn=error</code></p>
