# [red-knot] add regression test for fixed cycle panic

---

_Pull request opened by @carljm on 2025-04-22 01:50_

Add a regression test for the cycle documented in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14767, which no longer panics (or even causes a cycle at all.)

Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14767
