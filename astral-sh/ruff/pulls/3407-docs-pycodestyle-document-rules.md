# docs(pycodestyle): document rules

---

_@spaceone_

rip of the descriptions used by pycodestyle itself.

Sometimes the `Why is this bad?` doesn't fit and should better be `Explanation` - but I am not sure if this is a free-format?
Sometimes a `Exceptions` or `Okay variants` section would help.
It's meant as a starting point which can be improved.

Thank you! Mostly changed to directly quote PEP 8 where applicable and list it as a reference.
