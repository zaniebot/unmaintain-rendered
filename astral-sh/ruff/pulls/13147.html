            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you mean <code>self.types.expression_ty(subject)</code> here (<code>self.index</code> is the semantic index, which doesn&#x27;t have an <code>expression_ty</code> method.)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a bit misleading to say &quot;available in ...&quot;, because it won&#x27;t be, if we are inferring a single match pattern definition region, unless we ensure it gets put there. And we should only infer the type of the subject once, even if we have many match-pattern definitions referring to it. This is why we add the subject as a standalone expression in the semantic index; so that we can query its type directly using a cached Salsa query. So the approach we will want here is that we will call the Salsa query <code>infer_expression_types(db, expression)</code>, where we get <code>expression</code> (which is an <code>Expression</code> ingredient) from <code>self.index.expression(the_subject_ast_expr)</code>, and extend our own inference with the result. Once that&#x27;s done then we can look up its type in <code>self.types.expression_ty(subject.scoped_ast_id())</code>. (This is all similar to what&#x27;s currently done in <code>infer_assignment_definition</code>).</p>
<p>It&#x27;s fine for all of this to remain a TODO in this PR! I would just re-word the comment a bit:</p>
<pre><code>        // against the subject expression type (which we can query via `infer_expression_types`)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In this method, anywhere we would have created a <code>Definition</code> in semantic indexing, we should be calling <code>self.infer_definition(...)</code> to lookup the Definition by node (identifier in this case) and infer types in that definition&#x27;s region. This is what ensures we never double infer types: a given expression or definition is only inferred in one region, and &quot;outer&quot; regions always get access to those types by going through the cached Salsa query.</p>
<p>At least that&#x27;s the design so far. This case is a little odd, because a match pattern definition is a very limited region (just an identifier) that doesn&#x27;t actually include any expressions. Currently there is also an invariant that we maintain that doing scope-level inference will infer a type for every Definition in that scope, and have those types in its <code>self.types.definitions</code> map. But I actually don&#x27;t think we rely on that invariant anywhere, like we do on the all-expressions-have-types invariant.</p>
<p>I still think for now it&#x27;s probably best if we go ahead and do inference on all the match-pattern Definitions when we encounter them here?</p>
<p>Looking at this now, I also think when we do proper type inference for match statements, we will need to create a new ingredient and Salsa query for inferring types on a pattern and matching it against a subject, otherwise we will end up inferring types on expressions within the pattern multiple times (once per definition in that pattern), which is something we want to avoid. That new query doesn&#x27;t need to happen in this PR, but it would be good to add a TODO here, something like <code>// TODO Salsa query for inferring pattern types and matching against subject</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This looks good! Match statements are really tricky, and push the edges of the current design -- thanks for carefully thinking through how to handle them.</p>
<p>The main substantive change I think we need is that I think each match-pattern Definition needs to keep a reference to the subject of the match statement. And I think that scope-level inference should call <code>infer_definition_types</code> for the match-pattern definitions when they are encountered, though this one may not be strictly necessary, and I&#x27;m open to discussion on it.</p>
<p>Still approving anyway, since any of these things could also be done in a follow-up PR, with no harm done.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main reason for me to keep the visitor separate was because of the state variables which includes both the <code>index</code> and <code>pattern</code>. Here, the <code>pattern</code> is the outermost pattern being visited and is required to store because of the recursive nature of the visitor pattern. One advantage of using a separate visitor is that the state is reset as soon as the work is done.</p>

<p>I didn&#x27;t realize that this delegation would be required until a bit later when I noticed some tests failing. That said, I think it makes sense to maintain this invariant to avoid any future failure like the one I mentioned. We could create a separate <code>State</code> struct which maintains the necessary variables.</p>

<p>This requires creating the definition which requires the identifier index in the root pattern. This means we need to use the visitor pattern / save context on the type inference builder. I avoided this for now because I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly how the type inference was going to work here which itself is a separate task. Still, if you want I can take that up as a follow-up work to infer the definition types by storing the context on the builder.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand &quot;This requires creating the definition which requires the identifier index in the root pattern&quot; -- I wasn&#x27;t suggesting to fully do the inference here, just to actually make it go through the <code>infer_definition_types</code> query path (but then still end up with <code>Unknown</code> for now). But now that this is merged it&#x27;s fine, we can follow up in a future PR on the inference part.</p>
