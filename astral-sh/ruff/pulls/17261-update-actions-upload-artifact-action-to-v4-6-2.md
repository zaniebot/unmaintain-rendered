#### Notice: Breaking Changes :warning:

We will no longer include hidden files and folders by default in the `upload-artifact` action of this version. This reduces the risk that credentials are accidentally uploaded into artifacts. Customers who need to continue to upload these files can use a new option, `include-hidden-files`, to continue to do so.

See ["Notice of upcoming deprecations and breaking changes in GitHub Actions runners"](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-08-19-notice-of-upcoming-deprecations-and-breaking-changes-in-github-actions-runners/) changelog and [this issue](https://redirect.github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/602) for more details.
