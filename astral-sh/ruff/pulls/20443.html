<p>This PR uses the new <code>Diagnostic</code> type for rendering formatter diagnostics. This allows the formatter to inherit all of the output formats already implemented in the linter and ty. For example, here's the new <code>full</code> output format, with the formatting diff displayed using the same infrastructure as the linter:</p>
<p><img width="592" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d09817d-3f27-4960-aa8b-41ba47fb4dc0" /></p>
<details><summary>Resolved TODOs</summary>
<p>

<p>~~There are several limitiations/todos here still, especially around the <code>OutputFormat</code> type~~:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] A few literal <code>todo!</code>s for the remaining <code>OutputFormat</code>s without matching <code>DiagnosticFormat</code>s</li>
<li>[x] The default output format is <code>full</code> instead of something more concise like the current output</li>
<li>[x] Some of the output formats (namely JSON) have information that doesn't make much sense for these diagnostics</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these is definitely resolved, and I think the other two are as well, based on discussion on the design document. In brief, we're okay inheriting the default <code>OutputFormat</code> and can separate the global option into <code>lint.output-format</code> and <code>format.output-format</code> in the future, if needed; and we're okay including redundant information in the non-human-readable output formats.</p>
<p>My last major concern is with the performance of the new code, as discussed in the <code>Benchmarks</code> section below.</p>
<p>A smaller question is whether we should use <code>Diagnostic</code>s for formatting errors too. I think the answer to this is yes, in line with changes we're making in the linter too. I still need to implement that here.</p>
</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Benchmarks</summary>
<p>

<p>The values in the table are from a large benchmark on the CPython 3.10 code
base, which involves checking 2011 files, 1872 of which need to be reformatted.
<code>stable</code> corresponds to the same code used on <code>main</code>, while <code>preview-full</code> and
<code>preview-concise</code> use the new <code>Diagnostic</code> code gated behind <code>--preview</code> for the
<code>full</code> and <code>concise</code> output formats, respectively. <code>stable-diff</code> uses the
<code>--diff</code> to compare the two diff rendering approaches. See the full hyperfine
command below for more details. For a sense of scale, the <code>stable</code> output format
produces 1873 lines on stdout, compared to 855,278 for <code>preview-full</code> and
857,798 for <code>stable-diff</code>.</p>
<p>| Command           |     Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] |     Relative |
|:------------------|--------------:|---------:|---------:|-------------:|
| <code>stable</code>          |   201.2 ± 6.8 |    192.9 |    220.6 |         1.00 |
| <code>preview-full</code>    | 9113.2 ± 31.2 |   9076.1 |   9152.0 | 45.29 ± 1.54 |
| <code>preview-concise</code> |   214.2 ± 1.4 |    212.0 |    217.6 |  1.06 ± 0.04 |
| <code>stable-diff</code>     | 3308.6 ± 20.2 |   3278.6 |   3341.8 | 16.44 ± 0.56 |</p>
<p>In summary, the <code>preview-concise</code> diagnostics are ~6% slower than the stable
output format, increasing the average runtime from 201.2 ms to 214.2 ms. The
<code>full</code> preview diagnostics are much more expensive, taking over 9113.2 ms to
complete, which is ~3x more expensive even than the stable diffs produced by the
<code>--diff</code> flag.</p>
<p>My main takeaways here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rendering <code>Edit</code>s is much more expensive than rendering the diffs from <code>--diff</code></li>
<li>Constructing <code>Edit</code>s actually isn't too bad</li>
</ol>
<h3>Constructing <code>Edit</code>s</h3>
<p>I also took a closer look at <code>Edit</code> construction by modifying the code and
repeating the <code>preview-concise</code> benchmark and found that the main issue is
constructing a <code>SourceFile</code> for use in the <code>Edit</code> rendering. Commenting out the
<code>Edit</code> construction itself has basically no effect:</p>
<p>| Command   |   Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] |    Relative |
|:----------|------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|
| <code>stable</code>  | 197.5 ± 1.6 |    195.0 |    200.3 |        1.00 |
| <code>no-edit</code> | 208.9 ± 2.2 |    204.8 |    212.2 | 1.06 ± 0.01 |</p>
<p>However, also omitting the source text from the <code>SourceFile</code> construction
resolves the slowdown compared to <code>stable</code>. So it seems that copying the full
source text into a <code>SourceFile</code> is the main cause of the slowdown for non-<code>full</code>
diagnostics.</p>
<p>| Command          |   Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] |    Relative |
|:-----------------|------------:|---------:|---------:|------------:|
| <code>stable</code>         | 202.4 ± 2.9 |    197.6 |    207.9 |        1.00 |
| <code>no-source-text</code> | 202.7 ± 3.3 |    196.3 |    209.1 | 1.00 ± 0.02 |</p>
<h3>Rendering diffs</h3>
<p>The main difference between <code>stable-diff</code> and <code>preview-full</code> seems to be the diffing strategy we use from <code>similar</code>. Both versions use the same algorithm, but in the existing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_linter/src/source_kind.rs#L259"><code>CodeDiff</code></a> rendering for the <code>--diff</code> flag, we only do line-level diffing, whereas for <code>Diagnostic</code>s we use <code>TextDiff::iter_inline_changes</code> to highlight word-level changes too. Skipping the word diff for <code>Diagnostic</code>s closes most of the gap:</p>
<p>| Command | Mean [s] | Min [s] | Max [s] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| <code>stable-diff</code> | 3.323 ± 0.015 | 3.297 | 3.341 | 1.00 |
| <code>preview-full</code> | 3.654 ± 0.019 | 3.618 | 3.682 | 1.10 ± 0.01 |</p>
<p>(In some repeated runs, I've seen as small as a ~5% difference, down from 10% in the table)</p>
<p>This doesn't actually change any of our snapshots, but it would obviously change the rendered result in a terminal since we wouldn't highlight the specific words that changed within a line.</p>
<p>Another much smaller change that we can try is removing the deadline from the <code>iter_inline_changes</code> call. It looks like there's a fair amount of overhead from the default 500 ms deadline for computing these, and using <code>iter_inline_changes(op, None)</code> (<code>None</code> for the optional deadline argument) improves the runtime quite a bit:</p>
<p>| Command | Mean [s] | Min [s] | Max [s] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| <code>stable-diff</code> | 3.322 ± 0.013 | 3.298 | 3.341 | 1.00 |
| <code>preview-full</code> | 5.296 ± 0.030 | 5.251 | 5.366 | 1.59 ± 0.01 |</p>

<p>More broadly, it seems pretty expensive to add the entire file's contents as an Edit. I'm guessing that might show up in the benchmarks on this PR. On a related note, this is a pretty shallow conversion, only constructing the Diagnostics right before rendering. There might be a better way to use the new infrastructure more. We could also use them for rendering FormatCommandErrors, not just FormatPathResults.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A solution here could be to add a <code>diff</code> field to <code>Diagnostic</code> so that the &quot;edit&quot; is computed lazily or the diff is rendered directly instead of using the edit rendering.</p>

<p>The default output format is full instead of something more concise like the current output</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is mostly ready for review now. I did a lot of squashing today to make it easier to review commit-by-commit.</p>
<p>The first 7 commits are all very small, standalone refactors used in later steps. The 8th commit is the biggest, converting <code>FormatPathResult</code>s into diagnostics. The 9th commit is an incremental improvement on that to split notebook <code>Edit</code>s by cell so that they can actually be rendered in the <code>full</code> output format (otherwise they never satisfy <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_db/src/diagnostic/render/full.rs#L141">this check</a>). Finally, the last commit emits errors as diagnostics too.</p>
<p>I still have a bunch of TODO comments on the errors. I did my best to match up the error variants with <code>DiagnosticId</code>s, including adding two new <code>DiagnosticId</code>s, but I think there's still room for improvement. I should probably also add a test for some or all of these.</p>
<p>I haven't tried to truncate the lines in the diff yet either. I know that came up in the design discussion, so I'm happy to tackle it now or leave it for a follow up if desired.</p>
<p>Hopefully it's not too glaring, but in the screenshot in the summary you can see that the <code>|</code> for line numbers doesn't line up with the middle of the filename <code>--&gt;</code> like it does for lint diagnostics. I don't think there's really a good way around this since the arrow alignment comes from <code>annotate-snippets</code> and only gets indented if <code>annotate-snippets</code> renders line numbers too. I'm sure we could hack another option into <code>annotate-snippets</code>, but it would likely make https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20411 harder still.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm marking this ready for review. I pushed a few more commits resolving the main issues I noted above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I added a <code>lineno_offset</code>/<code>header_offset</code> field for improving the <code>--&gt;</code> alignment:</p>
<p><img width="555" height="417" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829cce57-0fe2-4ad1-b5b7-6f8b77fd2a94" /></p>
<p>It can still go wrong and makes it harder to un-fork <code>annotate-snippets</code>, so I'm happy to revert this, but I think it's a visual improvement in general.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I added tests for all of the <code>FormatCommandError</code> variants and fixed a couple of oversights in their formatting, including factoring out and using some of ty's panic rendering. There are still TODOs on a few of these, but I think I could use some input on the best <code>DiagnosticId</code>s to use. The tests at least show what they look like to help us iterate on them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the performance hit is acceptable. It's only ~10 ms (~5%) for the <code>concise</code> output on a large project, and the larger discrepancy between <code>full</code> output and <code>--diff</code> seems justified given the additional work of computing more granular diffs. I am seeing slightly worse performance today compared to the last time I ran the benchmarks, so it may be worth a bit more profiling, but I think the point still stands.</p>
<details><summary>New benchmark table</summary>
<p>

<p>| Command           |     Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] |     Relative |
| :---------------- | ------------: | -------: | -------: | -----------: |
| <code>stable</code>          |   200.0 ± 2.3 |    196.6 |    203.5 |         1.00 |
| <code>preview-full</code>    | 9134.8 ± 32.1 |   9108.0 |   9197.5 | 45.67 ± 0.55 |
| <code>preview-concise</code> |   232.6 ± 4.2 |    227.0 |    240.7 |  1.16 ± 0.02 |
| <code>stable-diff</code>     | 3354.8 ± 15.9 |   3333.7 |   3383.6 | 16.77 ± 0.21 |</p>
<p><code>stable</code> is basically identical to last time, but both <code>preview</code> versions are ~20 ms slower. <code>--diff</code> is almost 50 ms slower, which really doesn't make sense.</p>
</p>
</details> 

<p>Similarly, I think we may want to truncate large diffs at some point (Zanie even mentioned possibly making the limit configurable), but I think we can hold off on that for now.</p>
<p>Oh, one other TODO is that it would be nice to emit a warning if the <code>output-format</code> is set without <code>preview</code>, but I don't think that's so easy to do since <code>output-format</code> is a global option and will have already been <code>unwrap_or_default</code>ed by the time we see it.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder: Do your changes regress the performance of <code>format</code> (without <code>--check</code> or <code>--diff</code>). I suspect it could because we're now always capturing <code>formatted</code> and <code>unformatted</code> even if the changes were written right to disk.</p>
<p>I think we should keep both those variants but use <code>Diff</code> when using <code>--check</code> but keep using <code>Formatted</code> when using a bare <code>format</code> command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using IO here is probably fine and roughly matches what we do in the lint command.</p>
<p>We match on all <code>ignore::Error</code> in ty and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log a warning for any gitignore related errors but keep going (unlike Ruff)</li>
<li>Create IO errors for all other errors</li>
</ul>

<p>What's special about the ignore errors is that the path isn't guaranteed to be the current file path. E.g. the error could be related to the gitignore file in the same or even a parent directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's worth trying to do a little better here and trim the edit to the range that is different. This can be done in <code>O(n)</code> by searching the first (or last) character that's different (I'm not sure if we should then move forward/backward to find the start/end of the line or if that doesn't matter). I think that would also remove the need to use <code>set_file_level(true)</code> and for <code>set_header_offset</code>?</p>
<p>While not as good as separate Edits, it should already narrow the `Edits significantly in practice.</p>

<p>I think we can simply ignore that error or log a warning with tracing. It might also be worth checking what ruff check does.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using <code>set_file_level</code> here seems odd to me. I understand that the motivation for <code>set_file_level</code> was to suppress code snippets for diagnostics starting at 1:1 (or don't have a range).</p>
<p>But we do want to show the code snippet for formatter diagnostics and I believe it's the reason why the <code>--&gt;</code> arrow gets misplaced.</p>
<p>Why do we need <code>set_file_level</code> here, could we avoid using it as it seems a misuse?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I thought about the warning, but I wasn't sure how easy it would be to add since the output format is a global setting.

<p>It seems a bit easier if we want to check for non-default output formats, at least.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The snippet in your comment is the main difference. In the linter we still use the <code>TextEmitter</code> for these output formats and mix in a few other checks in the <code>match</code>:</p>

<p>We also use at least one different configuration setting in the formatter to always suppress the fix availability icon.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wasn't sure that we do want to show the code snippet for these diagnostics as it also requires us to underline/annotate a range in the file. I didn't want to add a multi-line annotation possibly spanning the entire file, but maybe we can underline the first changed line? That could work well with your other suggestion about narrowing the edit range. It does seem slightly redundant to render any code if we're immediately going to render it again in the diff, but I can give it a try.</p>
<p>But yes, you're right. If we set a real range and thus render a snippet we can avoid making these file-level diagnostics, and I can also revert my arrow changes.</p>

<p>I guess I was still thinking of these conceptually as file-level diagnostics. That's what they are on stable anyway, &quot;File would be reformatted.&quot; But I'm happy to rename the setting, <code>hide_snippet</code> makes the actual effect more clear for sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the alignment. We can probably get it &quot;right&quot; if we compute the line number where the first change is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's roughly what I'm doing now, except it's a bit better to compute the line number of the <em>last</em> change (currently the end of the file) since that's likely to need a wider alignment than the start. Notebooks are also more complicated since the width is for the per-cell line number.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's interesting. I do think it looks nice aligning the middle of the arrow with the line number separator, but maybe it's not worth the trouble.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: I'd also classify this as an internal error. At least, how we're using it in the formatter.</p>
<p>The way we use this error variant is to avoid panicking if we didn't see a specific syntax element when doing some ad-hoc lexing. This means, we incorrectly assumed some invariant that isn't true because the formatter is never called on code with syntax errors. This is always an implementation error -&gt; <code>InternalError</code>)</p>
<p>The original intended use case for this error variant comes from biome where the formatter supports formatting code with syntax error. The way it works is that it formats all code without syntax errors. For sections that contain syntax errors, it falls back to preserving the formatting from the source by catching <code>FormatError::SyntaxError</code> at the statement level. But even for Biome, a <code>SyntaxError</code> should never be propagated passt the statement formatting. If it does, than that's consider an internal error too.</p>

<p>I still very much dislike the offset hack but I think we can get it &quot;correct&quot; enough outside annotated snippet. However, it might be worth spending like a day to see if we can move the diff rendering to annotated snippets, removign the need for the offset workaround. But this can be a separate PR</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the reviews!</p>
<p>I think this could use one more look. I was over-complicating the range calculations for a while today, but they felt kind of tricky, at least when I was trying to use <code>zip</code> like the <code>start</code> calculation[^1]. The new <code>ModifiedRange</code> type seems to be working well now, though, unless I missed any edge cases.</p>
<p>The other changes seemed relatively straightforward, and I also merged the changes from #20595.</p>
<p>I'll timebox trying to move our diff rendering to annotate-snippets to one day later this week.</p>
<p>[^1]: The tricky part was that zipping and <code>find</code>ing the first different character could easily fail if one of the snippets was shorter than the other; at that point it's not clear which one was shorter and caused the failure. We also want an exclusive range, so we've gone one character too far by finding the first different character rather than the last common character. Now I just loop from the end and track the length of the common suffix, which we can subtract from both <code>text_len</code>s despite the actual offsets likely being different.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It shouldn't matter so I think it's fine leaving as is but there's the third case where <code>modified_range.unformatted</code> is empty (e.g. when adding blank lines between two classes), in which case its an insertion.

<p>Now, <code>ruff format --check</code>, become like <code>ruff format --diff</code>? But with more features.</p>
<p>So, <code>ruff format --diff</code> is deprecated for preview mode now?</p>

          Avoid writing any formatted files back; instead, exit with a non-zero

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--diff</code> produces a standalone diff that can still be useful for applying as a patch, for example, so it's not deprecated. The &quot;diff&quot; shown by the default <code>format --check</code> output uses the same format that's in preview for lint rules, which is a bit different.</p>

Redirection (<code>ruff format --check [...] &gt; DIR/OUTFILE</code>) doesn't fully solve the issue, since the directory containing the output file is required to exist.</p>

<p>No, I don't think so. This PR was for the <code>format</code> subcommand, so it shouldn't affect <code>ruff check</code> (the lint subcommand) at all. Micha's comment about Ruff only reporting leftover diagnostics after fixes have been applied is still accurate, as far as I know.</p>
