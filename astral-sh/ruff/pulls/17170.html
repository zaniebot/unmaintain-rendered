            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fixes #17164. Simply checking whether one type is gradually equivalent to another is too simplistic here: <code>Any</code> is gradually equivalent to <code>Todo</code>, but we should permit users to cast from <code>Todo</code> or <code>Unknown</code> to <code>Any</code> without complaining about it. This changes our logic so that we only complain about redundant casts if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the two types are exactly equal (when normalized) OR they are equivalent (we'll still complain about <code>Any -&gt; Any</code> casts, and about <code>Any | str | int</code> -&gt; <code>str | int | Any</code> casts, since their normalized forms are exactly equal, even though the type is not fully static -- and therefore does not participate in equivalence relations)</li>
<li>AND the casted type does not contain <code>Todo</code></li>
</ul>
