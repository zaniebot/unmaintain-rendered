### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2025-62522](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/security/advisories/GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7)

### Summary
Files denied by [`server.fs.deny`](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-fs-deny) were sent if the URL ended with `\` when the dev server is running on Windows.

### Impact
Only apps that match the following conditions are affected:

- explicitly exposes the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or [`server.host` config option](https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-host))
- running the dev server on Windows

### Details
`server.fs.deny` can contain patterns matching against files (by default it includes `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.{crt,pem}` as such patterns). These patterns were able to bypass by using a back slash(`\`). The root cause is that `fs.readFile('/foo.png/')` loads `/foo.png`.

### PoC
```shell
npm create vite@latest
cd vite-project/
cat "secret" > .env
npm install
npm run dev
curl --request-target /.env\ http://localhost:5173
```
