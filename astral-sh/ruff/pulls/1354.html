            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have added an autofix for W292, updated the tests, and updated the README. I'm relatively new to Rust and would love any feedback (even though there isn't many changes). If you would prefer, I could move the check into <code>plugins.rs</code> instead of keeping it in the same file. Also, if you want, I can open an issue as specified in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> if this is considered bigger changes.</p>
<p>Unrelated note: I ran <code>git push</code> on my own machine with my own PAT (personal access token) and somehow on the first commit someone named &quot;@kasryan&quot; committed, but on later commits with the same command and PAT I was correctly shown as the person who committed. I have no clue who @kasryan is.</p>
