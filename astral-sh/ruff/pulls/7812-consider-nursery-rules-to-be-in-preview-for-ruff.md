# Consider nursery rules to be in-preview for `ruff rule`

---

_Pull request opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-04 13:46_

## Summary

We treat these rules as `preview` elsewhere, so adding `preview: false` to the JSON and such seems like an error.

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7804.
