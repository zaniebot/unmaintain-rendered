# Fix a typo in the docs

Thanks for the great tool!

I noticed a small typo [in the docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/none-not-at-end-of-union/): it's [commutativity](Commutative_property) that makes the order not matter in type unions, not [associativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) which is something different.

I make the change in this PR.
