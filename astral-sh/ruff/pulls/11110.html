            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is needed because of the AST changes from <code>OnceCell</code> to <code>OnceLock</code>.</p>
<p>If we decide we don't need AST to be Sync/Send, we can revert this along with those changes; just want green CI for now.</p>
<p>Also adjust a URL in doc comments so <code>cargo docs</code> doesn't complain about it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know what the ecosystem failure is about, or whether it's related to red-knot. Shouldn't matter much though, since most red-knot PRs won't touch the linter for now anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the ecosystem failure is ok. It may get confused sometimes when you have a non-<code>main</code> upstream (can't remember).</p>
