<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>It semi-implements rule B903 from flake8-bugbear. The implementation is working but I need some clarifications regarding what is considerd a class that only set attributes in an  <code>__init__</code> method. This was implemented because it is rule to be implemented in #3758.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>I implementeed the same test suite as the one located in flake8-bugbear, as such the should behave the same way.</p>
<p>Test suite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class NoWarningsMoreMethods:
    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar

    def other_function(self): ...


class NoWarningsClassAttributes:
    spam = &quot;ham&quot;

    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar


class NoWarningsComplicatedAssignment:
    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar
        self.spam = &quot; - &quot;.join([foo, bar])


class NoWarningsMoreStatements:
    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        foo = &quot; - &quot;.join([foo, bar])
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar


class Warnings:
    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar


class WarningsWithDocstring:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A docstring should not be an impediment to a warning&quot;&quot;&quot;

    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar
</code></pre>
<p>I want to add more test cases because the current implementation is a generalization.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The earlier PR #9601 ended up implementing this rule, which unfortunately makes this a duplicate. (You couldn't have known, since that PR was originally implementing a closely related <code>pylint</code> rule).</p>
<p>Apologies for the outcome and the long delay in resolving this, but thank you for your contribution and interest in Ruff - I hope this doesn't discourage you from contributing in the future!</p>
