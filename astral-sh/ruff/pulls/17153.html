            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a follow up to the goto type definition PR. Specifically, that we want to avoid exposing too many semantic model internals publicly.</p>
<p>I want to get some feedback on the approach taken. I think it goes into the right direction but I'm not super happy with it.
The basic idea is that we add a <code>Type::definition</code> method which does the &quot;goto type definition&quot;. The parts that I think make it awkward:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can't directly return <code>Definition</code> because we don't create a <code>Definition</code> for modules (but we could?). Although I think it makes sense to possibly have a more public wrapper type anyway?</li>
<li>It doesn't handle unions and intersections. Mainly because not all elements in an intersection may have a definition and we only want to show a navigation target for intersections if there's only a single positive element (besides maybe <code>Unknown</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative design or an addition to this design is to introduce a <code>SemanticAnalysis(Db)</code> struct that has methods like <code>type_definition(&amp;self, type)</code> which explicitly exposes the methods we want. I don't feel comfortable design this API yet because it's unclear how fine granular it has to be (and if it is very fine granular, directly using <code>Type</code> might be better after all)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems fine to me, and I'm happy to see a lot of unnecessary <code>pub</code> removed.</p>
<p>I think of <code>Definition</code> as a pretty internal implementation detail of the semantic index and symbol resolution, so I'd prefer if it weren't <code>pub</code> at all, and I'm happy to have a separate <code>TypeDefinition</code> struct exposed as public API.</p>
<p>I don't think it would make sense to have <code>Definition</code> for a module, because the meaning of <code>Definition</code> is a value assigned to a name in a scope, which doesn't apply to an entire module.</p>
<p>Leaving the caller to decide how to handle intersections and unions also seems reasonable to me; the union or intersection type does not itself have a definition location. I guess the main disadvantage I see here is that it requires us to expose more of the API of union and intersection types, but we probably will need this for the linter anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Orthogonal to this PR but I just noticed in playground that we don't implement goto-type-definition for PEP 695 type aliases (<code>type Foo = int</code>), even though we could jump to the <code>type</code> statement. I think this would require keeping a reference to the <code>Definition</code> in <code>TypeAliasType</code>.</p>
