            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Regardless of whether #16408 and #16311 pan out, this part is worth pulling out as a separate PR.</p>
<p>Before, you had to define a new <code>IndexVec</code> index type for each type of association list you wanted to create.  Now there's a single index type that's internal to the alist implementation, and you use <code>List&lt;K, V&gt;</code> to store a handle to a particular list.</p>
<p>This also adds some property tests for the alist implementation.</p>

<p>We weren't (and as far as I know, aren't planning on) creating any lists with the same <code>K, V</code> but different <code>I</code> types.  So I was viewing this as removing a redundancy.</p>

<p>If there's value in having the separate index type than I think I'd prefer to keep it and instead have type aliases in <code>red_knot_python_semantic</code> or to move the types into <code>red_knot_python_semantic</code> if we don't intent to use it elsewhere.</p>

<p>That's a tough question. I don't think there's a fitting crate for it but creating its own crate also feels somewhat overkill. I'm okay leaving it here or I'd move it into <code>red_knot_python_semantic</code>, considering it's the only place where we use the type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Discussed this briefly with @dcreager  in our 1:1. I don't think this really loses any type safety that we had previously. If you want to create two list arenas with the same <code>K</code> and <code>V</code> but whose lists are treated as different types, you can do that in the same way you would in the same scenario with any other collection type: wrap it in a newtype. This seems more ergonomic, more idiomatic, and just as type-safe as being forced to define a distinct newtype-index.</p>
<p>The most likely mistake in our use of these lists is that we would mistakenly use a list from one scope's list arena with the arena from a different scope. But these arenas are all the same type (and use the same newtype-index today), so we already don't have protection from this. (It's no different than any of our per-scope IndexVec newtype indices, which are invalid if used across scopes, and we don't have compiler-level protection from this.)</p>

<p>Done.  That required removing some methods that aren't currently being used (union, list iterator), but we can always resurrect those from the git history if needed.</p>
