            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That PR title might be a bit inscrutable.</p>
<p>Consider the two constraints <code>T ≤ bool</code> and <code>T ≤ int</code>. Since <code>bool ≤ int</code>, by transitivity <code>T ≤ bool</code> implies <code>T ≤ int</code>. (Every type that is a subtype of <code>bool</code> is necessarily also a subtype of <code>int</code>.) That means that <code>T ≤ bool ∧ T ≰ int</code> is an impossible combination of constraints, and is therefore not a valid input to any BDD. We say that that assignment is not in the <em>domain</em> of the BDD.</p>
<p>The implication <code>T ≤ bool → T ≤ int</code> can be rewritten as <code>T ≰ bool ∨ T ≤ int</code>. (That's the definition of implication.) If we construct that constraint set in an mdtest, we should get a constraint set that is always satisfiable. Previously, that constraint set would correctly <em>display</em> as <code>always</code>, but a <code>static_assert</code> on it would fail.</p>
<p>The underlying cause is that our <code>is_always_satisfied</code> method would only test if the BDD was the <code>AlwaysTrue</code> terminal node. <code>T ≰ bool ∨ T ≤ int</code> does not simplify that far, because we purposefully keep around those constraints in the BDD structure so that it's easier to compare against other BDDs that reference those constraints.</p>
<p>To fix this, we need a more nuanced definition of &quot;always satisfied&quot;. Instead of evaluating to <code>true</code> for <em>every</em> input, we only need it to evaluate to <code>true</code> for every <em>valid</em> input — that is, every input in its domain.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ugh... I wanted to display this without simplifying the DNF so that we could see (and test!) that its internal structure is not just the <code>AlwaysTrue</code> terminal. But the display simplification rules are important to get consistent output even when BDD variable ordering changes. So this is a flaky assertion, as can be seen in the CI failures.</p>
<p>For now, I think I'm going to back out the parts that let us display BDD domains in the mdtests. The equality test below still lets us test that the domain is not just <code>AlwaysTrue</code>, even if we can't display it nicely.</p>
