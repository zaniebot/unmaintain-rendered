            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, these are the only changes in this PR that are clear improvement to me. For most of the others, I prefer them as they are -- I wouldn&#x27;t usually put a comma after &quot;e.g.&quot;. Even in this paragraph, I would remove the comma you&#x27;ve added after &quot;e.g.&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @AlexWaygood, I see your point, I just wanted to keep it consistent with the rest of the docs, where most &quot;e.g&quot;s are followed by a comma.</p>

<p>Typically, but not always. Take a look at the change in <code>BREAKING_CHANGES.md</code> in this PR. On <code>main</code> it&#x27;s</p>
<pre><code>Previously, Ruff supported the non-standard compliant emoji identifiers e.g. `📦 = 1`.
</code></pre>
<p>And I agree that&#x27;s ungrammatical if you replace it with &quot;for example&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>Previously, Ruff supported the non-standard compliant emoji identifiers for example `📦 = 1`.
</code></pre>
<p>But it&#x27;s also ungrammatical if you add a comma after &quot;for example&quot; here:</p>
<pre><code>Previously, Ruff supported the non-standard compliant emoji identifiers for example, `📦 = 1`.
</code></pre>
<p>To make it grammatical, you&#x27;d need to place a comma <em>before</em> the &quot;for example&quot; here as well as after:</p>
<pre><code>Previously, Ruff supported the non-standard compliant emoji identifiers, for example, `📦 = 1`.
</code></pre>
<p>Or, even better, start a new sentence:</p>
<pre><code>Previously, Ruff supported the non-standard compliant emoji identifiers. For example, `📦 = 1`.
</code></pre>
<p>But best of all would probably be to use a different construction altogether here, like &quot;such as&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>Previously, Ruff supported non-standards-compliant emoji identifiers such as `📦 = 1`.
</code></pre>
