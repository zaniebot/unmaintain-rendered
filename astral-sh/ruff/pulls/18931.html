<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Here's the part that was split out of #18906. I wanted to move these into the rule files since the rest of the rules in <code>deferred_scope</code>/<code>statement</code> have that same structure of implementations being in the rule definition file. It also resolves the dilemma of where to put the comment, at least for these rules.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>N/A, no test/functionality affected</p>
