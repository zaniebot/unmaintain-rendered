            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just some smaller changes of things I noticed during/after my first contribution. I completely missed the print-ast command and it took me a bit to figure out how to properly call it (although that is just my lack of rust/cargo experience likely).</p>
<p>I saw this neat cargo alias in two other rust projects and I think this makes it nicer to use, e.g. <code>cargo dev generate-rules-table</code>. Also generate-rules-table was really expecting to be called from within the ruff_dev directory, so I made that more flexible.</p>
