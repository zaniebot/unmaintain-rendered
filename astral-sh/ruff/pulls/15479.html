<p>They're mainly experimentations on my end but I never really had time to fully persuade them. The overall design with <code>AstNode</code> is inspired by rust analyzers/BiomeJS AST <a href="https://github.com/biomejs/biome/blob/main/crates/biome_js_syntax/src/generated/nodes.rs#L16418">facade over a generic syntax node</a>. But I don't think the design works as well for our AST. That's why removing <code>cast</code>, <code>cast_ref</code>, and <code>Ref</code> is probably a good idea. I'm also open to removing the <code>AstNode</code>.</p>
<p>I do think it might be valuable to keep <code>StatementRef</code> around:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have and use <code>ExpressionRef</code>, <code>AnyNodeRef</code>. <code>StatementRef</code> is needed for a &quot;complete&quot; API</li>
<li>The main motivation for <code>StatementRef</code> (and <code>ExpressionRef</code>) is that we have methods that should accept any statement node. Historically, we used <code>&amp;Stmt</code> for those. The problem with using <code>&amp;Stmt</code> is that you're screwed if you only have a <code>&amp;StmtIf</code> because there's no way to go from <code>&amp;StmtIf</code> to <code>&amp;Stmt::If</code>. Our previous solution was to change the call-site to get access to the <code>&amp;Stmt</code> node. Unfortunately, that method now accepts redundant arguments or we just weakened its signature (with a very likely <code>unwrap</code> call in the method itself). A possible solution for this problem is to use <code>StatementRef</code> over <code>&amp;Stmt</code> because you can convert a <code>&amp;Stmt</code> and a specific statement node to <code>StatementRef</code>. I've never had the time to refactor some code to use <code>StatementRef</code> because it's hard to identify the problematic methods now where they all use <code>&amp;Stmt</code> instead of a specific node. It's also something that needs to be done at a larger scale because mixing <code>StatementRef</code> and <code>&amp;Stmt</code> is problematic again whenever you have to call from a function taking a <code>StatementRef</code> into a function that takes a <code>&amp;Stmt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I'm eventually aiming for (WIP branch <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/dcreager/ast-builder">here</a>) would be to use <code>IndexVec</code> to store all of the AST variants, and <code>Stmt</code>/<code>Expr</code>/etc would be enums wrapping the <em>id</em>, not the actual data.  I think that would make <code>Expr</code> work in places where we're currently using <code>ExpressionRef</code>.  And a method that only operates on <code>StmtIf</code> would take in <code>StmtIfId</code> instead of the enum wrapper.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR diff is <em>much</em> nicer with #15544 merged!  This is ready for review again.</p>
<p>I've also taken the opportunity to remove <code>AnyNode</code>.  In general, we operate on references to syntax nodes, and not owned copies of them.  It was only being used in one test, which can be updated to use <code>AnyNodeRef</code> instead.</p>

<p>I've kept <code>StatementRef</code> (and <code>ExpressionRef</code>), though with #15544 they're now auto-generated.</p>
