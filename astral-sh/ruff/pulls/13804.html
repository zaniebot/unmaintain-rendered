            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aren't the line numbers off after a code block (that could span multiple lines)?</p>
<p>I think a better approach is to track the <code>offset</code> (<code>TextSize</code>) and increment it in <code>self.scan</code> and here. Then use <code>LineIndex</code> during rendering to get the line number.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: I'm inclined to use a regular <code>Vec</code> here and instead sort it before returning it in <code>run_test</code>. Vec's are just overall simpler data structure (e.g. for iterating). I then would add the <code>md_offset</code> to the <code>FailuresByLine</code> data structure (do we still need <code>line_number</code> or can we replace it with the <code>md_offset</code>?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>nit: just because you <em>can</em> do arbitrary unpacking in Rust doesn't mean you <em>should</em> ;)</p>
<p>Here, I'd find this more readable:</p>

                let AbsoluteLineNumberPath {
                    path,
                    line_number: absolute_line_number,

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The indentation should come before <code>absolute_line_info</code> here, so that the per-line diagnostics are indented below the &quot;heading&quot;, which is the name of the embedded file</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">                        println!(&quot;    {absolute_line_info} {line_info} {failure}&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the output in the terminal looks is beautifully organised like this if you have a test which has multiple Python snippets in the same Markdown test, and failures in more than one of those code blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a12dfbab-aed4-4a46-b861-78946ee9a790" alt="image" /></p>
<p>I checked, and I'm still able to double-click on the <code>exception_control_flow.md:157</code> if I run the test in VSCode, and it takes me straight to the line, even if it's indented.</p>
<hr />
<p>Separately, I'm wondering if we need the relative line number to be reported at all, or if we could just make do with the relative line number? It feels like it just adds noise. Maybe we could just do this (diff relative to your PR branch):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also agree with removing the old embedded-relative line number entirely, in favor of just the new absolute line number.</p>
<p>I would favor removing the grouping by embedded-file altogether in the output, and just having flat output of one failure per line, per test. It's weird to me to have it grouped by embedded file but then the line numbers be relative to the markdown file. If you find the given line in the markdown file, it'll be obvious what embedded file you are in. And so many of the embedded file names are just <code>/src/test.py</code> anyway, it feels like mostly noise.</p>

It has the advantage that the test framework doesn't need to compute the <code>LineIndex</code> if there are no errors. Computing the <code>LineIndex</code> isn't expensive, but it can add up.

<p>@MichaReiser I think this feedback was mostly addressed. The errors are no longer grouped according to the <em>embedded Python file inside a single Markdown test</em>. Here's what it currently looks like on this PR branch if some tests fail:</p>
<details>
<summary>Screenshot</summary>

<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca27b86f-3db7-4357-86e0-2e1eb660c7a7" alt="image" /></p>
</details>

<p>And here's what the same failures looked like on this PR branch prior to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13804/commits/5d20b5c3cca2e56a866301204884e3c71aae81f8</p>

</details>

<p>So the <code>/src/test.py</code>, <code>/src/branches_unify_to_non_union_type.py</code>, <code>/src/union_type_inferred.py</code> and <code>/src/test.py</code> headings are now gone. (These all told you the name of the <em>embedded Python file</em> inside a specific Markdown test.) However, there's still an unnecessary line break in between these two lines in the test output:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/exception/control_flow.md:53 unexpected error: [revealed-type] &quot;Revealed type is `Literal[2]`&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>/exception/control_flow.md:74 unmatched assertion: revealed: bytes</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The errors before the line break occur in one embedded Python code block, and the errors after the line break occur in a different Python code block. I think this line break is unnecessary; @pilleye could you possibly get rid of it?</p>

<p>The failures are still grouped according to the name of the Markdown test inside the Markdown file, but I find that very helpful: it means you can have some idea of what kinds of tests are failing without even having to jump and look at the specific assertions that are failing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This may be a holdover from a previous version of the PR, but I don't think this <code>with_capacity</code> really makes sense anymore. This vector isn't going to have a number of entries based on the number of embedded files, it'll have a number of entries based on the number of lines with failures on them. In the ideal scenario (where arguably we care the most about speed) it'll be an empty vec. So I think it would be better to optimistically not allocate:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>naming nit: I don't think <code>contextual_path</code> is very clear, I'd name the struct <code>PathWithOffset</code> (as mentioned above) and name this <code>path_with_offset</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we could avoid eagerly copying the entire <code>lines</code> vec by instead just adding a <code>starting_line_number</code> or <code>line_offset</code> field to <code>FailuresByLine</code>, and adding the offset to each line number in <code>FailuresByLine::iter</code> instead.</p>

<p>Some comments on the code; maybe wait to implement them until @MichaReiser has a look, in case he has a different idea on any of this, since he's done some recent work on mdtest perf.</p>
