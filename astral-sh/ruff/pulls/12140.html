<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>This is the implementation for the new rule of <code>pycodestyle (E204)</code>. It follows the guidlines described in the contributing site, and as such it has a new file named <code>whitespace_after_decorator.rs</code>, a new test file called <code>E204.py</code>, and as such invokes the <code>function</code> in the <code>AST statement checker</code> for functions and functions in classes. Linking #2402 because it has all the pycodestyle rules.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>The file E204.py, has a <code>decorator</code> defined called wrapper, and this decorator is used for 2 cases. The first one is when a <code>function</code> which has a <code>decorator</code> is called in the file, and the second one is when there is a <code>class</code> and 2 <code>methods</code> are defined for the <code>class</code> with a <code>decorator</code> attached it.</p>
<p>Test file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo(fun):
    def wrapper():
        print('before')
        fun()
        print('after')
    return wrapper

# No error
@foo
def bar():
    print('bar')

# E204
@ foo
def baz():
    print('baz')

class Test:
    # No error
    @foo
    def bar(self):
        print('bar')

    # E204
    @ foo
    def baz(self):
        print('baz')
</code></pre>
<p>I am still new to rust and any suggestion is appreciated. Specially with the way im using native ruff utilities.</p>
