What does autoformat mean?

_Review comment by @zanieb on `CHANGELOG.md`:14 on 2023-11-03 19:36_

Are we consistently putting formatter preview style here?

I'm not sure this was a bug fix

Personal preference
```suggestion
- Improve performance of parsing comments ([#8193](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8193))
- Improve performance of parsing strings ([#8227](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8227))
```

A "CLI" section (which is one of our standard ones), perhaps with a clearer change entry e.g. "Add `--output-format` to `ruff rule` and `ruff linter`"

Well I think it's okay for now, we'll probably want to be more sophisticated someday
