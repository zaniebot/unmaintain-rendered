            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We used <code>builtins.copyright</code> for various tests that tested absolute core functionality such as the ability to resolve a symbol from <code>builtins.pyi</code> in typeshed. This is because it was, at the time, the simplest function definition we could find in typeshed. But it has recently become more complicated. (I&#x27;m partly to blame here... I merged the typeshed PR that made it more complicated 🙈)</p>
<p>I switched our tests to use <code>builtins.chr</code> instead of <code>builtins.copyright</code>. For these tests that are checking the absolute fundamentals, it feels best to use a function that&#x27;s as simple as possible, and <code>builtins.copyright</code> no longer fits that bill.</p>
