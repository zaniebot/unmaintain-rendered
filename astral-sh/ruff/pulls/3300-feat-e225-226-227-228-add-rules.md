I thought rules made obsolete by code formatting tools like ``black`` would be omitted from ``ruff``? I personally don't mind, just wanted to know if there was a change of heart for that? It is mentioned in the readme at https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/tree/v0.0.254#rules

@fschulze - That was more a decision based on pragmatism / prioritization rather than philosophy. I do want Ruff to be usable as a `pycodestyle` replacement for those projects that can't or don't use Black, so we're continuing to finish off that implementation.

(Note also that these rules aren't enabled on `main` yet, they're behind a feature flag.)
