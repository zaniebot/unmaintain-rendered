            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a variant of #20076 that moves some complexity out of <code>apply_type_mapping_impl</code> in <code>generics.rs</code>. The tradeoff is that now every place that applies <code>TypeMapping::Specialization</code> must take care to call <code>.materialize()</code> afterwards. (A previous version of this didn't work because I had missed a spot where I had to call <code>.materialize()</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems like a win to me. The materialization kind is part of the specialization; it seems reasonable that <code>apply_specialization</code> methods would be responsible for handling it.</p>
<p>I think if we wanted to invest in better error-resilience here (if we find ourselves forgetting to apply the materialization in more cases), the approach would be to extract a Rust type that holds only the types part of a <code>Specialization</code>, and have <code>TypeMappling::Specialization</code> hold only that Rust type, so you'd have to extract that and the materialization from a <code>Specialization</code> in order to wrap it in a <code>TypeMapping</code>. This would make it impossible to ignore the materialization part accidentally.</p>
