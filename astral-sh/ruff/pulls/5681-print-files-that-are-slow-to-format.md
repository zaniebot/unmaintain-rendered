# Print files that are slow to format

## Summary

This PR extends `cargo dev format` to print files that take "long" to format in release builds. I picked a rather random number of 50ms as long, we can fine tune this later. 

Why release mode only? It otherwise gets pretty noisy and debug performance isn't very meaningful. 

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan

Run it in release, it reported one file that takes 53ms
<!-- How was it tested? -->

There are a few files but it depends from run to run (some runs show no files)

maybe it's actually the scheduler and we have to run with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` to check

Yeah, the scheduler can create additional pressure depending on the task sequencing. But all the reported files are large (up to 9k of lines). So I think this gives us a good idea.
