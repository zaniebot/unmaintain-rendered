            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd lean towards <em>only</em> adding this hint if the list has 1 item in the slice. If it's <code>[int]</code>, it's very likely that the user wanted <code>list[int]</code>, but if it's something like <code>[int, str]</code>, it feels to me just as likely that the user wanted <code>tuple[int, str]</code>.</p>
<p>It would also be great if we could say &quot;Did you mean <code>list[int]</code>?&quot; in the suggestion if it was <code>[int]</code>, rather than just &quot;Did you mean to use <code>list[...]</code>?&quot;!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Enabling snapshots for this subsection creates a snapshot that's sort-of overwhelmingly huge 😆 I'm inclined to add a new subsection to the <code>## Diagnostics for common errors</code> section below, enable snapshots for that new subsection, and add duplicate tests to that section for the nodes where we offer tailored hints. It doesn't matter too much if some nodes are tested twice, once without snapshots and once with snapshots!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you, this is excellent! I pushed a refactor so that we don't calculate the hinted type so eagerly unless we know we're going to emit a diagnostic. That's quite important, as there's lots of situations where we need to infer types without emitting diagnostics (for example, if we're analzying third-party code in <code>site-packages</code> because we followed an import there from first-party code)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a bit more primer output than I was expecting, but most of it is one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ty not understanding that <code>typing.TypeVar</code> in mypy's vendored version of typeshed is the same class as <code>typing.TypeVar</code> in ty's vendored version of typeshed. This isn't really a bug, just a weirdness that comes from type-checking all Python files in mypy's codebase with ty.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Strange things happening in unreachable code branches, which mean that we don't understand that <code>Callable</code> is <code>Callable</code> or <code>Literal</code> is <code>Literal</code> in those branches. That's important because we only recognize int literals as being valid inside type expressions when they're nested inside <code>Literal</code> slices, and we only recognize list literals as being valid in type expressions if they appear as the first argument to <code>Callable</code>.</p>
<p>We're planning on implementing a global solution soon so that we don't emit any false positives in unreachable code branches, so I'm not going to worry too much about this issue either right now.</p>
