            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p><code>ty</code> does not understand that calls to functions which have been annotated as having a return type of <code>Never</code> / <code>NoReturn</code> are terminal.</p>
<p>This PR fixes that, by adding new reachability constraints when call expressions are seen. If the call expression evaluates to <code>Never</code>, the code following it will be considered to be unreachable. Note that, for adding these constraints, we only consider call expressions at the statement level, and that too only inside function scopes. This is because otherwise, the number of such constraints becomes too high, and evaluating them later on during type inference results in a major performance degradation.</p>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/180</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>New mdtests.</p>
<h2>Ecosystem changes</h2>
<p>This PR removes the following false-positives:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Function can implicitly return <code>None</code>, which is not assignable to ...&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Name <code>foo</code> used when possibly not defind&quot; - because the branch in which it is not defined has a <code>NoReturn</code> call, or when <code>foo</code> was imported in a <code>try</code>, and the except had a <code>NoReturn</code> call.</li>

<p>Hmm, I'm not so sure -- I feel like assertions from inside Salsa (a third-party library we use) should probably never trigger, no matter what we do in ty 😄 there could very well be a bug in this PR <em>as well</em>, but I think there's probably a bug in Salsa here too</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the explanation.
This is also timing out when analyzing https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_linter/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_use_pathlib/PTH210.py via <code>run_corpus_tests</code>, but I cannot reproduce the long run-time if I copy the contents from that file and run it as an <code>mdtest</code>. Interesting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The corpus tests run in a pretty different way to our mdtests. Our mdtests try to emulate how ty would run if you executed it from the command line. But the corpus tests attempt to probe the type of each sub-expression in a file's AST, which is somewhat different to what ty does when it's run from the command line. (Many subexpressions can actually end up being irrelevant when ty is being run from the command line, so it skips analyzing them altogether.)</p>

<p>Closing+reopening should be sufficient. GitHub CI on PRs doesn't run directly on the PR branch -- it runs on the result of a merge commit of the PR branch with the target branch.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why did you decide to save a reference to <code>func</code> here instead of saving a reference to the whole call expression? I think that would allow you to use the inferred type for the whole call expression (which could then be compared to <code>Never</code>). This would save you from going through all overloads and checking the annotations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this was my suggestion. The idea here was that inferring a type for an entire call expression may be orders of magnitude more expensive, because it requires inferring types for every argument, checking assignability of all arguments, possibly running the full overload resolution algorithm (which can involve union expansion and exponentially growing numbers of argument-list evaluations), etc.</p>
<p>The most common case by far (and thus the one we most need to optimize) is the case where we call a function that cannot return <code>Never</code>. The second most common case is that we call a function which does not have overloads and always returns <code>Never</code>. In both of those cases we can short-circuit all the argument-related work by just inferring a type for <code>func</code> and checking its return type directly.</p>
<p>This optimization does add the complication that we have more work to do when <code>func</code> has overloads -- we need to walk all the overloads and see if any of them can return <code>Never</code>, and if so, then we actually need to resolve the full call and see if it does return <code>Never</code> at this particular call site.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this PR was sort of waiting for https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/210, to see if it significantly reduces the number of these new constraints that we need to evaluate in practice.</p>
<p>But given that the latest codspeed results here are showing &lt;5% cold-check regression, we might be able to consider merging this without even waiting for that.</p>

<p>That makes sense, but one thing I did not understand is, we do infer types of all expressions once when inferring the file as a whole right? If we turn all call expressions into <code>standalone_expression</code>s, can we not re-use the inference result from the first time? (I see that <code>infer_standalone_expression</code> makes use of salsa caching via <code>infer_expression_types</code>.)</p>
<p>Is the concern that that would lead to the many new salsa structs consuming a lot of memory?</p>

<p>But we don't do this for all files -- the file may be a third-party dependency, or a first-party file for which type checking was not requested on the CLI, in which case we do minimal inference of just the definitions we need.</p>
<p>You are right that if we are inferring types of all expressions anyway in the file, then the inference will be reused anyway.</p>

<p>@AlexWaygood I saw your comment at https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/423#issuecomment-2971714486, and I think this might also be related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/256?</p>
<hr />
<p>A minimal reproduction, which fails on this branch, but not on the latest alpha is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import packaging.requirements


def _(req: packaging.requirements.Requirement):
    req.name

</code></pre>
<p>My understanding is that this block will try to infer the type of <code>requirements.py/Requirement.name</code>, and as part of that, end up inferring the <code>_parser.py</code> file which Alex mentioned in the above comment. This inference would be triggered because of the additional constraints on this branch.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This does not work because of https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/685 which I filed recently. I think that would need more discussion and better fixed in a follow up PR. I will <em>unmark</em> this PR from fixing https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/180, lest that main issue get closed automatically.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should at the very least support <code>Type::Callable</code> also. Ideally we'd support callable instances, bound methods, etc as well. I think the way to do this would be adding a <code>Type::into_callable_type -&gt; Option&lt;Type&gt;</code> that always returns <code>Some(Type::Callable(...))</code> or <code>None</code> -- most of the pieces needed for that are already in place. For clarity it could be added in a separate PR (either before or after this one).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No we shouldn't add a panic here, we should silently return something and let type checking emit a diagnostic for a bad call.</p>
<p>It's an interesting question what we should return. In principle it makes sense to return <code>AlwaysTrue</code> (calling a non-callable will raise an error and thus terminate control flow). But we don't do that for other diagnostics that are high-confidence will-raise-an-error, so it seems inconsistent to do it here. Thus I think we should probably return <code>AlwaysFalse</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is impressively little code! Thanks for working on this, and for your patience.</p>
<p>I think really the only blocker to landing this as a solid initial step is the performance impact; it's pretty bad right now on real-sized projects :/</p>
<p>I think it is worth waiting (a bit longer) to see the impact of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18955 here, as that should remove another frequent case where we would see a lot of these extra reachability constraints unnecessarily evaluated.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we might need to do some profiling to understand where this is causing us to spend a lot of time, and how we might be able to mitigate it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Edit: this issue was likely fixed by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18955, and this hack is no longer required. This also means the below reasoning is incorrect.</p>
<details>
<summary>Incorrect reasoning</summary>

<p>Without this change to the test here, the test gives a &quot;possibly unbound&quot; error on this PR.</p>
<p>Ignoring the new <code>ReturnsNever</code> constraints for a while, consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f1(flag: bool, cond: bool):
  class C1:
    if flag:

      if cond:  # extra block
        raise

      attr = DataDescriptor()


    def f(self):
      self.attr = &quot;normal&quot;

  reveal_type(C1().attr)
</code></pre>
<p>This also triggers a &quot;possibly unbound&quot; error on <code>main</code> today (which I believe is not what we want).</p>
<p>The above example (without the <code>ReturnsNever</code> constraints) can be thought of as similar to the example in this test suite, but with the new <code>ReturnsNever</code> constrains, which I'll copy below from <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f1(flag: bool):
  class C1:
    if flag:
      attr = DataDescriptor()   # original version, without my hack


    def f(self):
      self.attr = &quot;normal&quot;

  reveal_type(C1().attr)
</code></pre>
<p>The similarity is that, in both cases, there is a terminal statement with a condition. On this branch, the terminal statement is a call returning <code>Never</code>, with the condition (which is not yet evaluated when building the semantic index) that the thing being called should be annotated as returning <code>NoReturn</code>, while on <code>main</code> right now, with the example with <code>cond</code> I shared above, the terminal statemtent is <code>raise</code> and the condition (again, unevaluated when building the semantic index) is <code>cond</code>.</p>
<p>This is hand-wavy, and I don't have a very solid understanding on why this manifests as the &quot;possibly unbound&quot; error, since I haven't dug into the implementation of the descriptor fall-back described in this test suite. But the above parallel strongly suggests that this issue is related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/685.</p>
<p>The hack I did side-steps this because it makes it so that the constraint of &quot;does not return <code>Never</code>&quot; is applied <em>outside</em> the <code>if</code>, and independent of the snapshot-merge issue.</p>

<p>I was looking at the <code>mypy_primer</code> diff, and there are some new diagnostics for &quot;Attribute <code>foo</code> of type <code>bar</code> is possibly unbound&quot;. The MRE for them is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">  def _(flag: bool):
      class C:
          def __init__(self, x: int):
              self.x = x

      c = C(1)
      c.x  # possibly unbound

<p>This smells similar to the above issue, and I now feel it would be worth digging deeper to figure out what's going on here. I shall do that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was thinking about a few approaches to improve the performance here. The main problem seems to be the sheer amount of reachability constraints that we record. In principle, <em>every</em> call expression could have a return type of <code>Never</code> and should therefore be analyzed. And we could go even further and also analyze every attribute access. <em>In principle</em>, the attribute could be a descriptor and it's <code>__get__</code> method could return <code>Never</code>. That seems ridiculous, but maybe illustrates the point that we may need to cut scope here?</p>
<p>One radical way to cut scope would be to only analyze call expressions that are at the statement level. This would mean that we could still handle a standalone <code>sys.exit(1)</code> call, but not something like <code>… if … else sys.exit(1)</code>, <code>_ = sys.exit(1)</code> or <code>return sys.exit(1)</code>. I tried that approach at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19085 and it's <em>much</em> faster. The only significant performance drop is for <code>hydra-zen</code> with -8%. Everything else is below 5%.</p>
<p>This is not very elegant, but maybe a reasonable first step? We could always expand the scope by recording the constraints in more situations (ternary expressions might be a reasonable addition, but I didn't find any examples where <code>sys.exit</code> specifically was used in a ternary).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @sharkdp for the further exploration. I think it makes sense to start with the statement-level-only version, and consider expanding it carefully if/as we see issues crop up with more deeply nested calls returning <code>Never</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do still think it's <em>also</em> worth exploring the idea that when resolving imports, we ignore some kinds of reachability constraints (call-Never constraints for sure, maybe also assertion constraints?) that are particularly likely to accumulate at end-of-scope for almost any symbol. I think that should dramatically reduce the number of these constraints we have to evaluate, and in particular, the number of them we have to evaluate in third-party code, that may trigger further type inference we could otherwise avoid entirely.</p>
<p>An alternative version of cutting scope here that would be even simpler to experiment with, but would I think have similar effects, would be to never add these call-Never constraints at all in non-function scopes. (Today, non-function scopes are the only ones where we use end-of-scope symbol resolution). I think this way of cutting scope might more closely match what other type checkers do and don't support? At least pyright doesn't ever seem to respect Never-returning calls as a constraint when inferring types of class attributes or imported names. (But within a function, it does respect Never-returning calls that aren't top-level statements.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. I changed this to return <code>AlwaysFalse</code>. It seems earlier I had the impression that this branch should be unreachable, hence the question about adding a panic. But I now get that that impression is clearly wrong, since semantic indexing will happily add a constraint here for <code>random_thing_which_is_not_a_function()</code>, by looking at just the AST :)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This now restricts these new constraints to be added only at statement-level calls (thanks @sharkdp!), and only in function scopes.</p>

<li><p>When required, evaluating the constraints will fall-back to inferring the full call expression. As part of this, the constraint now stores references to both the callable, and the call expression.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because we now add these new constraints only inside function scopes, <code>nox</code> and <code>streamlit</code> no longer panic, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18333#issuecomment-2998963974">like they used to when we had module-level constraints</a>.</p>
