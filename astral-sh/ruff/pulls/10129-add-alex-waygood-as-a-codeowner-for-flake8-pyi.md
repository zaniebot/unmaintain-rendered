# Add Alex Waygood as a CODEOWNER for flake8-pyi

---

_@AlexWaygood_

## Summary

Adds me as a codeowner for the flake8-pyi rules. I help maintain the original flake8 plugin these rules are derived from, and wrote the original versions of a bunch of these rules, so I think it makes sense for me to be pinged on PRs touching these files
