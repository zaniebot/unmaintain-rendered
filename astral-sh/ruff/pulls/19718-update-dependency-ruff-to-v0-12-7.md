### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>astral-sh/ruff (ruff)</summary>

### [`v0.12.7`](https://redirect.github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0127)

This is a follow-up release to 0.12.6. Because of an issue in the package metadata, 0.12.6 failed to publish fully to PyPI and has been yanked. Similarly, there is no GitHub release or Git tag for 0.12.6. The contents of the 0.12.7 release are identical to 0.12.6, except for the updated metadata.
