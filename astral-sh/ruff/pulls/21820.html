            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I find the fix here pretty awkward (given that <code>kw_only</code> is optional and we're now setting it to always-<code>Some</code>) so I suspect it doesn't quite fit the intended design.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you're right that this fix is awkward; took a look at why and I think it's mostly existing awkwardness / lack of support. I pushed a few TODO comments and one code change, since it was easier than describing in a review.</p>
<p>I think we never properly added support for <code>default_*</code> params on base-class and metaclass-based transformers, but some contributors added partial support when synthesizing <code>__init__</code>. Instead of that partial support, we should either have generalized methods for querying dataclass params (from anywhere) which always fall back to the dataclass-transformer-params, or we should ensure that <code>dataclass_params</code> on the class itself are always already initialized with values from the transformer param defaults. (It looks like this currently happens for function dataclass transforms but not for metaclass or base-class ones.) It also looks like we store <code>dataclass_transformer_params</code> on the class, but this also isn't currently set for metaclass or base-class transformers. So this special-cased support for base-class and metaclass transformers that was added to <code>__init__</code> synthesis ought to be generalized, and if that happened this PR wouldn't need to explicitly check the transformer params.</p>
<p>Otherwise this fix looks fine to me. The <code>ref mut</code> stuff is a little awkward but that's just a local artifact of how <code>own_fields</code> is currently structured. I'd be fine landing this with the TODO comments I added.</p>
<p>Maybe ideally we'd also make <code>kw_only</code> on a field not optional in this PR, since now we are always setting it to <code>Some</code>. The only reason it was previously optional was so that <code>__init__</code> synthesis could revisit the question, but that shouldn't really be needed (and isn't after this PR.) I removed one bit of code in the <code>__init__</code> synthesis which becomes unnecessary with this fix in <code>own_fields</code>.</p>
