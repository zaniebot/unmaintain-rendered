            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Some (most?) diagnostic messages already use the form &quot;Operator  not supported&quot;, but others use &quot;Operator  unsupported&quot;:</p>
<p>https://play.ty.dev/ae13cd3d-531b-4ed3-adea-eba9b0cafb6c</p>
<pre><code>0 + &quot;&quot;
0 &lt; &quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Operator <code>+</code> is unsupported between objects of type <code>Literal[0]</code> and <code>Literal[&quot;&quot;]</code> (unsupported-operator) [Ln 1, Col 1]
Operator <code>&lt;</code> is not supported between objects of type <code>Literal[0]</code> and <code>Literal[&quot;&quot;]</code> (unsupported-operator) [Ln 2, Col 1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This commit uniforms the diagnostic messages, favoring &quot;not supported&quot;. While it is two characters longer, this:</p>
<ul>
<li>matches pyright/pyrefly&#x27;s messages,</li>
<li>is slightly less redundant given that &quot;unsupported&quot; already appears in the diagnostic&#x27;s type (e.g., unsupported-operator),</li>
<li>makes the &quot;not&quot; stand out.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This commit does not remove all occurrences of &quot;unsupported&quot; in diagnostic messages: there are still some that e.g. start with &quot;Unsupported X&quot;. I think those are acceptable as they are.)</p>
Test Plan
<p>Updated existing tests, and checked the new diagnostics messages with those produced by pyright/pyrefly.</p>
