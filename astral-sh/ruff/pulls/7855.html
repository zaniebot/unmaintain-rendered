<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<p>Fixes #7853.</p>
<p>The old and new source files were reversed in the call to <code>TextDiff::from_lines</code>, so the diff output of the CLI was also reversed.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Two snapshots were updated in the process, so any reversal should be caught :)</p>
