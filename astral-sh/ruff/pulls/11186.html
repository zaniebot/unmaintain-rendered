            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bump dependency pins in <code>scripts/fuzz-parser/requirements.txt</code>. The latest versions of <code>pysource-codegen</code> and <code>pysource-minimize</code> have some typing improvements that mean that pyright and mypy now both give the <code>scripts/fuzz-parser</code> directory a clean bill of health.</li>
<li>If <code>cargo build --release</code> fails, print the captured stderr to the terminal so it's easy to diagnose what's gone wrong.</li>
<li>Add instructions to the module docstring (also displayed if you run <code>py scripts/fuzz-parser/fuzz.py --help</code> in a terminal window) for how to run the script with randomly selected seeds.</li>
<li>Alter <code>FuzzResult.print_description()</code> so that it prints how far through the overall fuzzing the script is. This is especially useful if you've fed randomly selected seeds to the script, as it's hard to know what the distribution of the seeds will be if they've been randomly selected.</li>
<li>Colourise <code>--help</code> output with <code>rich-argparse</code> (why not)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I ran the following commands to test the script:</p>
<pre><code>$ py scripts/fuzz-parser/fuzz.py --help
$ py scripts/fuzz-parser/fuzz.py 0-100
$ py scripts/fuzz-parser/fuzz.py $(shuf -i 0-1000000 -n 10000)
</code></pre>
<p>I also applied this diff to the parser and then ran the script again to check the output if the script found parser bugs:</p>
