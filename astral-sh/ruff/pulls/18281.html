            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR improves completions by leveraging scopes. That is, we try to
identify an expression corresponding to the cursor's current position.
We then use that expression to find it scope. Our completions are then
the names in that scope's (and its ancestors') symbol tables.</p>
<p>The most straight-forward way this improves on the status quo can be
seen from a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    def foofoo(): ...
&lt;CURSOR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Today, this would include <code>foofoo</code> in the completions. But with this
PR, <code>foofoo</code> is not included.</p>
<p>I had originally started off with a bit more shenanigans in terms of
identifying the expression under the cursor. But in the end, at least
for scopes, a very simple solution seems to work well.</p>
<p>The major caveat here is that this <em>doesn't</em> work well when requesting
completions before having typed anything. While this doesn't fail in
every case, it is somewhat common. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    def foofoo(): ...
    &lt;CURSOR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this instance, the AST nodes for <code>foo</code> and <code>foofoo</code> actually end
at exactly the same byte offset, so there is nothing for us to easily
latch on to that comes after <code>foofoo</code> but before the end of <code>foo</code>.
In particular, we really want to enumerate the symbols for the scope
contained in the function body of <code>foo</code>. But it's unclear how to
(easily) actually get the scope given the cursor's position. One
approach might be to tweak the ranges of the AST nodes to make finding
overlapping AST nodes easier. Either way, in this case currently, we
fall back to the global scope. So we don't end up with a complete
failure, but I'm guessing this will prove to be frustrating for users.</p>
<p>(I do not think we need to fix this in this PR.)</p>
<p>Note that this doesn't apply when something has been typed. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    def foofoo(): ...
    f&lt;CURSOR&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we see that <code>f</code> is part of the body of <code>foo</code> and
correctly provide completions for both <code>foo</code> and <code>foofoo</code>.</p>
<p>There are some other cases where a <code>&lt;CURSOR&gt;</code> being in leading/trailing
whitespace results in sub-optimal failures. The commented out test
cases in the second commit cover a smattering of them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Instead of assuming any relationship between node and scope. I think I'd prefer if the IDE integration traverses downwards to find a node who's indentation matches the indentation at the current position, then lookup the scope for that node. This may require passing the scope to <code>model.completions</code> because our AST, unfortunately, doesn't support traversing upwards once you have an <code>AnyNodeRef</code></p>

<p>The <code>extend_with_declarations_and_bindings</code> function in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18251 does something similar to this, but excludes definitely-unbound symbols.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the desired functionality here is (or if there is a performance tradeoff). Maybe it's fine to error on the side of providing too many completions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is due to error recovery. The source code contains a syntax error because the identifier is absent (<code>[ for bar in [1, 2, 3]</code>) and the parser recovers by converting <code>for</code> into an identifier. The fix is to improve error recovery where the parser is converting keywords into an identifier. There are benefits for doing this but maybe not doing this conversion might be more beneficial.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's why I was wondering if we should lean towards providing too many completions.</p>
<p>But note that other LSPs also have degraded experience in unreachable code sections:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e73013-59f3-49c3-8f78-f7411953c290" alt="image" /></p>
<p>That's not a <em>great</em> reason for not trying to do better here. But I also don't think it's high priority to provide the best-possible LSP experience inside unreachable sections of code. For other languages, I often deliberately change the config when I'm editing otherwise unreachable code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think another important issue revealed by this example is that we aren't modeling the quirks of Python name resolution, e.g. that names in a class scope are not visible within nested function scopes (so only the global <code>foo</code> should even be visible here.) Doesn't necessarily need to be in this PR, but I think this will be important to fix; having all methods of a class wrongly show up as autocomplete suggestions within other methods of the class will be pretty annoying.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For now, I've &quot;fixed&quot; this by just sorting and de-duplicating the completions returned by the server. I had assumed the client would de-duplicate since it was already doing prefix matching, but that does not appear to be the case. I've also added tests covering these cases (along with an appropriate FIXME for the false positives that @carljm points out).</p>
<p>I agree that what we're doing right now is <em>very</em> dumb. I'm working my way up to fancier things. :-) I agree that the false positives here should be fixed <em>and</em> that completions should be more than just name strings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I agree we can do better here, but I think I generally prefer offering too many completions in a case like this until we can implement what @AlexWaygood suggests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I've addressed what feedback I think is plausible to do in this PR. I've recorded the notes about where completions can be improved (which I'll try to summarize in GitHub issues when I get a chance) for future work. I don't have a good sense of how hard some of these things are yet. e.g., Detecting whether the cursor is in an unreachable scope and ensuring that instance methods aren't treated as if they were normal functions.</p>
