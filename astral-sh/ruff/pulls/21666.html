            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One major concern with this approach is that memory usage is likely to grow significantly (~projects*files) because we parse and analyze the same file multiple time, especially because we start computing auto imports per database</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we'll want to revive this for PEP-723 script support, but only register the members if the file is actually open. This way you'll only get really brutal memory usage if you have a bunch of scripts open <em>and</em> they have non-trivial dependencies (e.g. if you have a ton of scripts that import members of a monorepo, transitively importing the entire monorepo).</p>
<p>Notably I think we should skip scripts on workspace diagnostics by default. (...which now that I've said that, that will be annoying if your scripts import monorepo members and you're refactoring your APIs... actually christ how would <code>rename</code> even work there oh god).</p>

<p>Yeah, this is a good point. I'm getting more and more convinced that we need a single ty instance for all projects.</p>
