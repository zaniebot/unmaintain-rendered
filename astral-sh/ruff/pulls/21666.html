            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One major concern with this approach is that memory usage is likely to grow significantly (~projects*files) because we parse and analyze the same file multiple time, especially because we start computing auto imports per database</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we&#x27;ll want to revive this for PEP-723 script support, but only register the members if the file is actually open. This way you&#x27;ll only get really brutal memory usage if you have a bunch of scripts open <em>and</em> they have non-trivial dependencies (e.g. if you have a ton of scripts that import members of a monorepo, transitively importing the entire monorepo).</p>
<p>Notably I think we should skip scripts on workspace diagnostics by default. (...which now that I&#x27;ve said that, that will be annoying if your scripts import monorepo members and you&#x27;re refactoring your APIs... actually christ how would <code>rename</code> even work there oh god).</p>

<p>Yeah, this is a good point. I&#x27;m getting more and more convinced that we need a single ty instance for all projects.</p>
