            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fixes #21973. When the fix is applied and a <code>\n</code> is present, the transformation introduces a newline and results in a syntax error.</p>
<p>The fix replaces <code>\n</code> with <code>\\n</code> to preserve correct string rendering.</p>
<p>This change also adds support for <code>Expr::Call</code> and <code>Expr::Attribute</code> in the fix by replacing the full text range.</p>
<p>The snapshot updates reflect the expanded fix applicability ([*]) and the corrected string rendering. Additionally, a test case with <code>\n</code> was added to ensure that no unintended newline is introduced.</p>

<p>It looks like https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/21973 hadn't been triaged yet and is actually a duplicate of an older issue (#20151), which already has two open PRs trying to fix it (#20224 and #21310). I'll close this for now to avoid more duplicate work.</p>
