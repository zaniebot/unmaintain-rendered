<p>This is not a perfect solution, since we still end up with some false negatives, but it&#x27;s still a lot better than having false positives.</p>
Summary
<p>Submodule imports create a binding on the base module, if we have more than one submodule import for the same base module we may incorrectly attribute a runtime reference to a typing only import, if we don&#x27;t make sure that the reference starts with the same name segments as the import.</p>

            <div class="timeline-header">Review comment by <a href="https://github.com/Daverball">@Daverball</a> on <code>crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_type_checking/mod.rs</code>:539 on 2025-02-24 08:52</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually it&#x27;s still quite a bit more complex than that, since we can have partial overlaps and complete overlaps of bindings, so whether or not we can look at the references of a shadowing import depends on how it overlaps with our import and whether or not those overlapping imports are in a runtime context or not.</p>
<p>We also don&#x27;t properly take into account the fact that the parent module will be fully imported by a submodule import. So for the parent module we would need to check if there are any bindings in runtime context at all in order to avoid false negatives, e.g. for a runtime use of <code>os.sep</code> with a typing only import of <code>os.path</code>. <code>os.path</code> should be flagged if there isn&#x27;t also a runtime <code>os</code> import.</p>
<p>So for something like</p>
<pre><code>import a
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    import a.b
    import a.b.d

x = a.b  # leads to TC004 for `import a.b`

import a.b.c

y = a.b  # fine
z = a.b.d  # leads to TC004 for `import a.b.d`
</code></pre>
<p>For reference <code>x</code> we would need to detect that the shadowed binding <code>a</code> for <code>import a</code> doesn&#x27;t include <code>a.b</code>, but for reference <code>y</code> we would need to detect that <code>import a.b.c</code> fully covers the shadowed <code>import a.b</code>, so we don&#x27;t have to worry about it. But for <code>z</code> <code>import a.b.c</code> doesn&#x27;t fully cover <code>import a.b.d</code>, so we do need to look at the references to <code>import a.b.d</code> for checking whether or not <code>import a.b.d</code> has any runtime references. So the combinatorics quickly get out of hand here.</p>
<p>The approach chosen in this PR still seems like a reasonable compromise however, since it will catch some things with submodule imports, while incorrectly flagging fewer imports that shouldn&#x27;t be flagged. I.e. we raise the false negative rate slightly, but we get rid of the false positives we&#x27;re most likely to encounter in the wild.</p>
<p>Anything more accurate would probably need multi-file analysis and some degree of type inference, so we actually know which attributes are currently available at runtime in the current scope and through which binding.</p>
<p>Another approach we could take is to just never emit <code>TC004</code> if we&#x27;re shadowing another binding. This would completely get rid of any false positives. But I feel the approach this PR has taken is more balanced.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Currently, I would probably defer this PR in favor of getting #13965 to a state, where it can be merged, since that seems like a more complete solution for the problem to me, that benefits the whole semantic model and not just a single rule.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll try to find some time to take a closer look at the approach taken in the other PR to see if I can come up with some changes, beyond the ones that have already been proposed, that reduce the overhead. I had a similar idea for solving this problem more generally, but assumed it would add too much overhead, for too little benefit, so I didn&#x27;t pursue it further at the time. But given that I now know that there are other rules that would benefit from this, it might be worth pursuing after all.</p>
<p>If we don&#x27;t think we can push #13965 forward any time soon, and reviewing this PR can be done quickly, with a low amount of effort, then it still might be a reasonable stop gap measure, otherwise I&#x27;d probably put this into draft until we know for sure whether or not #13965 will happen. Especially since we will probably need to or at least want to revert this change, once it does.</p>
