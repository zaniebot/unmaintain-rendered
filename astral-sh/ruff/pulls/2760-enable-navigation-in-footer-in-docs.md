# enable navigation in footer in docs

_Pull request opened by @sbrugman on 2023-02-11 09:48_

When reaching the end of a page, the natural next step is to move further. Currently, the user has to scroll up. The footer navigation enables to additionally go to the next and previous page (see [docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-the-footer/#custom-copyright))
