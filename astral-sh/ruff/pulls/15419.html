<p>Yes, thank you. This is an oversight by me from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15019. There is no semantic difference, we just inserted declarations twice into the <code>BitSet</code> (where the second insertion was a no-op).</p>
<p>Your solution here might be the best way, but for comparison, I opened #15451 which changes the code back to the state before statically-known branches. It uses <code>BitSet::union</code> instead of inserting elements one by one. The solution here might still be faster, because with the statically-known branches work, we now have to iterate over live declarations (to construct merged visibility constraints). So it might make sense to compute the union &quot;as we go&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @sharkdp. I like your solution better because it simplifies the <code>merge</code> flow (and already goes in the direction of incorporating the expected size <code>with_capacity</code> for all structs). I'll close this in favor of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15451</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Isn't the bitset dynamically sized? I'd suggest to have a <code>BitSet::with_capacity</code> so that it can allocate the right inner vector. We could consider doing the same for all other fields. E.g. <code>visibility_constraint</code>'s length is at least as large as the max of <code>a</code>'s and <code>b</code>'s visibility constraints (if I understand the logic correctly)</p>

<p>It is, I was mostly just responding to the &quot;initialize all vecs here&quot;.</p>
<p>For small sizes, the <code>BitSet</code> is stack-allocated with a fixed capacity, so as long as we're below that threshold, reserving wouldn't help. But in general, adding reserve/with_capacity calls here sounds like a reasonable thing to try!</p>
