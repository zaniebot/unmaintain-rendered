            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR further extends the principles established in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15539 -- and allows us to get rid of even more special cases for <code>type[]</code> types in <code>Type::is_disjoint_from()</code>! A class definition <code>class A(B, C): ...</code> can only succeed if either the metaclass of <code>C</code> is a subclass of the metaclass of <code>B</code> or the metaclass of <code>B</code> is a subclass of the metaclass of <code>C</code>. As such, for two types <code>type[T]</code> and <code>type[S]</code>, we can conclude that the two types are disjoint if <code>T</code>'s metaclass and <code>S</code>'s metaclass are disjoint.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>New mdtests added</li>
<li>Ran <code>QUICKCHECK_TESTS=1000000 cargo test --release -p red_knot_python_semantic -- --ignored types::property_tests::stable</code></li>
</ul>
<p>@sharkdp -- we don't have <em>great</em> coverage for this kind of thing in our property tests, because I know of no standard-library classes that have <code>@final</code> metaclasses, so it's hard for me to think of how to get the property tests to use some <code>type[]</code> types that have disjoint metaclasses. Maybe that just means that this kind of thing is an edge case that we don't need to worry about too much, though 🤷</p>

<p>Right. I think we might be able to write a custom file to the in-memory FS of the <code>TestDB</code> that would contain a couple of bespoke types that we could then import into the property tests? Might be a bit more difficult due to the <code>Ty</code> layer in between, though.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about changing the input to the property tests for another reason. We could add a layer like</p>
<pre><code>pub enum PropertyTestType {
    Ty(Ty),
    CustomTypeWithFinalMetaclass,
    # …
}
</code></pre>
<p>and use that as the input to the property tests. That would have the added benefit that we could write a custom <code>Display</code> (or <code>Debug</code>?) implementation for this in order to get a better output when a property test fails. Instead of showing the <code>Ty</code> representation, we could potentially render the nicer <code>Type</code> <code>Display</code> output that would also contain initial simplifications in case of union types. So instead of showing <code>Ty::union([int,str, Literal[1]])</code>, we could show <code>int | str</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this line is OK as-is, as far as this method is used in this PR, because our semantics of non-fully-static types in <code>is_disjoint_from</code> is that we treat them as equivalent to their widest possible type (that is, <code>Any</code> and <code>object</code> are treated the same by <code>is_disjoint_from</code>, in being disjoint from nothing.) But if this method were to be used in other contexts in future, we need to be a little careful about this line, it may not be the right thing; we should maybe return <code>Dynamic</code> instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, good point. In my first version of this PR I used this method from multiple places (which was why I created at method)... but it looks like now it's only used in a single location... So maybe I should just inline it at that single location (like it was prior to this PR)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that might be better, in that it would reduce the risk of reusing this logic where this isn't the right handling of it.</p>
