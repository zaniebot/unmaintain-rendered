            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Treat <code>Callable</code>s as bound-method descriptors if <code>Callable</code> is the return type of a decorator that is applied to a function definition. See the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/david/callables-as-descriptors/crates/ty_python_semantic/resources/mdtest/call/callables_as_descriptors.md">rendered version of the new test file</a> for the full description of this new heuristic.</p>
<p>I could imagine that we want to treat <code>Callable</code>s as bound-method descriptors in other cases as well, but this seems like a step in the right direction. I am planning to add other &quot;use cases&quot; from https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/491 to this test suite.</p>
<p>partially addresses https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/491
closes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1333</p>
<h2>Ecosystem impact</h2>
<p>All positive</p>
<ul>
<li>2961 removed <code>unsupported-operator</code> diagnostics on <code>sympy</code>, which was one of the main motivations for implementing this change</li>
<li>37 removed <code>missing-argument</code> diagnostics, and no added call-error diagnostics, which is an indicator that this heuristic shouldn't cause many false positives</li>
<li>A few removed <code>possibly-missing-attribute</code> diagnostics when accessing attributes like <code>__name__</code> on decorated functions. The two added <code>unused-ignore-comment</code> diagnostics are also cases of this.</li>
<li>One new <code>invalid-assignment</code> diagnostic on <code>dd-trace-py</code>, which looks suspicious, but only because our <code>invalid-assignment</code> diagnostics are not great. This is actually a &quot;Implicit shadowing of function&quot; diagnostic that hides behind the <code>invalid-assignment</code> diagnostic, because a module-global function is being patched through a <code>module.func</code> attribute assignment.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The argument here is a bit weak. I had trouble coming up with a better example.</p>
<p>It still feels wrong to me to generally assume that returned <code>Callable</code> types are function-like if a function-like callable is passed into a call (would we try to detect that in every possible parameter position? or only apply the heuristic for single-argument calls?).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>According to our usual naming logic, this function should be called <code>into_callable</code>. But that function already exists (and does something else, namely try to <em>turn</em> a <code>Type</code> into its equivalent <code>Callable</code> type). I would propose to rename the existing <code>Type::into_callable</code> in order to restore our naming scheme here.</p>
<p>As an aside, I always try <code>ty.as_*</code> first (e.g. <code>ty.as_class_literal()</code>) before remembering that they all start with <code>.into_</code>. &quot;into&quot; sounds like a transformation, but it's really just an unwrapping.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like this PR might have caused the ty fuzzer job to take significantly longer in CI. In PRs yesterday, it took around 5 minutes to complete, but following this PR it seems to be taking around 18 minutes to complete. It looks like this change causes pathological performance issues on seeds 32 and 56, for some reason.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem to be causing issues on any of our benchmarks, and mypy_primer still seems to be finishing in good time, so the problematic pattern is probably something that doesn't actually come up much in practice? So a quick fix might be to just add 32 and 56 to this set here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/1ed9b215b981d0283022185f988957d22a02b918/python/py-fuzzer/fuzz.py#L155-L156</p>
<p>We should probably try to pin down what exactly the problematic pattern <em>is</em>, though, in the medium/long term</p>
