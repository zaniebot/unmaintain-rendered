### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>camino-rs/camino (camino)</summary>

### [`v1.2.0`](https://redirect.github.com/camino-rs/camino/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#120---2025-09-14)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/camino-rs/camino/compare/camino-1.1.12...camino-1.2.0)

##### Changed

- MSRV updated to Rust 1.61 to support the switch to `serde_core`.
- camino now depends on `serde_core` rather than `serde`. This allows camino's compilation to be parallelized with `serde_derive`.
- `serde` and `proptest` are no longer available as features. This is technically a breaking change, but these features were already no-ops. Instead, use `serde1` and `proptest1` respectively.

</details>
