##### What's Changed

##### Breaking Changes

- Enhance caching in setup-node with automatic package manager detection by [@&#8203;priya-kinthali](https://redirect.github.com/priya-kinthali) in [#&#8203;1348](https://redirect.github.com/actions/setup-node/pull/1348)

This update, introduces automatic caching when a valid `packageManager` field is present in your `package.json`. This aims to improve workflow performance and make dependency management more seamless.
To disable this automatic caching, set `package-manager-cache: false`

```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v5
- uses: actions/setup-node@v5
  with:
    package-manager-cache: false
```

- Upgrade action to use node24 by [@&#8203;salmanmkc](https://redirect.github.com/salmanmkc) in [#&#8203;1325](https://redirect.github.com/actions/setup-node/pull/1325)

Make sure your runner is on version v2.327.1 or later to ensure compatibility with this release. [See Release Notes](https://redirect.github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.327.1)
