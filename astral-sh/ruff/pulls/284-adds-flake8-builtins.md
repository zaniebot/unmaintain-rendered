# Adds flake8-builtins

---

_Pull request opened by @sobolevn on 2022-09-29 10:14_

I mark this as a WIP, because I don't have `rust` on my machine right now **because of the SECURITY reasons** 😒 

So, I've never actually executed the code I wrote.
Plus, I need to write tests.

Looking good! Do you plan to run + test + get it out of draft state? Or want a hand given the above comment RE installing Rust?

I actually had to find a way to run this to find proper `column` numbers 🙈 
It was fun writting code without ever running it!
