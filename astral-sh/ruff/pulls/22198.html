            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>While analyzing our rules, I wanted to know which of them use configuration options but noticed that some of them were not documented (or at least not documented in a separate <code>## Options</code> section).</p>
<p>I had Claude generate an initial list of candidate rules, but it contained a lot of false positives that I filtered out, and I ended up adding all of these sections myself. I'm not claiming that the options lists are exhaustive (as in the rules may use additional options beyond what I found), but this will at least help with my goal of determining whether or not a rule is configurable at all and also hopefully be helpful in general.</p>
<p>I mostly just tacked on an <code>## Options</code> section without any commentary, but I added a couple lines of explanation when I felt that the meaning of the options wasn't obvious from the context.</p>
<p>I also noticed a bit of variation in the <code>flake8-simplify</code> rules from doing this. Some of them offer a diagnostic but no fix depending on the resulting line length of the suggestion, while others offer neither. I'm not sure we need to do anything different here, but it seemed worth mentioning.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Docs tests to make sure the links are right</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I only (intentionally) added a blank line if there were additional sections after the options, usually <code>## References</code>. I'll double check and also build the docs locally to make sure everything looks okay.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On second thought, I might actually remove this one. The rule does technically use them by passing them to <code>FunctionType::classify</code>, but they should effectively be ignored since the rule only applies to functions defined outside of a class scope.</p>
