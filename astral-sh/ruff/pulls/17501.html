Thank you for contributing to Ruff! To help us out with reviewing, please consider the following:

- Does this pull request include a summary of the change? (See below.)
- Does this pull request include a descriptive title?
- Does this pull request include references to any relevant issues?
-->

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This extends the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/commented-out-code/">ERA001</a> check to allow references to Jira issues and GitLab merge requests. Currently, only GitHub-style issue references are excluded from being flagged as commented-out code.</p>
<p>Previously, lines like the following were incorrectly flagged:</p>
<p>Jira issue reference</p>
<pre><code>See: PROJ-1234
</code></pre>
<p>GitLab MR reference</p>
<pre><code>See: !15
</code></pre>
<p>These are now correctly treated as comments, not code.</p>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p>Added unit tests to verify the behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on this!</p>
<p>Does this correspond to an open issue? It's usually nice to discuss these things a bit before jumping into the implementation.</p>
<p>I can reproduce the Jira issue if there's a colon after <code>See</code>, but not otherwise: https://play.ruff.rs/cf52731c-e71a-4f6b-b736-1049d04b5133</p>
<p>so it's not really clear to me how big of an issue this is. There are several other heuristics used for determining code, not just the <code>HASH_NUMBER</code> regex, and in combination they seem to handle most of these cases.</p>
<p>If we decide we need to do something here still, another option is a user-configurable list of regular expressions. It sounds like that's what the <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/eradicate?tab=readme-ov-file#whitelisting">upstream linter</a> does, although I'm not sure if we have any other config options with user-facing regexes. cc @MichaReiser</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There wasn't any discussion, more of a &quot;scratch your own itch&quot; situation. I used Ruff + Jira and this resulted in some positives. Since the github format was in, I figured why not extend it to jira. As you noted it is the <code>:</code> that makes the difference or not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO, it makes sense to have the rule being consistent with what we have for TD003. I'm a bit surprised to see that TD003 neither supports GitLab or JIRA comments, it seems.</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/79a2c7eaa28daed1de520f35119ec0625b007188/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_todos/rules/todos.rs#L242-L248</p>
<p>But I'm okay allowlisting JIRA here, specifically <code># See: PROJ-999</code> but I'm leaning towards adding the regex to the existing <code>ALLOWLIST</code> regex group</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's already a bunch of different regex groups here but I'm not super opinionated on this. The question here is should we tie this with TD003 or keep it as is.</p>
