# [ty] Fix an mdtest title

---

_@AlexWaygood_

Two tests were reported as failing in https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2236: `subtype_of_implies_not_disjoint_from` and `all_type_pairs_are_assignable_to_their_union`. This regression test is for the `subtype_of_implies_not_disjoint_from` test, but the mdtest title currently implies that it's a regression test for the `all_type_pairs_are_assignable_to_their_union` test.
