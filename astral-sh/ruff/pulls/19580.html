            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nit: It feels a bit off to me to use a <code>Result</code> here. I would expect an <code>Err</code> only if two types can&#x27;t be compared but that&#x27;s not how <code>Result</code> is used here.</p>
<p>I think I&#x27;d use a custom enum over <code>Result</code> with a <code>Yes</code> and <code>No(reason)</code> variants. We can mark the type as <code>#[must_use]</code> if we&#x27;re worried about callers not handling the error but it seems not handling the error actually seems to be the default?</p>
<p>What&#x27;s unclear to me is how we plan on aggregating <code>TypeRelationError</code>s. But maybe that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s not yet clear to me what variants <code>TypeRelationError</code> will have</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think using <code>Result</code> might have some advantages further down the line: methods like <code>map_err</code> could be useful for bubbling up a low-level assignability failure of a wrapped type into a high-level assignability failure for the wrapping type. But I agree that we need a more ergonomic solution for the default case: I was going to suggest having low-level methods <code>try_type_relation</code>, <code>try_subtype_relation</code> and <code>try_assignability_relation</code> (which you can use if you need to know <em>why</em> the relation doesn&#x27;t apply between two types), but to also have high-level <code>has_relation_to</code>, <code>is_subtype_of</code> and <code>is_assignable_to</code> methods like we have now:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;&#x27;db&gt; Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt; {
    fn has_relation_to(db: &amp;&#x27;db dyn Db, other: Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;, relation: TypeRelation) -&gt; bool {
        self.try_type_relation(db, other, relation).is_ok()
    }

    fn is_subtype_of(db: &amp;&#x27;db dyn Db, other: Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;) -&gt; bool {
        self.has_relation_to(db, other, TypeRelation::Subtyping)
    }

    fn is_assignable_to(db: &amp;&#x27;db dyn Db, other: Type&lt;&#x27;db&gt;) -&gt; bool {
        self.has_relation_to(db, other, TypeRelation::Assignability)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>it&#x27;s a bit hard to tell what the best design is, however, until we try to start trying to use (in diagnostics) the extra information now available to us.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One thing you could try is ot use <code>thin_vec</code>. I suspect that the performance regression is mainly because the result of the type operations no longer fit into a single register. But it might also be that we return <code>false</code> in many places and tracking the information is anything but free.</p>
<p>But I think I&#x27;ll need a better understanding for what we want to use this new information and if it&#x27;s even worth tracking all possible errors.</p>
<p>It might be good to start with: What exact information do we need and, from there, backtrack on what information we need to propagate in these relation methods.</p>
<p>It might also be that we want separate relation methods to avoid the overhead in the most common path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s probably also useful if I turn TypeRelationError into an enum? All of the todo fails right now will create a new vec, but for the most part most vec will have one item</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this is a lot more expensive than what we do on <code>main</code> because it means that we now have to iterate through the entire MRO (and allocate a <code>Vec</code>) whereas previously we could short-circuit as soon as we spotted that one class was a subclass of the other. We should avoid <code>.collect()</code> calls in this and similar cases wherever possible, and continue to short-circuit. I think in most cases, it&#x27;s probably okay if we only provide a single reason why one type is not a subtype of another, even if there are multiple underlying reasons why the relation cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p><code>Protocol</code>s might be an exception to this, but we can deal with that later</p>

<p>What&#x27;s not clear to me from this if this is something we need to integrate into the <code>is_</code> methods directly or if we should have a separate method that visits a type again and then diagnoses why it isn&#x27;t assignable (by re-testing each union element to find the one that isn&#x27;t assignable).</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a good question. It would be interesting to experiment with some different designs here.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the current approach in this PR is that it does not increase the maintenance burden of the type-relational methods. I would definitely not want to go back to a situation similar to what we had before <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18430">astral-sh/ruff#18430</a>: having separate <code>Type::is_assignable_to</code> and <code>Type::is_subtype_of</code> methods was a maintenance nightmare that led to many subtle bugs across our code. I&#x27;m concerned that your suggestion <em>might</em> similarly lead to us trying to have duplicated implementations of <code>Type::has_relation_to</code> which would be very hard to keep in sync (this method is very subtle, and very complex!).</p>
<p>There might also be ways of implementing your suggestion that would not significantly increase the maintenance burden. On the other hand, I also think there are some obvious ways of optimising this PR branch, as I commented above</p>
