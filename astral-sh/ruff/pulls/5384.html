            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This adds a new rule that detect unreachable code, currently limited to function bodies.</p>
<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>The rule works as follows.</p>
<p>First we create &quot;basic blocks&quot; from the statements. These basic block are zero or more lines of code (statements) for which the code flow is easy to follow. Specifically all statements in a single block follow each other, no diversion of the control flow. At the end of the block the control can do one of three things: 1) continue to another code block, 2) based on a condition jump to one of two code blocks, or 3) terminate (return or end of the function).</p>
<p>Second, based on these basic blocks, and the simplified control flow they represent, we can determine what blocks are and aren't reached. We do this by starting with the first block of the function and following the jumps it makes to the next code block, marking them all as reached.</p>
<p>Third, we create a diagnostic for each code block that is not reached by step 2. Currently these diagnostics are quite limited, see below.</p>
<h1>Future Work and Limitations</h1>
<p>This commit is only the beginning of this rule, there is much work still left to do.</p>
<p>The diagnostics created currently is quite limited. It only mentions the function name and points to the fist statement in the basic block. In the future this should be expanded to point to all statements in the basic block. Furthermore it would be helpful to the users to explain <em>why</em> a code block is not reached as currently, except for the most basic example, this might not be clear.</p>
<p>We're currently quite limited on how we determine if a branch is always taken or not, specifically we only detect the constants true and false and only in the most basic condition (mainly the <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements). This can be expanded to detect more cases where we can statically determine whether or not a branch is taken.</p>
<p>This currently doesn't handle the <code>try</code> or (<code>async</code>) <code>with</code> statements.</p>
<p>For match statements we currently set <code>BasicBlock::stmts</code> to the entire match statement for each basic block, even though we're only interested in one of its cases.</p>
<p>Within match statements binding to named patterns is currently not handled. Similarly to wildcard they should be considered to be always taken (assuming no guard is present).</p>
<h1>False Positive</h1>
<p>This has the possibility for false positive mostly around the non-implementation of <code>try</code> and <code>with</code> statements. Currently I found one in the Bokeh repo and added it as a (commented-out) test case. I believe time is best spend implementing <code>try</code> and <code>with</code> instead of working around this issue.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Added new tests, simply run <code>cargo test</code>.</p>
<p>I also manually ran this on airflow the Bokeh, Cpython, FastAPI and Jupyter server repos.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the purposes of detecting unreachable code, your block 1 doesn't contain any control flow, notwithstanding function calls that always raise an exception, thus block 2 is always reached when block 1 is reached. Creating one block instead of two is then simply less work for us later on. Rustc does the same thing, see https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/appendix/background.html#what-is-a-control-flow-graph.</p>
<p>Other then the addition block, it's what we roughly create at the moment, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5384/files#diff-a98f67bee97e7c459fad838467a76c7cbcd7c66beca1bae4826d1fa4054c4e5d (crates/ruff/src/rules/ruff/rules/snapshots/ruff__rules__ruff__rules__unreachable__tests__while.py_12.snap) for a graph of code that is quite similar.</p>

<pre><code>* Have you thought about how to support e.g. conditional expressions where we also have a conditional data flow?</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You mean for example an <code>if</code> statement inside of the condition (test) of an <code>if</code> statement (<code>Expr::IfExp</code>)? No, I didn't have time to look at this yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>* I commented on the `BasicBlock` layout. Could you expand on the reason why you chose this specific `BasicBlock` layout? Or in general, could you document how the basic blocks should be structured?</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm going to assume you mean <code>BasicBlocks</code> (multiple) as you left a comment on that.</p>
<p>Basically the <code>BasicBlocks.blocks</code> is a tree laid out as a vector/array. The fist and last blocks are defined as the last and first blocks in the function (i.e. they are switched) because we start processing the last statement. Why start with the last statement? Because the statement always jumps to the next statement assuming no control flow diversion, which means they have to be part of the existing tree (vector) to reference them.</p>
<p>In between these two block however things get a little fuzzy... It's not ideal, but I couldn't really find a reasonable way to make it return a fixed order (in the time I had). Basically each statement can add an arbitrary number of blocks as it can have an arbitrary number of statements within it (think the body of a loop or if statement). For these &quot;sub-statements&quot; we use the same approach as the top-level statements, but we reuse the <code>blocks</code> vector (for performance reasons). This all works fairly straight forward up to the point where you have recursion, e.g. for loops.</p>
<p>For while loops the body jumps to the while block itself, unless we see a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code>. But by default <code>create_blocks</code> points to the last block in <code>blocks</code> as the next block (unless <code>after</code> is set). But the <code>after</code> argument isn't sufficient in all cases, so we need <code>change_next_block</code> to fix up the control flow in some cases. (I added the <code>after</code> argument after I already implemented <code>change_next_block</code>, but I couldn't remove it as it's still required in some cases last time I checked)</p>
