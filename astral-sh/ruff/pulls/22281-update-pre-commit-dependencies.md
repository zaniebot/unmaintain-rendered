### [`v1.40.0`](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#014---2019-11-03)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/compare/v1.39.2...v1.40.0)

##### Bug Fixes

- Ignore numbers as identifiers ([a00831c8](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/a00831c847b7efd81be520ea9b5d02f70555351f))
- Improve the organization of --help ([a48a457c](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/a48a457cc3ca817850118e2a2fb8b20fecdd40b8))

##### Features

- Dump files, identifiers, and words ([ce365ae1](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/ce365ae12e12fddfb6fc42a7f1e5ea71834d6051), closes [#&#8203;41](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/41))
- Give control over allowed identifier characters for leading vs rest ([107308a6](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/107308a655a425eb593bf5e4928572c16e6a9bdd))

##### Performance

- Use standard identifier rules to avoid doing umber checks ([107308a6](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/107308a655a425eb593bf5e4928572c16e6a9bdd))
- Only do hex check if digits are in identifiers ([68cd36d0](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/68cd36d0de90226dbc9d31c2ce6d8bf6b69adb5c))

### [`v1.39.2`](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#014---2019-11-03)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/compare/v1.39.1...v1.39.2)

##### Bug Fixes

- Ignore numbers as identifiers ([a00831c8](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/a00831c847b7efd81be520ea9b5d02f70555351f))
- Improve the organization of --help ([a48a457c](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/a48a457cc3ca817850118e2a2fb8b20fecdd40b8))

##### Features

- Dump files, identifiers, and words ([ce365ae1](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/ce365ae12e12fddfb6fc42a7f1e5ea71834d6051), closes [#&#8203;41](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/41))
- Give control over allowed identifier characters for leading vs rest ([107308a6](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/107308a655a425eb593bf5e4928572c16e6a9bdd))

##### Performance

- Use standard identifier rules to avoid doing umber checks ([107308a6](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/107308a655a425eb593bf5e4928572c16e6a9bdd))
- Only do hex check if digits are in identifiers ([68cd36d0](https://redirect.github.com/crate-ci/typos/commit/68cd36d0de90226dbc9d31c2ce6d8bf6b69adb5c))
