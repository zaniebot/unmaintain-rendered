## Summary

This PR aims to reduce the allocations necessary for `best_fitting`. 

Today:

* One allocation for interning the object that should be formatted with different variants (outside of best fitting, avoids formatting the same content multiple times)
* One allocation for the `Vec` that stores all variants
* One allocation per variant that stores the format elements for that variant


This PR removes the allocations per variant and instead writes all variants into a single buffer stored on `BestFitting`. 
The downside of this is that resolving the most-flat or most-expanded variants now requires a search for the `StartBestFittingEntry` or `EndBestFittingEntry` . I don't expect this to be significant because best-fitting entries tend to be small (<16 entries). 

## Performance

This gives us a 2% improvement for most files, except the large/dataset.py. I need to dig deeper to understand why only large data set is regressing. This is especially surprising because I would have expected the performance to improve the most for large files that make heavy use of best fitting.

## Test Plan

`cargo test`

It would be nice to remove the need for this buffer too but this complicates things a bit because finding the boundaries of a variant suddenly need to account for nested best fitting elements:

```
StartBestFittingEntry (Outer)
....
StartBestFittingEntry (Inner)
...
EndBestFittingEntry
...
EndBestFittingEntry
```

The nesting is probably rare because best fitting is almost always used together with `Interned`, meaning that the nested best fitting most likely ends up being inside of the interned vec, but it remains possible.

Isn't as promising as I thought, or even regressing and it introduces additional complexity.
