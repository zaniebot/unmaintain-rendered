Welcome to the project :) thanks for taking the time to contribute.

I'm not sure I see enough value in adding this, it feels like something that we would fail to maintain. Can you say a bit more about how this will be valuable to users?

I think this can be helpful for individuals who don't have experience with Docker and want to try ruff, or for those who want an easier way to test and contribute to a project.

I wish this PR can help. 😄

I appreciate the PR but ultimately I don't think the maintenance burden outweighs the benefits. Thanks for getting involved!
