This was released without a changelog or migration guide (https://github.com/pascalkuthe/imara-diff/issues/27). I think we should just wait as this is mainly used in `cargo dev` command, unless someone is motivated to look at the diff (https://github.com/pascalkuthe/imara-diff/compare/v0.1.8...master) and see what's breaking :)
