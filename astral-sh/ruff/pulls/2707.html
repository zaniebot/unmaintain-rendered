<p>Haven&#x27;t bothered to fix up the tests yet, but here&#x27;s the current UI:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@henryiii - This is just a first draft, but from your perspective, what&#x27;s missing from the output?</p>
<p>You&#x27;d mentioned line numbers in the issue, but line numbers are a little tricky to include here, because they won&#x27;t map to lines in the changed file, and they might not even map to line numbers in the <em>original</em> file, because we preform multiple autofix passes. That is: sometimes, fixing a rule introduces a new violation, so we continue autofixing until the code stabilizes (e.g., if we remove a statement, it might render an import unused, and so on).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We <em>could</em> include the location information and message for every fixed violation, but the outputs are going to be confusing in some cases due to the above disclaimer.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think the location is that important, though I think the message should be there. That provides a description of sorts of what it did (removed imports, removed print statements, etc). Just the number only helps advanced users who&#x27;d memorized all the numbers or are willing to look each on up.</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>my/file.py:
  F821 (x12): I don&#x27;t actually remember what F821 is, other than very common
  A123 (x2): Some other fixable thing
</code></pre>
<p>Other than that, looks great!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is nice. Agreed that it probably doesn&#x27;t make sense to give line/character breakdown. If you&#x27;re removing lines, then there is no line to reference. And then it seems strange to have some with that information and some without.</p>
<p>Can I propose something like the following for the output?</p>
<pre><code>Fixed 81 errors:
  crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_return/RET504.py:
     1 × E731 Do not assign a `lambda` expression, use a `def`
  crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_return/RET505.py:
    26 × F841 Local variable `…` is assigned to but never used
  crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_return/RET506.py:
    19 × F841 Local variable `…` is assigned to but never used
  crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_return/RET507.py:
    16 × F841 Local variable `…` is assigned to but never used
  crates/ruff/resources/test/fixtures/flake8_return/RET508.py:
    19 × F841 Local variable `…` is assigned to but never used
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy to parse visually as things align nicely. Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort the outer list of files alphabetically - it&#x27;s easier to scan through</li>
<li>Sort the inner lists by decreasing number of fixes - it&#x27;s nice to know where the biggest wins were</li>
<li>Output the rule message to avoid having to look up rule codes<ul>
<li><p>Note that rules with more than one message format should be grouped separately, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>100 × RUF100 Unused blanket `noqa` directive
 10 × RUF100 Unused `noqa` directive
  1 × RUF100 Unused `noqa` directive (…)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>But don&#x27;t repeat for all variations of a message, i.e. substitute <code>…</code> for all placeholders</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right align the count of violations fixed under <em>all</em> files by the number of digits for the biggest number</li>
<li>And I love the use of nice unicode symbols... So note the <code>×</code> and <code>…</code> 😉</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m hesitant to include the message formats because they&#x27;re not very clear in a lot of cases, and we haven&#x27;t committed to maintaining variants that <em>would</em> be clear in this context. I&#x27;d kind of prefer to use the human-readable rule name for that purpose, which we <em>are</em> committed to maintaining.</p>

<p>I think this will happen anyway when we switch to focusing on human-friendly names as the primary code.</p>
<p>Also, we lose a bit of context when a rule has different messages.</p>

<p>Although maybe this is an indication that a rule should be split up into multiple rules? 🤔</p>
