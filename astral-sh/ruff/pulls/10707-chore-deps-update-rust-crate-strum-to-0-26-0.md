### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>Peternator7/strum (strum)</summary>

### [`v0.26.2`](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0262)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/compare/v0.26.1...v0.26.2)

-   [#&#8203;337](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/337): Fix missing generic impls for `EnumTryAs`
-   [#&#8203;334](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/334): Support prefix in `AsRefStr`. Technically a breaking change,
    but `prefix` was just added in `0.26.0` so it's a newer feature and it makes the feature more consisent in general.

### [`v0.26.1`](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0261)

-   [#&#8203;325](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/pull/325): use `core` instead of `std` in VariantArray.

### [`v0.26.0`](https://togithub.com/Peternator7/strum/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0260)

##### Breaking Changes

-   The `EnumVariantNames` macro has been renamed `VariantNames`. The deprecation warning should steer you in
    the right direction for fixing the warning.
-   The Iterator struct generated by EnumIter now has new bounds on it. This shouldn't break code unless you manually
    added the implementation in your code.
-   `Display` now supports format strings using named fields in the enum variant. This should be a no-op for most code.
    However, if you were outputting a string like `"Hello {field}"`, this will now be interpretted as a format string.
-   EnumDiscriminant now inherits the repr and discriminant values from your main enum. This makes the discriminant type
    closer to a mirror of the original and that's always the goal.

##### New features

-   The `VariantArray` macro has been added. This macro adds an associated constant `VARIANTS` to your enum. The constant
    is a `&'static [Self]` slice so that you can access all the variants of your enum. This only works on enums that only
    have unit variants.

    ```rust
    use strum::VariantArray;

    #[derive(Debug, VariantArray)]
    enum Color {
      Red,
      Blue,
      Green,
    }

    fn main() {
      println!("{:?}", Color::VARIANTS); // prints: ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]
    }
    ```

-   The `EnumTable` macro has been *experimentally* added. This macro adds a new type that stores an item for each variant
    of the enum. This is useful for storing a value for each variant of an enum. This is an experimental feature because
    I'm not convinced the current api surface area is correct.

    ```rust
    use strum::EnumTable;

    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumTable)]
    enum Color {
      Red,
      Blue,
      Green,
    }

    fn main() {
      let mut counts = ColorTable::filled(0);
      for color in &[Color::Red, Color::Red, Color::Green]] {
        counts[color] += 1;
      }

      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Red], 2);
      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Blue], 0);
      assert_eq!(counts[Color::Green], 1);
    }
    ```

-   `Display` has 2 new features:
    -   the `strum(prefix = "some_value")` attribute on an enum now allows you to prepend a string onto every
        variant when you serialize it.

    -   Custom `to_string` and `serialize` attributes now support string interopolation on serialization.
