            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it be better to be explicit from which module <code>DAG</code> was removed to avoid false positives instead of allowing any <code>DAG</code> symbol imported from anywhere within airflow (e.g. this also flags <code>airflow.providers.my_provider.DAG</code>)</p>

<p>We had a discussion with @ntBre previously. Our conclusion back then was this kind of small ones are fine.</p>
<p>But if we want to make it gated behind preview, what would be the process? Do we need to extract these logic to somewhere so that they can be activated through preview flag? Thanks!</p>

<p>It should be pretty easy to add guards to the <code>match</code> arms and a new preview function like in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/c0fb235a703684bca1cc1767015bb7e19ab1c22f/crates/ruff_linter/src/preview.rs#L16-L19"><code>preview.rs</code></a>.</p>
<p>But I agree that this change seems fine without preview.</p>
