## Summary

This PR replaces our custom `fixtures` macro used by the formatter with insta's `glob` macro. 

The main motivation for the change is that the `#[fixture]` macro was somewhat error prone because it relied to come before the `#[test]` macro. 

The downside of using `insta::glob` is that it now defines a single test. Maning, all fixture tests run sequentially, rather than in parallel. The slowdown isn't significant on my machine. 

I further improved the snapshot tests by 

* Making the fixture tests integration tests to avoid snapshot name collisions (and these tests are integration tests after all).
* Removing the module name
* Hide the expression (which is always `expression`)

<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

## Test Plan

No functional change.

Could you move these into their own function? In my experience macro calls often break tooling inside of it

Maybe... Normally not, because `assert_equals` use the name of the enclosing function but who knows, maybe their some custom logic in place to handle `glob`.
