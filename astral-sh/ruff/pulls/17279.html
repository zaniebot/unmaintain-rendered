<h2>Summary</h2>
<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->

<ul>
<li>Adds a pre-commit check for merge conflict inspired by reviewing #17278. This will flag any commits that contain merge-conflict strings before they are pushed to branches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Checks that it flags merge conflict like in #17278 . This is one of the builtin standard hooks and I have used it in many repos.</li>
</ul>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is interesting. How fast is this pre-commit step? I'm a bit annoyed by how slow our pre-commit is if I use <code>--all-files</code> (I have to use <code>--all-files</code> because I never run pre-commit on individual commits, we aren't friends ;))</p>
<p>I guess my concern is, I don't want to make my workflow significantly slower and this is already something that otherwise gets catched in CI</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm also a bit sceptical this will be that useful -- it's a pretty fast hook IIRC, but I'm not convinced it'll be that useful given that merge conflicts are pretty easy to catch in CI through our existing checks. And I agree that our pre-commit is already somewhat slow locally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my experience, it's a super fast lightweight hook; and one of the standard pre-commit hooks. The builtin hooks are pretty optimized.</p>
<p>This also catches merge conflicts in code areas that are not run: like say documentation, text files or other file types.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I checked out this PR locally and the new hook is basically instantaneous on this repo. So if this will help some of our contributors, let's go for it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
