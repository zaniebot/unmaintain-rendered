It's https://github.com/actions/checkout/commit/0c366fd6a839edf440554fa01a7085ccba70ac98 ?

I merged it in the ty repo (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/pull/2452) as that looked v6.0.2, the tag is on the parent commit actually. Do we need to revert that?

Now I'm not sure why I wasn't able to find it (I used Cmd+f?)

Pinning it to `de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd` makes senes to me (which is what the tag points to)

You don't, but the bot deleted the branch immediately after the PR was closed, so you need to restore the branch before you can reopen the PR (I've done so)
