            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR updates the server capabilities to include the commands that Ruff supports. This is similar to how there's a list of possible code actions supported by the server.</p>
<p>I noticed this when I was trying to find whether Helix supported workspace commands or not based on Jane's comment (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11831#discussion_r1634984921) and I found the <code>:lsp-workspace-command</code> in the editor but it didn't show up anything in the picker.</p>
<p>So, I looked at the implementation in Helix (https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/9c479e6d2de3bca9dec304f9182cee2b1c0ad766/helix-term/src/commands/typed.rs#L1372-L1384) which made me realize that Ruff doesn't provide this in its capabilities. Currently, this does require <code>ruff</code> to be first in the list of language servers in the user config but that should be resolved by https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/10176. So, the following config should work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
# Ruff should come first until https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/10176 is released
language-servers = [&quot;ruff&quot;, &quot;pyright&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ol>
<li>Neovim's server capabilities output should include the supported commands:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>  executeCommandProvider = {                                                                                                                          
    commands = { &quot;ruff.applyFormat&quot;, &quot;ruff.applyAutofix&quot;, &quot;ruff.applyOrganizeImports&quot;, &quot;ruff.printDebugInformation&quot; },                                
    workDoneProgress = false                                                                                                                          
  },
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Helix should now display the commands to pick from when <code>:lsp-workspace-command</code> is invoked:</li>
</ol>

<p>It's unfortunate that Helix isn't able to forward the URI for these commands - maybe that's something we should try contributing upstream eventually.</p>

<p>Yeah, we can start by opening an issue / discussion to let them know about this limitation. I also think this can be solved by a custom plugin but I don't think Helix supports them yet.</p>
