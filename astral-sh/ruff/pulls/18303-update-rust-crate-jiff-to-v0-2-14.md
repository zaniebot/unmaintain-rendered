### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>BurntSushi/jiff (jiff)</summary>

### [`v0.2.14`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0214-2025-05-20)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.13...0.2.14)

\===================
This release includes a smattering of bug fixes, and hopefully a small
improvement to the time it takes to compile Jiff. Also, in this release, when
`TZ` is set to a non-empty but invalid value, Jiff will always fall back to
`Etc/Unknown` when using `TimeZone::system()`. This differs from previous
behavior where Jiff would, in this case, attempt to read the system's default
time zone. This change brings Jiff into consistency with existing Unix tooling
like `date`, and is also arguably a better failure mode. That is, when `TZ` is
set but invalid, we shouldn't silently fall back to the default system time
zone, but instead do something that indicates something has potentially gone
wrong.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;364](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/364):
    Jiff now falls back to `Etc/Unknown` for invalid `TZ` values.
-   [#&#8203;379](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/379):
    Improve compilation times.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;365](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/365):
    Fixes a compile error in Jiff when only the `tzdb-concatenated` feature was
    enabled.
-   [#&#8203;366](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/366):
    Fixes slow initial `Zoned::now()` in environments where `/usr/share/zoneinfo`
    is on a very slow file system (like CI environments).
-   [#&#8203;376](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/376):
    Avoids searching for a tzdb at `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on Windows.
