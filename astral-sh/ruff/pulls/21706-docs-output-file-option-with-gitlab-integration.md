# docs: Output file option with GitLab integration

---

_Pull request opened by @kieran-ryan on 2025-11-30 22:10_

## Summary

Document availability and usage of the `--output-file` option within the GitLab integration - over usage of `>`.

Interested whether there is rationale to retain the existing sample otherwise - in which case this issue can be closed.

thank you. I don't think there's any specific reason for using `>` over `--output-file` other than that this documentation was written before we added support for `--output-file`.
