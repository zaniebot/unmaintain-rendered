<p>Just for additional context, I <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/206">suggested splitting</a> the implementation into two parts:  (1) collect all conflicting declared types so we would in principle be able to emit a diagnostic — assuming we could do it from anywhere, and (2) actually create a new diagnostic and make the required changes to be able to emit it.</p>
<p>But even part (1) doesn't seem finished, so keeping this in draft seems fine. @smokyabdulrahman Let us know if you need additional help to proceed here.</p>

<p>Hey @sharkdp,
I couldn't think of any other place to tackle and add the logic of collecting conflicting declared types to.
Also, I am not sure how to test for part (1) even in a hacky way.</p>

<p>We identified two spots in the linked issue. If I understand it correctly, you solved it for one of these, but the more difficult one would be in the change to the loop logic. I can go into more details tomorrow, if that would help.</p>

<p>The infrastructure for emitting diagnostics from <code>Type::member</code> (and friends) is still not in place. If you're okay with waiting for that, you could still test your implementation by running Red Knot manually on a test file, and &quot;emitting&quot; diagnostics via <code>eprintln!</code> or similar.</p>
<p>The important thing for part 1 would be to get the semantics correct, i.e. to identify two or three test cases that would clearly show that we would be able to generate the right diagnostic messages.</p>
<p>If that sounds too complicated, I'm also okay with leaving that open for a bit longer, and revisit it once the diagnostics infrastructure is in place.</p>
