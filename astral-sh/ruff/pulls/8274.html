            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR is a heavy WIP and RFC for adding support for wildcard paths for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/banned-api/"><code>banned-api</code></a>.</p>
<p>In short, the goal would be to be able to do</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.flake8-tidy-imports.banned-api]
&quot;some_package.ANCIENT*&quot;.msg = &quot;None of the ancient powers of `some_package` may be invoked&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>instead of having to spell out all of the ancients&#x27; names in the config.</p>
How?!
<p>This PR implements this by way of a new <code>CallPathPattern</code> struct, which is basically a <code>CallPath</code> but with possible wildcard segments (<code>glob.Pattern</code>s; I looked at <code>wildmatch</code> and decided not to introduce another dependency) and can be matched against a qualified name <code>CallPath</code>. I&#x27;m not 100% sure that&#x27;s the best way here, and especially e.g. config parsing becomes a bit hairier since turning the strings in the config to CallPathPatterns could fail (e.g. <code>some_package.ANCI[</code> is invalid).<br>
(I also noticed there&#x27;s a NameMatchPolicy thing in the <code>flake8_tidy_imports</code> linter that kind-of does the same thing.)</p>
<p>Then, there&#x27;s a possible concern about performance, since we can no longer just use an FxHashMap for looking up bans. (Since this is very much a WIP (and who knows, maybe this is deemed a Bad Idea all in all), I haven&#x27;t measured things.)</p>
<p>Of course we could come up with a smarter data structure that&#x27;s both an FxHashMap for the exact-match happy path, and a vector of CallPathPatterns for other situations?</p>
Test Plan


<p>Not very well yet. It&#x27;s probably buggy (but compiles!). The patch is currently also peppered with TODOs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the overall idea is reasonable. I assume we&#x27;d also want to support:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;some_package.*.ANCIENT&quot;.msg = &quot;None of the ancient powers of `some_package` may be invoked&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>One idea: could we use a <code>GlobSet</code>? So, combine all the patterns into one, and do that single test; if it passes, then run all the individual tests to find the relevant message.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Mm, yeah! (This would already support <code>some_package.*.ANCIENT</code>, but not <code>some_package.**.ANCIENT</code>.) Using a GlobSet would be a grand idea otherwise, but it doesn&#x27;t look like you can customize which character(s) the globs think are path separators, so I don&#x27;t think we can just easily match them against full <code>CallPath</code>s then.</p>
<p>We&#x27;d want these patterns to consider <code>.</code> path separators, not <code>/</code> ... unless we do spooky things on our side and turn the <code>CallPath</code>s into slash-separated strings (which, tbh, isn&#x27;t completely unreasonable, probably...)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I only saw the ping when browsing through open Ruff PRs. I&#x27;m sorry.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have a clear path forward for this, but I&#x27;m now looking into multifile analysis and plan to significantly change Ruff&#x27;s semantic model. I think it does make sense to defer this work until we have a better understanding of how our semantic model looks (I don&#x27;t expect <code>CallPath</code> to survive the refactor).</p>
