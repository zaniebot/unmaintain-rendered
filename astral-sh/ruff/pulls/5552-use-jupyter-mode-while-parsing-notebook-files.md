# Use `Jupyter` mode while parsing Notebook files

---

_Pull request opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-07-06 05:05_

## Summary

Enable using the new `Mode::Jupyter` for the tokenizer/parser to parse Jupyter line magic tokens.

The individual call to the lexer i.e., `lex_starts_at` done by various rules should consider the context of the source code (is this content from a Jupyter Notebook?). Thus, a new field `source_type` (of type `PySourceType`) is added to `Checker` which is being passed around as an argument to the relevant functions. This is then used to determine the `Mode` for the lexer.

## Test Plan

Add new test cases to make sure that the magic statement is considered while generating the diagnostic and autofix:
* For `I001`, if there's a magic statement in between two import blocks, they should be sorted independently

fixes: #6090

_Renamed from "Allow line magics for Jupyter Notebook" to "Use `Jupyter` mode while parsing Notebook files" by @dhruvmanila on 2023-07-18 16:57_

The reason to use a `bool` here instead of `Mode` is that the function is expected to return a `Module` node which is only possible for 2 (`Module`, `Jupyter`) out of the 4 modes.

We could use a `bool` here instead of `Mode` similar to `parse_program_tokens` but I think this is a general function so this is ok.

Unrelated to this line. Ruff calls into `lex_starts_at` in various places. Do we need to change these calls to use the right mode?

Yes. Most of the calls are made in the rule implementation so they'll require the correct context.

@dhruvmanila would it be possible to split out the necessary changes to get Ruff compile? I wanted to pull in my cursor changes but am unable to do so because of the new AST nodes. The alternative is that I put `todo!()`s everywhere

This is incorrect as line 4 and 5 belong to the previous cell, so it shouldn't be shown here. This is more of a todo for me. It shows the correct information when using `cargo run` on the file directly. It seems the the Jupyter index is computed when it shouldn't be, thus the incorrect cell breaks.

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff/src/checkers/ast/mod.rs`:80 on 2023-07-27 06:04_

Nit: What do you think of passing in a `PythonFileType` enum instead of an enum to e.g. support Pyi files,. 

We could even go further. Rome has a `SourceType` struct that stores the `Language`, `version`, etc. Anything that may result in different parser behaviour 

---

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff/src/jupyter/notebook.rs`:86 on 2023-07-27 06:07_

Nit: Aren't line magics now parsed (rather than being ignored by the parser)?

---

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff/src/linter.rs`:267 on 2023-07-27 06:09_

How do we ensure that we pass the correct `mode` in all the places where we call `tokenize`, `lex` or `lex_starts_at` today? 

I haven't thought this through fully but I start wondering if we should have something like a `PythonFile` that stores the source, mode, required python version, etc. and provides method for parsing and lexing the content.

_Review comment by @MichaReiser on `crates/ruff/src/rules/flake8_raise/rules/unnecessary_paren_on_raise_exception.rs`:97 on 2023-07-27 06:11_

Nit: This `if` is very repetitive. I think introducing a `PyFileType` that has a `as_mode()` method would be useful.

what about determining this from file extension, so you can run `print-ast` on `data_analysis.ipynb` without having to set the flag?

I like the idea of having an enum to have multiple file types. Regarding the mentioned `SourceType` I couldn't find that in Rome, were you referring to [`JsFileSource`](https://github.com/rome/tools/blob/3370296d862aa6a7f63f5db3d2995e14b150c3a7/crates/rome_js_syntax/src/file_source.rs#L100-L106)? 

I think introducing a new `PyFileSource` is much better and robust solution:
```rust
enum LanguageVariant {
	#[default]
	Standard,
	Pyi,
	Ipynb
}

impl LanguageVariant {
	fn as_mode(&self) -> Mode {
		match self {
			Self::Standard | Self::Pyi => Mode::Module,
			Self::Ipynb => Mode::Jupyter
		}
	}
}

struct PyFileSource {
	variant: LanguageVariant
}

impl PyFileSource {
	fn as_mode(&self) -> Mode {
		self.variant.as_mode()
	}
}
```

We might want to merge this with the existing `SourceKind` abstraction although that is used in a different context.

Would this be more similar to the existing [`SourceKind`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/e15b9c5572227df15e09b806a7b707ac748cd89f/crates/ruff/src/source_kind.rs#L4) abstraction? Although that is mainly to capture the `Notebook` struct within the same type.

Yes, that's helpful as well but this would allow us to use Jupyter specific syntax in a Python file and not worry about starting a notebook server. We could include both :)

`JsFileSource` is what I meant. They must have renamed it. I think I prefer `PyFileType` or `PySourceType` to make it clear it's about the source file (which can be different from the codegen target, e.g. when transpiling Python 3.12 code to Python 3.8). 

> We might want to merge this with the existing SourceKind abstraction although that is used in a different context.

Oh, I didn't remember it existed. IT may be fine to have both until we split source files more clearly.

I think it would be higher because it encapsulates a Python file with its meta information (source version, what's the source text, ... ). It could also store source kind.
