            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Fixes #14141.</p>
<p>Attempting to infer the MRO or metaclass of a cyclically defined class must be avoided, or we&#x27;ll end up in an infinite loop. As such, our logic for determining metaclasses and our logic for determining MROs both have logic included to detect if a class is cyclically defined and abort if so.</p>
<p>This PR moves the cycle-detection logic from <code>mro.rs</code> into a single method on <code>ClassType</code> that is queried by both the MRO-inference and metaclass-inference methods. This has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It means that for cyclically defined classes, we don&#x27;t even need to call the <code>try_mro</code> and <code>try_metaclass</code> Salsa queries in <code>check_class_definitions</code>. We know that we won&#x27;t be able to calculate either, so there&#x27;s no need to do so. It doesn&#x27;t cost us anything to eagerly check whether the class is cyclically defined in the <code>check_class_definitions</code> method, because we would need to do this check anyway before even attempting to check that the class&#x27;s MRO or metaclass was resolvable.</li>
<li>It gets rid of this awkward patch of code here, where we have to just ignore the error and move on, because we know it&#x27;ll have already been handled by the MRO-checking logic immediately above: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/953e862aca1449651d96036fcd35f7fab4ccda51/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types/infer.rs#L567-L570</li>
<li>It&#x27;s a reasonably significant reduction in code quantity. It&#x27;s also a reasonably significant reduction in code complexity: there&#x27;s now no need for a recursive inner function in <code>try_metaclass</code>, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>The diff in the metaclass-inference logic is a bit hard to read -- sorry! -- but there&#x27;s really not much changed overall. It&#x27;s just all been dedented because there&#x27;s no longer any need for the large recursive inner function.</p>
Can we use the <code>specify</code> Salsa functionality?
<p>@carljm suggested in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14141">astral-sh/ruff#14141</a> that we could use Salsa&#x27;s <code>specify</code> functionality to let Salsa know that it didn&#x27;t even need to call <code>try_mro</code> or <code>try_metaclass</code> if there was a cyclic class definition, since if there&#x27;s a cyclic class definition we know we&#x27;ll just return an error variant from these queries. I tried this, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work: Salsa complains that <code>Class</code> doesn&#x27;t implement the <code>salsa::plumbing::TrackedStructInDb</code> trait if I make this change:</p>
<pre><code>diff --git a/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types.rs b/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/src/types.rs

<p>I looked into this a little bit and I don&#x27;t think it would be correct (and maybe not possible?) for <code>Class</code> to implement that trait, so I don&#x27;t think we can use <code>specify</code> for Salsa-tracked methods on <code>Class</code>.</p>

<p>Existing tests all pass.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>nit: obviously it&#x27;s not impossible, we did it prior to this diff :) might be clearer to just say &quot;we&#x27;d enter an infinite loop.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess the main cost of this diff (due to the fact that we can&#x27;t use <code>specify</code>) is an additional tracked function for each class. But I think this is a reasonable tradeoff; there are relatively few classes (compared to the number of, say, definitions), so I don&#x27;t think this will make a huge difference to our total tracked-functions count.</p>

<p>Interesting that no mdtests had to change here. Does that mean that this didn&#x27;t actually regress the MRO we infer for cases where only a sub-graph of our MRO is cyclic?</p>

<p>That&#x27;s correct. At one point in my MRO PR I had a very weak form of partial recovery for cyclic classes. But it was pretty ad-hoc/unprincipled, and I didn&#x27;t think it was particularly useful (given how cyclic classes inherently don&#x27;t make any sense, and always fail at runtime anyway). So I ripped it out before landing the MRO PR; even though it wasn&#x27;t <em>much</em> additional complexity, it didn&#x27;t seem worth it considering how tiny the benefits were.</p>
<p>For any class with a cycle in its MRO, we infer the MRO as being <code>[&lt;the class in question&gt;, &lt;Unknown&gt;, &lt;object&gt;]</code>. That was true before this PR, and it&#x27;s true with this PR as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I mean... kinda? We would <em>try</em> to infer the metaclass prior to this diff, but we would immediately throw up our hands and bail out of it as soon as we detected a cycle. That feels like kind of the same thing to me 😄 but, I&#x27;ll rewrite the comment :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes. I suppose we could also try not caching this, and just recomputing it everywhere. I don&#x27;t really have any idea how much the caching helps or hurts us here.</p>
<p>Codspeed&#x27;s entirely neutral on this PR, so it at least doesn&#x27;t seem to be leading to a significant regression when checking tomllib. But then tomllib doesn&#x27;t really have any deep inheritance hierarchies (I don&#x27;t think!). So it might not be the best benchmark for this specific issue.</p>
