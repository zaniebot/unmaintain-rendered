            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @charliermarsh, what was your reasoning behind re-enabling this PR after rolling it back? Did you only roll it back? Was the main reason for rolling it back that it didn't build correctly on i686?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser - Yeah the motivation for the revert was to figure out how to get builds passing on those other architectures, so it felt appropriate to re-enable once I'd added these extra conditionals. I didn't do any further investigation into memory usage etc. but I'll admit I was buoyed by some of your other analyses :)</p>
