            <div class="timeline-body"><p><strong>Changelog:</strong> This PR improves observability in the server by removing the need of using the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#traceValue">&quot;trace&quot; value</a> as a means to turn on or off logging. Now, the server logging is solely controlled using the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/settings/#loglevel"><code>logLevel</code> server setting</a> which defaults to &quot;info&quot;. This avoids the confusion where the user is notified about going through the log messages but there aren't any.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Refer to the VS Code PR (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode/pull/659) for details on the change.</p>
<p>This PR changes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add tracing span for both request (request id and method name) and notification (method name) handler</li>
<li>Remove the <code>RUFF_TRACE</code> environment variable. This was being used to turn on / off logging for the server</li>
<li>Similarly, remove reading the <code>trace</code> value from the initialization options</li>
<li>Remove handling the <code>$/setTrace</code> notification</li>
<li>Remove the specialized <code>TraceLogWriter</code> used for Zed and VS Code (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12564)</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the (5) for the Zed editor, the reason that was implemented was because there was no way of looking at the stderr messages in the editor which has been changed. Now, it captures the stderr as part of the &quot;Server Logs&quot;. (https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/82492d74a8d0350cba66671c27e282a928fd4c85/crates/language_tools/src/lsp_log.rs#L548-L552)</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>Regarding (1), I think having just a simple trace level message should be good for now as the spans are not hierarchical. This could be tackled with astral-sh/ty#90. The difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Update documentation (I'll be adding a troubleshooting section under &quot;Editors&quot; as a follow-up which is for all editors)</li>
<li>[x] Check for backwards compatibility. I don't think this should break backwards compatibility as it's mainly targeted towards improving the debugging experience.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this works as expected because the <code>span</code> is dropped as soon as the <code>request</code> method ends. You should be able to see this by adding other tracing logs in a request handler. Those messages should be nested under the <code>request</code> level.</p>
<p>Instead, what we have to do is to create the <code>span</code> here, but only call <code>entered</code> in the thread that process the request OR defer creating the span to the thread that processes the request.</p>
<p>The same applies to notification.</p>
<p>Does this also cover response handlers?</p>
