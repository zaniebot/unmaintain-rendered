            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR switches more callsites of <code>SemanticModel::is_builtin</code> to move over to the new methods I introduced in #10919, which are more concise and more accurate. I missed these calls in the first PR.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p><code>cargo test</code>. I haven't introduced any new tests in this PR, because I added quite a few in #10919, and this is just doing the same thing as that PR. One existing violation in the test fixtures becomes newly fixable, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Performance is <a href="https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/ruff/branches/AlexWaygood:builtins-3">overall neutral</a>, but some linter benchmarks are showing regressions of 1-2%. I think that's <em>probably</em> okay, given that #10982 was also overall neutral, and the final version of that PR had improvements of 2-3% on some of the same benchmarks. I can't see an easy/clean way of moving the calls to the semantic model lower down in any of the rules I'm touching here.</p>
