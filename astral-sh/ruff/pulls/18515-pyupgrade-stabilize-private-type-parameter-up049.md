# [pyupgrade] Stabilize private-type-parameter (UP049)

---

_@ntBre_

## Summary
Stabilizes the UP049 rule (private-type-parameter) by moving it from Preview to Stable.

UP049 detects and fixes the use of private type parameters (those with leading underscores) in PEP 695 generic classes and functions.

## Test plan
- Verified that UP049 tests pass: `crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pyupgrade/mod.rs`
- Ran full test suite with `make test` 
- Confirmed that no test migration was needed as UP049 was already in the main `rules` test function

## Rule documentation
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/private-type-parameter/

These with the funny descriptions are being generated by claude with a lot of hand-holding. I'm double-checking that the tests are in the right place and that the docs look okay manually, but not necessarily before opening the PRs.

I actually do have a Makefile and told it to run `make test` :laughing:

oh whoops! sorry, Claude - my mistake!

Looks like the ecosystem check is all unrelated (claude had the base branch wrong initially again). The docs and tests look good to me.
