# Update README.md by adding `ivy` repository to the who's using Ruff section

---

_Pull request opened by @Sai-Suraj-27 on 2024-01-31 15:07_

## Summary
I have recently made a contribution to a big python based repo **replacing flake8 with ruff** (https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/pull/27779). So, as per this [discussion](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9731). I am making this PR to add the [ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy) repository (**with > 13k stars ⭐**) to the Ruff's readme

## Test Plan
No, need of any tests for the changes made.
