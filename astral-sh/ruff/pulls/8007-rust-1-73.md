I don't mind disabling that lint... Here's the documentation of the rule and why https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#/ignored_unit_patterns

I was like, meh but then it's rare and not too bad

I'm fine with it, don't feel strongly.

I'd been holding off on this as Homebrew doesn't yet support it (conda-forge does): https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/149754

Just tested `brew install ruff --head` and it compiles fine :)

FYI, rust 1.74.0 got shipped in the homebrew side now, https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/154526
