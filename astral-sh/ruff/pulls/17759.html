            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The PR add the fix safety section for rule <code>RUF013</code> (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15584">astral-sh/ruff#15584</a> )
The fix was introduced here #4831</p>
<p>The rule as a lot of False Negative (as it is explained in the docs of the rule).</p>
<p>The main reason because the fix is unsafe is that it could change code generation tools behaviour, as in the example here:</p>
<pre><code>def generate_api_docs(func):
    hints = get_type_hints(func)
    for param, hint in hints.items():
        if is_optional_type(hint):
            print(f&quot;Parameter &#x27;{param}&#x27; is optional&quot;)
        else:
            print(f&quot;Parameter &#x27;{param}&#x27; is required&quot;)

# Before fix
def create_user(name: str, roles: list[str] = None):
    pass

# After fix
def create_user(name: str, roles: Optional[list[str]] = None):
    pass

# Generated docs would change from &quot;roles is required&quot; to &quot;roles is optional&quot;

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @dylwil3</p>
<p>it was hard to find an example were the fix was unsafe, or to understand the reasons why is unsafe. But I think the main reasons is the one explained above.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this fix might just be safe. This is a creative reason it might not be safe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main reason because the fix is unsafe is that it could change code generation tools behaviour, as in the example here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but I think that example looks like a bug fix or desired change to me - the argument really <em>is</em> optional.</p>
<p>My guess is that - as we&#x27;ve seen in other instances for this documentation issue - the fix was <em>originally</em> marked as unsafe because there were some false positives, but then during code review the implementation was changed to either skip or correctly handle those cases.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve made a separate PR to make the fix safe in preview <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17836">astral-sh/ruff#17836</a> . Assuming I&#x27;m not missing something and that gets merged I&#x27;ll close this PR.</p>
<p>Thank you for the investigative work! Really it&#x27;s helpful either way if we end up documenting the fix or learning that it has a safe fix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>RUF013 can change runtime behavior:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat &gt;ruf013.py &lt;&lt;&#x27;# EOF&#x27;
def foo(arg: int = None):
    pass
print(foo.__annotations__[&quot;arg&quot;])
# EOF

$ python ruf013.py
&lt;class &#x27;int&#x27;&gt;

$ ruff --isolated check ruf013.py --select RUF013 --unsafe-fixes --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ python ruf013.py
typing.Optional[int]
</code></pre>
<p>It is conceivable that some code might inspect annotations at runtime, expecting normal <code>type</code>s, and break on typing-specific things. In such a case, it’s still a true positive for RUF013, but the proper fix would be more involved than this autofix.</p>
