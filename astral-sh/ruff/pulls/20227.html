            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, you are right. I checked and I could not find a situation where we have a change of behaviour in the program. I think the only problem is that it can delete comments</p>

<p>What happened here and elsewhere is that long long ago the fix was implemented as &quot;suggested&quot;.
