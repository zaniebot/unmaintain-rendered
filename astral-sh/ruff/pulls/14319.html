<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<!-- How was it tested? -->

<p><code>cargo test</code></p>
<p>The ecosystem results are all correct, but for <code>Airflow</code> the rule is not relevant due to the use of overloading (and is marked as unsafe correctly).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, how common is this antipattern in practice? I see a few ecosystem hits here, but not enough to make me think that this is something that a <em>lot</em> of users are doing. Has this rule been requested by any of our userse?</p>
<p>For context: we've had lots of conversations over at flake8-pyi over whether we should implement more rules that detect redundant unions (https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-pyi/issues/283, https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-pyi/issues/414, etc.). Our conclusion every time has been that without very sophisticated multifile type inference, a generalised way of detecting redundant union elements is impossible, so we should only implement rules that detect common mistakes that we've actually encountered in real code.</p>

<p>It's a fair concern, but I would argue to give it a try and see how it turns out for users.</p>
<p>I've searched before implementing this rule, and it's less rare than I expected (see list below).
The rule is under preview, so we could always later decide to remove it if users do not pick it up/disable it.</p>
<p>For the nested unions and literals, having the rules in place can simplify the auto fixes of other rules, since we can reduce the problem to one that we've already solved.</p>
<p>We also should remind ourselves that the ecosystem results are published code, it could be that while developing/refactoring, such rules become more relevant. For instance saving users time when running <code>ruff</code> on save.</p>
<p>It's good to consider that is that if you expect typed Python to be more common with the amazing tooling that is coming available (type checkers, auto typing etc.), the number of users of these features also increase, and so will their need for learning new concepts such as <code>Literal</code>. I like to think of rules as a tool for users who are learning new concepts such as typing, and then realising when <code>Literal[True, False]</code> is equivalent to <code>bool</code> and when not could help in developing their mental model. A bit off topic, but this would be one of the cool outcomes of grouping rules related to the same language features together (#1774).</p>
<p>One final and exciting motivation is that these rules add to the diversity of test cases too, which can help testing red-knot!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! I'm sure that this rule would help some people.</p>
<p>My concern is just that there's sort of an endless number of rules like this, regarding redundant union members, that you could plausibly add to Ruff. It's not clear where to draw the line, and they all add a certain amount of maintenance burden for us. When we adopt red-knot as the new backend, moreover, we should be able to consolidate them all into a single rule that is implemented with much less code and has much greater accuracy.</p>
<p>So I'm not against adding these rules when they address very common user issues or when we've been explicitly asked for a rule like this. If I were dead-set against it, I wouldn't have added rules like this to flake8-pyi in the first place! But I do think the bar needs to be ~reasonably high for this kind of rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I chatted with @MichaReiser offline and he convinced me that this would be an especially helpful rule for Python beginners. I'm still a bit concerned that there'll be a lot of churn for users if we end up deprecating all these rules and replacing them with a single, generalised rule when we switch to using red-knot as the backend. But that's probably a long way off.</p>
<p>Just a few docs nitpicks, then I think we're good to go 👍</p>
