<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Closes #18349</p>
<p>After this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>All deprecated rules are deselected by default</li>
<li>They are only selected if the user specifically selects them by code, e.g. <code>--select UP038</code></li>
<li>Thus, <code>--select ALL --select UP --select UP0</code> won't select the deprecated rule UP038</li>
<li>Documented the change in version policy. From now on, deprecating a rule should increase the minor version</li>
</ul>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Integration tests in &quot;integration_tests.rs&quot;</p>
<p>Also tested with a temporary test package:</p>
<pre><code>~&gt; ../../ruff/target/debug/ruff.exe check --select UP038
warning: Rule `UP038` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
warning: Detected debug build without --no-cache.
UP038 Use `X | Y` in `isinstance` call instead of `(X, Y)`
 --&gt; main.py:2:11

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The old test still seems relevant to me. It shows that indirect selection in preview does <em>not</em> produce the failure that a direct selection in preview does. I think we can revert the changes to this test.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is minimizing the diff such a big goal?
In my experience, it's better to allow (even encourage) small improvements like this. This helps keep the code clean and up-to-date.
If the change is too big (like renaming a variable which is used a lot across the project), I'd want it to be a proper PR/commit but in my case, the diff is small.</p>
<p>That said, I understand it's important in this project, so I'll comply, no problem:)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's not such a big deal, I just lean toward preserving the original code/comments if it's not a really clear improvement. This is just a slight phrasing improvement, so I don't think it's worth adding another step to checking the git-blame in the future, for example. In other cases I'd probably agree with you :)</p>
