# Revert "Remove `--preview` as a required argument for `ruff server` (#12053)"

This reverts commit b28dc9ac14dd83175e65ed40c54ca65665c2dea5.

We're not ready to stabilize the server yet. There's some pending work for the VS Code extension and documentation improvements.

This change is to unblock Ruff release.
