            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR extends our playground so that you can paste a <code>pyproject.toml</code> or <code>ruff.toml</code> configuration into the settings panel and
it automatically converts it to the JSON configuration.</p>
<p>This PR also adds a <em>Copy as pyproject.toml</em> and <em>Copy as ruff.toml</em> action that converts the JSON configuration to a TOML confguration.</p>
<p>The motivation for extending the playground is that it makes it easier to try out configurations provided by users and to share configurations verified in the playground in a format that's familiar to users.
I considered changing the settings a TOML file instead. However, monaco has no autocompletion or schema support for TOML files, which means that switching to TOML would lead to a worse overall editing experience.</p>
<p>The pasting could be &quot;nicer&quot; because the implementation let's monaco handle the paste and then replaces the pasted content if it is a TOML setting.
Users can see how the content change. I spent quiet a bit of time trying to figure out if there's a more official way of handling
pasting from the clip board in monaco and customizing the behavior by either overriding the standard paste operation or
adding a cutom paste action but was unsuccessful. That's why I ultimately went with the solution in this PR.</p>
