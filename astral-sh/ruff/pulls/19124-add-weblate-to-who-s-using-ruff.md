Hey, added Anki and Weblate, but got a question, is it preferable to use the source code URL or the home page (if the page has one)

Could change https://weblate.org/ to https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate and https://apps.ankiweb.net/ to https://github.com/ankitects/anki

Thanks!

It's a good question. I checked when reviewing your Anki PR, and it looks like the majority use GitHub links, but there are definitely some home pages mixed in, so I think either is okay.

I'd probably slightly lean toward GitHub links if available, but not strongly enough to change either of these.
