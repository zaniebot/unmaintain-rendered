            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Following #20962 we're seeing the fuzzer take much longer in CI on seed 742 than on any other seed (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20962#issuecomment-3477968074). But this problem is only reproducible in debug builds, so this doesn't seem like an issue that's worth worrying much about.</p>
<p>This PR switches the fuzzer CI job to use <code>--profile=profiling</code>, and also makes this the new default if you run the fuzzer locally. This should mean that the build the fuzzer uses in CI has more similar performance characteristics to a release build. This in turn means we don't have to constantly wonder whether the fuzzer taking twice as long is indicative of a &quot;real&quot; issue or just an artifact of debug-build weirdness.</p>
<p>As well this, this also reduces the amount of time the fuzzer CI job takes (4min30s -&gt; 3min40s) and reduces the amount of time we need to wait for the fuzzer job to start. (Prior to this PR, you had to wait for the <code>cargo-test-linux</code> job to finish before it would even start, because it reused the build uploaded from that job.)</p>
