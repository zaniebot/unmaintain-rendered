            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR removes our default database handling from ty's LSP.</p>
<p>We used the default database for files that don't belong to any project,
because we want to treat them differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>We shouldn't show any diagnsotics (funnily enough, this doesn't work today)</li>
<li>In the future, we want to disable formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>This PR removes the default database and:</p>
<ul>
<li>relies on the project inclusion/exlusion to disable diagnostics for non-project files, the same as we do it in the CLI</li>
<li>We can disable formatting and other features that should only run on project files the very same way</li>
</ul>
<p>This fixes an issue where goto definition didn't work in files in the project's virtual environment
for relative imports because the default database uses different search paths than the project.</p>
<p>The only downside that I see using this approach is that ty doesn't warn
about missing imports in non-project files if those modules are available in the project's virtual environment.
If this is a concern, than I think we'll want to use a similar approach to scripts (TBD). Either way, I don't think
we want to use a default database.</p>
<p>Fixes https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2290</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>Tested that goto definition now works for projects using <code>venv</code> as their virtual environment (the example in https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/2290)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's different and, confusingly, we used the same term for them. We use a fallback db if the initialization of the project's database fails during workspace initialization. But we associate that db with the project's path.</p>
<p>The default database was different. We only used it for paths that have no project with which they share a prefix.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm also getting more and more to the conclusion that not having to do that would be great</p>

<p>I'm not aware of a situationb where this would be the case.</p>
