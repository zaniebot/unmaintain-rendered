            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This implements the (subtle!) algorithm that Python uses for binary arithmetic operations between two instances. The full algorithm is described well in <a href="https://snarky.ca/unravelling-binary-arithmetic-operations-in-python/">this blog post</a> by Brett Cannon; the official Python docs for this are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are still many TODOs in the code and tests. The main remaining tasks in this area are:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many type errors we do not currently catch, and some types that we do not yet infer correctly, because we would need to validate the types of arguments passed to functions.</li>
<li>We do not yet have any capability to traverse a class&#x27;s MRO to understand if one class is a subclass of the other</li>
</ul>
<p>Closes #13590</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@carljm -- currently I just returned an <code>Option</code>, as it&#x27;s simpler and we don&#x27;t have a branch dealing with <code>Union</code>s yet.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think we should use <code>is_assignable_to</code> here, or even <code>is_subtype_of</code>; I think we should go straight to an <code>is_subclass_of</code> method implemented directly on <code>ClassType</code>.</p>
<p>Functionally it shouldn&#x27;t matter currently, though it will be more efficient to bypass unnecessary layers of abstraction. But in the future with generic classes, I <em>think</em> this decision should be based purely on the subclass relationship of the classes, without considering generic parameters at all. E.g. if class <code>Bar[T]</code> inherits class <code>Foo[T]</code> and overrides <code>__radd__</code>, then I think we should prioritize <code>Bar.__radd__</code> even if we have <code>Bar[X]</code> and <code>Foo[Y]</code>, where <code>Bar[X]</code> is not a subtype of <code>Foo[Y]</code> (for variance reasons or because X and Y have no subtype relationship), because the runtime won&#x27;t be considering generic parameters (they don&#x27;t even exist at runtime.)</p>
<p>Of course our eventual determination of which method is <em>supported</em> will depend on the type annotations on the dunder methods, which may involve <code>T</code>, and that could influence our eventual determination of the result of the operation. But I don&#x27;t think <code>T</code> should influence the decision of which dunder method to try first. Which means I think this should be based purely on the subclass relationship of two classes, without considering anything else handled in <code>is_assignable_to</code> or <code>is_subtype_of</code>.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t actually know what the right answer is... do we need to consider <code>Y</code> as a class that &quot;could inherit from <code>X</code> and override <code>__radd__</code>&quot;?

So a better answer than what mypy/pyright give might be <code>int | Any</code> (accounting for the fact that it <em>could</em> be a class that inherits from <code>X</code>, but it also <em>could not</em>)?</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s even slightly more subtle than that; the relevant case here is that Any represents some unknown third class Z which inherits from X and overrides <code>__radd__</code> (since we can see that Y itself does not override <code>__radd__</code>).</p>
<p>I agree that <code>int | Any</code> is the right answer here. It would be <code>int &amp; Any</code> if <code>X</code> also defined <code>__radd__</code> to return <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>Getting to this right answer will depend on several features, one of which is <code>is_subclass_of</code> supporting finding <code>Any</code> in the MRO, and the other is <code>class_member</code> and <code>inherited_class_member</code> supporting <code>Any</code> in the MRO.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry I wasn&#x27;t more clear about this: I think this method should take <code>other: ClassType</code> instead of <code>other: Type</code>, and attempt to only answer the much narrower question, &quot;given two ClassType, does the one inherit the other&quot;. This would avoid a lot of the TODO questions below; I think more abstracted methods calling this should be responsible for handling e.g. unions and intersections. (For example, that is already the case in this PR, and would also be the case when e.g. <code>is_subtype_of</code> wants to make use of this method -- which it probably should already in this PR.)</p>
<p>That just leaves the question of how to handle <code>Any</code> in the MRO. I think for now (until we have a proper MRO and a clarified data model for what types can occur in the MRO) this method can just return <code>true</code> if it finds <code>Any/Unknown/Todo</code> or a matching <code>ClassType</code> in bases, otherwise <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>I think a doc comment clarifying the semantics of this method would be useful.</p>
<pre><code>    /// Does this class inherit the given `other` class?
    pub fn is_subclass_of(self, db: &amp;&#x27;db dyn Db, other: ClassType) -&gt; bool {

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This means that if we want binary operations to actually consider the possibility that an <code>Any</code> inheriting type might be a subtype when found on the RHS, we&#x27;ll have to do something a bit more complicated there than just <code>is_subclass_of</code>; there might need to be another <code>may_be_subclass_of</code> method that does respect <code>Any/Unknown</code>?</p>
<p>To be honest, though, I feel like the behavior of binary operations when the RHS inherits <code>Any</code> is an edge case that may never practically matter to anyone, so I don&#x27;t think we should spend more time on it now.</p>

<p>To be honest, though, I feel like the behavior of binary operations when the RHS inherits <code>Any</code> is an edge case that may never practically matter to anyone, so I don&#x27;t think we should spend more time on it now.</p>

<p>Agreed, I&#x27;m definitely fine with what we have for now, the TODO comments are pretty clear!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yes, you did indeed lead me astray here from your comment in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13800">astral-sh/ruff#13800</a>#discussion_r1806833944, when you said this 😄</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that the hypothetical <code>ClassType::is_subclass_of</code> should handle the special case of <code>Any</code> or <code>Unknown</code> in the MRO. (And unions too, if we support them in bases, though this might be handled via checking in multiple MROs instead.)</p>

<p>but no harm done!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think there was a misunderstanding between &quot;handle Any/union in the MRO&quot;, which is what I said, and &quot;handle Any/Union&quot; in the <code>other</code> type&quot;, which is what you implemented. I didn&#x27;t mean that comment to imply handling anything else in <code>other</code>. I don&#x27;t think the version you implemented did handle Any or Union found in the MRO?</p>
<p>But my comment was wrong regardless, because in the end I realized I don&#x27;t think we should handle Any in the MRO here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I got messaged by @AlexWaygood on Discord about a potential error in my blog post&#x27;s code, but since I never heard back from Alex after I answered the question I wanted to make sure you all knew that the canonical code for my syntactic sugar posts can be found at https://github.com/brettcannon/desugar/ . That repo has tests to verify the unravelling matches actual semantics and the code hasn&#x27;t been modified for blog post readability, i.e. it shouldn&#x27;t very bugs. 😅</p>
