Summary
<p>Fix a typo in the docs example, and add a test for the case where a negative pattern and a positive pattern overlap.</p>
<p>The behavior here is simple: patterns (positive or negative) are always additive if they hit (i.e. match for a positive pattern, don&#x27;t match for a negated pattern). We never &quot;un-ignore&quot; previously-ignored rules based on a pattern (positive or negative) failing to hit.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s simple enough that I don&#x27;t really see other cases we need to add tests for (the tests we have cover all branches in the ignores_from_path function that implements the core logic), but open to reviewer feedback.</p>
<p>I also didn&#x27;t end up changing the docs to explain this more, because I think they are accurate as written and don&#x27;t wrongly imply any more complex behavior. Open to reviewer feedback on this as well!</p>
<p>After some discussion, I think allowing negative patterns to un-ignore rules is too confusing and easy to get wrong; if we need that, we should add <code>per-file-selects</code> instead.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Test/docs only change; tests pass, docs render and look right.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for asking the question! I&#x27;m not set on this behavior, just was favoring the simplest option to understand, unless we had a clear need for something more complex. But it&#x27;s true that it will be hard to change this once shipped, so it&#x27;s good to think through what we prefer now.</p>
<p>The main difference I see between this case and gitignore is that a negative pattern in gitignore serves exactly one purpose: to un-ignore whatever it matches. It doesn&#x27;t also mean &quot;ignore everything that doesn&#x27;t match this pattern.&quot;</p>
<p>In our case we do want &quot;ignore everything that doesn&#x27;t match this pattern&quot; for negative patterns, so there&#x27;s more risk of overloading the meaning if we also add &quot;un-ignore everything that does match this pattern.&quot;</p>
<p>For instance, here&#x27;s a case to consider:</p>
<pre><code># ignore D rules in all __init__.py files
&quot;__init__.py&quot; = [&quot;D&quot;]
# ignore D rules everywhere outside src/
# - does this also mean &quot;actually, don&#x27;t ignore in __init__.py files inside src/&quot;?
&quot;!src/**.py&quot; = [&quot;D&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure which behavior is more intuitive for this example. But if we did add un-ignoring, and you did want to ignore in all <code>__init__.py</code> files inside <code>src/</code> too, you can always just switch the order of the two patterns; the rule would be &quot;last one wins.&quot; I think between this and the option of adding another more-specific positive pattern after the negative one, there shouldn&#x27;t be any cases you can&#x27;t express at all, if we add this.</p>
<p>Initially it seemed odd to me that a negative pattern would un-ignore on failure to hit, while a positive pattern wouldn&#x27;t do that, but after thinking through some examples, I think that behavior works out OK; for a negative pattern the no-hit cases are more narrowly targeted, so it&#x27;s more intuitive to un-ignore in that case.</p>
<p>I guess my last concern: is it too confusing if a negative pattern in <code>extend-per-file-ignores</code> (in a different config location from <code>per-file-ignores</code>) overrides some of what&#x27;s specified in <code>per-file-ignores</code>? (This isn&#x27;t possible today, since everything is just additive.) Or is this fine?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The typical way I like to do filtering for whitelist/blacklist situations like this is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every rule is either a whitelist or a blacklist rule.</li>
<li>The rules are ordered. Later rules take priority over earlier rules.</li>
<li>When there are 1 or more whitelist rules, then in order for a subject to pass the filter, the last matching rule must be a whitelist rule.</li>
<li>When there are 0 whitelist rules, a subject passes the filter when it matches 0 blacklist rules.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the filter rejects the subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find that these semantics overall provide a lot of flexibility. But you&#x27;re right that gitignore doesn&#x27;t neatly map on to this model. The other complication that seems present here is that the rules aren&#x27;t just ignore/not-ignore, but they also come with lint rules associated with the filter. I haven&#x27;t thought through fully how that might impact things.</p>
<p>I think the model above overall matches what you&#x27;re saying around adding un-ignoring, particularly with the last rule matching being the winner. I think I overall personally like this style. I don&#x27;t have a good answer for what to do about <code>extend-per-file-ignores</code> though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the fact that we&#x27;re not just making a pass/fail ruling for a subject, but building up an ignore-ruleset for the subject, means that the algorithm you outlined doesn&#x27;t quite work here. Specifically the part that doesn&#x27;t work (or at least has to be more complex) is &quot;a negative rule can only cause a subject to pass the filter if there are no positive rules.&quot; The problem is illustrated by a case like this:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;__init__.py&quot; = [&quot;F401&quot;]
&quot;!src/**/*.py&quot; = [&quot;E&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>IMO the intent here is clearly that <code>F401</code> is ignored in all <code>__init__.py</code> files, whereas <code>E</code> is ignored in all files outside the <code>src/</code> directory. But since there is both a positive pattern and a negative pattern present, according to the algorithm you listed, the negative rule here would be a no-op.</p>
<p>We could try a more complex version of it, where &quot;1 or more positive patterns&quot; and &quot;0 positive patterns&quot; are replaced by &quot;1 or more positive patterns with overlapping ruleset&quot; and &quot;0 positive patterns with overlapping ruleset.&quot; But I think this is too subtle.</p>
<p>What I&#x27;ve pushed here is instead a variant of your algorithm. It&#x27;s still last-one-wins where there are conflicts, but a negative pattern always applies in both directions: it always adds ignores to anything that doesn&#x27;t match, and removes them from anything that does.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After more discussion off-line, it feels like allowing un-ignores is too unpredictable. The case that seems like the most obvious for un-ignores is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[lint.per-file-ignores]
&quot;src/**/*.py&quot; = &quot;[X]&quot;
&quot;!src/foo/bar/**/*.py&quot; = &quot;[X]&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>But even that is subtly wrong, because it doesn&#x27;t just make a carve-out from the prior rule, it ends up ignoring <code>X</code> <em>everywhere</em> outside <code>src/foo/bar</code>, rendering the first rule redundant.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to roll back this PR to just test the existing purely-additive behavior (which we actually already released this morning); my suspicion is that if we want per-file selects it will be a lot clearer to add a <code>per-file-selects</code> config. But we should have more discussion and do that in a separate PR.</p>
