Summary
<p>Adds support for sarif v2.1.0 output to cli, usable via the output-format paramter.</p>
<p><code>ruff . --output-format=sarif</code></p>
<p>Includes a few changes I wasn&#x27;t sure of, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds a few derives for Clone &amp; Copy, which I think could be removed with a little extra work as well.</li>
</ul>
Test Plan


<p>I built and ran this against several large open source projects and verified that the output sarif was valid, using <a href="https://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/Validation">Microsoft&#x27;s SARIF validator tool</a></p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also attached an output of the sarif generated by this version of ruff on the main branch of django at commit: b287af5dc9
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/files/13626222/django_main_b287af5dc9_sarif.json">django_main_b287af5dc9_sarif.json</a></p>
<p>Note: this needs to be regenerated with the latest changes and confirmed.</p>
Open Points
<p>[ ] Convert to just using all Rules all the time
[ ] Fix the issue with getting the file URI when compiling for web assembly</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So one potential issue here is that <code>pyproject_config</code> isn&#x27;t guaranteed to contain the correct set of enabled rules for all files. Ruff supports hierarchical configuration, so you can have different configuration files that apply to different subdirectories in your project. The <code>pyproject_config</code> here really just represents the settings in the current working directory.</p>
<p>Could we infer the set of rules from the diagnostic messages? (What is this used for on the SARIF side?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If <code>filename</code> is relative here, would this convert it to absolute? I do think <code>filename</code> will always be absolute here... we pass around absolute paths, and expect callers to call <code>relativize_path</code> when displaying user-facing relative paths...

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gotcha--thanks for that context.  SARIF lists the rules applied as part of the tool description so that you can be sure you&#x27;re getting an apples to apples comparison, rather than just saying both times you checked with a particular rust version.</p>
<p>While the field is not mandatory in the SARIF specification <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790806">Section 3.19.23 rules property</a> it is <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning">required by Github</a>.   Also see: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#understanding-rules-and-results">Understand Rules and Results</a></p>
<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure how github would handle having the <code>rules</code> be supplied as only the ones for which diagnostics could be found as that&#x27;s not documented.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yeah, <code>normalize_path</code> seems like the right call here, as <code>.canonicalize()</code> will fail if the file doesn&#x27;t actually exist (a la in test).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Including all rules is probably the safest bet.  In my experience with code scanning on github, I&#x27;ve never looked at what checks were done, only the findings, so this is probably closest to the SARIF expectation.  My gut is that most people have most rules applied, and only turn off a handful, but I could be wrong, especially for older/larger projects.</p>
<p>Only downsides are if someone complains and then we change it, if others are using it in their CI, the rules set will change, which again, not sure how bad that is and that the file size will be a bit larger.</p>

<p>Yeah, those were needed at one point with how SarifResults were copying rules into them, was also planning on backing them out but you beat me to it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately, <code>#[allow(clippy::unnecessary_wraps)]</code> is hard to avoid since we need the function to have the same signature on all platforms -- so if <em>any</em> of them return a <code>Result</code>, they <em>all</em> need to return a <code>Result</code>. We run into this in other parts of Ruff too.</p>
