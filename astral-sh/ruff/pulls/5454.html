</blockquote>
<p>Currently, <code>UP035</code> detects imports of many deprecated names, while <code>UP006</code> detects usage of just PEP 585 deprecated names. So e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List  # Flagged by UP035
x: List  # Flagged by UP006

import typing
x: typing.List  # Flagged by UP006
</code></pre>
<p>It definitely seems like something that could be merged into one rule, or we could have two (one for pep 585 and one for other deprecated names) which share their implementation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also made me realise an issue with this PR currently:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import typing
from typing import Sequence

x: Sequence
x: typing.Sequence
</code></pre>
<p>causes an error</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to create fix for NonPEP585Annotation: Unable to insert `Sequence` into scope due to name conflict

<p>although weirdly when I actually run <code>--fix</code> it runs <strong>2</strong> fixes (including <code>UP006</code>) and does actually fix the code properly... I guess ruff reruns fixes until the output is stable?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this originally arose from pyupgrade, which has two separate &quot;rules&quot; for deprecated imports vs. PEP 585 rewrites (for builtins only). Most deprecated imports can be fixed by only modifying the import site, since they typically involve members that were moved from one module to another. Meanwhile, the PEP 585 built-in rewrites don't require changing imports at all, since they only change to <code>list</code>, <code>set</code>, etc., which are available as builtins. Later, when we added support for multi-location fixes, we added <code>defaultdict</code> and <code>deque</code> to the PEP 585 rule; and we added <code>typing.List</code> and friends to the deprecated import rule, even though it was already covered in a sense by the PEP 585 rule. Anyway, just explaining why this happened, not how we should deal with it.</p>
<p>The current setup honestly seems okay to me (the PEP 585 rule deals with members that need to be renamed; the deprecated imports rule only fixes <em>imports</em>), but I'd probably also be okay with removing the PEP 585 imports from &quot;deprecated imports&quot; and moving them into this rule. Though it might be sort of complicated to pull off given how different the implementations are, and some of the quirks around how they'd need to be gated (e.g., you can rewrite <code>List</code> to <code>list</code> if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is present, but you can't rewrite to a <code>collections.abc</code> import), at which point, I may question the value.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's right -- we iteratively fix up to a certain number of iterations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for explaining, I agree that it seems quite complicated to combine the rules, and removing the duplication of names would probably also require a decent amount of work. Maybe something that could be done at some point but I'm not sure it's necessary for this PR.</p>
<p>I fixed the issue with the name conflict when both types of import are already there (the autofix for this case still works, it just needs the <code>UP035</code> autofix first).</p>
<p>Does this look alright?</p>

<p>I can't think of a case that you'd want to have a rule to detect/fix</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import List
x: List
</code></pre>
<p>but not</p>
<pre><code>import typing
x: typing.List
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect them to be treated as equivalent by a rule attempting to update to PEP 585 annotations.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that just suggests that would make sense to implement for <code>UP006</code> (ideally sharing implementation with <code>UP035</code>). IMO, the difference between <code>UP006</code> and <code>UP035</code> should just be what names are affected, not in what cases the names are changed, since that's not a helpful distinction for the user.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>nit: we can split this into two matches to short-circuit when the call path is not from <code>typing</code> / <code>typing_extensions</code> module like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">let [&quot;typing&quot; | &quot;typing_extensions&quot;, member @ ..] = call_path else {
    return None;
};

match member {
    // Builtins
    [&quot;Tuple&quot;] =&gt; Some((&quot;&quot;, &quot;tuple&quot;)),

<p>Not sure if the change back was intentional, or just something lost in the course of the PR...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have raised a few issues with this change:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15246</p>
<p>Even if the detection+fix ability is better now that these are implemented in <code>UP006</code>, something needs to be done about the fact that the newly added warnings are all duplicates of warnings and fixes that already exist in <code>UP035</code>.</p>
<p>If this implementation becomes a little more polished, it probably should completely replace the implementation that's currently in <code>UP035</code>, there's really no reason to still keep that inferior implementation other than its battle-tested status. Although maybe for historic consistency, even if the <em>implementation</em> is unified towards <code>UP006</code>, the set of items that it triggers for should remain split between <code>UP006</code> (covering only builtins such as <code>list</code>) and <code>UP035</code> (covering others) like it's always been.</p>
</li>
<li><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15245</p>
<p>The fixer has bugs where it sometimes fails to kick in, and in corner cases kicks in with strange results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I'd like to see this pull request reverted and relanded later after a more detailed discussion, because it has ongoing bugs and possibly introduces undesirable/unexpected changes to what the rules are supposed to cover.</p>
