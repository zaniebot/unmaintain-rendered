<p>Right, but in e.g. <code>x = (y := 1) + 2</code>, you could argue that <code>y</code> is being defined (assigned to <code>1</code>) and then <em>immediately</em> used (added to <code>2</code>) in the same breath?</p>

<p>Ah gotcha, thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thinking of the walrus-created variable as unused is consistent with our current behaviour, though: it appears we flag <code>x</code> in the following snippet as unused in e.g. our <code>F841</code> lint rule:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    return (x := 1) + 2
</code></pre>
<p>And that sorta makes sense, since you can just write that more simply without the walrus as</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    return 1 + 2
</code></pre>
<p>So I think I retract my argument. It only makes sense to think of walrus-defined variables as being &quot;used&quot; if they are <em>additionally</em> used <em>outside</em> of the immediate expression in which they are defined.</p>
<p>TL;DR: LGTM!</p>

<p>Aha! Yes, that&#x27;s an interesting point. You could look at it that way, but this is not really the way Python looks at it, in terms of the AST (there is no <code>Name</code> node for <code>y</code> with context <code>Load</code> here) or in terms of the compiled bytecode (there is no <code>LOAD_FAST/LOAD_NAME</code> of <code>y</code> here).</p>
<p>For basically exactly the same reasons, it is not the simplest way for us to look at it, either. There is no &quot;use&quot; of <code>y</code> here because there is no need for us to look up <code>y</code> and resolve reachable definition(s) for it: we know that definition would always resolve to this very walrus expression, and when doing type inference we always already have the type of that expression in hand! So it&#x27;s much simpler to look at it as simply &quot;the type of the walrus expression is the type of its right-hand side, and as a side effect it also defines a name.&quot; This is how CPython handles it (except in terms of value, not type, of course), and how we handle it in this PR, and it doesn&#x27;t require treating the walrus expression as a &quot;use&quot; of its target name. You could think of it instead as we are only &quot;using&quot; the right-hand-side expression, and also storing it off to a name as a side effect, but not &quot;using&quot; the name here.</p>
