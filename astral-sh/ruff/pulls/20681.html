            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>@AlexWaygood and I discussed this a bit on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1039017663004942429/1343691651243315312/1422892554868756552">Discord</a>, and it seemed relevant for the Python 3.14 release next week, so I figured I&#x27;d put up a PR.</p>
<p>This adds <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/jump-statement-in-finally/#jump-statement-in-finally-b012">jump-statement-in-finally (B012)</a> and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/byte-string-usage/#byte-string-usage-pyi057">byte-string-usage (PYI057)</a> to the default rule set. <code>B012</code> is especially relevant for Python 3.14 because it will become a <code>SyntaxWarning</code> and may be upgraded to a <code>SyntaxError</code> in the future. <code>PYI057</code>, on the other hand, covers APIs that now won&#x27;t be removed until 3.17, but Ruff could help to make this more visible to avoid it being pushed back again.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m realizing now that I didn&#x27;t attempt to gate the new defaults based on the target Python version as Alex suggested, but I can look into that if we want. It doesn&#x27;t immediately seem straightforward to do, based on our current usage of <code>DEFAULT_SELECTORS</code>, though. <code>B012</code> seems serious enough to me always to be enabled, but the nice stdlib replacement for <code>PYI057</code> was only added in Python 3.12.</p>
Test Plan
<p>Existing tests, plus a new CLI test with the new rules</p>

<p>agreed; I think this is almost always a mistake, whatever Python version you&#x27;re using</p>

<p>but the nice stdlib replacement for <code>PYI057</code> was only added in Python 3.12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, yeah. <em>Ideally</em> I think this would only be enabled by default if your code targets Python 3.12+. But most users can probably use a <code>bytes | bytearray</code> union on lower Python versions instead of an ABC. And if they have typing_extensions as a dependency, they can use the backport of <code>collections.abc.Buffer</code> in typing_extensions too. So I think it <em>should</em> be okay if it&#x27;s made the default regardless of target Python version.</p>
<p>It might be worth adding some more examples to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/byte-string-usage/#example for what you can do if you support Python &lt;3.12? (It also seems like there&#x27;s a typo in https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/byte-string-usage/#why-is-this-bad -- it says <code>Python \&lt;3.12</code> rather than <code>Python &lt;3.12</code>.)</p>

<p>Could <code>B012</code> become a syntax rule? I guess the main reason why it shouldn&#x27;t is because there are reasons why someone would want to disable it (on a per-file or per-line basis).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;s tempting to make it a semantic syntax error, but it would be a bit more aggressive than CPython itself. The <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/#emit-syntaxerror-in-cpython">PEP</a> explicitly rejected or at least deferred plans to upgrade the warning to an error.</p>
<p>I know what you mean about expanding the defaults. I&#x27;m also happy to split the two rules into separate PRs and/or defer both until a later release after more discussion. I just wanted to have it ready in case we wanted to include these in the 3.14 release next week.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I can see that making the default selection dynamic might be pretty confusing to users. As I said above, I think it&#x27;s probably okay if PYI057 is enabled by default regardless of Python version. Of the two, I also think there&#x27;s an even stronger case for enabling B012 by default, as well, so considering the two rules separately might indeed make sense here.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I think it&#x27;s pretty important that B012 should be suppressible:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPython will still parse and execute the code at runtime (albeit with a warning)</li>
<li>The vast majority of the time, code that uses this pattern isn&#x27;t working as intended, and there&#x27;s always a way to rewrite the code in a clearer, more explicit way. But not <em>every</em> instance of this pattern is <em>necessarily</em> a bug; sometimes it might actually be working in the desired way! Even in these instances, I think the lint is beneficial, since you could rewrite the code in a clearer way, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it should be unsuppressible.</li>
<li>What if your code has lots of instances of this pattern? I think it would be reasonable to add <code>noqa</code> comments to all occurences (using <code>--add-noqa</code>) as part of the initial PR upgrading your Ruff version, and then slowly remove the <code>noqa</code> comments in followup PRs.</li>
<li>There&#x27;s no particular reason to make B012 non-suppressible while other rules that cover <code>SyntaxWarning</code>s at runtime (such as <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/is-literal/">F632</a>) are still suppressible.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yeah, I do agree that we should try to ensure that we catch all pattenrs that CPython flags at compile-time with <code>SyntaxWarning</code>s, that rules which flag syntax warnings such as <code>B012</code> and <code>F632</code> should probably all be enabled by default, and that these rules should probably all be in a common category. It&#x27;s definitely a similar problem to the syntax-errors project, and I&#x27;ve chatted with @ntBre about it before. But, I also agree that this is a separate, broader discussion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like we may want to hold off on this for now and take a more general approach to syntax warnings, which sounds good to me. I think we can still call out these rules in the release post without enabling them by default and hopefully still help with the deprecation.</p>
