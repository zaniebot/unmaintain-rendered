            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This PR fixes a bug where the checker would require the tokens for an invalid offset w.r.t. the source code.</p>
<p>Taking the source code from the linked issue as an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">relese_version :&quot;0.0is 64&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this isn't really a valid type annotation but that's what this PR is fixing. Regardless of whether it's valid or not, Ruff shouldn't panic.</p>
<p>The checker would visit the parsed type annotation (<code>0.0is 64</code>) and try to detect any violations. Certain rule logic requests the tokens for the same but it would fail because the lexer would only have the <code>String</code> token considering original source code. This worked before because the lexer was invoked again for each rule logic.</p>
<p>The solution is to store the parsed type annotation on the checker if it's in a typing context and use the tokens from that instead if it's available. This is enforced by creating a new API on the checker to get the tokens.</p>
<p>But, this means that there are two ways to get the tokens via the checker API. I want to restrict this in a follow-up PR (#11741) to only expose <code>tokens</code> and <code>comment_ranges</code> as methods and restrict access to the parsed source code.</p>
<p>fixes: #11736</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>[x] Add a test case for <code>F632</code> rule and update the snapshot</li>
<li>[x] Check all affected rules</li>
<li>[x] No ecosystem changes</li>
</ul>
