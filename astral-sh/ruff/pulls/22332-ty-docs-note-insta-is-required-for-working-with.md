# [ty] (docs) - Note insta is required for working with ty tests in ty CONTRIBUTING.md

---

_Pull request opened by @sinon on 2026-01-01 18:05_

## Summary

`insta` is now used by a sub-set of the `ty` crates.

Since this CONTRIBUTING.md was seeded from `ruff` one I have inserted the same text and in the same location for consistency.

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md?plain=1#L96-L101

## Test Plan

Renders as expected in Github `View File -> Preview`
