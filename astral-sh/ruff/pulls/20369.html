            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This looks like it should fix the errors that we've been seeing in sympy in recent mypy-primer runs.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>I wasn't able to reproduce the sympy failures locally; it looks like there is probably a dependency on the order in which files are checked. So I don't have a minimal reproducible example, and wasn't able to add a test :/ Obviously I would be happier if we could commit a regression test here, but since the change is straightforward and clearly desirable, I'm not sure how many hours it's worth trying to track it down.</p>
<p>Mypy-primer is still failing in CI on this PR, because it fails on the &quot;old&quot; ty commit already (i.e. on main). But it passes <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20370">on a no-op PR stacked on top of this</a>, which strongly suggests this PR fixes the problem.</p>
