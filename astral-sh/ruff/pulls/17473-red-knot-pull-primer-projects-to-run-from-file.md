# [red-knot] pull primer projects to run from file

---

_@carljm_

## Summary

The long line of projects in `mypy_primer.yaml` is hard to work with when adding projects or checking whether they are currently run. Use a one-per-line text file instead.

## Test Plan

Ecosystem check on this PR.

Thank you. Can you maybe change that one sentence in `crates/red_knot/docs/mypy_primer.md` that refers to the mypy_primer workflow, and instead tell the user to execute your `paste` command to get the selector?
