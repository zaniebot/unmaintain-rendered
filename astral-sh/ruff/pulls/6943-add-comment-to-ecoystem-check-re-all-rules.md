Honestly I'm not sure if I agree with this logic though. What if my new rule is not detected in this small set of repositories or what if there's an edge-case elsewhere in the ecosystem?

I don't know if I agree with the logic either even though it's my comment, though I'm also not 100% sure I want to enable `ALL` for all projects. Hmm...
