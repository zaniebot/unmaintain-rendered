            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR removes the <code>default_members</code> from the workspace configuration.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I'm not familiar with the motivation for why the <code>default_members</code> setting was added initially, and I do not object to keeping it. I'll explain my motivation for removing it below.</p>
<p>My main reason for removing the <code>default_members</code> override is that new contributors may not know that <code>cargo test</code>, <code>cargo build</code>, and other commands only run on a subset of crates. They may then be surprised that their PRs are failing in CI, but everything works locally.</p>
<p>My guess why <code>default_members</code> was added is to speed up the development workflow. That's fair, but I question the value because <code>ruff</code> is the heaviest crate to build.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I guess the reason this was present was to make <code>ruff_cli</code> the default <code>run</code> invocation. You now have to do <code>cargo run -p ruff_cli</code> to run Ruff from root.</p>
