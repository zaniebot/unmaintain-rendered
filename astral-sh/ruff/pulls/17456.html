            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>We were over-conflating the conditions for deferred name resolution. <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> defers annotations, but not class bases. In stub files, class bases are also deferred. Modeling this correctly also reduces likelihood of cycles in Python files using <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> (since deferred resolution is inherently cycle-prone). The same cycles are still possible in <code>.pyi</code> files, but much less likely, since typically there isn't anything in a <code>pyi</code> file that would cause an early return from a scope, or otherwise cause visibility constraints to persist to end of scope. Usually there is only code at module global scope and class scope, which can't have <code>return</code> statements, and <code>raise</code> or <code>assert</code> statements in a stub file would be very strange. (Technically according to the spec we'd be within our rights to just forbid a whole bunch of syntax outright in a stub file, but  I kinda like minimizing unnecessary differences between the handling of Python files and stub files.)</p>
