            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This PR attempts to fix the issues raised in #2948 (by applying fixes to the level above control flow, and adding a newline if absent), though it changes some of the decisions made in the RET503 implementation in the process.</p>
<p>Specifically, we now flag this as an error:</p>
<pre><code>def bar1(x, y, z):
    for i in x:
        return z
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas before, that was considered acceptable. This makes it easier to enforce and reason about the rule, since we no longer need to look within loops, only beyond them.</p>
<p>(That should arguably have always been an error, since we can&#x27;t guarantee that the loop even runs, so there <em>is</em> an implicit return.)</p>
<p>Closes #2948.</p>
<p>Closes #2781.</p>
