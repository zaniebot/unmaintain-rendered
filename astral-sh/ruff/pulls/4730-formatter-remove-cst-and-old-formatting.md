## Summary
This PR removes the formatter's CST implementation and the existing formatting code. I intend of reusing the formatter code by going back to this PR and copying the logic over. 

The reason for deleting the code now is that updating to https://github.com/RustPython/Parser/pull/76 causes some tests to panic and I don't believe it's still worth investing time into fixing the panics, considering that we intend replacing the code anyway.

I added some dummy formatting that simply prints the source code as is (it's not a 100% correct because RustPython's generated ranges do not include trailing trivia).

**Why**:
The new architecture avoids re-building the AST and collecting the children. This should result in a significantly faster formatter. 

## Test Plan

`cargo test`
