<p>This is a revival of #21780. After seeing #21780, I thought that perhaps we could reduce the number of incorrect hits by improving the edit distance calculation and candidate filtering.</p>
<p>I improved <code>did_you_mean</code> by referring to rustc's suggestion selection algorithm<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/nightly-rustc/src/rustc_span/edit_distance.rs.html">^1</a>.</p>

<p>Ah, I didn't notice that.
If the suggestion scope is expanded to the same extent as #18751 and the same degree of performance regression occurs, then this PR is pointless.</p>

<p>(one big, possibly expensive, thing that we don't do yet with our Liskov implementation, but that we need to add soon, is inferring the types of all first-party <em>implicit instance attributes</em>.)</p>

<p>I still think it's probably worth it to try to improve our current Levenshtein algorithm. I'd welcome a PR that just pulls out the Levenshtein algorithm from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18705 and uses it to improve our current <code>did_you_mean</code> function (without adding any new suggestions anywhere)!</p>
