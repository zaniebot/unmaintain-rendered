<p>actually two more errors are also emitted along with the expected one , can we supress others ? as the changes in this PR are not related to other two errors ,</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the first error, I think you can just add a global <code>a</code> binding before the function definition. The second case looks interesting, I think it's basically a conflicting error with the error you're adding in this PR. I think we might want to suppress the <code>used prior to global declaration</code> error in this case so that we only report the more specific <code>parameter and global</code> error.</p>
<p>I checked how we handle this in <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/b0d433c7-568d-48f2-8288-0ff9ef72c0b1">ruff</a> too, and it looks like we only emit the <code>parameter and global</code> syntax error, even if <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/load-before-global-declaration/">PLE0118</a> is also enabled.</p>

<p>what do you think of this approach I have added a new symbol flag _IS_PARAMETER ? is working as expected now</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice! This does seem to work. My only hesitation is that I suspect there is an existing way to obtain this information without adding adding a new <code>SymbolFlags</code> variant. I poked around a bit and didn't find anything, but it's probably worth someone on the ty team taking a look if they get the chance.</p>
<p>Maybe @AlexWaygood and I can have a look tomorrow during our meeting :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW I think it's probably <em>possible</em> to do it another way, but this way looks pretty clean and straightforward, and IMO is very much in line with the intended use of <code>SymbolFlags</code>, so no objection from me.</p>
