            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Part of astral-sh/ty#1341</p>
<p>The following changes will be made to <code>Place</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce <code>TypeOrigin</code></li>
<li><code>Place::Type</code> -&gt; <code>Place::Defined</code></li>
<li><code>Place::Unbound</code> -&gt; <code>Place::Undefined</code></li>
<li><code>Boundness</code> -&gt; <code>Definedness</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>TypeOrigin::Declared</code>+<code>Definedness::PossiblyUndefined</code> are patterns that weren&#x27;t considered before, but this PR doesn&#x27;t address them yet, only refactors.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, the diff in mypy_primer is unexpected.
There was no diff in the initial commit, and it appears that the diff was caused by a merge commit that should have been unrelated.</p>
<p>It seems that this also occurred in #20792 and #20806.
I don&#x27;t know the cause, but perhaps there is non-deterministic inference being made regarding <code>dataclasses.field</code> or overloading?</p>

<p>Yeah, there does seem to be something nondeterministic happening there. It&#x27;s quite annoying; if you feel like tracking it down, that would be very helpful 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I&#x27;m inclined to keep <code>Member</code> as a struct, even if it only consists of <code>inner: pub(super) inner: PlaceAndQualifiers&lt;&#x27;db&gt;</code> for now. I am quite confident that we will add other attributes to this soon.</p>
<p>But great to see that the new <code>Place</code> makes the <code>is_declared</code> flag superfluous.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for doing this! Just one comment.</p>
<p>If someone is unhappy with the newly proposed names here, we can always easily change them later. I think we should aim to get this refactor in as quick as possible, or it will collect a lot of conflicts.</p>
