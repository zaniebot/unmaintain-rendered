            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR refactors our import-tracking logic to leverage our existing logic for tracking bindings. It&#x27;s both a significant simplification, a significant improvement (as we can now track reassignments), and closes out a bunch of subtle bugs.</p>
<p>Though the AST tracks all bindings (e.g., when parsing <code>import os as foo</code>, we bind the name <code>foo</code> to a <code>BindingKind::Importation</code> that points to the <code>os</code> module), when I went to implement import tracking (e.g., to ensure that if the user references <code>List</code>, it&#x27;s actually <code>typing.List</code>), I added a parallel system specifically for this use-case.</p>
<p>That was a mistake, for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It didn&#x27;t track reassignments, so if you had <code>from typing import List</code>, but <code>List</code> was later overridden, we&#x27;d still consider any reference to <code>List</code> to be <code>typing.List</code>.</li>
<li>It required a bunch of extra logic, include complex logic to try and optimize the lookups, since it&#x27;s such a hot codepath.</li>
<li>There were a few bugs in the implementation that were just hard to correct under the existing abstractions (e.g., if you did <code>from typing import Optional as Foo</code>, then we&#x27;d treat any reference to <code>Foo</code> <em>or</em> <code>Optional</code> as <code>typing.Optional</code> (even though, in that case, <code>Optional</code> was really unbound).</li>
</ol>
<p>The new implementation goes through our existing binding tracking: when we get a reference, we find the appropriate binding given the current scope stack, and normalize it back to its original target.</p>
<p>Closes #1690.
Closes #1790.</p>
