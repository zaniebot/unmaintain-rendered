            <div class="timeline-body"><p>uff, this config file gets more and more complex 🙃 I guess this isn't the first regex in this file, but it definitely seems like the most complicated one we've added so far.</p>
<p>Could we at least add a comment here to document a bit better:</p>
<ol>
<li>What the regex matches and</li>
<li>Why we're using a custom manager here rather than using renovate's builtin GitHub Actions support</li>
</ol>
<p>I also suggest linking directly to https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/regex/ somewhere</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Am I also correct that if Renovate creates a PR to update the pin in <code>dist-workspace.toml</code>, we'll then need to checkout the Renovate PR locally and run <code>dist generate</code> before CI will pass on the PR (because otherwise the pins in <code>release.yml</code> will be out of date with the pins in <code>dist-workspace.toml</code>)? That could also be worth documenting in a comment, maybe?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should probably be less exact about the exact amount of whitespace, and the exact number of characters made up by the hash. The docs also state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The regex manager matches are done <em>per-file</em>, not per-line! This means the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> regex assertions only match the beginning and end of the entire file. If you need to match line boundaries you can use <code>(?:^|\r\n|\r|\n|$)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that means that the <code>.*</code> at the end currently will match the entirety of the rest of the <code>dist-workspace.toml</code> file, meaning that there will only ever be at most one match for any Renovate run?</p>
<pre><code class="language-suggestion">      matchStrings: [
        '&quot;(?&lt;depName&gt;actions/[^&quot;]+)&quot;\\s*=\\s*&quot;(?&lt;currentDigest&gt;[a-f0-9]{4,})&quot;\\s*#\\s*(?&lt;currentValue&gt;v[\\d\\.]+).*?\\n'
      ],

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't love the complexity that this adds to our renovate config, but I can definitely see that this in particular is annoying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Renovate updates a dependency with a missing verison comment to the next available commit, which isn't necessarily part of a release (yet).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm also not the person usually reviewing/merging these PRs, so I'm happy to defer to you if you think it's worth it!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm. That's a good point that it now still requires manually updating the <code>release.yml</code>. @Gankra is there a way we could preserve the version comment in the <code>yml</code> that cargo dist generates? That would allow us to keep the current setup but without renovate getting all confused and picking up every commit instead of only releaes-commits.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I could have us insert a comment sure -- alternatively can you just have renovate edit release.yml <em>and</em> the dist-workspace.toml?</p>
<p>...oh right the comment would be read as &quot;dirty&quot; by cargo-dist. ok yeah I can add a feature for this.</p>
