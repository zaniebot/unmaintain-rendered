            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Stacked on top of #18053. This fixes a new false positive I can see in the primer diff on that PR, and I think it's a good change to make anyway!</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This change looks good, but is there any reason it should be specific to a dynamic element? It seems like as long as the intersection is not disjoint from <code>type</code>, and we can find at least one element in it that is a valid base, we should be able to safely consider it that type and construct the base accordingly.</p>
<p>(Not saying that change needs to happen in this PR -- but the thought could maybe go into a comment, to help us out if it comes up in future.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's... an interesting thought. I'm not sure it has any practical consequences right now, because the only other &quot;atomic&quot; types we support as class bases currently are class-literal types and dynamic types. <code>&lt;dynamic type&gt; &amp; whatever</code> is handled here. <code>&lt;class literal type&gt; &amp; whatever</code> should always either simplify to <code>&lt;class literal type&gt;</code> or <code>Never</code>, since class-literal types only have a single inhabitant.</p>
<p>(We probably should allow users to inherit from objects of <code>type[Any]</code>, though, due to it <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/222">actually being an intersection</a>. And if we did that, then yes, this would have more practical consequences. I can do that in a followup. And I'll tackle this at the same time!)</p>
