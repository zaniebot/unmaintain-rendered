            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Reduce the number of completions sent to clients to reduce serialization/deserialization overhead, thereby reducing lag.</p>
<p>Serializing large responses can cause noticeable lag because serialization occurs on the server&#x27;s main thread.
Not only is serializing large responses expensive on the server, but deserializing them is equally expensive for the client.</p>
<p>This PR limits the number of completions sent to the client to at most 1k. I picked the number rather arbitrarily, and we could maybe even go as low as 100
But the serialization/deserialization cost between 100 and 1000 is minimal.</p>
<p>I also made some changes to our tracing setup, which allowed me to debug this more easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the response logging from <code>trace</code> to <code>debug</code>, it includes the end-to-end time it took to process a response (including wait time for an available worker thread and serialization)</li>
<li>Add spans to <code>all_symbols</code> and <code>workspace_symbols</code> so that tracing preserves the request information for the spawned tasks running on a worker thread (tracing now logs that <code>symbols_for_file_globals_only</code> is part of the <code>completions </code>request`)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could the LSP response please set the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionList"><code>CompletionList.isIncomplete</code> flag</a> in the response based on wether or not the list has been truncated?</p>
<p>From the LSP 3.17 documentation string for that attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This list is not complete. Further typing should result in recomputing this list.</p>
<p>Recomputed lists have all their items replaced (not appended) in the incomplete completion sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, is there any way a client could opt into getting the full list anyway?</p>
<p>I realise that my use-case is not typical (I&#x27;m using the LSP protocol to gather Python project API information) but I was kinda counting on these responses being complete ;-) If <code>isIncomplete</code> is set based on wether or not the list was truncated, I can at least programatically detect when to send more detailed queries, as checking for a length of exactly 1000 items feels icky and not very robust.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is being set regardless of the list actually being complete or not. Could it reflect wether or not the list was truncated instead?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can&#x27;t, because our current fuzzy search returns more results when you type more text, and it&#x27;s important that clients don&#x27;t cache the completion results.</p>

<p>for speed clients should be able to filter an already received completion list if the user continues typing. Servers can opt out of this using a <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionList">CompletionList</a> and mark it as isIncomplete.</p>

<p>Thanks for finding that entry, I had missed that note. So <code>isIncomplete</code> is overloaded to mean both &#x27;there can be more results&#x27; and &#x27;do not filter this list down yourself, leave that to the server&#x27;. Check!</p>
