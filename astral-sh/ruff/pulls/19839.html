            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This fixes a regression caused by the BOM handling in #19806. Most diagnostics already account for the BOM in their ranges, but those that use <code>TextRange::default</code> to mean the beginning of the file do not, causing an underflow in <code>RenderableAnnotation::new</code> when subtracting the BOM-shifted <code>snippet_start</code> from the annotation range.</p>
<p>I ran into this when trying to run benchmarks on CPython in preparation for caching work. The file <code>cpython/Lib/test/bad_coding2.py</code> was causing a crash because it had a default-range <code>I002</code> diagnostic, with a BOM.</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/7cc3f1ebe9386e77e7009bc411fc6480d3851015/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/isort/rules/add_required_imports.rs#L122-L126</p>
<p>The fix here is just to saturate to zero instead of panicking. I considered adding a <code>TextRange::saturating_sub</code> method, but I wasn't sure it was worth it for this one use. I'm happy to do that if preferred, though.</p>
<p>Saturating seemed easier than shifting the affected annotations over, but that could be another solution.</p>
<h2>Test Plan</h2>
<p>A new <code>ruff_db</code> test that reproduced the issue and manual testing against the CPython file mentioned above</p>

<p>Yep, that was my thinking. Otherwise it's a bug.</p>
