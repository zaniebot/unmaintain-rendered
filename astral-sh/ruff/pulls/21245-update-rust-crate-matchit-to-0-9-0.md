### Release Notes

<details>
<summary>ibraheemdev/matchit (matchit)</summary>

### [`v0.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit/releases/tag/v0.9.0): 0.9.0

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit/compare/v0.8.6...v0.9.0)

- Fixed a bug that caused empty routes to be ignored on insert ([#&#8203;76](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit/pull/76)).
- Tightened the rules around overlapping parameter prefixes and suffixes, where ambiguous routes were inadvertently allowed ([#&#8203;67](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit/issues/67)). See the [new conflict rules](https://redirect.github.com/ibraheemdev/matchit?tab=readme-ov-file#conflict-rules) for details.
