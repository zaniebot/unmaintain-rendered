            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Introduces a new formatter option <code>f-string-consistent-quotes</code> that leverages Python 3.12's PEP 701 to use consistent quotes inside f-string expressions rather than alternating quote styles for compatibility.</p>
<p>When enabled and targeting Python 3.12+, the formatter will use the same quote style (following the <code>quote-style</code> setting) inside f-string expressions as in the outer f-string. This produces more consistent and readable code.</p>
<p>When disabled (default) or targeting Python versions below 3.12, the formatter will continue to alternate quotes for compatibility.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for considering this PR. I'd like to clarify a few points that might help with the decision:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>This change introduces an <em>opt-in</em> configuration option that doesn't alter existing behavior by default. Users who prefer the current approach can continue using it unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The feature aligns with Ruff's existing philosophy of giving <em>users</em> control over code formatting. Just as <code>quote-style</code> lets users choose their preferred quotes globally, this option extends that same control to quotes inside f-strings. As it is, Ruff allows users to choose their quotes, yet arbitrarily dictates them in nested f-string expressions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since Python 3.12 specifically introduced this capability with PEP 701, it seems logical to provide a way for users to take advantage of it. The implementation only applies when targeting Python 3.12+, maintaining backward compatibility. Older versions of Python will one day be obsolete and alternating quotes will become vestigial and unnecessary, so this will likely need to be done eventually anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Six users have already expressed interest in this feature in the initial issue (#14118), suggesting there's demand for this level of formatting control.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What additional information would be helpful to move this forward? I'm happy to address any specific concerns about the implementation or rationale.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's mainly that I'm not sure that there's enough demand to justify an extra option. We don't have as high a bar as black on options but we still maintain a fairly high bar on new options because each option introduces the risk that people now start discussing options instead of formatting decisions.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the feedback. I understand your concern about demand, but I'd like to respectfully point out that you accepted and implemented the original feature request to make quote styles alternating (#11056) even though it had been requested by and had support from only a <em>single</em> user. This feature has been requested by <em>six</em> users already.</p>
<p>The original change to enforce alternating quotes made in 2024 was made to cater to a narrow use case - backporting to Python versions released <em>before 2022</em> - while this configuration option will benefit all current users of Python 3.12 (released two years ago already, in 2023) and all future versions. Given that Python's trajectory is clearly moving toward consistent quote handling in f-strings with PEP 701, it seems reasonable to provide users the option to follow this modern approach.</p>
<p>Additionally, this is a non-default configuration option that requires explicit opt-in, so it doesn't impact existing users or add complexity to the default experience. It simply provides flexibility for those who want to leverage Python 3.12's improved f-string capabilities.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would very much like to see this merged. I am currently postponing upgrading ruff to ^0.9 in my repo, because I do not like the alternating style. I was surprised that the option for consistent quotes was not already present when I saw the default was to alternate quotes.</p>
<p>It seems weird to not be able to opt in to something, that in my opinion should be the default behavior after python 3.11 end of life. I do not believe we should be restricted by limitations of old versions forever, and allowing the transition to happen sooner on an opt in basis will only make it smoother.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also really hope this PR gets merged. I think having a unified quote style would look much better. Right now, I can only use <code>quote-style = &quot;preserve&quot;</code>. If this PR gets merged, I will switch to <code>quote-style = &quot;single&quot;</code>. @MichaReiser</p>

<p>I think the Python official decision to introduce 'Quote reuse in f-strings' in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-701-syntactic-formalization-of-f-strings">Python 3.12</a> justifies this PR.</p>
<p>If 'Quote reuse in f-strings' really had no value, why would the Python official team introduce this syntax through <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0701/">PEP 701 – Syntactic formalization of f-strings</a>?</p>
<p>At least for me, I prefer a more unified style for f-strings, and I hope this PR gets merged soon. @charliermarsh</p>

<p>If you're worried about providing too many options, why not make this PR (f-string consistent quotes) the only choice for users of Python 3.12 and above?</p>
<p>For code that requires Python 3.12 or later, format it using a consistent quote style. For code before Python 3.12, keep the existing behavior.</p>
<p>I prefer a more unified style for f-strings, and there's <strong>no need</strong> to offer an option for the existing behavior anymore. @MichaReiser @charliermarsh @zanieb</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Change the existing behavior to f-string consistent quotes instead of adding a new option. I think this is a reasonable solution, avoiding the issue raised by @MichaReiser about providing too many options.</p>

<p>The reason it like like this is backport friendliness, see the original issue #11056. Whether it is a good enough reason to force inconsistent quotes even for people who do not care about supporting python &lt;3.12 is another question.</p>

<p>I’d argue most developers targeting 3.12+ don’t actually need their code to be backportable to pre-3.12 versions. Most are writing application code or end-user applications and have complete control over their environment, and if they are writing libraries, they are likely writing them for internal use within an organization where they can assume a minimum Python version. Even among public library authors, only some need to support older versions.</p>
<p>Given that, it might make more sense for <code>f-string-consistent-quotes</code> to be <em>enabled</em> by default, and perhaps even removed entirely as a config option. Then, those who require backport compatibility can instead rely on setting their target Python version to something below 3.12, or - if needed - the config flag could remain available for them to disable. This way, Ruff would better align with the needs of the majority while still accommodating those who need stricter backwards compatibility.</p>
