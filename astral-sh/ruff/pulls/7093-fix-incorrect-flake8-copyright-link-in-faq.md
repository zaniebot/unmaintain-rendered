# Fix incorrect flake8-copyright link in faq

---

_Pull request opened by @oliviacrain on 2023-09-03 17:52_

## Summary

One of the links to `flake8-copyright` points to the PyPI page for `flake8-comprehension`- let's make that link point to the correct page.

## Test Plan

Spun up a local instance of the docs and confirmed that the new link goes to the right page. I also did a quick spot-check to make sure the other links in that section point to the right places.
