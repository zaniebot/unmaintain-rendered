<p>I based the total number of rules on what's listed in https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify#rules (without the &quot;legacyfix&quot; and &quot;removed&quot; ones) and included the experimental rules (<code>SIM9</code>), but if you prefer not to include the experimental ones, it totals to 30 rules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Somehow I got 33 rules when I created the table <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/998">here</a> -- is the discrepancy obvious to you? Is that table missing some, or the other way around?</p>

<p>Ha, I was wondering if it was intentional or not, but since there are other plugins listed with only 1 rule (<code>autoflake</code> and <code>flake8-tidy-imports</code>, although they have way less total rules), I wasn't sure.</p>

<p>Differences I can see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SIM104</code> is in the list, and I didn't count it as it is listed as a &quot;legacyfix&quot;</li>
<li><code>SIM224</code> is in the list, but it's a placeholder for an experimental rule</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The list also doesn't include experimental rules under <code>SIM9</code> (although it's probably intended), so without the 3 extra rules, it totals to 30 (and 37 if we count the experimental ones).</p>
