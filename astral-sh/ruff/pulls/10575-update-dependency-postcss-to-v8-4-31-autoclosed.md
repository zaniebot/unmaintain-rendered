### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

#### [CVE-2023-44270](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44270)

An issue was discovered in PostCSS before 8.4.31. It affects linters using PostCSS to parse external Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). There may be `\r` discrepancies, as demonstrated by `@font-face{ font:(\r/*);}` in a rule.

This vulnerability affects linters using PostCSS to parse external untrusted CSS. An attacker can prepare CSS in such a way that it will contains parts parsed by PostCSS as a CSS comment. After processing by PostCSS, it will be included in the PostCSS output in CSS nodes (rules, properties) despite being originally included in a comment.
