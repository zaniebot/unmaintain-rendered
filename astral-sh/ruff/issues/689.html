            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I understand ruff’s primary point of comparison is flake8, but I am curious to know how it compares with pylint. This would likely help people considering migrating to ruff from pylint.</p>
<p>And maybe some inspiration could also be taken from pylint feature-wise? For instance, the use of “dev readable error codes” makes things a lot clearer when reading code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pylint does a lot of AST analysis and has lots of modules and a modular system.
It's pretty cool. I have written pylint modules in the past.</p>
<p>The problem is that it is excruciatingly slow.</p>
<p>If ruff could go towards that and stay as fast as it is ... oh boy I would be in love.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pylint has a very long list of rules. I currently use pylint but mainly stick to W/E/F rules as they catch most of interesting issues in my codebase. The more stylistic rules like formatting/variable naming/docstrings I value less.</p>
<p>I'd find most value in Error <a href="http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/all-codes">rules</a> here. Almost all of them I enable, they've caught a number of bugs, and find false positive rate pretty low. One caveat is some rules I do rely on exception lists based on known problematic modules. As an example generated-members is useful way of dealing with modules/classes that have many dynamically defined attributes and static analysis would otherwise produce a lot of false positives.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should add a bunch of these! I'd probably start with the <code>E</code> rules, though there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in the <code>W</code> category. I can do one or two to add least add Pylint as a category.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(I'm a pylint maintainer). One way to know if it's easy to implement a pylint rule is to check the confidence used when raising a message. If there's no inference (I.E. the check is static and could be done without astroid's inference capability) then the confidence is going to be HIGH in <code>add_message</code>.  For example <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/aeaa16d4af44abbf263643a63f6df8298802c701/pylint/extensions/for_any_all.py#L57"><code>consider-using-any-or-all&quot;</code> does not use inference</a> but some <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/aeaa16d4af44abbf263643a63f6df8298802c701/pylint/checkers/refactoring/implicit_booleaness_checker.py#L123">corner cases of <code>use-implicit-booleaness-not-len</code> do</a>.</p>
<p>The confidence is not defined everywhere though, this is an ongoing effort.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there any intention of respecting pylint's annotations allowing errors to be disabled for a certain scope?</p>
<p>One impediment to switching over is the large number of pylint annotations which immediately throw errors. e.g. <code># pylint: disable=bare-except</code>.</p>
<p>If ruff supported more pylint rules this would not be so important, as a single regex replacement over the codebase would allow migration. However in the interim we need to continue to use pylint in pre-commit hooks, but would like to enable ruff in developers' IDEs.</p>

<p>A Change in Pydantic design might also have helped, but pylint catching these is a game-changer for large classes.</p>

<p>The other benefit of pylint for me here is the IDE integration with VSCode. I Still have not made time to check this in my PyCharm, but... yeah, I like pylint for at-least this reason.</p>

<p>This thread is my first search result for &quot;ruff pylint parity&quot;, and I didn't see your comment about moving to #970 until I was a few hours into migrating. I imagine others might have the same issue (especially if they're doing a casual look to see if they can get rid of pylint yet.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, if a search brought you to this issue:
<strong>#970 is the current issue with the actual checklist of which rules have been implemented</strong>. (There's been much more progress since this issue was closed. Big thanks to @charliermarsh and the rest of the ruff contributors for all the great work!)</p>

I'd love to have a full list of rules that I can disable in pylint cause it's very very slow. I'm working on a refactor that touches many python files (50+) and the pylint commit-hook is killing me, like it takes 5+ minutes to run :( . Now that I got a taste of that nice ruff speed I'm hooked.</p>
<p>I'm hoping if I can disable the redundant rules on the pylint side, the engine will run that much faster...</p>
