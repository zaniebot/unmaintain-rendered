            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given a string concatenation, the formatter currently determines the quote style for each segment individually, which can result in different segments using different quote styles.</p>
<p>I believe this is consistent with Black, but I don't know that it's the right decision... For example, it means that if you move content between the segments, you may have to change quotes.</p>
<p>We explicitly avoid this in our flake8-quotes rule (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2400). Let's at least consider doing the same here.</p>

<p>To clarify: Do you mean our behavior is consistent with Black or using a single quote style for an entire string is consistent with black?</p>
<p>I prefer keeping it as is, at least for now, to ease adoption coming from black.</p>
