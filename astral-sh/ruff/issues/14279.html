            <div class="timeline-body"><p>red-knot infers the following types for the following comparisons:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import reveal_type

def int_instance() -&gt; int:
    return 42

reveal_type(&quot;foo&quot; == &quot;bar&quot;)                                       # Literal[False]
reveal_type((&quot;foo&quot;,) == (&quot;bar&quot;,))                                 # Literal[False]
reveal_type((4, &quot;foo&quot;) == (4, &quot;bar&quot;))                             # Literal[False]
reveal_type((int_instance(), &quot;foo&quot;) == (int_instance(), &quot;bar&quot;))   # bool
</code></pre>
<p>The last one should also be inferred as <code>Literal[False]</code>, just like the first three. This is because two objects of types <code>Literal[&quot;foo&quot;]</code> and <code>Literal[&quot;bar&quot;]</code> respectively will never compare equal to each other. By the same token, two 2-element tuples where the second elements are of type <code>Literal[&quot;foo&quot;]</code> and <code>Literal[&quot;bar&quot;]</code> respectively will never compare equal, regardless of what their first element is.</p>
<p>I discovered this while working on https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14244. Ideally, this comparison would be inferred as <code>Literal[False]</code>, since <code>sys.version_info[3]</code> should be inferred by red-knot as being of type <code>Literal[&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;candidate&quot;, &quot;final&quot;]</code>, and objects with that type never compare equal to the string <code>&quot;finallllllll&quot;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import sys
from typing import reveal_type

reveal_type(sys.version_info == (3, 8, 1, &quot;finallllllll&quot;, 0))
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense! Additionally, we should handle tuples of different lengths.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">reveal_type((int_instance(),) == (int_instance(), &quot;bar&quot;))   # revealed: bool
</code></pre>
<p>I think it might be a simple fix! If no other opinions come up, I’ll go ahead and work on it :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An issue with error propagation suddenly came to mind. When tuple comparison was initially implemented, only literal comparison was supported, so there was no opportunity to properly test error propagation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">(int_instance(), &quot;test&quot;) &lt; (int_instance(), 3)
</code></pre>
<p>Since there’s a possibility of an unsupported operation error here, a diagnostic should be triggered. However, it currently isn’t, as the comparison stops immediately when <code>Truthness::Ambiguous</code> occurs during lexicographic comparison.</p>
