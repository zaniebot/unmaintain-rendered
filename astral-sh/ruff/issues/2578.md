# ruff --statistics could show fixable state

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-02-05 10:36_

ruff now shows fixable items:
```PIE790 [*] Unnecessary `pass` statement```

ruff --statistics just shows:
```1\tPIE790\tUnnecessary `pass` statement```

→ the information would be nice as well:

maybe like this?:

for fixable items:
```1\tPIE790\t[*]\tUnnecessary `pass` statement```
for unfixable items:
```1\tPIE790\t[]\tUnnecessary `pass` statement```
