Can you expand the summary by what you expect us to do? I'm asking because I don't know what OG is and would need to google what an unfurl image is ;)

OG stands for OpenGraph. We should have custom OpenGraph images that appear when you link to the docs on Twitter, Slack, etc. Today, if you link to the docs in Discord or wherever else, we show the URL with no such preview image.
