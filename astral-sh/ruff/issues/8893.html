<pre><code>def foo():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Docstring
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Here we go
    if x:

        # This is also now fine
        a = 123

    else:
        # But not necessary
        a = 123
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how black now allows empty lines before the comments. Ruff seems to support this sometimes.</p>
<p>Goal: Implement the new formatting behind the preview flag and import the Black tests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see the motivation behind this change but it can lead to unintentional deviations that outweigh the benefit of the change.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s say you start with</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Docstring
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Here we go
    if x:
		if no_longer_needed:
			print(&quot;Some complex statements&quot;)

        # This is also now fine
        a = 123
</code></pre>
<p>And you refactor the code to remove the <code>no_longer_needed</code> branch</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Docstring
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Here we go
    if x:

        # This is also now fine
        a = 123
</code></pre>
<p>and you now hit save. Without this change, the comment and <code>a = 123</code> gets moved directly under the <code>if x:</code> condition which is what I would expect and gives us consistent formatting.</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Docstring
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Here we go
    if x:
        # This is also now fine
        a = 123
</code></pre>
<p>This would no longer happen if we implement the change. Instead, I have to remove the line above the comment manually. While I see that being able to make an exception might help with readability in few cases, removing the new line is the desired behavior in most cases.</p>
<p>I opened <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4121">an issue in the Black repository</a> to share our feedback with them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thanks for building Ruff!</p>
<p>Given that Black is allowing newlines after a block opening line in the 2024 preview style, based on <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4043">psf/black#4043</a>, does Ruff plan to reopen this issue and conform to Black&#x27;s intended style?</p>
<p>Personally, I place a high premium on code readability, and while I don&#x27;t always add blank lines after a block opening line, it can often make the code a lot clearer, as demonstrated here: <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/902">psf/black#902</a>#issuecomment-1425713025</p>
<p>I would love to see this reopened and addressed. Thanks for considering!</p>
<p>note: I prefer not to comment on closed issues, but this seems like the most appropriate place to comment. Please let me know if there&#x27;s a better way to provide feedback :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hy @vaughnkoch</p>
<p>We share your concern for readability. That&#x27;s the main purpose of a code formatter, isn&#x27;t it.</p>
<p>We have some concerns with the preview style as it is defined by black and decided not to ship it as part of Ruff&#x27;s upcoming new stable style (which this issue is tracking). It doesn&#x27;t mean we don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s just that we aren&#x27;t convinced by the heuristic and want to avoid changing styles too often.</p>
<p>My personal take on Black&#x27;s blank line rules is that they&#x27;re too opinionated and I could see it as an option that we explore with simpler blank line rules in the future, but that requires taking a holistic look at all of Ruff&#x27;s/Black&#x27;s blank line rules and find ways to simplify them.</p>
<p>I recommend opening a new issue that we can use for future style discussions.</p>
