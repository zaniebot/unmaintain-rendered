            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Instead of building a CFG and lazily traversing it backwards whenever we resolve types, we could instead build use-def links directly up-front, reducing the work to be done in type resolution.</p>
<p>The challenge here is type narrowing. Each use-def link would also need to be associated with a list of potential narrowing effects to be applied in type resolution. And we would need to represent these potential narrowing effects in a way that doesn't depend on resolving types in e.g. an <code>if</code> test up-front (resolving types can always cross modules, and we want to ensure that only happens lazily.) But this should be possible; it should be no different than how we would represent the same narrowing effect as a node in the CFG.</p>
<p>This would be pretty similar to transforming to an SSA representation, with the addition of narrowing-effects associated with each use.</p>
