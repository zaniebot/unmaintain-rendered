# D104: ignore empty files

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2025-08-01 23:22_

`D104 Missing docstring in public package` should ignore empty files like `__init__.py`.

This might need to be a configuration option because even an empty `__init__.py` is a package that, depending on preference, should be documented.
