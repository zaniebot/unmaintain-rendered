# Report unmatched range suppression comments

---

_Issue opened by @amyreese on 2025-12-09 20:38_

### Summary

Create a new RUF10x rule to report unmatched range suppression comments (eg, `disable` without a matching `enable`), potentially with autofix to add matching comment at the end of the first comment's scope/indent.
