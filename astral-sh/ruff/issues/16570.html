            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A small question/discussion point (relevant as-of ruff 0.9.10 preview). Pertains to how <code>reimplemented-starmap</code> <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/reimplemented-starmap/">FURB140</a> recommends code that interacts less well with certain static type checkers.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import itertools


def moo(x: int, y: str) -&gt; str:
    return f&quot;{x} {y}&quot;


x = [(1, &quot;a&quot;), (2, &quot;b&quot;)]
y = [(1, &quot;a&quot;, False), (2, &quot;b&quot;, False)]


moo_x1 = list(itertools.starmap(moo, x))
moo_y1 = list(itertools.starmap(moo, y))  # (no pyright error)

moo_x2 = [moo(a, b) for a, b in x]
moo_y2 = [moo(a, b) for a, b in y]  # ERROR: Expression with type &quot;tuple[int, str, bool]&quot; cannot be assigned...
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The creation of <code>moo_y1</code> and <code>moo_y2</code> both fail (expectedly) at runtime.</li>
<li>pyright 1.1.396 spots the problem with the comprehension. But with starmap pyright can't analyse it.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>reimplemented-starmap</code> will want to change the second forms (using the comprehensions) to the first (with starmap). We currently use pyright for static analysis, so from <em>our</em> perspective this suggested change arguably results in more fragile, less verified, code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should we say that FURB140 is good, and that the static type checker needs to be improved? And that it could/should in theory catch this?</li>
<li>Is this something that should be discussed upstream in <code>refurb</code>? e.g. since ruff's job is just to mirror the rule that's implemented there?</li>
</ul>
<p>I've not previously been inclined to disable a ruff rule because I felt that applying it could result in more fragile code. Hence I thought I'd open this up for discussion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this issue. This is very important feedback and getting it before we stabilize rules is very valuable!</p>
<p>@carljm sorry for pulling you in. Do you know if this is a common limitation or more likely to be specific to pyright?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having a peek at the <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/5c85697da7c24bb70d72e9883004f2974a3b7e46/stdlib/itertools.pyi#L105C7-L108">typeshed annotations for starmap</a> suggests that the argument types for the callable won't be constrained. (Not sure if other tools might provide more constrained annotations for the stdlib though)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I doubt that any tools provide special-cased handling of <code>starmap</code>, so I suspect that whatever the typeshed annotations specify is how tools will behave.</p>
<p>It looks like the typeshed annotation of starmap could be improved using <code>TypeVarTuple</code> sufficiently to catch this case? Not entirely sure without trying it out.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Toying around with this a little:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class StarMap[T]:
    @overload
    def __init__[*Ts](
        self, function: Callable[[*Ts], T], iterable: Iterable[tuple[*Ts]]
    ) -&gt; None: ...
    @overload
    def __init__(
        self, function: Callable[..., T], iterable: Iterable[Iterable[Any]]
    ) -&gt; None: ...
    def __init__(
        self, function: Callable[..., T], iterable: Iterable[Iterable[Any]]
    ) -&gt; None:
        self._starmap = itertools.starmap(function, iterable)

    def __iter__(self) -&gt; Self:
        self._starmap.__iter__()
        return self

    def __next__(self) -&gt; T:
        return self._starmap.__next__()
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>the first overload is a more specific one using a <code>TypeVarTuple</code></li>
<li>we have to keep the <code>Iterable[Iterable[Any]]</code> case too, so as to support e.g. <code>starmap(moo, [[1, &quot;a&quot;], [2, &quot;b&quot;]]</code> where the type system doesn't know about the elements</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'knowably bad' case won't match the new overload, but will still match the second. I'm not sure if there's a way to have the extra constraint without disallowing other statically-unknown but valid uses!</p>
