Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

<p>I'm using ruff with the following pre-commit. My goal is to have sorted imports (I001) and unused ones are removed (F401).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    # Ruff version.
    rev: v0.3.5
    hooks:
      # Run the linter.
      - id: ruff
        # --select I sorts imports
        args: [ --fix, --select, I  ]
      # Run the formatter.
      - id: ruff-format
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>args: [ --fix, --select, I  ]</code> it sorts the imports, but it doesn't remove unused ones. With <code>args: [ --fix ]</code> it doesn't sort, but removed unused imports.</p>
<p>Is this intended behavior? And is there a way to get both to work?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can change your <code>--select</code> to <code>--extend-select</code>. Otherwise, you're overwriting the default set of enabled rules (which includes <code>F401</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks that worked!</p>
<p>Maybe an idea to put a note about this behavior in the documentation pages of I001 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unsorted-imports/ and F401 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-import/?</p>
<p>I can open a PR if you want.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This behavior actually isn't specific to those rules, it applies to enabling / selecting rules in general! There's some documentation on it here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#rule-selection.</p>
