            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i&#x27;m working in a large, public python codebase that lints using ruff.</p>
<p>I have a general <em>feeling</em> that this codebase has massive overuse of argument defaults in methods and I would love to lint for this. This happens in a couple of different ways-</p>
<ul>
<li>a non-public function has many arguments with default values, however it is never called without fully-specifying the default values anywhere</li>
<li>functions that repeatedly delegate to lower-level functions, but repeat the default arguments redundantly at every level in the hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>it&#x27;s the second case here that causes the biggest headaches in this particular codebase. The function signatures are very noisy. Also (in my case) the default value is almost always <code>None</code>, and it takes some serious archaeology to try and figure out what it means to leave out any particular arg (<code>None</code> is often semantically different to <code>not None</code>).</p>
<p>I have no idea whether this type of lint is possible using this library. You&#x27;d have to collect every non-public function with default valued args, and compare them to each of their call-sites to determine whether the arg defaults are ever used or not. Or something.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is out-of-scope <em>right now</em> because we don&#x27;t do cross-file checks. That is, if you define a function in one file, we don&#x27;t have a way to pick up its signature when linting files that import it.</p>
<p>I want to get to that in the future, but the model right now is single-file oriented.</p>

<p>I wondered about that. Fair enough</p>

<p>you could still implement this in a limited capacity today. This could still apply to any function which is private to a single file, has default arguments, and those defaults are never used.</p>
<p>function visibility would be</p>
<ul>
<li>private if a leading underscore (and no <code>__all__</code>)</li>
<li>public if no leading underscore (and no <code>__all__</code>)</li>
<li>private if not in <code>__all__</code> (if present)</li>
</ul>
<p>you&#x27;d miss most cases of course, but you&#x27;d have the logic in place</p>
