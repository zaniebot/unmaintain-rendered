            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I want to have a feature to write <code># TODO:</code> comments with deadlines.<br />
Something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">s = &quot;1&quot;  # TODO(&lt;=30.03.2025): rewrite to int
</code></pre>
<p>And if today date is 01.04.2025, then in next <code>ruff check</code> i want to see an error like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Today is 01.04.2025 you need to fix this!
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see the use case for this but I feel hesitant about adding this as a feature. It would be the first rule where ruff would suddenly fails even when you didn't make any changes to your project files (content or metadata). It's also not clear what a user would do in this situation because fixing a TODO often takes a fair bit of time. My most likely action would be to bump the TODO date.</p>

<p>if it will be released as a separate rule (e.g. <code>FIX005</code>), then probably:</p>
<ul>
<li>ignore this rule.<br />
(do you think this will be inconvenient?)</li>
<li>update dates/fix todos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<p>I think this is a matter of habit. user should set a correct deadline for completing code changes</p>
<p>also, I found that ESLint has a plugin with similar functionality: https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/main/docs/rules/expiring-todo-comments.md</p>

<p>normally me, always postpone the deadlines dates :D</p>

<p>It's also important to mention that if one didn't make any changes since the last run, Ruff may also <em>not</em> report anything later due to the cache.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's an excellent point. It breaks many assumptions of how ruff works</p>
