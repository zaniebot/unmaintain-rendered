Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>In a pycodestyle tracking issue https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402 the rule for <code>W391</code> is checked but this does not exist in the ruff codebase. In fact there is a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402#issuecomment-1855323380">comment noting this</a>. Can this be unchecked so the tracking and expectations is right and, ultimately, tackled?</p>
