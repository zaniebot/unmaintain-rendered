            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank for such a cool tool.
I am currently working with a huge monolithic old code base. I am planning to use a linter like ruff with only new code, so I don't have old errors appearing in thr console. It is possible to create a baseline so only the new code gets lint?</p>

<p>I think this is a duplicate of #1149. Unfortunately, it's not something we support right now -- maybe some day. The only alternatives you would have are (1) running <code>ruff check --add-noqa /path/to/src</code> to automatically add suppression comments to existing violations, or (2) only enabling a subset of checks for now, and fixing all violations for that subset.</p>
