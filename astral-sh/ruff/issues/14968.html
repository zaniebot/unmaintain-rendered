            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a follow up to #14796: attempting to assign a private function parameter still gets flagged in Ruff v0.8.3 (<a href="https://play.ruff.rs/e233076b-9184-492f-aa36-94306356bf12">playground</a>)</p>
<p>My primary use case for private parameters is when I need to track what I've seen when recursing through a potentially circular graph:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Node:

    connected: list[Node]

    def recurse(self, *, _seen: set[Node] | None = None):
        if _seen is None:
            _seen = set()  # Local dummy variable `_seen` is accessed (RUF052)
        elif self in _seen:
            return
        _seen.add(self)
        for other in self.connected:
            other.recurse(_seen=_seen)
</code></pre>
<p>In most cases, I wouldn't want the caller to have to seed the <code>_seen</code> param or even know that it exists, as imo, that's just an implementation detail.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Incidentally, in this example the rule is <em>not</em> complaining about the binding for the function parameter, but rather about the rebinding in the if-statement. So I think we need to add some logic that skips if the offending binding is a re-binding of a private parameter declaration.</p>
<p>Unrelated - would it be more helpful if the diagnostic pointed to the problematic <em>use</em> rather than the <em>binding</em>?</p>

<p>Yeah on 0.8.2 the rule flagged both the function definition and the reassignment in the body separately, so that seems like the appropriate solution.</p>

<p>That might just flip it to error on <code>_seen.add(self)</code> and, if there's a lot of usages in the same function, could output a lot of messages</p>
