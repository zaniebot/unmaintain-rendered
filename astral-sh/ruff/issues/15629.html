            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>contextlib.contextmanager</code> is dangerous because its <code>__exit__</code> won't get run if an exception is raised, which is rarely what you want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def foo():
    print('starting')
    yield
    print('ending')

with foo():
    raise Exception
</code></pre>
<p>it would be nice if ruff had a rule to enforce <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> on these types of context managers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def foo():
    print('starting')
    try:
        yield
    finally:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>we would need to make sure to also support context managers that delegate to other context managers. E.g. the <code>g()</code> function definition is fine here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; from contextlib import contextmanager
&gt;&gt;&gt; @contextmanager
... def f():
...     try:
...         print('hi')
...         yield
...     finally:
...         print('bye')
...         
&gt;&gt;&gt; @contextmanager
... def g():
...     print('hiiiii')
...     with f():
...         yield
...         
&gt;&gt;&gt; with g():
...     raise Exception
...     
hiiiii
hi
bye

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>isn't that still unsafe if you have anything after the <code>yield</code> statement in <code>g</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@contextmanager
def g():
    print(&quot;hiiiii&quot;)
    with f():
        yield
        print(&quot;byeee&quot;)  # doesn't run
    print(&quot;byeee2&quot;)  # neither does this
</code></pre>
<p>i guess the rule can just not report on context managers where <code>yield</code> is the last statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@contextmanager
def g():
    print(&quot;hiiiii&quot;)
    with f():
        yield # no error
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">@contextmanager
def f():
    print(&quot;hi&quot;)
    yield # no error
</code></pre>
<p>but the last example probably isn't very common</p>

<p>yes, fair point</p>

<p>sure, that seems like a reasonable way to handle this.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall this seems like a reasonable rule to me, since you're right that this is easy to get wrong, and it's never <em>incorrect</em> to put the <code>yield</code> inside a <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> guard. Some might find it a little strict/noisy, since in some cases it isn't actually necessary to do the post-<code>yield</code> cleanup in the event that an exception is terminating the current scope's execution. But I do agree that it is strictly more correct to make sure that you always use <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> in a <code>@contextmanager</code>-decorated function or method.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Should we wait until after rule categorization with adding this rule, considering that it is rather noisy/strict.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd take a stab at this one if/when you confirm it should be taken.</p>
<p>PS. very helpful rule for pytest fixtures that ensures no side-effects. Been bitten more than once due to the lack of try-finally</p>
