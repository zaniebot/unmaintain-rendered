# Add a cli option to force colored output

---

_@lypwig_

It can be required to force the output to be colored.

I know there is [an environment variable](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-can-i-disableforce-ruffs-color-output) for that, but it's not so practical and [might be tricky](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet/issues/351#issuecomment-3767642134) in some cases.

So it can be interesting to have a `--color` cli option [like in ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/reference/cli/#ty-check--color).

Wow, I'm very surprised that Ruff doesn't have this option. We should add it.
