# Implement A003, A004, A006 (flake8-builtins)

---

_Issue opened by @nkakouros on 2024-07-27 07:10_

[`flake8-builtins`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-builtins/#rules) has added 3 new rules since A001-003 where implemented in ruff:

- A004: An import statement is shadowing a Python builtin.
- A005: A module is shadowing a Python builtin module (e.g: logging or socket)
- A006: A lambda argument is shadowing a Python builtin.
