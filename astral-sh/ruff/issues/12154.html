<p>Hey, guys,</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if ruff could detect exposed API keys. This is a pretty common security vulnerability. However, it is not included as part of flake8-bandit, probably because it would require quite a bit of effort to make sure that the api keys regexes are up to date. But, I still believe this is a pretty useful rule.</p>
<p>I can implement a rule like this, for example in a similar fashion to <a href="https://github.com/sdushantha/dora/blob/main/dora/db/data.json">this project</a>, with a neat json/yaml/toml file, that would include all the api key regex that we are detecting. But, while I can promise support for this over the next year or so, I am obviously going to stop supporting it at some point: new apis are appearing every second, and making changes for all of them for the rest of my life is not something I would want to do.</p>
<p>I still believe in usability of such a rule, even if maintenance for it would be dropped. I would expect that half of the regexes would rot (become invalid) over the course of 5 years, which is quite quickly, but still, it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>So, if you believe this is a nice and useful rule, what would be the steps I shall take before making a PR into ruff? Currently, the most relevant source I found about it is this <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/issues/443">issue</a>, which seems abandoned, so I might actually implement it PyCQA. But then the route to get it into ruff through bandit is pretty long: bandit -&gt; flake8-bandit -&gt; ruff, so I wonder if there is any fast-track way to do it.</p>
