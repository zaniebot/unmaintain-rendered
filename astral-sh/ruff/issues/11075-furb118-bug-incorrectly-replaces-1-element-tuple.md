Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

There is a bad fixit generated by ruff for FURB118 with operator.itemgetter().

It tries to replace this line:
```python
            return lambda x: (x[index],)
```
with this line
```python
            return operator.itemgetter(index)
```
However, these are not equivalent, in the first instance, the code will return a 1 element tuple, while in the second one, it will just return that element.
