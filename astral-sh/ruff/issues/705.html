            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just came to ask for this... I know I said I didn't have a preference, but adding Ruff to FastAPI I just realized I do. 😅</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;import as&quot; I have are just to re-export things from other places, so that mypy and PyRight can know they are available, without having to deal with <code>__all__</code> that is much more error prone (strings referring to code can get obsolete and out of sync easily).</p>
<p>And having those &quot;import as&quot; in their own line helps me see more explicitly what are the things that I'm re-exporting and don't get lost among the things I'm just importing to use internally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah makes sense! Will change this. (There’s maybe a case to be made that “from a import b as b” and “from a import b as c” should get different treatment, but probably worth just being drop-in compatible with isort at this point.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>@charliermarsh is there an option for combining <code>as</code> imports available? It doesn't seem to based on the documentation and the PR that closed this issue but I'm finding that surprising considering that you said you prefer it :thinking:
For what it's worth, I also prefer it and it's the only discrepancy from the default <code>black</code> profile in all projects where I have isort set up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Jackenmen - Yeah I ended up changing the default behavior and didn't think it was worth making it configurable, but I can probably support it. Will take a look...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Jackenmen - I've implemented it here: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1022. Will go out shortly. Can you give it a try and let me know if it matches your expectation?</p>
