            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just came to ask for this... I know I said I didn&#x27;t have a preference, but adding Ruff to FastAPI I just realized I do. 😅</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;import as&quot; I have are just to re-export things from other places, so that mypy and PyRight can know they are available, without having to deal with <code>__all__</code> that is much more error prone (strings referring to code can get obsolete and out of sync easily).</p>
<p>And having those &quot;import as&quot; in their own line helps me see more explicitly what are the things that I&#x27;m re-exporting and don&#x27;t get lost among the things I&#x27;m just importing to use internally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah makes sense! Will change this. (There’s maybe a case to be made that “from a import b as b” and “from a import b as c” should get different treatment, but probably worth just being drop-in compatible with isort at this point.)</p>

<p>@charliermarsh is there an option for combining <code>as</code> imports available? It doesn&#x27;t seem to based on the documentation and the PR that closed this issue but I&#x27;m finding that surprising considering that you said you prefer it :thinking:
For what it&#x27;s worth, I also prefer it and it&#x27;s the only discrepancy from the default <code>black</code> profile in all projects where I have isort set up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Jackenmen - Yeah I ended up changing the default behavior and didn&#x27;t think it was worth making it configurable, but I can probably support it. Will take a look...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Jackenmen - I&#x27;ve implemented it here: <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1022">charliermarsh/ruff#1022</a>. Will go out shortly. Can you give it a try and let me know if it matches your expectation?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It appears to work as I expect, checked first on one made-up example and then on two isorted codebases, thanks!</p>
