# How to get score from ruff, similar to pylint score?

_Issue opened by @fhg-isi on 2024-12-23 15:32_

Could you please provide a score feature, similar to pylint... if it does not exist yet?

Hi @fhg-isi 

Thanks for cross-posting. 

Ruff doesn't have a score system. It isn't about rating your code but helping you to be more productive when writing Python. That's why everyone should enable the rules that are useful for them and make them more productive.

Thank you for clarification. I would like to switch from pylint to ruff and still show a linting score as badge. 
As a workaround, I'll show if the lint workflow has failed or not.
