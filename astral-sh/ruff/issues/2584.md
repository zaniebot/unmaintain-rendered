# SLF001 triggered when using a private static method within the class

```py
class A:
    def test(self):
        return A._static_but_private()  # SLF001

    @staticmethod
    def _static_but_private():
        return 0
```
It might be nice to allow the above.

This likely wouldn't be possible without type checking support in ruff?

You can use `self._static_but_private()` instead of `A._static_but_private()`.

We can _probably_ support this, because we know `A` is bound to the current class there.

That works for me. Feel free to close the issue.
