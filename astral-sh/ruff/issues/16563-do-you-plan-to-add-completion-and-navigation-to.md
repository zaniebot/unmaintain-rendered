### Question

Hello,
Was reading your ruff server doc, do you plan to add code completion and navigation inside ruff server so we could ditch pyright or jedi and use ruff server only ?

### Version

Hi @ginolegigot 

We are working on a standalone type checker that will support completion and code navigation. How and when we'll bring this feature to Ruff is something we're still trying to figure out. 

Our goal is to ship a first alpha/beta later this year and maybe a stable version by the end of the year and you can follow its development by filtering issues by the *red knot* label.
