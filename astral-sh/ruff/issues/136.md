# pre-commit hook does not consider configuration in pyproject.toml.

_Issue opened by @amirnaeimi on 2022-09-09 21:51_

I have tested pre-commit hook and it works fine but when I tried to implement a new configuration in ```pyproject.toml```, I realized it does not consider the configuration. 
```
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 200
ignore = ['E501', 'F841']
```
I still get the error E501 even though I have ignored it.

Thanks! Are there pyproject files in any of the subdirectories that are being linted?

Nope :) it's in root project!

I think this may have been solved by some of the recent fixes to pathing. Please let me know if you continue to see it.
