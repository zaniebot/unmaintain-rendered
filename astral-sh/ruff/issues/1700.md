# Feature Request: Please support isort add_imports option

---

_Issue opened by @nefrob on 2023-01-06 23:55_

With `isort` you can auto import things, i.e. in the `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.isort]
add_imports = "from __future__ import annotations"
```

This is a feature request for the same functionality in `ruff`

```toml
[tool.ruff.isort]
add_imports = "from __future__ import annotations"

Makes sense. Are there valid use-cases here beyond future imports? Most of the [examples](https://cs.github.com/?q=add_imports%20language%3ATOML&scopeName=All%20repos&scope=) I see are related to future imports.

(I don't know if this question really affects implementation, but I figured it was worth asking.)

Future imports seems like the most common use case. If `ruff` supports the `flake` `--force-future-annotations` option @danieleades mentioned above that would likely be sufficient as an alternative.

Cool. The only hard part here is figuring out where to put the import.

Above all the other imports, but below any module-level docs. Right?

Yes! (The rules are clear, I more meant, from the code perspective, ensuring we put them in a reasonable place even if you don't have import-sorting enabled.)
