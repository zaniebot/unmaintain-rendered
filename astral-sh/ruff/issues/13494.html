Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).

<p>It would be nice if ruff supported these extra tryceratops checks:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>TRY006</code> makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I fear that<code>TRY005</code> is blocked by #1774 because it's a very specific rule that probably doesn't make sense for most projects. However, we have quiet a few users that use Ruff with <code>--select ALL</code>.</p>

<p>but what is the issue with that? Not needed rule can be added to <code>ignore</code> or <code>per-file-ignores</code> config sections. I would expect it's part of ruff (pre-commit hook) upgrade process.</p>
