            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p><strong>Context:</strong>
My intention is to write a script to update the code of some python modules.</p>
<p>(for illustration: we currently have a workflow where, when updating fields in our database, we have to manually update both a schema file <em>and</em> the model classes in some python modules; I want to write a utility which updates the existing python classes based on the list of columns in the schema file)</p>
<p>I have a poc, written in python, which sort of works, using the standard python <code>ast</code> module.
One limitation of <code>ast</code>, though, it that it does not preserve comments in the generated ast for a python module, which makes it cumbersome for my use case.</p>
<p><strong>My goal:</strong>
So I am looking for another library, which would allow me to parse, update and reformat a python module.</p>
<p>Ideally, this library should be usable directly in python.</p>
<p><strong>My question:</strong>
Is the python parser used in ruff published as a separate python module ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We don't currently have a Python API for any of our crates (or actually publish the Rust crates to crates.io). I think <a href="https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST">LibCST</a> might be helpful, though. We use it for some of our fixes.</p>
<p>@amyreese might also have some suggestions</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I second the recommendation for using LibCST. It has a parser written in Rust, so it's currently the fastest full CST usable from Python, and it includes its own <a href="https://libcst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/codemods_tutorial.html">&quot;codemod&quot; mechanisms</a> for scripting transformations across entire repositories. The Python API is quite nice, with <a href="https://libcst.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">good documentation</a> and an <a href="https://libcst.me/">online playground</a> if you want to explore the CST for a bit of code.</p>
