            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Very tall ask considering I don&#x27;t see how to do this without depending on <code>mypy</code> but wanted to at least float the suggestion.</p>
<p>Similar to how useless <code># noqa</code> directives are removed by <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#ruff-specific-rules-ruf"><code>RUF100</code></a>, it would be cool to auto-remove <code># type: ignore</code> on lines that no longer issue a <code>mypy</code> error.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@janosh In case you didn&#x27;t know, <code>mypy</code> can at least warn you when this happens (but doesn&#x27;t autofix it for you):

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@stinodego Thanks for bringing that up, should have mentioned it myself. I&#x27;m already using that flag. <code>mypy</code> is just painfully slow so if <code>ruff</code> could do it, would be a big QoL improvement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I would like this feature, I think it is out of scope for ruff:</p>
<ul>
<li>per <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#compatibility-with-other-uses-of-function-annotations">PEP 484</a> <code>typing: ignore</code> is not mypy-specific but intended for all type checkers (I assume ruff doesn&#x27;t want to implement all type checkers)</li>
<li>mypy/pyright/... and the python type system are still changing, does ruff really want to keep up with this (sounds like a lot of work for little benefit given that type checkers themselves have this check already)? It would also mean having to know the version of mypy and reading its config file to know which rules are used.</li>
</ul>
