Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Today I found the following code:
<code>self.frame_buffer = deque([], self.frame_buffer_size)</code></p>
<p>Which, to my understanding, should be the same as
<code>self.frame_buffer = deque(maxlen=self.frame_buffer_size)</code>
(but w/o an extra empty literal, be it a list, tuple, set, etc)</p>
<p>Same with <code>x = deque([])</code>/<code>x = deque(())</code> --&gt; <code>x = deque()</code></p>
<p>There may be more collection types for which this idea applies.</p>
<p>I think this could be enforced by a linting rule.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. Actually any empty iterable if we really wanna be thorough.
But given there's already rules to cover replacing empty iterable calls by literals: At least any empty literal (<code>deque({})</code> is probably not common, but imo may as well cover it).</p>
