            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As red-knot project going to alpha state, opened this discussion to make decision about naming of it.</p>
<p>Despite shared structures between Ruff and red-knot, it seems they're going to be separated apps (at least for alpha and beta releases) so it deserves to have a good name.</p>
<p>Here is my personal suggestion:</p>
<h3><code>pyte</code></h3>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>short: it's 4 length word as same as <code>ruff</code> and <code>knot</code>.</li>
<li>started with <code>pyt</code> which is half of with <code>python</code> word.</li>
<li>inspired by <code>type</code> world by in-placing t with p.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's already reserved in Pypi.</li>
<li>it can be multiple pronounced: <em>pait</em> OR <em>peet</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This discussion created to gather more ideas, drop your suggestions about other names.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does it need a separate name? The ruff linter (ruff check) and ruff formatter (ruff format) don't. Would the command be something like &quot;ruff typecheck&quot;? Or it could be integrated into &quot;ruff check&quot; with new categories of lint error for type issues?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like to have it as subcommand of ruff too, but as of current state we have executable called <code>knot</code> which has its own separated cli, configuration, lsp, diagnostics, playground, etc. So, I guess that's going to keep its current state in alpha and beta releases too.</p>
