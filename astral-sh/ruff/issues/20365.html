            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>A while ago ruff added a message output validating things worked. There were conversations about adding a files count. Is there any plan for this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be supportive of this change. It looks like the tracking issues and PRs have all been closed, so I don't think there is any work ongoing. As pointed out in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10424 we also report the number of files checked in <code>ruff format</code>, so this would be more consistent too.</p>
