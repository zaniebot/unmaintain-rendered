            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's very nice when there is a quick link from the playground to the docs, as I often open the playground first to test something, and then want to visit the docs to confirm the behavior.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://black.vercel.app/">black playground</a> clicking on the &quot;Black&quot; in the top left takes you directly to the docs.
In the <a href="https://basedpyright.com/">basedpyright playground</a> there is a clickable element in the top left to take you directly to the docs.</p>
<p>It would be nice if clicking on the RUFF in the top left took you to the docs/there was a docs link somewhere on the page.
Currently the way I often do it is clicking on the github link, then the docs link from there, but this is inconvenient since github can often be slow to load.</p>
