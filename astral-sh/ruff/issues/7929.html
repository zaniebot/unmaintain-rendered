            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue is to request support for isort's ordering action comments.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># isort: unique-list
__all__ = [&quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Would be rewritten to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># isort: unique-list
__all__ = [ &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>This code within isort is located here:
https://github.com/PyCQA/isort/blob/9e0ad3d9939e0649a77f4e04db23652f170808a6/isort/literal.py#L97</p>
<p>With the code styling comments supported by isort located here:
https://github.com/PyCQA/isort/blob/9e0ad3d9939e0649a77f4e04db23652f170808a6/isort/core.py#L18</p>
<p>This was originally requested within isort in the issue below and released as part of isort 5.3.0:
https://github.com/PyCQA/isort/issues/1358</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
