            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>Counter</code> (as a dict subclass) should have a rule similar to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-comprehension-in-call/ and https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-list-comprehension-dict/:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Counter([(x, f(x)) for x in foo])
Counter([x.id for x in foo])

# above lines should be rewritten to:
Counter((x, f(x)) for x in foo)
Counter(x.id for x in foo)
</code></pre>
<p>As well as https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-comprehension/:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Counter([x for x in foo])
# above line is rewritten to:
Counter(list(foo))
# but it should really be rewritten to:
Counter(foo)
# this should be rewritten too:
Counter(x for x in foo)
</code></pre>

<p><code>Counter</code> is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter">part of the stdlib</a>, so we should always know that it's a subtype of dict.</p>
