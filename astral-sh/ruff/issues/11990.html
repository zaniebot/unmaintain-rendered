            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an idea for a formatting or linting rule (not sure where it would fit best). Basically I'd like ruff to drop unneeded parentheses from <code>a[(b, c)]</code> (into <code>a[b, c]</code>). This pattern comes up a lot in idiomatic <a href="https://github.com/yt-project/yt"><code>yt</code></a>, but there are currently no formatter (that we know of) for it, so our docs and code base have two widely spread, competing styles.
I couldn't find a similar open issue, apologies if there is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Up to you guys. I'm tempted to give it a try myself but that would be my first rust contribution ever. My personal inclination is that this would go to the formatter (as a known deviation from black ?), but I'm happy to wait for consensus for I dive in.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like the idea that @MichaReiser raised of &quot;formatting rule = does not change the AST&quot; but I don't think that convention is actually followed, as far as I can tell, in the lint and formatting rules that currently exist, is that right? So I ended up taking a stab at this as a lint rule based on the convention of &quot;vibes&quot;. Let me know if you'd prefer it to be formatting.</p>
