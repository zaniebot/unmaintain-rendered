            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Version: ruff 0.0.254
the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.254">changelog for 0.0.254</a> mentions several (great!) new rules (E211, E225, E226, E227, E228) have been added.</p>
<p>These seem to be missing from the documentation (they should be in the screenshot below - but also a Search doesn't find them) - and are also not applied when trying to see if they still work and are active.</p>
<p>Have these been disabled / removed temporarily, or is there something wrong with this / my install</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, sorry about that. This is just a confusion in messaging -- we've implemented those rules, but they're currently behind a feature flag, so they're not accessible from the production build.</p>
<p>I want all of the remaining pycodestyle rules to go out in a single coordinated release, since it's arguably a 'breaking' change for users (it'll enable a bunch of previously non-existent rules for any users that enable the <code>E</code> category).</p>
<p>There are about 10 more rules to go, hopefully in the next week or two but don't hold me to it :)</p>
