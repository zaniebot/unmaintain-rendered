            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure what you can do about this, but my work computer just decided to flag ruff as a virus and delete it.
Don't know if &quot;enterprise&quot; windows has an exceptionally tight virus scanner or if consumer windows will start doing this to people as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Executables that read and modify code are likely to be flagged as potential malware. Especially if written in a lower-level language. As more users download the executable, and manually flag it as non-dangerous, then antivirus/antimalware understand it's a false-positive for that specific executable's signature. This is normal and has a chance to happen every new release, where a &quot;new executable&quot; is &quot;rapidly spreading&quot; (from an antivirus' PoV).</p>
<p>The best Ruff devs can do really is try to strike a deal with popular antivirus makers to send new releases to be excluded.</p>
