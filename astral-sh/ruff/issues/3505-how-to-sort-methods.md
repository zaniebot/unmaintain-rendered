# How to sort methods?

---

_@Pedrexus_

Hello, 

I'm recently migrated my linter/formatter to ruff, but before I used a flake8 plugin that would sort methods, functions, properties in alphabetically. Is there any way to achieve this functionality in ruff?

In any case, thank you for this amazing lib. The speedups are impressive!
