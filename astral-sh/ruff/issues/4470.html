            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, first of all, thank you for building this tool, saved me time integrating tens of similar tools into the project.</p>
<p>Now, here's the problem I noticed recently: for variables we have <code>A001</code> to warn when it shadows a builtin. However, builtins can also be shadowed by methods, but <code>A001</code> does not catch that. Here's a situation where it can cause trouble:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class C:
    @staticmethod
    def list() -&gt; None:
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def repeat(value: int, times: int) -&gt; list[int]:
        return [value] * times
</code></pre>
<p>If you pass this to <code>pyright</code> it will warn at the return type of <code>repeat</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plain">a.py:7:43 - error: Expected type expression but received &quot;() -&gt; None&quot; (reportGeneralTypeIssues)
</code></pre>
<p>From the error message, looks like <code>list</code> in the second method signature is understood as the <code>list</code> method we defined above, not the <code>list</code> builtin. This is highly confusing, but I'm not sure if this really belongs to <code>A001</code> though as this problem only happen at type level, you can't refer to that method inside another method.</p>
<p>Anyway, it costs me almost an hour to realize what's wrong (yep, I'm that noob), so I think I should just write this down in case another poor soul is also facing the same problem 🤷</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we may have done this originally, but it ended up being more confusing than helpful. I think this <em>could</em> be useful though. We'd probably want to flag at the usage site (like <code>list[int]</code>), not the definition site (<code>def list</code>), since it's totally valid for a class to define a function named <code>list</code>. The confusion comes when you reference that function within the class scope.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah sorry, I believe this is A003?</p>
<pre><code>foo.py:3:9: A003 Class attribute `list` is shadowing a Python builtin

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ouch, sorry for wasting your time. I looked at the end of my config and see the <code>ignorelist</code> having only <code>id</code> there so I thought <code>A003</code> is being partially enabled, turned out there is another line completely disabled that rule. I tried with <code>A003</code> enabled and it does warn at the definition of <code>list()</code>, thank you.</p>
