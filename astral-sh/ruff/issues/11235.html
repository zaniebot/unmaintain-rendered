<li>List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue: &quot;isnull&quot;, &quot;pandas-vet&quot; (read through some of the issues, including one that says <code>pandas-vet</code> is like training wheels; that said, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect it not to flag issues on non-pandas code)</li>
<li>A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug: https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-ml/blob/87889d9857237425544a3a5dc41fce9e1ca7fe5d/ibisml/steps/impute.py#L13 (sorry, I&#x27;ll try to update this to something more minimal later, but I think you can trigger it by calling <code>.isnull()</code> on literally anything)</li>
<li>The command you invoked (e.g., <code>ruff /path/to/file.py --fix</code>), ideally including the <code>--isolated</code> flag: Ran though pre-commit hook.</li>
<li>The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your <code>pyproject.toml</code>): <code>PD</code> is selected.</li>
<li>The current Ruff version (<code>ruff --version</code>): v0.3.2</li>
</ul>
<p>I did also try type hinting my function (marking <code>col</code> as type <code>ir.Column</code>), but it didn&#x27;t matter. Looking at the implementation of the rule, it seems to be a naive string match.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the clear issue. I think we should just merge this into <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6432">astral-sh/ruff#6432</a> though -- it&#x27;s the same underlying issue, we aren&#x27;t correctly inferring that something is or isn&#x27;t a DataFrame.</p>
