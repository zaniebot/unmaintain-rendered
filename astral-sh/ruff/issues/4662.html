            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Example code:</p>
<pre><code>some_string = &quot;hello&quot;
test_string = (
    f&quot;this is a string without placeholders &quot;
    &quot;and this is also without placeholders &quot;
    f&quot;{some_string} is in a placeholder&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<p>The first line should generate a violation and it does not. If you delete the other 2 lines, then the violation is found.</p>
<p>Command to run:
<code>ruff check --select F541</code></p>
<p>My ruff version: 0.0.263</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, so I <em>think</em> this is intentional, since it's common to use a shared prefix for all tokens within an implicit string concatenation, which has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common horizontal alignment (the first character of each line is aligned with every other line).</li>
<li>No need to change prefixes if you reflow text (e.g., one line gets too long, so a word is moved up to the previous line).</li>
</ul>
<p>Pyflakes has the same behavior -- it doesn't flag the above case either. My inclination is to call this &quot;working as intended&quot;.</p>
