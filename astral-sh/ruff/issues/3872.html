            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you run <code>ruff check scratch_171.py --isolated --select PGH004</code> on the snippet below you get the output</p>
<pre><code>scratch_171.py:2:8: PGH004 Use specific rule codes when using noqa
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 1  # noqa: blahblahblah
a = 1  # noqa blahblahblah
</code></pre>
<p>PGH004 is incorrectly detecting that <code>noqa blahblahblah</code> does not have a specific rule code, presumably because it does not have a colon.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm, I think this is arguably correct. Both Ruff and Flake8 treat <code># noqa blahblahblah</code> as equivalent to <code># noqa</code>. Even <code># noqa E501</code> is treated as identical to <code># noqa</code> (that is, it's treated as a blanket ignore). So it seems right to be called out as such?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah you're right - I had assumed that <code>noqa blah</code> was equivalent to <code>noqa: blah</code> but it's actually a blanket ignore.</p>
<p><a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#pygrep-hooks-pgh">PGH004</a> plus <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#ruff-specific-rules-ruf">RUF100</a> protect against that pretty well then.</p>
<p>thank you</p>
