I wrote up the state and TODOs of compatibility for the planned 2024 black stable style: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8678. Some of the items listed here are not included, e.g. the improved string processing

Thanks. I'll have a closer look once I manage to get through all notifications 😅

@MichaReiser I actually liked having this issue for general preview formatter style discussion whereas #8678 is specifically for the 2024 Black preview implementations.

FWIW I'm fine with closing this, I don't really see the value it adds to track here separately. Shouldn't we use a discussion if we want to gather feedback on preview style, not this issue?

@zanieb feel free to take the issue over and update its content. I closed it because the content it tracked is now identical to #8678. I don't mind keeping it around, if it serves a different purpose.

Hm... let's leave it closed for now and we can re-open or create a new one if we need it later.
