Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I made https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/4106 because I didn't know how to configure <code>ruff</code>'s internal <code>isort</code>.  I had just been looking here: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#isort-i.</p>
<p>However, there's a whole <code>isort</code> config section here: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort</p>
<p>The request: can we link the settings page in the rules page, for all tools where both pages exist?</p>
