<p>From version 4.3 ruff.exe on Windows 7 with python 3.8 generates a 0C0000005 error when launched.
It is no more compatible? I do not see anything in the ruff changelog.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that seems reasonable and I should probably have waited with this change until Ruff 0.5.</p>
