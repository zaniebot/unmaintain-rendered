            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Almost of the pandas rules have auto-fixes but many of them could be added relatively trivially. PD003-PD009 in particular are simply changing the name of the method.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, it seems like this was previously implemented in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/2741, but we didn't have the ability to flag fixes as unsafe at that point. I think we could reconsider adding this now!</p>
