            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've seen some discussion on here about allowing/not allowing an empty first line after a new code block with <code>ruff format</code>. <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/change_log.html#id16">This was updated to be allowed by black 24+</a>. It also seems that black's removing of the empty new line <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4193#issuecomment-1915008471">was only a feature in black 23</a>; previous versions of black did not enforce this.</p>
<p>Is there any willingness to allow these empty newlines in ruff? Or perhaps an optional flag to allow them? I agree with others' opinions that ruff should not format existing code with no new line, but should allow empty new lines.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
