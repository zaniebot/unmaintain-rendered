            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Environment variable interpolation in certain config settings could be very useful, specifically in the <code>extend</code> field.</p>
<p>Our use case is that we have a second internal repo where we've had to maintain a copy in <code>pyproject.toml</code> of the config from our main repo. But ideally we could just do this:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
extend` = &quot;${MAIN_REPO}/pyproject.toml&quot;
# ... a few internal-specific settings
</code></pre>
<p>This becomes more useful the more repos you have.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sweet-- just wanna say you're doing an a fantastic job building a great tool for teams working on monorepos (not to mention all the other great stuff about ruff). You've implemented basically everything on my wishlist to date.</p>
<p>I try to get the pyright maintainer (the other big tool we're going to be using) to implement a lot of this simple quality-of-life stuff but he rejects virtually every request and IMO pyright is consequently full of user-unfriendly APIs and blind-spots. In contrast you're typically knocking these out the day I raise them. Great job, this will help us a lot with Dagster when the transition PR merges. I'll definitely write a post on the Dagster blog about it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! Really happy to hear it. From my perspective, it's been super beneficial for <em>Ruff</em> too to have all of your feedback and input, and I'm grateful for it. Your issues are always very thoughtful and well-communicated, and the work we're doing here will be a huge boon to other projects (especially monorepos) in the future.</p>
