# Configuration options for argument splitting into multiple lines

---

_Issue opened by @oxysoft on 2024-12-20 20:09_

Hi, I looked around and surprisingly did not find any options for this. I just started using Ruff, and it is splitting all my arguments like crazy. For example this line is being turned into 3 lines!

Before:

```
    results, time_points = analyzer.analyze_segments(waveform, target_resolution=args.segment_duration,)
```

After:

    results, time_points = analyzer.analyze_segments(
        waveform, target_resolution=args.segment_duration
    )


Is this the normal expected behavior? Thank you!

This is expected from the formatter, and agrees with the output from black. Are you maybe used to having a longer line length? You can configure that [as described in the docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#line-length).
