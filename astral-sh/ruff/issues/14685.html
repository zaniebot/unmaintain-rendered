            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue was brought up <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14499#issuecomment-2489577707">here</a> originally.
Since labeling every PR and issue could be time consuming I thought it could be helpful to automate it.</p>
<p>I created this issue to know if this is actually a time consuming problem that requires solving or not.</p>
<p>I was only thinking about red-knot right now which most of the issues and PRs are have &quot;red-knot&quot; in their title. So using title could help a lot and it's simple.
For linter and formatter there should also be some useful strings(for example linter rule codes) to identify them.</p>
<p>I would be happy to work on this.</p>

<p>Speeking just for myself.</p>
<p>Labelling issues and pull requests isn't what's taking a lot of my time. At least not compared to understanding and answering issues. However, I'm subscribed to all repository notifications. I could see how automatic labelling Red Knot issues could beuseful for @carljm who's not subscribed to repository notifications. But I let him speak for himself.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's something I started by mistake. I'm not sure if we actually want that haha</p>

<p>While possible, I'd prefer not to do that. Our current triaging is that issues without a label need triaging. Adding automatic labeling breaks this workflow (and it's not the time consuming part).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@michaReiser, you've complained to us before that we don't always remember to attach the <code>red-knot</code> label to red-knot contributor PRs when you're away ;)</p>
<p>If it's easy to do, I think it would be helpful to have a bot automatically add the red-knot label to PRs that only touch code inside of of the red-knot crates. But I do also agree that it doesn't feel like it's one of the things that takes up a lot of our time right now.</p>

<p>Personally I find it very useful to be able to immediately see from the commit message which commits are red-knot-related when I'm scrolling through <code>git log</code>!</p>

<p>I agree although I do spend some time (not much) during the release going over the issues that we've forgotten to label.</p>

<p>I like this and can be done easily using https://github.com/actions/labeler. We could configure it to label &quot;red-knot&quot; for PRs that touch the <code>red_knot_*</code> crates.</p>

<p>I would prefer to just use the crate names in which the changes occur for a PR.</p>

<p>I prefer something simple to begin with. Looking at the changed code works for PRs but not for issues and we'd have to be careful not to over-label RPs as red knot PRs just because they touched some red knot crate. They should only be labelled with red knot if they don't touch any non-red-knot crate.</p>

<p>But I don't think we necessarily need a universal solution that removes the need for us to do any manual adding of labels. I agree with you that auto-labelling issues doesn't feel like it would add much value, but I feel like adding some labels to some PRs automatically <em>would</em> add value, and would be well worth it. So if a proposed solution only works for PRs, then that seems fine to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I would get value from is a way to get <em>notified</em> of all new red-knot-labeled issues; right now I have to remember to check the issues list, otherwise I miss them. I get notified of red-knot PRs thanks to CODEOWNERS. But it's not that hard to check the issues list periodically, so I'm not sufficiently motivated to spend time on this :)</p>
<p>Auto-labeling of issues wouldn't have much value for me; I haven't observed us forgetting to label issues. Auto-labeling of PRs also wouldn't help me personally, but I'd be happy if it makes life easier for contributors or for people releasing ruff.</p>
