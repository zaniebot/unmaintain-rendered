            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure if this is an issue here or with Ale. From the output of <code>ruff .</code>, you can see that S101 is being ignored. However, in the file itself I still see the warning.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And here is the config:</p>
<pre><code>let g:ale_linters = { &quot;python&quot;: [&quot;ruff&quot;, &quot;pylint&quot;], &quot;rust&quot;: [&quot;analyzer&quot;] }
let g:ale_fixers = {
\       &quot;*&quot;: [&quot;remove_trailing_lines&quot;, &quot;trim_whitespace&quot;],
\       &quot;python&quot;: [&quot;black&quot;, &quot;ruff&quot;],
\       &quot;rust&quot;: [&quot;rustfmt&quot;],
\}
</code></pre>
<p>Also, we should probbably put instructions for this in the README, since this seems a lot easier than the suggested way of using ruff in vim.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not super familiar with this tool... My best guess is that it's not passing the filename to Ruff? So we can't find the config?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is definitely the issue! Thanks! Charlie, should I replace our current README with Ale since the config is WAY easier? It also one of the most popular vim tools.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gonna close since I think this is handled by the upstream issue.</p>
<p>@colin99d - Can you add a section for it similar to what we have for <code>efm</code> and <code>null-ls</code>?</p>
