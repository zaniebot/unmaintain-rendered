<p>I am using <code>ruff==0.6.4</code>. I have been using Ruff linter for quite some time alongside black formatter. Now I would like to use Ruff Formatter instead of black but my issue is with the handling of <code>line-length</code> between Ruff and Black. With Black, line length is only enforced for code blocks and not for docstrings or comments. But Ruff's <code>tool.ruff.line-length</code> is a universal length restriction and causes <code>E501 Line too long</code> for hundreds of lines making it extremely difficult to manually fix them all. Plus I would prefer to leave those as is as they are just comments or docstrings and I don't want the linter to complain for them.</p>
<p>Is there a way to configure length restriction to ignore docstrings and comments? Or perhaps allow a different length for linter and formatter?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hy @kevalmorabia97</p>
<p>My recommendation is to disable <code>E501</code> and rather formatting related lint runes when using <code>ruff format</code>by adding them to <code>ignore = [&quot;E501&quot;]</code>. Annoter common setup is to keep <code>E501</code> enabled and increase the <code>[max-line-length</code>](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pycodestyle_max-line-length) and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pycodestyle_max-doc-length"><code>max-doc-length</code></a> settings to find very long lines that the formatter wasn't able to break lines into shorter lines automatically.</p>
