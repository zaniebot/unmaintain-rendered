            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I may be misunderstanding something, but from the README</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, Ruff enables all E and F error codes, which correspond to those built-in to Flake8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought that all E* codes from flake8 would show up with <code>ruff</code> too. But here I see <code>E111</code> being skipped:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">(.venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/tmp$ cat t.py
if 2 + 5:
  pass
(.venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/tmp$ flake8 t.py
t.py:2:3: E111 indentation is not a multiple of 4
(.venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/tmp$ ruff t.py
</code></pre>
<p>Diagnostics:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">(.venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/tmp$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.205
(.venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/tmp$ flake8 --version
6.0.0 (mccabe: 0.7.0, pycodestyle: 2.10.0, pyflakes: 3.0.1) CPython 3.8.16 on Linux
(.venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/tmp$ python --version
Python 3.8.16
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise for <code>E226</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey,</p>
<p>that refers to all error codes as currently implemented by ruff. <code>E111</code> is not one of them. One is able to replace flake8 with ruff under conditions mentioned <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruff can be used as a drop-in replacement for Flake8 when used (1) without or with a small number of plugins, (2) alongside Black, and (3) on Python 3 code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of error codes &lt; E400 from pycodestyle have been implemented so far. A more recent comment from Charlie on that matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We prioritized the rules based on the assumption that Ruff would be used alongside Black -- so we just haven't focused on implementing rules like <code>E302</code> that are made obsolete by an autoformatter. (It doesn't mean we won't implement them, just that they weren't / haven't been prioritized.) That's one of the key assumptions baked into any &quot;parity with Flake8&quot; claims. I hope it doesn't come across as misleading, it's all documented in the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8">FAQ</a>, definitely not my intent.</p>

That said, eventually becoming an autoformatter is in scope of this project.</p>
