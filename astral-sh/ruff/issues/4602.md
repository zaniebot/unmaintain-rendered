# Are there pyproject-exclusive options?

---

_Issue opened by @SXHRYU on 2023-05-23 13:59_

Is there any way to have the following options be applicable through CLI?
```
[tool.ruff.isort]
combine-as-imports = true
lines-after-imports = 2
order-by-type = false
no-lines-before = ["local-folder"]

[tool.ruff.flake8-unused-arguments]
ignore-variadic-names = true

[tool.ruff.flake8-annotations]
suppress-dummy-args = true
```

I've tried unsuccesfully:
```
ruff check \
            --lines-after-imports 2 \
            --order-by-type false \
            --no-lines-before "local-folder" \
            --ignore-variadic-names \
            --suppress-dummy-args .
```
and 
```
ruff check \
            --extend-select ignore-init-module-imports \
            --extend-select combine-as-imports \
            --extend-select lines-after-imports 2 \
            --extend-select order-by-type false \
            --extend-select no-lines-before "local-folder" \
            --extend-select ignore-variadic-names \
            --extend-select suppress-dummy-args .
```


Or are most of the stuff from here https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#suppress-dummy-args pyproject-exclusive? If not, the documentation should be clearer on how to invoke these kinds of settings.

Yup! Only a small subset of the arguments (e.g. those related to rule selection) are supported on the command line. We may add a mechanism for assigning arbitrary configuration options in the future (e.g., `--config foo=bar`).
