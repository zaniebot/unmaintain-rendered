            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-copyright-notice/#missing-copyright-notice-cpy001">missing-copyright-notice (CPY001)</a> has come up a couple of times (#15833, #12343) as a motivation for enabling specific preview rules, so I checked why we didn't stabilize it in the last release and saw a bunch of open, related issues. We don't necessarily have to resolve <em>all</em> of these before stabilizing, but I thought it might be helpful to have this tracking issue to centralize discussion and track progress toward stabilization.</p>
