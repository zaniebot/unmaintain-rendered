# New Setting Request: Adjust the quotes in the problem from [`] to [']

---

_Issue opened by @andyluooo on 2023-03-17 13:47_

I'd like to know if I can adjust the quotations showing in the problems from \` \` (backquote) to ' ' or " " (single/ double quote) through configurations. For instance, I desire the {name} showed in the problem to be 'name' (just like flake8) or "name" instead of \`name\`. Ruff does help me a lot but it really bother me by this stuff since I simply don't like the backquote.  I would appreciate it if you could provide a new setting option to solve this. BTW I'm currently using the Ruff VSCode extention. Thanks.

Here, are you referring specifically to the message that appears in the diagnostic?

Yes.

Ah yeah, this isn't currently configurable. I think it's a reasonable choice for us and to be honest, we're unlikely to parametrize it just given the maintenance burden.
