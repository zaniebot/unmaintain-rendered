            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If a unit-under-test is successfully raising an error inside a pytest.raises block, then any trailing code after that call will not be executed and is effectively doing nothing. And given that a function not raising when it should is already an erroneous condition, any other code/assertions are likely not testing the code in the expected state.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def asd():
  raise ValueError('blah')

def test_asd():
  with pytest.raises(ValueError, match='blah'):
    asd()
    # Code after this line will only be run if the unit-under-test doesn't raise.

    assert something == something_else
</code></pre>
<p>Given detecting the actual code that should be raising isn't quite obvious, I don't think there's an easy auto-fix for this. But the 'fix' should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">with pytest.raises(ValueError, match='blah'):
  ... # Code before thing that raises
  ... # Code that raises
  # Anything else moved out of the context manager

assert something == something_else
</code></pre>
<p>As far as detecting this, the pattern is probably something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any contiguous block of assertions <em>at the end</em> of a pytest.raises block.</p>
</blockquote>
