            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>at work, our client requires us to use their SonarQube. At the same time, I'd like to use Ruff as well.</p>
<p>These two clash when you're trying to add inline suppression comments for both, at least this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">except:  # NOSONAR python:S5754 noqa: E722
</code></pre>
<p>In this particular case, switching them works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">except:  # noqa: E722 NOSONAR python:S5754
</code></pre>
<p>However, this might not work with other inline comment based metadata.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what a good solution for this might look like, but I have two ideas.</p>
<p>You could look for the <code>noqa</code> pattern <em>anywhere</em> in a comment.</p>
<p>And/or, you could add a feature like <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.3.2/excluding.html#advanced-exclusion">coverage</a>, that lets you exclude lines that match a provided pattern. This way, I could provide a suppression pattern <code>NOSONAR</code> to Ruff and both tools would be happy.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would you mind trying this? <code>except:  # NOSONAR python:S5754  # noqa: E722</code></p>
<p>We allow the <code>noqa</code> anywhere, but we require that it's prefixed by its own <code>#</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm gonna close since we do ask for the leading <code>#</code> to clearly disambiguate the suppression. Hopefully that's ok for your use-case.</p>
