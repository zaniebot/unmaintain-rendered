            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it applies to all error codes, but let me give an example where I encountered that.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data = do_some_transformations()
return data
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a violation of <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-assign/"><code>RET504</code></a> - unnecessary assignment.</p>
<p>I needed to perform the assignment and <code>return data</code>, not <code>return do_some_transformations()</code>, so added a <code>noqa: RET504</code> with explanation of why I want to bypass the rule:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">data = do_some_transformations()
return data  # noqa: RET504 - to be able to debug the returned object.
</code></pre>
<p>Then I disabled <code>RET504</code> in <code>ruff</code> config completely, and this <code>noqa</code> became unused. Here is where <code>RUF100</code> comes into play, as it complains on unused error codes, and provides a fix.</p>
<p>The fix was:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">-    return data  # noqa: RET504 - to be able to debug the returned object
+    return data  # - to be able to debug the returned object
</code></pre>
<p>While I believe it should have been:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">-    return data  # noqa: RET504 - to be able to debug the returned object
+    return data
</code></pre>
<p>As it's probably quite safe to assume that entire content of the comment <code>noqa</code> is part of is explaining why a rule should by bypassed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a standard or a strong feeling here on preserving trailing whitespace following 'Preserved' comments? Meaning:</p>
<p>can:  <code>x = 1  # noqa  # type: ignore</code>
and: <code>x = 1  # noqa  # type: ignore    </code></p>
<p>both resolve to: <code>x = 1  # type: ignore</code>  ?</p>
<p>or is there a conceivable edge case where that matters?</p>
<p>At any rate, I believe I've mostly got this but will spend some time tomorrow getting the testing framework and everything set up, should work regardless of the above, just changes the logic a bit to save those characters if we want 'em.</p>
