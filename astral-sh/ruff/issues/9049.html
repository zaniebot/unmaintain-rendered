            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FURB152 tries to replace hard-coded constants with the built-in constants (e.g. <code>3.1415</code> to <code>math.pi</code>). Unfortunately -- I have found it to be too false-positive happy -- e.g. it will correct <code>3.15</code> to <code>math.pi</code>.</p>
<p>At the very least, I&#x27;d argue that this should be an <em>unsafe</em> fix if the constant does not exactly match the builtin (since we will observe some behavioral difference). But I think we should <em>also</em> increase the precision required (e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/6bbabceead840e0d232950a1ed1e8f02cdafb92c/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/refurb/rules/math_constant.rs#L61C29-L61C29) -- I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about how precise it should be, but IMO <code>3.15</code> should not be corrected to <code>math.pi</code> (maybe do it based on the # of digits vs the rounded version?).</p>
<p>Would be happy to contribute a patch if you think this a good idea.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There was some discussion about safety at <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8727">astral-sh/ruff#8727</a>#discussion_r1396381872 and we&#x27;re a bit divided on it. I&#x27;d prefer to leave it as safe for now and instead reduce the false positives. Unsafe isn&#x27;t really intended to account for false positives i.e. if the rule was always applied correctly would it be safe? It&#x27;s true that it changes the precision slightly but I don&#x27;t think it should effect the intent of the code. If we still get feedback that it&#x27;s causing problems, we can consider changing it.</p>
<p>I agree 3.15 should definitely not change to <code>math.pi</code>. I&#x27;d welcome a pull request resolving that issue (and similar).</p>
