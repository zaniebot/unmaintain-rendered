            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I think many people use the automatic import feature.
The feature is very convenient, but sometimes it imports from the wrong place.</p>
<p>Sometimes this problem occurs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># source.py
value = 'value'

__all__ = ['value']
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># file_1.py
from source import value  # normal import
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># file_2.py
from file_1 import value  # reimport. The object is imported from a location other than the one where it was created
</code></pre>
<p>Reimports are hard to spot and difficult to find using search.
Reimports complicate refactoring and can cause circular import errors.</p>
<p>I suggest adding a rule that will warn on import if the imported object was not created in the source, is not listed in <code>__all__</code> and is not from a library.</p>
