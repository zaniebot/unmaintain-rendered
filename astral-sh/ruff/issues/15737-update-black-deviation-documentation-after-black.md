# Update black deviation documentation after Black 2025 release

---

_@MichaReiser_

### Description

Black is about to release their new [2025 style guide](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4558#event-16066112961). We should update the black deviation document (there are many that can now be removed but I think there's one new style that they decided to promote on short notice).
