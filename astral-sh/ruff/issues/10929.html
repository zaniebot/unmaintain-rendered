            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Trying to understand the licensing here, the LICENSE file is 13k lines long(!) Lots of copyright notice. Guessing if I just use it for CI and do not redistribute then I don't need to carry the copyright(s) (?)</p>
<p>Any way to simplify/summarize this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>BTW excited about the approach and project overall! We'd love to use it for Apache Superset but we're under the scrutiny of the ASF around licensing. It looks like folks in the Apache Airflow community may have done the vetting already (?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that's right -- the project is MIT licensed, and you don't need to carry the copyright if you're just using in CI (IIUC).</p>
