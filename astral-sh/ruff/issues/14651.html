            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to propose that the rule documentation or rule page (or a new subpage?) lists all existing rules from the different tools (flake8, pycodestyle, pylint, etc...) and which ones currently are and are not implemented in ruff.</p>
<p>This would make it easier for developers to understand if they can stop using some tool and adopt ruff instead.</p>
<p>Related issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2322</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1593<ul>
<li>This issue also asks for this information but was closed without much discussion as at that time there was a section into the README called &quot;How does ruff compare to flake8&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>all rules of each set and which rules are implemented:<ul>
<li>in ruff (stable default)</li>
<li>in ruff (stable opt-in)</li>
<li>in ruff (preview)</li>
<li>in ruff (not yet)</li>
<li>in ruff (not planned/low priority because of reason X)</li>
<li>what version of ruff the rule was implemented in</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
