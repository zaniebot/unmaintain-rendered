            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, the parser drops all unterminated strings or more precisely the lexer doesn&#x27;t emit the string token for unterminated strings. This is for both normal and formatted string literals.</p>
<p>This can be solved by always emitting the string / f-string tokens even if it&#x27;s unterminated. We would need to introduce an <code>Unterminated</code> token flag which will signal the parser about the same.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;hello world

def foo():
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Even though the parser recovers from the above unterminated string, the AST doesn&#x27;t include the string itself. Here, the new tokens would be:</p>
<pre><code>TokenKind::String (with TokenFlags::Unterminated)
TokenKind::Newline
TokenKind::NonLogicalNewline
TokenKind::Def
...
</code></pre>
<p>This will help the parser create the correct AST. We&#x27;d also need to move the error handling from the lexer to the parser.</p>
<p>Note that this will only work for single-quoted strings as triple-quoted strings will just consume the remaining source code completely if there&#x27;s no closing quote.</p>
F-strings
<p>There&#x27;s more to f-strings than a normal string literal because it can contain an expression element. This means that there could be unterminated f-string or the closing curly brace could be missing or an error in the expression itself.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>f&quot;hello {foo
# or, f&quot;hello {foo}
# or, f&quot;hello {foo} world
# or, f&quot;hello

def bar():
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Here, there&#x27;s a <code>NonLogicalNewline</code> token after the &quot;foo&quot; variable because of an unclosed <code>{</code>. This would require a modified re-lexing logic to (1) recover from an unclosed <code>{</code> and (2) recover from an unterminated f-string.</p>
<p>This also requires moving the error handling from the lexer to the parser.</p>
<p>But, here&#x27;s another problem: the parser doesn&#x27;t use existing list parsing logic for parsing comma-separated expressions aka tuple expression which means it doesn&#x27;t benefit from any error recovery logic. Thus, if there&#x27;s an error in the f-string expression itself, there&#x27;s a high change it&#x27;ll not recovery correctly.</p>
<pre><code>f&#x27;hello {foo bar

def func():
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>For the above code snippet, should &quot;foo bar&quot; be parsed as a tuple expression with a missing comma (?) because currently the &quot;bar&quot; would be parsed as a name node in the global scope.</p>
<code>Unknown</code> token
<p>If we were to move the error handling for strings to the parser, it would mean that there won&#x27;t be any <code>Unknown</code> token. This means that the change cannot be made without support for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11915">astral-sh/ruff#11915</a>. The main reason is that these rules rely on the fact that there&#x27;ll be an <code>Unknown</code> token in the token stream where there&#x27;s a lexial error. Maybe there&#x27;s a way around that but I&#x27;m not exactly sure now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After #11915, if we do start emitting the tokens for unterminated strings, we should avoid running any token-based rules on them. This could be done by checking whether the <code>Unterminated</code> token flag is set or not.</p>
