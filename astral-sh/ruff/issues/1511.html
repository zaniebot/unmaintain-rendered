<p>Ok cool. My only hesitation is around robustness. If we see flakiness on CI (e.g., from waiting for <code>blackd</code> to startup, or other daemon-related issues), I may ask that we convert back to <code>black</code>, since I'd rather CI be reliable than fast (at least, on that order of magnitude).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok it sounds like it's worth rolling back then. Not urgent though if it's easy for you, go for it :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn’t see the context here, but was it a <code>blackd</code> startup failure? I note that we’re only waiting a total of 1 second for <code>blackd</code> to start (10 × 100 ms), which seems low for a Python project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From what I remember it's been startup failures. And you're right, it's only 1 second (I thought it was longer). So increasing the wait time would also be an option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that's probably my fault -- I think I reduced them a bit before merging. Let's bump them and close for now. Can always revisit.</p>
