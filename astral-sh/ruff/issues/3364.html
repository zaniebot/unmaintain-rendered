            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pylint gives a score between 0 and 10 for code it analyzes? It's nice to have a simple metric that improves as you fix flaws. Could ruff add something similar?</p>
<p>I just started with ruff and appreciate how much faster it is than pylint -- thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the kind words!</p>
<p>I think I'm gonna err on the side of closing this one as something that, while I understand the use and value, I don't want to support in Ruff right now.</p>
