            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>flake8-annotations supports an options <code>--respect-type-ignore</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/sco1/flake8-annotations?tab=readme-ov-file#--respect-type-ignore">here</a>.
It would be great to have support for it in Ruff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we want to support rule-specific suppression comments. That would become rather confusing, especially once we remove the linter groups as they exist today (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1774).</p>
<p>Our in-work type checker will support <code>type: ignore</code> comments and it's somewhat likely that we'll support it as well in Ruff once we transition Ruff to use the same infrastructure but with an option to <em>ignore</em> <code>type: ignore</code> suppression comments.</p>
<p>However, I could also see us to disallow the use of <code>type: ignore</code> for lint like rules. That's why I think we should wait with adding support for <code>type: ignore</code> until we have a better understanding where we'll go with the Ruff/Red Knot integration</p>
