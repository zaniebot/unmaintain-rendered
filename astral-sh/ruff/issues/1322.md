# [feature-request] Keep error summary together at bottom of error list

---

_Issue opened by @smackesey on 2022-12-22 01:30_

When I run `ruff` with a subset of fixable errors, I get output like this:

```
Found 62 error(s).
dagster-cloud/integration_tests/python_modules/dagster-cloud-test-infra/dagster_cloud_test_infra/pex/sample-repos/repo-with-partition-set/repo1/repo1/__init__.py:1:25: F401 `repository.repo1` imported but unused
dagster-cloud/integration_tests/test_suites/kubernetes_dagster_cloud/test_kubernetes.py:137:31: F811 Redefinition of unused `dagster_cloud_most_recent_release` from line 31
... 60 more lines ...
11 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

IMO it's a bit confusing to have the number of fixable errors at the bottom and the total at the top (especially if there are a lot of errors and you have to scroll to the get the total)-- they should both be at the bottom.
