<p>When using flake8-builtins linting, it complains that <code>Argument </code>type<code> is shadowing a python builtin</code>. However in this instance it is not an argument, but an attribute.</p>
<p>This collides with <code>A003</code>, right now <code>A002</code> takes precedence over <code>A003</code>.</p>
<p>Somewhat interesting discussion around <code>A003</code> -&gt; https://github.com/gforcada/flake8-builtins/issues/75 though I would say, leave it up to the user. Personally I don't see much point in A003.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the issue is that it doesn't really make sense to worry about this problem because it's almost never possible to refer to class attributes in a way that would conflict with a builtin.</p>
<p>An interesting approach might be to allow the definition to go through but to flag any potentially-confusing use.</p>
<p>It's also easy enough to just explicitly exclude <code>A003</code> (or don't select <code>A</code> in the first place).  It might make sense to remove <code>A003</code> from being automatically enabled by <code>A</code>, though.</p>
