Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>The rule N999 (snake_case module names) seems to trigger on <code>__version__.py</code> which seems incorrect based on the pep8 rule linked in the docs.</p>
<p>If you think it's correct however, feel free to close :)</p>
<p>Keep on truckin'</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this should be fixed in v0.0.249, which is building now (and was released early for this purpose :))</p>
<p>If you see it on v0.0.249, definitely let me know!</p>
