            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure if I missed an already-possible feature, but I often find myself working in libraries that need <code>keep-runtime-typing = True</code> for only a select few files.  It would be convenient, in those cases, to enforce the rule for a subset of files with something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint.pyupgrade]
keep-runtime-typing-files = [&quot;src/subfolder/*.py&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>this is not currently possible, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's not currently possible but we do want to support it, probably in a more general way like https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7696. I'm gonna merge into that issue!</p>
