            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Many of my bugs in Django are from doing <code>.first()</code> on an unordered QuerySet, which arbitrarily gives me one of the records. I would like <code>.first()</code> to be flagged as an error unless it is chained with <code>.order_by()</code> (not necessarily consecutively, but in the same statement). I searched for an example of a similar rule in flake8 but couldn't find any.</p>
