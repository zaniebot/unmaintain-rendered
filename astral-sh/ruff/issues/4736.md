# INP001: there is no automatic fixer

---

_Issue opened by @saippuakauppias on 2023-05-30 21:47_

There is no automatic fix for rule https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/implicit-namespace-package/ , which could simply create a `__init__.py` file next to the file from the error.

In my opinion, there are no other options here when file `__init__.py` is not required, so a fixer can be made.

This seems reasonable but we don't have support for fixes that modify the _filesystem_ right now, only fixes that modify file contents.
