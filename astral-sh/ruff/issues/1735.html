            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://ruff.pages.dev/">playground</a> currently uses JSON for the Settings ... which I don't think makes much sense given that ruff normally is configured via <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>So I think it would be better if the Settings tab of the demo was actually named <code>pyproject.toml</code> and would contain the contents of a valid <code>pyproject.toml</code> file. This way users could simply copy'n'paste between their local config file and the online playground.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would be nice! Although I'm guessing we'd lose JSON Schema support (since VS Code doesn't support JSON Schema for TOML without an extension), which would be a bummer.</p>
<p>Maybe there's a middle ground, like allowing users to paste in TOML and auto-converting to JSON.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I didn't think about JSON schema support. Slightly off-topic: Does the Ruff VS code extension integrate with any other extension that provides JSON schema support for TOML? I just tried <a href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/tamasfe/even-better-toml">Even Better TOML</a> but it does not recognize <code>tool.ruff</code>.</p>
<p>Back to the topic at hand: Yeah I think it's quite unfortunate that Monaco doesn't support extensions (https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/issues/343). Auto-converting doesn't let the user get TOML out of the playground ... we could provide a toggle button to switch between TOML and JSON, but this obviously still isn't ideal. The ideal solution would be to get JSON schema support in Monaco but that's probably not possible until Monaco supports extensions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah my bad, it does work! I was just getting confused by some errors it highlighted but these are just because my <code>pyproject.toml</code> file uses recently introduced settings that the VS code extension, that hasn't been updated since, doesn't yet know about. I am using the <code>ruff.path</code> setting to use the latest version of ruff with the extension ... would it be possible for the extension to obtain the latest JSON schema from the <code>ruff</code> binary?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't <em>think</em> so. I haven't looked into it deeply. Unfortunately we have to update the schema in the <a href="https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore">SchemaStore repository</a> in order to ship updates, which I do from time to time. (You <em>can</em> point SchemaStore to a URL, rather than including the schema in the repo directly, but then we wouldn't be able to autocomplete in <code>pyproject.toml</code> files -- anything that's included in <em>another</em> schema has to be bundled directly.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can now paste a TOML configuration into the playground using CTRL-V and it gets converted to JSON. The playground also supports copying the JSON configuration as TOML by right click -&gt; Copy pyproject.toml.</p>
<p>I looked into using TOML as the configuration format but, unfortunately, Monaco doesn't support TOML auto completion and I couldn't find any plugin.</p>
