            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding a tool like <code>ruff</code> or any linter to an existing unchecked codebase can be really painful.</p>
<p>Traditionally this is done by having include files and gradually ratcheting up the strictness. There are several issues with this approach, including forgetting to add a new file, renaming files or even knowing when to ratchet up the strictness.</p>
<p>An alternative is to add <code># type: ignore</code> or <code># pragma</code> comments to every line that produces an error. This has the advantage that files can be moved / renamed / refactored without issues. And any new files, new functions, etc. will by default have typing/linting enforced.</p>
<p>Thus it would be really interesting if ruff had a <code>--add-ignores</code> option or something like that would go over the entire codebase and add ignores wherever necessary to get the whole thing to pass.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I imagine this &quot;autopragma&quot; system would be quite similar except that the &quot;fix&quot; would be to add the right pragma comment (instead of deleting it). I think I&#x27;m going to watch how you handle #255 and study the autofix system a bit, and maybe I&#x27;ll be able to handle this (no promises!)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oops, I may&#x27;ve beat you to it -- I have an initial implementation here: #256. (It isn&#x27;t fully wired-up yet. I also opted to do it as its own flow rather than as a lint rule that can be autofixed but I may reverse that decision...)</p>
