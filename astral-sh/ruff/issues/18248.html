            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unexpected-indentation-comment/</p>
<p>On one hand, I do understand that random comment indentation is a bit ugly.</p>
<p>On the other, Python interpreter is fine with it, and it can be handy during development, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">            except (NoObserverError, ActionFailed):
                raise  # propagate along
            except Exception as e:
                raise UncaughtCharmError(
                    f'Uncaught exception ({type(e)}) in operator/charm code: {e!r}',
                ) from e
</code></pre>
<p>⬇</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">            except (NoObserverError, ActionFailed):
                raise  # propagate along
            # FIXME uncommment back; used for debug
            # except Exception as e:
                # raise UncaughtCharmError(
                    # f'Uncaught exception ({type(e)}) in operator/charm code: {e!r}',
                # ) from e
</code></pre>
<p>Arguably, I should have used some IDE macro to make a block comment instead, but I'm lazy and prepending <code># </code> and then repeating the command on the next few lines is just easier?</p>

<p>E116 is an opinionated rule for users who want to enforce the comment indentation. It's totally fine if you decide to indent your comments differently. In this case, disable the rule.</p>
