# Remove update-check support?

This used to be on-by-default, then we made it off-by-default. I can find a _few_ usages of `update-check = true` via GitHub Code Search, but perhaps this isn't worth maintaining.

I do not think there is a need to keep it.
As every day there is a new release (which is greatly appreciated), you just know you can update.
