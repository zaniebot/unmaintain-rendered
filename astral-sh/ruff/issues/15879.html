<p>~^ suggests a fixit here. This is the recommended class structure for old versions of python before strenum was introduced. However, enum doesn&#x27;t have <strong>slots</strong> defined, so defining a <code>__slots__</code> wouldn&#x27;t be that helpful.~ i also see this bug happen when a class has multiple ancestors, one of which is a tuple.</p>
<p>Actually, nevermind, this error was actually masking another error where enum was not properly imported. Seems odd to suggest a fixit in this situation. In other cases though, I do see the error pop up when only one of the ancestors is a tuple.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could you explain what&#x27;s the bug experience? I don&#x27;t think I understand it from the issue.</p>
<p>Ruff does raise an error about a missing <code>__slots__</code> even if the base class is known. So warning in the case if any base class is unknown doesn&#x27;t seem incorrect, because the <code>__slots__</code> attribute is always required if any parent is <code>tuple</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser To clarify, what is the behavior if a class has two ancestors, and only one of them implements <code>__slots__</code>? My understanding is that the <strong>slots</strong> in the class itself won&#x27;t have an effect because it will still need to consult the <code>__dict__</code> of the first parent, but I could be wrong? Specifically, what happens here:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I see. That&#x27;s a good point. In that case, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not a false positive, at least not when the base class is under the user&#x27;s control. However, the suggested fix/message is misleading because only adding <code>__slots__</code> to the current class isn&#x27;t enough; it also needs to be added to all non-tuple parent classes.</p>
<p>Now, analyzing base classes is something that Ruff struggles with, at least if they&#x27;re defined in another file. Which is why I&#x27;m leaning towards leaving the rule as is for now and revisit it once we have better type inference.</p>
