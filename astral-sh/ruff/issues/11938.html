            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Issues such as #11937, #11929 basically suggests that the token ranges are overlapping which is causing the panic in downstream tools.</p>
<p>I think it would be useful to validate the parsed output in the test cases to make sure that the token ranges don&#x27;t overlap. This would be similar to the validation done on the AST.</p>
