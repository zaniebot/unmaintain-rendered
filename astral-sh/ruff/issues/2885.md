# B904 not triggered in else block 

---

_Issue opened by @tekumara on 2023-02-14 03:45_

```python
try:
    ...
except Exception as e:
    if ...:
        raise RuntimeError("boom!")
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("bang!")
```

ruff only identifies B904 on line 5, and not on line 7:
```
:5:9: B904 Within an except clause, raise exceptions with `raise ... from err` or `raise ... from None` to distinguish them from errors in exception handling
```

ruff 0.0.246
