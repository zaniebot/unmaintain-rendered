            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider the following class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Person:
    name: str

    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -&gt; None:
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
</code></pre>
<p>The rule would suggests adding a typing annotation for <code>Person.age</code> so the code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Person:
    name: str
    age: int

    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int) -&gt; None:
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. Such a rule does make sense to me but Ruff's current capabilities only allow this rule to provide precise results when the class has no base classes because it can't resolve attributes from other classes (at least not if they're defined in other files). This would make the rule less useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not a fan of the extra boilerplate and bookkeeping personally.
Type-checkers already scan for assignments in <code>__init__</code>. And if you don't enable a rule to ensure that you don't forget to initialize, you may end up with extra declarations if you remove the member later.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Avasam There could also be a rule for redundant type annotations that aren't used at all</p>
