            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When I call <code>ruff .</code> it finished in 0.15s on my repo, but <code>ruff --fix .</code> takes &gt;2.5s, even if there are no lint errors and nothing to fix. Is it safe to always call <code>ruff .</code> and run it again with --fix only when the are some fixable issues? If so then maybe there is some room for improvement in ruff itself?</p>
<p>My use case was that we have replaced isort (and few other tools) with ruff --fix and it is much faster, but I was looking into speeding it up even more. We run black &amp;&amp; ruff --fix, black takes 0.8s and I hoped to speed it up with <code>ruff format</code>, but then noticed that ruff --fix takes most of the execution time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me look into this… I think we might be intentionally skipping the cache when the linter is run with the fix flag, but that may no longer be necessary for a variety of reasons. At least, I don’t see an inherent reason why we need to skip the cache any more.</p>
<p>But yes — you can always run ruff with fix after running ruff, only if there are any fixable issues.</p>
