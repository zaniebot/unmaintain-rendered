            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried to find if there were any existing issues, but I couldn't find anything.</p>
<p>I think I found a small false positive in RUF001. The ℹ️ contains the smaller unicode letter \u2139 which looks a lot like the letter &quot;i&quot;. So when pasting the emoji ℹ️ into my code I got a Ruff error that my code includes an ambiguous unicode character.</p>
<p>I can circumvent this by pasting the full unicode version of the emoji (<code>\u2139\ufe0f</code>), but this doesn't improve readability. Nor do I think that there is a chance that people conuse the emoji ℹ️ with the letter &quot;i&quot;.</p>
<p>Is this intended behaviour, or is this indeed a small false positive? If it's a bug I would be willing to look into it! :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. Yeah this seems off. We try to match VS code's behavior. I would have to look into it how they solve it, possibly by looking at grapheme clusters rather than characters.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just in case someone else (like me) is having trouble reproducing this: I had to surround the emoji in quotes in the playground example before actually getting a Ruff diagnostic emitted (before that only the underlying <em>editor backend</em> for the playground emits a warning.)</p>
