# Suggestion: Add release dates in changelog

---

_@romuald_

Hello

I would be appreciated if each new release came with a date in the changelog

(It seems that @zanieb is already working on it: https://github.com/zanieb/rooster/issues/47)

I haven't started work, if someone is compelled to add it.

I'll close this in favor of the upstream issue. Doing this manually seems too error prone
