            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Congrats on the release with the new formatter. Besides a few changed lines that I still need to investigate It looks really good!</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised with the fact that it is <em>only</em> a separate command. I kind of expected it to work as a lint rule: <code>RUF300: Code not formatted</code> or something... Which of course includes an autofix.</p>
<p>Using Ruff would allow me to drop 3 tools (flake8, isort, black) but I still need to run two commands...</p>
<p>I also noticed #8185 and feel that those warnings are better suited in the case that the formatter is enabled as lint rule. It seems to me that as a separate command you might want to differ between formatting and conflicting lint rules...</p>

<p>We're planning to integrate the formatter and linter into a single command as a part of the &quot;Stable&quot; formatter release.</p>

<p>I'm going to close this issue in favor of a tracking issue at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8232 which we'll use for general updates on this feature — implementing as a lint rule is only one of the possible interfaces.</p>
