            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I've recently found out that some people are unaware that <strong>CONTAINS_OP</strong>'s <strong>LOAD_CONST</strong> optimization applies only to containers with trivial values. As long as the RHS is non-trivial, Python will not apply <strong>LOAD_CONST</strong> optimization and will build the container each time we do <strong>CONTAINS_OP</strong>. This is a <em>major performance bottlneck</em> that many people may accidentally stumble upon. I think there's great potential in having a new rule that checks for this kind of inefficiency.</p>
<p>I prepared an example that hopefully explains my idea and labels which cases should be considered for a warning:
https://godbolt.org/z/radT91rdn</p>
<p>For example, <code>0 in {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}</code> is much more efficient in the form of <code>0 == 'foo' or 0 == 'bar'</code>, so manual iteration. An alternative would be to declare a variable for computing RHS once but that may not always be feasible.</p>
<p>There is one potential issue: in the original code, all of the RHS is run, which can cause some side effects. After rewriting it to a sequence of <code>or...or</code> operations, Python may not run all the cases, potentially changing runtime behavior. Although I think such code would be of very poor quality in the first place.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the suggestion! This is cool, and I didn't know godbolt had a Python option.</p>
<p>One thing that concerns me about making this a lint rule is that it seems very dependent upon CPython implementation details that might vary between CPython versions and especially other implementations of Python.</p>
<p>This also seems partially covered by two of our other rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/literal-membership/#literal-membership-plr6201">literal-membership (PLR6201)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/single-item-membership-test/#single-item-membership-test-furb171">single-item-membership-test (FURB171)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>but not the dict case in your example, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>Not quite, my issue concerns the set/list being constructed from scratch whenever it's being tested. Some people are unaware that this LOAD_CONST optimization only applies to Python trivial values and when such optimization is missed, there's a significant performance degradation.</p>

<p>Given that this rule should only be applied to cases that hurt performance (bad cases), the only false-positive I can think of is if there exists a Python version/implementation that can optimize sets/collections with potential creation-time side-effects (or be smarter about it: e.g., understand that <code>'foo'.lower()</code> is side-effect-free).</p>
<p>PyPy 3.11 has the same behavior as CPython:

<summary>Cython Pure Python Mode would result in false positives (it is actually smarter):</summary>

<p>I have run AI research on the topic (https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/3d2baeed-0ad0-4db1-9042-a819ff24425f) and here are the key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>LOAD_CONST optimization here is mostly unchanged since Python 3.7, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#what-versions-of-python-does-ruff-support">the same as Ruff support</a></li>
<li>Other implementations are unlikely to provide false positives here</li>
</ul>
<p>For cases of Python versions/implementations that do not support the LOAD_CONST optimization, the rule will still be beneficial for spotting performance issues. It would only miss warnings on good cases that would suffer from the same problem.</p>
