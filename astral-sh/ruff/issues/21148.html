            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-builtin-import/"><code>unnecessary-builtin-import</code> (UP029)</a>’s documentation does not match its implementation or original purpose. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
What it does
<p>Checks for unnecessary imports of builtins.</p>
Why is this bad?
<p>Builtins are always available. Importing them is unnecessary and should be removed to avoid confusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The documentation is correct that importing builtins is unnecessary. Maybe there should be a rule for that. However, that is not what this rule actually does. It does not check for all imports of builtins, e.g. <code>from builtins import tuple</code>. The purpose of the corresponding piece of <a href="https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade">pyupgrade</a> is to upgrade imports of builtins that are only necessary when using libraries like python-future or six for compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3.</p>
