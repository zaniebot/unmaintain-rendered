# New rule: Unnecessary `enumerate()`

---

_Issue opened by @ngnpope on 2023-02-06 20:07_

Fairly sure this is not covered by anything, but something I encountered due to autofixing `B007`.

Given the following example:

```python
for i, s in enumerate("abc"):
    print(s)
```

I get the following output:

```console
❯ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.241

❯ ruff --isolated --select B007 bug.py 
bug.py:1:5: B007 [*] Loop control variable `i` not used within loop body
Found 1 error.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.

❯ ruff --isolated --select B007 --fix bug.py 
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

❯ cat bug.py 
for _i, s in enumerate("abc"):
    print(s)
```

We could probably identify when `builtins.enumerate()` is being used and autofix to:

```python
for s in "abc":
    print(s)
```

Ah, this is covered [here](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1348#issuecomment-1405166629) by `FURB148` / `no-ignored-enumerate-items`.
