            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is more a general question rather than a feature request/bug report:</p>
<p>How do you plan on keeping up to date with evolving projects you reimplemented in core, like pyupgrade for example?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The goal is to maintain parity as those projects evolve, to the degree that we can. We've already reimplemented some upstream fixes from <code>flake8-bugbear</code>, for example.</p>
<p>Many of the plugins we've reimplemented, though, are pretty &quot;stable&quot;, in that they tend not to add many additional rules. E.g., many of them haven't seen new releases in the past few years. That's not true of <em>all</em> of them, but at least a handful.</p>
<p><code>pyupgrade</code> is maybe an interesting case, because we don't <em>really</em> support pre-Python 3.7 code. So I'd probably not prioritize anything that was added to <code>pyupgrade</code> that was focused on 2-to-3 conversions. (We do have some of that, like <code>six</code> import removal, but in hindsight I wouldn't have prioritized adding it.) On the other hand, there's a lot of stuff in <code>pyupgrade</code> that's useful for the ongoing maintenance of Python 3 code, like the type annotation rules. So I <em>would</em> pull in new rules of that nature.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Great! Thanks for your answer 😊</p>
<p>Yeah my question about pyupgrade was more focused on the ongoing development for new Python versions as I don’t see this tool be « finished » like maybe isort or some other could be (I mean once you’ve sorted your imports everything else is bug fixing, … right ? 😁)</p>
<p>And thanks for ruff! It’s an amazing piece of software 😊 I incorporated it in my own projects coming from flakeheaven and the transition was smooth. I don’t have large codebases but it feels a lot snappier already.</p>
