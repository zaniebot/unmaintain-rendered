<p>It would be really helpful for standalone scripts if Ruff would support reading the <code>requires-pyton</code> setting from the PEP 723 metadata. Standalone scripts usually don&#x27;t have a separate project config file, but in some cases they may still want to configure the Python version that Ruff uses.</p>
<p>In my case I ran into this because I was using the <code>zoneinfo</code> module that was added to the standard library in 3.9, and I was surprised that Ruff sorted it under third-party imports (see also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6475">astral-sh/ruff#6475</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13354">astral-sh/ruff#13354</a>). So it would be great if Ruff could support the metadata comment block for that.</p>
