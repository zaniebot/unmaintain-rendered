### Summary

[lint.flake8-import-conventions.aliases](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_aliases) already has `import numpy as np` but not `import numpy.typing as npt` which you can see in https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html is part of the numpy import alias convention.
