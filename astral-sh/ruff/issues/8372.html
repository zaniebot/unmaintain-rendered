            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it be possible for a virtual env placed inside the project directory to automatically not be considered a first party?</p>
<p>The default <code>exclude</code> option for example have <code>.venv</code> as an ignore, but I am not sure that should hold any bearing. Should excludes always be third party?</p>
<p>Or can Ruff possibly figure out if the virtual env is inside the root and omit that in its discovery as first-party?</p>
<h2>Additional context</h2>
<p>I realize lots of thought have been done around this, by reading https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#src, the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq">FAQ </a> and https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/contributing/#import-categorization_1m, as well as seeing other issue such as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2004. I am fine to close this immediately as such, but brought this up more as an idea/&quot;what if it has not been thought about&quot;. Ergo, feel free to close immediately if this does not make sense. 😃</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we may support discovering files within virtual environments eventually (at which point we could classify them as third-party, rather than relying on &quot;not-first-party&quot; as the definition of third-party), but right now it's not supported.</p>
