            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sharkdp I've picked this one. I spent a couple of hours diving into semantic index builder, use_def_map and the rest of the related code. Having fixed the issue yet, but I plan to.</p>
<p>P.S. good issue, facilitated much deeper dive in into the code base than the other one I've fixed.</p>

<p>That sounds more like I did a bad job at picking out a beginner-friendly task, sorry. I didn't want to introduce you to everything all at once :upside_down_face:. Let us know if you need help. I <em>think</em> https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/206 would only require changes to type inference (<code>types.rs</code>, <code>infer.rs</code>), but it's hard to tell without actually working on the task.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sharkdp no worries, I enjoy figuring things out and prefer hard(er) problems. Plus, I have general goal of contributing to red_knot in a major way, so I'll need to understand all of it one way or another. If this is urgent and you do not want to wait for the fix - then let me know, otherwise I'd like to tackle it before moving on to other issues.</p>
