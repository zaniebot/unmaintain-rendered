<p>I only just realized that our fix infrastructure always assumes that all changes belong to the file from the primary span.</p>
<p>How would the rendered diagnostic look like if we had a sub-diagnostic with a span pointing to a different file? I don't think it's something we have to solve now but it might be worth documenting if the rendered output looks confusing.</p>

<p>Beyond the implicit fix-primary-span connection, we'll also render diffs immediately after the last diagnostic, whether that fits nicely or not. Especially after the planned changes in #19919, the diffs will be expecting a <code>help:</code> header above them, which will be missing if an additional sub-diagnostic has been added before the <code>help</code> message.</p>
<p>These issues shouldn't affect any existing diagnostics yet, but they're something to look out for as we start using the new diagnostic features more extensively.</p>
