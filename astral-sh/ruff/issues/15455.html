            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I got an error for this rule (as the newest version of ruff got installed) and was reading the documentation and it took me quite a while to realize that the issue was the name of the module I was working on. As the error message tracks to line 1 of the file in question, which is an import X as Y statement, I kept thinking that the Y was the problem, but that didn't make sense given that the error message stated something else than Y.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think it would be useful to include an example in the documentation and/or be more explicit that the issue refers to the filename rather than the code.</p>
<p>In general, it would be useful if issues relating to file names, missing inits (INP001), etc (not sure if there are many of these) don't track to line 1 of a given file, but to something else. I guess this is not so easy to implement though.
However, again, for such cases it would be useful if there were a comment in the documentation for such rules that although the issue tracks to line 1 of a given file, that that line is not the actual problem.</p>
