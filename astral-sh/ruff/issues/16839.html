            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! There are some other open issues around F821 (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6242">astral-sh/ruff#6242</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9858">astral-sh/ruff#9858</a>, for example), but those seem to be related to <code>del</code>. I think it&#x27;s worth tracking this separately.</p>
<p>I think we would need to know that the assignment to <code>x</code> can raise an exception, so this probably requires better type inference. Or we could take the approach described in the <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/error/used-before-assignment.html">pylint docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assignments in try blocks are assumed not to have occurred when evaluating associated except/finally blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(pasting the playground code for easier quick reference)</p>
<pre><code># ruff says all good
# pylint says: E0601: Using variable &#x27;x&#x27; before assignment (used-before-assignment)
try:
    x = 1 / 0
    #if x:
    #    ...
except Exception:
    print(x)


# ruff says all good
# pylint says all good
try:
    x = 1 / 0
    if x:
        ...
except Exception:
    print(x)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the most correct would be to mark every variable defined inside a <code>try</code> to be possibly unbound in the <code>except</code> handlers and any code coming after. However, I worry that this is too strict for most users and should probably be its own rule. At least, this is what we do in our new type checker (<a href="https://playknot.ruff.rs/2ac1f0fb-c2b6-477a-bea5-3a6a77edceb7">playground</a>)</p>
