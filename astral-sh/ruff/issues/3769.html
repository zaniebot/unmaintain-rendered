Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I stumbled upon a false positive for pydocstyle's D402 (First line should not be the function's signature) in ruff 0.0.259, python 3.8.10.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what pydocstyle itself would do, but it seems incorrect even if pydocstyle would also be triggered:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class A(models.QuerySet):
    def b(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Call `C.b()` on something.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>Here the <code>b(</code>in the docstring seems to cause the violation. The rule is also triggered by <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Call 'C.b(x)' on something.&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Call 'b(' on something.&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Call 'b(a,c)' on something.&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>, but not if it does not contain <code>b(</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah FWIW pydocstyle also flags this. I can't think of a more reliable way to implement this off the top of my head while still catching a reasonable number of true positives.</p>
