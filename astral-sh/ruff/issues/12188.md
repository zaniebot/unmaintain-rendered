# ruff format does not break overlong lines

---

_Issue opened by @PerMildner on 2024-07-04 12:53_

I would expect `ruff format` to break overlong comment lines, but it does not seem to do this.

The example is from a devcontainer terminal within VSCode, but I do not think that is significant, given that I pass the `--isolated` flag to `ruff`.

Note that `ruff format` does fix the repeated whitespace (so `format` does some work) but it does nothing with the long comment line.

```
$ poetry run ruff --version
ruff 0.5.0
$ poetry run ruff format --verbose --isolated --line-length=88 --diff tests/conftest.py 
[2024-07-04][12:47:40][ruff::resolve][DEBUG] Isolated mode, not reading any pyproject.toml

It took me a moment to find the issue. I knew it was somewhere. I'll close this issue in favor of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7414

Yeah, we don't wrap overlong comments.

Thanks for the update. I understand.

That this is, at least for now, as intended is not at all clear from the documentation of `ruff format`, though.

Should I open a separate "documentation is unclear" ticket?
