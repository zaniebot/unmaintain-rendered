            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I’m on mobile so I can’t confirm but I think M001 doesn’t warn about unused excludes in the config. I think it should since it's essentially the same reasoning as unused per-line ignores. Thoughts?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this could be useful (maybe as <code>M002</code> or something). My only hesitation is that it's sometimes useful to enable blanket ignores that you copy across projects (like <code>.venv37</code>). So maybe it only affects targeted ignores, like <code>foo/bar/baz.py</code> that didn't match any files? That would be really useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm having trouble understanding the response so I'll just ask for clarification. Say I have this config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
ignore = [&quot;F401&quot;]
extend-select = [&quot;M001&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't actually have any <code>F401</code> errors in my code. I think that because <code>M001</code> is enabled I should see an error for the <code>ignore = [&quot;F401&quot;]</code> just like if I had an unused <code># noqa: F401</code> somewhere in my code.</p>
<p>I realize this may be quite hard to enforce because it would require checking all of the codes in <code>ignore</code> just to confirm if they are being ignored or not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ohhh sorry, yes! That makes sense. (I think of &quot;excludes&quot; as filepath exclusions, like <code>.git</code>, so that's where my brain went.)</p>
