            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have quite a few of these scattered around our codebase. <code>T201</code> reminds us if we forget to comment them back out after we're done debugging, but I wish I could avoid the warning while they're commented.

I tried <code>task-tags=[&quot;TODO&quot;, &quot;print&quot;]</code>, but this didn't work since there's no space after the <code>print</code>. I'd like to see either parens added to the delimiter for <code>task-tags</code> exclusions, or a separate setting added for allowed functions in commented-out code, please.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Upvoted. PyCharm allows comments like <code># language=regexp</code> to inject a language into a string in the following line, but this gets detected as commented out code by ruff and it's annoying to have to explicitly append a <code># noqa: ERA001</code> each time.</p>
<p>The setting could work exactly like <code>dummy-variable-rgx</code>, meaning a Regex pattern that, if matched, causes the error not to trigger for that particular line (or better yet for it and following lines that would otherwise trigger it).</p>
