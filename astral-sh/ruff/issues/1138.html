            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now, if a file uses the match statement, you have to manually exclude the file from ruff in your environment. It would be better to have an official workaround, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ruff automatically falls back to running flake8 when the match statement is encountered</li>
<li>Providing a way to mark one function as noqa, but still lint the rest of the file</li>
<li>Some other workaround I haven't thought of?</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal is not to have to manually create an appropriate special treatment for each file that is not compatible and to still have some code-quality checks on the offending file</p>
