            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While preparing to stabilize the rule in 0.12, we realized that at a minimum the rationale in the rule docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pytest.warns expects to receive an expected warning as its first argument. If omitted, <strong>the pytest.warns call will fail at runtime.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>is no longer correct in pytest 8.4. Further, it seems this has not been correct since at least pytest 7.0 in early 2022. The &quot;new&quot; default is <code>Warning</code>, which is quite broad and could naturally fall under <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/pytest-warns-too-broad/#pytest-warns-too-broad-pt030">pytest-warns-too-broad (PT030)</a> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I think at least we should not stabilize this for now. I think the change is <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html#pytest-7-0-0-2022-02-03:~:text=%238645%3A%20pytest.warns(None">here</a>%20is%20now%20deprecated%20because%20many%20people%20used%20it%20to%20mean%20%E2%80%9Cthis%20code%20does%20not%20emit%20warnings%E2%80%9D%2C%20but%20it%20actually%20had%20the%20effect%20of%20checking%20that%20the%20code%20emits%20at%20least%20one%20warning%20of%20any%20type%20%2D%20like%20pytest.warns()%20or%20pytest.warns(Warning).) in the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/changelog.html#pytest-7-0-0rc1-2021-12-06">pytest 7.0.0rc1</a> release notes from 2021-12-06 and in this PR: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8645.</p>
