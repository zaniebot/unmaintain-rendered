            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it would make sense to introduce the following labels:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>core</code> for issues about changing something fundamental about ruff (e.g. introducing a plugin architecture, introducing error severity (warnings vs errors), etc.)</li>
<li><code>CLI</code>, for issues related to the command-line interface (currently <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1473">1473</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1470">1470</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/995">995</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/455">455</a>)</li>
<li><code>autofix</code>, for issues about implementing/improving <code>--fix</code> support for an existing check (several current issues)</li>
<li><code>docstrings</code>, for issues related to docstrings (currently <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/993">993</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/924">924</a>, <a href="https://www.github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/458">458</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>rule</code> label is currently described as &quot;Implementing a known but unsupported lint rule&quot; and apparently not added to issues proposing a new rule when there is no clear existing lint rule it can be modeled after ... I think it would make sense to expand the scope of <code>rule</code> to new rule requests in general (no matter if the rule exists in an existing linter or not).</p>
<p>I also think it would make sense to rename the label <code>enhancement</code> to <code>new feature</code> because arguably any issue here is for some kind of enhancement ... enhancement is too ambiguous.</p>
<p>I am happy to help with triaging (adding labels and updating issue titles to be more descriptive).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like the new labels you've proposed. I'll go ahead and add them today. I also want to add a <code>plugin</code> label since we have a few issues that are &quot;meta-issues&quot; for an entire plugin.</p>
<p><code>enhancement</code> vs. <code>new feature</code> I'm unsure about. I agree <code>enhancement</code> is too ambiguous...</p>
