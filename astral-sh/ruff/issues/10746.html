            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The ecosystem checks perform a comparison between the branch <code>ruff</code> binary and a baseline <code>ruff</code> binary. We pull a baseline binary from the base branch of the pull request:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/814b26f82e1e6a678dc59ee4cd0fc1c277efb517/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L248-L254</p>
<p>GitHub runs pull request CI against a &quot;merge&quot; commit of the pull request HEAD and the base branch. This commit is not guaranteed to be the same commit as we pulled a baseline for above. We see this manifest as incorrect ecosystem reports on pull requests — they include changes for &quot;recently&quot; merged pull requests.</p>
<p>I believe something like the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>A commit is made to main and a baseline binary (1) is uploaded</li>
<li>A commit is made to main and a baseline binary (2) build starts</li>
<li>Open a pull request, a branch binary build starts — this includes the second commit made to main</li>
<li>The pull request ecosystem checks start and pull latest baseline binary (1)</li>
<li>Changes from (2) are incorrectly reported as coming from the pull request</li>
</ul>
