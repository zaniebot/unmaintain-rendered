            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>As mentioned in other issues, (such as <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9554">#9554</a>), adding <code># noqa: I001</code> to the <em>first</em> line disables import sorting for <em>all</em> imports.</p>
<p>I personally think that is very unintuitive on its own, but I understand why it&#x27;s done this way.</p>
<p>What I find even weirder is that the &quot;Organize Imports&quot; code action, present in Ruff LSP integrations in VSCode, Neovim and others, also does not format the imports when executed.</p>
<p>When I manually execute something, shouldn&#x27;t that override any &quot;static&quot; rules? Since organizing imports is more of a formatting action, the user should <em>at least</em> get a warning that nothing actually happened, or the action should not be present at all if that would be the case.</p>
<p>I would prefer it to ignore all restrictions/disablements, but I assume it just executes the <code>ruff check --select I &lt;file&gt; --fix</code> command, so that might be difficult to achieve.</p>
To &quot;reproduce&quot;:
<ol>
<li>copy the following to a file:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code># example.py
import os  # noqa: I001
from json import loads, dumps

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    print(dumps(loads(&quot;file.json&quot;)))
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Open in any editor with Ruff LSP integration.</li>
<li>Invoke &quot;Organize imports&quot; code action.</li>
<li>Nothing happens.</li>
</ol>

<p>I see how this is confusing. We should revisit how <code>noqa</code> suppressions work for isort but that&#x27;s a breaking change. Until then, I recommend you to use the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#action-comments"><code>isort</code> specific suppression comments</a> to disable sorting of a specific import.</p>

<p>I can see the reasoning for this but the CLI and editor must behave exactly the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many users enable <em>organize imports</em> on save and Ruff shouldn&#x27;t make any changes to a file that passed all Ruff tests on the CLI if it remained unchanged. However, this wouldn&#x27;t be the case when implementing this change because the editor would organize the imports that were <em>fine</em> when using the CLI because the CLI respects the noqa comment but the editor doesn&#x27;t</li>
<li>I would find it very confusing if the editor ignored the noqa comment. I&#x27;m explicitly telling Ruff to <em>leave that line alone</em> and, IMO, that has higher priority than me running the <em>organize imports</em> command manually</li>
</ul>
