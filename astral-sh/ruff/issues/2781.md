If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.

`ruff check --select=RET503 --fix .`
```python
def get_value_as_int(value):
    if value.isdigit():
        return int(value)
```

But no **fix** is made.
