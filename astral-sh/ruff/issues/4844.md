# D200: autofix does not work if there are initial/end double quotes in the dockstring

_Issue opened by @saippuakauppias on 2023-06-03 22:40_

Example:
```python
def download_url():
    """
    User-friendly url for further downloading: "/attachments/1234567/"
    """
    ...


def foo():
    """
    "first" second
    """
```

Ruff output:
```sh
$ ruff --fix --select D200 ruff_errors/D200.py

ruff_errors/D200.py:2:5: D200 One-line docstring should fit on one line
ruff_errors/D200.py:9:5: D200 One-line docstring should fit on one line
Found 2 errors.
```

I believe these are intentional. The latter is maybe fixable? But the former can't be fixed without escaping, this introduces a syntax error:

```py
def download_url():
    """User-friendly url for further downloading: "/attachments/1234567/""""
```

Yes, it's probably best to leave it up to users to fix manually, rather than trying to change the type of quotes inside, as I originally thought.
