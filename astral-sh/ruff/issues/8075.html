            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We intend for some fixes to only be available in preview, e.g. #8073 and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7934">astral-sh/ruff#7934</a> but then rules will be displayed as fixable in the documentation without indication that it is only fixable with preview enabled. We worry this will be confusing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was just about to open a new issue about a rule being documented with &quot;Fix is always available.&quot; (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-builtin-import/).</p>
<hr>
<p>On the rule page itself, I think you could have:
&quot;Fix is always available&quot; / &quot;Fix is sometimes available&quot; / (no fix available)
and separately mention that &quot;Some fixes are marked <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#fix-safety">unsafe</a> by default&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to mention that &quot;All fixes are unsafe&quot;. But at a user I wouldn&#x27;t mind being a touch more exact. As long as it is show that I need to run <code>--unsafe-fixes</code> to get all the available fixes.</p>
<hr>
<p>As for the &quot;all rules&quot; page.
You could differentiate between &quot;sometimes autofixable&quot; and &quot;always autofixable&quot; with 🔨 or 🔧, it&#x27;s visually just 🛠️ but with a tool missing. I personally quite like that.</p>
<p>As for fix safety, I&#x27;m less certain of the best way to display that / convey the information concisely. I think that adding a column should be fine.
The first thing that comes to mind is ⚠️, but it looks out of place/scary even when grayed out:

Other suggestions may include ⁉, 🚦, or just annotating the autofix with <code>*</code>, or even get fancy with it with a set-width column (or a 0-width element translated to the right position):
