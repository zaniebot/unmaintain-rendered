            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Same as https://github.com/PyCQA/pep8-naming/issues/215 I think this would be useful whether it is added to pep8-naming or not</p>
<p>Python 3.12 will introduce the <code>override</code> decorator. It is already backported by <code>typing_extensions</code>.</p>
<p>Overridden method names are out of the dev's control when subclassing an external library. A strong example of this is PyQt6/PySide6, where I have to keep adding to <code>ignore-names</code> as I use more and more features. Ruff could understand that there's nothing the dev can do about the names if a method is marked with <code>@override</code> (and it'll still raise anyway on the base class if it's internal).</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.pep8-naming]
# PyQt methods
ignore-names = [&quot;closeEvent&quot;, &quot;paintEvent&quot;, &quot;keyPressEvent&quot;, &quot;mousePressEvent&quot;, &quot;mouseMoveEvent&quot;, &quot;mouseReleaseEvent&quot;]
