            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to know if I can adjust the quotations showing in the problems from ` ` (backquote) to ' ' or &quot; &quot; (single/ double quote) through configurations. For instance, I desire the {name} showed in the problem to be 'name' (just like flake8) or &quot;name&quot; instead of `name`. Ruff does help me a lot but it really bother me by this stuff since I simply don't like the backquote.  I would appreciate it if you could provide a new setting option to solve this. BTW I'm currently using the Ruff VSCode extention. Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, this isn't currently configurable. I think it's a reasonable choice for us and to be honest, we're unlikely to parametrize it just given the maintenance burden.</p>
