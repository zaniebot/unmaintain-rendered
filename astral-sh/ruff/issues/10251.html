            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is arguably a true positive, since <code>tz=None</code> is equivalent to omitting it, in that it won&#x27;t produce a timezone-aware object. Perhaps the documentation and message need to be tweaked to reflect that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it’s arguable. No arguments could be a mistake (and is a common one). Explicitly passing None is acknowledging that you actually want None. In my case I want to use UTC everywhere except in a helper script.</p>
<p>But yes at least an error message tweak would be nice.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I also view it as borderline. I could definitely be convinced to ignore it. May need more opinions. @AlexWaygood, what do you think?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like we&#x27;re following what the original flake8 rule does here, which is explicitly going out of its way to make sure that calls are still flagged when <code>None</code> is passed to this argument: https://github.com/pjknkda/flake8-datetimez/blob/1bcda18963ef61861a57c86f83741172884aadd1/flake8_datetimez.py#L96-L110. (But that&#x27;s obviously not decisive -- if this is bad behaviour, we shouldn&#x27;t do it!)</p>
<p>I... am sort-of inclined to leave this rule as it is, though. It&#x27;s simple to explain currently: &quot;aware datetimes are good; naive datetimes are bad&quot;. Keeping a rule simple to explain to users and easy to describe in documentation is valuable. Moreover, if we changed the behaviour here, it&#x27;s possible people who don&#x27;t understand the rationale behind the rule might think that they&#x27;re &quot;fixing&quot; the issue by passing <code>None</code> (since the linter stops complaining at them). That wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be true.</p>
<p>I feel like if you&#x27;re working in a domain where you don&#x27;t need aware timezones, you can probably just not enable this rule on your project. And if you have a specific script in a larger project where it&#x27;s just that script that doesn&#x27;t need aware timezones, you can probably just put <code># ruff: noqa: DTZ005</code> somewhere near the top of the file.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s a fair point, I hadn&#x27;t thought of that.</p>
<p>I guess the other recommendation is to do:</p>
<pre><code>datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc).astimezone()
</code></pre>
<p>Which I think gives you the local timezone, although it&#x27;s not as simple as <code>tz=None</code></p>
<p>Either way, whatever you choose is fine by my, I just wanted to bring it to attention.</p>
