<p>I never encountered that error in a production code, but I have a lot of it in my tests, that check if calling that property raises an error (second example of the error). Similarly to what was described in #3831. I understand that this is context-specific and in some situations it would be better to get that error even for the cost of a few false-positives. Or maybe it could be less strict in a context of test files? Removing the <em>property</em> decorator and calling it as a method fixes the error.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, thanks for providing a detailed issue. Do you think the solution mentioned in the linked issue (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3831#issuecomment-1493202616) can help your use-case?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this observation is correct. We avoid triggering this rule if the expression can potentially contain any side effects like a function call.</p>
<p>I'll close this in favor of the linked issue.</p>
