# Should `subclass-builtin (FURB189)` not apply to stubs?

---

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2025-01-06 03:24_

I don't think that [subclass-builtin (FURB189)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/subclass-builtin/#subclass-builtin-furb189) should apply to stubs (it currently does).
Stubs authors should aim to faithfully represent the runtime implementation. And if the runtime subclasses `dict`, `list` or `str`. So should the stubs.

Third-party stub authors have no control on this. First-party stubs would get `FURB189` in their source `.py` files.

Ruff: 0.8.5 (rule is currently in preview)
