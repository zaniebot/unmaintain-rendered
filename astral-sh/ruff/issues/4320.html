Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Please see the below code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Worker:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Asynchronous worker.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    def wait(self) -&gt; bool:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Wait for worker thread to join.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        # Code wraps threading.Event.wait()


def wait_all(*workers: Worker) -&gt; bool:
    return all([w.wait() for w in workers])  # List stops short circuit
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>ruff==0.0.265</code>, and running <code>ruff --select=C419 --fix a.py</code>, it removes the <code>list</code> cast:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def wait_all(*workers: Worker) -&gt; bool:
    return all(w.wait() for w in workers)  # List stops short circuit
</code></pre>
<p>However, this actually added a subtle bug, because now the <code>all</code> statement will be short-circuited.  This short circuiting (in my scenario here) will cause all workers beyond the first <code>w.wait()</code> return of <code>False</code> to not be awaited.</p>
<p>I think <code>C4</code> autofixing should not be applied within <code>all</code>/<code>any</code>, as these can be short circuited, which can cause undesirable side effects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, this is intentional. In the future we'll probably qualify this as a suggested, and not an automated fix, since it changes the semantics of the program, but I wouldn't want to remove it entirely, since this is the entire rule and it's generally the correct fix.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to share my two cents here, I agree removing extra <code>list</code> casts is generally the correct fix, especially with argument unpacking into <code>*args</code>.</p>
<p>I would argue though, when short circuiting can happen, that <code>C4</code> actually changes the core behavior.  Imo autofixes should not be able to change fundamental behaviors.</p>
