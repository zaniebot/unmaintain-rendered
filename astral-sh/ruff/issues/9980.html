            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider this long string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;This is a long string. Yeah it's really long. I think I need multiple lines to have a meaningful formatting.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Most times, you will split this into something like this to have a meaningful formatting in an acceptable line length</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(
    &quot;This is a long string. Yeah it's really long.&quot;
    &quot;I think I need multiple lines to have a meaningful formatting.&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<p>I missed the trailing whitespace or a newline at the end of the second sentence</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(
    &quot;This is a long string. Yeah it's really long.&quot;
                                                # ^ [ ] or \n is missing
    &quot;I think I need multiple lines to have a meaningful formatting.&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<p>and this would create an undesired string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">-This is a long string. Yeah it's really long. I think I need multiple lines to have a meaningful formatting.
+This is a long string. Yeah it's really long.I think I need multiple lines to have a meaningful formatting.
</code></pre>
<p>I would suggest what Ruff checks on <em>split</em> strings, that all lines except the last line end in <code>[ ]&quot;</code> or in <code>\n&quot;</code> as the version without whitespace or newline is basically never desired.</p>
