            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The following example</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;&quot;&quot;Example __init__.py problem.&quot;&quot;&quot;
from .defs import AnotherClass, CLASS

__all__ = [
    &quot;AnotherClass&quot;,
    &quot;CLASS&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>with this option in <code>ruff.toml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[lint.isort]
classes = [&quot;CLASS&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>should result in no errors because of the overridden PEP8 type inference with <code>classes</code>, but <code>RUF022</code> still triggers.</p>
<p>This is a small issue which I only noticed because the order of <code>__all__</code> can be used in <code>sphinx-autodoc</code>. Still, this seems unexpected behavior in my opinion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This makes some sense to me, my only hesitation is that we we have a lot of isort settings, and it doesn't look like the rule accounts for any of them, preferring a simpler sort. I think that's in line with the &quot;isort-style&quot; part of the docs. It could be a bit of a slippery slope to start using some of the isort options, but I'm open to other thoughts!</p>
<p>This is more of an implementation detail than an essential issue, but structurally it also looks like it would be difficult to access the <code>LinterSettings</code> where the sort actually takes place.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, thanks for responding so quickly :)</p>
<p>I would understand why this is hard to fix or out of scope, but maybe this can somehow be documented? For example <code>RUF022</code> could state that (currently?) the <code>isort</code> settings are ignored?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah that's a good idea to clarify this in the rule docs!</p>
