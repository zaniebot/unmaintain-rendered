            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is related to the <code>await</code> outside async function syntax error, which currently corresponds to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/await-outside-async/">await-outside-async (PLE1142)</a>. It's not currently an issue because the syntax error is still converted to a PLE1142 diagnostic in ruff, but we'll want to have a plan for handling this before stabilizing it as a syntax error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This one might not belong in syntax-errors and might be better to remain as a disableable rule. Top level await is allowed if the module is compiled with https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT. This is useful when working with pyodide, as modules can assume an event loop is running prior to them being imported.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we'll want this one to be suppressible on a per-project basis in red-knot as well. Mypy has had similar issues when it comes to checking Jupyter notebooks, which can sometimes use <code>await</code> at the top level. (I'm guessing we'll check Jupyter notebooks as isolated projects from red-knot.) See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15339, https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18795, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We haven't explored Jupyter Notebook support for red-knot but (a bit hand wavy) I don't think it would be an isolated project because the notebook can import modules from the current project. Anyways, we don't need to discuss that here.</p>

<li>Keep it a rule</li>

<p>I don't think this is a realistic option for non-notebook files: for the vast majority of Python code this is a syntax error; we should definitely flag it by default for non-notebooks.</p>
<p>I'm not totally familiar with the situation for notebooks, honestly, as I've never seriously used notebooks. I can't tell you whether top-level <code>await</code>s are allowed by default in notebooks or if it's only if some settings are enabled. I believe they're much more common in notebooks than in regular Python source code, however. For notebooks, we <em>may</em> want it to be an opt-in diagnostic rather than an opt-out diagnostic.</p>
<p>And even for regular Python source code, we'll want this to be at least suppressible on a per-file basis. Although it's pretty rare to use <code>ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT</code> for non-notebooks, it is <em>possible</em>.</p>
<p>I don't have strong opinions on how we make this diagnostic suppressible -- whether it stays as a linter rule or if you add per-file parser options.</p>

<p>For Notebooks, if the backend uses <code>ipykernel</code> (which is probably most of the notebooks) there's an option <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/autoawait.html#using-autoawait-in-a-notebook-ipykernel"><code>autoawait</code></a> which is enabled by default but a user can turn it off which would then make top-level <code>async</code> usages a syntax error. So, we should definitely have that as opt-in at least for notebooks.</p>
