<p><sup>Originally posted by <strong>boolean-light</strong> March 14, 2024</sup>
I've run into lots of bugs related to assignments of mutables (e.g. lists, dicts, sets), like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">array = [1, 2, 3]
temp_array = array
temp_array[0] = 42  # This will change content of original array also!
print(temp_array)  # [42, 2, 3]
print(array)  # [42, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>But as far as I know, there are no rules which gives warning about this.
Could we add warning or possibly fixes (e.g. suggesting <code>copy</code> or <code>deepcopy</code>)?</p>
<p>Probably because it requires type inference, it will be difficult to make it work for something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">array = [1, 2, 3]  # This is not intended to be modified

def change_first(arr):
    arr[0] = 42
    return arr

add_first(array)  # This will change the array
print(array)  # [42, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>But I think we could do this, like for first example, where the type of variable is straightforward.</div></p>
<p>Thought this could be opened as an issue, related to #10505.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand that the rule you're asking for is to warn if multiple variables point to the same data and that data gets mutated because a user might not be aware that it mutates the state of other variables as well. Is that correct?</p>
<p>One of the main challenges here is having a reasonable precise alias analysis. I would have to think through more examples. My worry is that there are many valid use cases for this. For example. your <code>change_first</code> example seems fine to me.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Realized this will be fine after revising my code, and probably this should be marked as one valid type.</p>
<p>I think it is fine for the narrow case where two different names are just pointing to the same &quot;reference&quot; and same binding, but I agree that we should consider more examples before implementing this.</p>
