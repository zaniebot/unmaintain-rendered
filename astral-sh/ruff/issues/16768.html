            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Filing a public issue instead of reporting this as a private vulnerability, since this malware is a publicly known and an urgent issue.</p>
<p>ruff uses a compromised version of tj-actions/changed-files. The compromised action appears to leak secrets the runner has in memory.</p>
<p>The action is included in: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml</p>
<p>Output of an affected run on ruff: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/13868731237/job/38812473949?pr=16641#step:3:113</p>
<p>Please review.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! We were notified about this yesterday and currently have all non-Astral actions disabled (effectively disabling CI) while we work on a longer-term fix. We also rotated all of our secrets that could have been affected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should be resolved by:</p>
<ol>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16788, which removed the compromised action</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16789, which should prevent similar tag-altering attacks in the future</li>
</ol>
<p>We also replaced the action's functionality with a git command (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16796) like in uv (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12188) and python-build-standalone (https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/pull/559).</p>
<p>Thank you again for the report!</p>
