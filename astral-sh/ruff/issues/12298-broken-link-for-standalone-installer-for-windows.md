# Broken link for standalone installer for Windows

It seems that https://astral.sh/ruff/install.ps1 doesn't work but https://astral.sh/ruff/0.5.1/install.ps1 does. The former leads to a 404 page on the website.

This is fixed (but may take some time for cache to propagate if you tried it while 404ing).
