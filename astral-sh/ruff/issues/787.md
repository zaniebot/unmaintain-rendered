# Add rule to use sys.exit() instead of exit()

---

_Issue opened by @JonathanPlasse on 2022-11-17 13:54_

`exit()` is not a built-in function and is only defined if the site module is imported during Python's initialization (which, for example, can be disabled with `-S` option passed to the interpreter). You should use `sys.exit()` instead:
```suggestion
    sys.exit(os.spawnv(os.P_WAIT, ruff, [ruff, *sys.argv[1:]]))
```

Fixed, thanks. (Ruff should have a rule for this!)

I would like to implement it.
In which rule group would this be added?

Awesome! This should go in the `RUF` group since it's new / custom to Ruff.

How can I check if `exit()` has not been overridden?
Which, in this case, should not trigger an error.

We have to resolve that for https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/780. We need to check if the `BindingKind` on the identifier is still `BindingKind::Builtin`. You could omit it for now if you'd rather wait until it's solved for #780.
