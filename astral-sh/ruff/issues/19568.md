# C409 fix omits comma for `tuple([1],)`

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-07-26 13:17_

### Summary

If a `tuple` call has a trailing comma and its argument is a single-element list display, the fix for [unnecessary-literal-within-tuple-call (C409)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-literal-within-tuple-call/) doesn’t add a trailing comma, which changes the program’s behavior. [Example](https://play.ruff.rs/be6e84f6-a364-4093-b2d5-dacd7aa12816):
```console
$ cat >c409.py <<'# EOF'
print(tuple([1],))
# EOF

$ python c409.py
(1,)

$ ruff --isolated check c409.py --select C409 --unsafe-fixes --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ cat c409.py
print((1))

$ python c409.py
1
```
