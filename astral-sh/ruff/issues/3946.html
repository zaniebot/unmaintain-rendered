            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since Ruff already implements <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#isort-i">isort</a>, it would be nice to see <a href="https://github.com/bwhmather/ssort">ssort</a> implemented as well.</p>
<p>This plugin automatically reorders the contents of a python file so that statements are placed after the things they depend making navigation easier within the file. For example (from the ssort GitHub page):
Before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from module import BaseClass

def function():
    return _dependency()

def _decorator(fn):
    return fn

@_decorator
def _dependency():
    return Class()

class Class(BaseClass):
    def public_method(self):
        return self

    def __init__(self):
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>After:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from module import BaseClass

class Class(BaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def public_method(self):
        return self

    def _decorator(fn):
        return fn

@_decorator
def _dependency():
    return Class()

def function():
    return _dependency()
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is an active <a href="https://github.com/bwhmather/ssort/issues/18">issue</a> in <code>ssort</code> asking for more sorting options. This could be part of <code>tool.ruff.ssort.sorting-order</code>. Although, I'm not sure if top-down is the correct order for a scripting language such as Python since lookups happen immediately as described <a href="https://github.com/bwhmather/ssort#why-does-ssort-sort-bottom-up-rather-than-top-down">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are some issues on <code>ssort</code>'s GitHub page asking for options to change the sorting order. So that could work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So after looking and understanding ssort's implementation, it definitely looks like it would be better to just re-write it entirely from the ground up. I'm gonna work on some other rules so I can get a bit more practice with Ruff's codebase first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @Aspect1103! I'm a ssort collaborator and have recently really taken an interest in ruff. I think there's a lot of promise here, specifically from a performance perspective. We spent considerable effort optimizing ssort's performance, but pure python can only take you so far. I could easily see a pure rust implementation having orders of magnitude better performance! Let me know if I can help out in any way!</p>

<p>Hi, I haven't yet had a go with making some Ruff plugins, so you could take this one on if you want.</p>
