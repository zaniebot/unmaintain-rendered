            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When I type a short code in the search bar on the website (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff), for example <code>ruf005</code>, the search suggestion is a link to the list of warnings. When I type a long code, for example <code>collection-literal-concatenation</code>, the search suggestion is a direct link to the warning's article. Could the short code case be changed?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, that's unfortunate. We would have to look into our Algolia search configuration to see how it index pages and either change the Algolia configuration or the structure of the rule's page. I don't think I've access to Algolia (@charliermarsh )</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Author of Material for MkDocs here – results should drastically improve once we release <a href="https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/6307">the new search</a>, which is currently blocked by a bigger refactor we're working on in the background (@charliermarsh we talked about this recently), as mentioned in <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2024/08/19/how-were-transforming-material-for-mkdocs/">our latest blog post</a>. Once we got a first version of that ready, we'll reach out to you for giving it a try ☺️ We estimate that this should be the case by the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, as a bandaid, you should be able to improve discovery by using tags, and tagging each rule with its modifier. Tags currently take precedence over everything else in search:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">---
tags:
- ruf005
---

# Tag name
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've pushed a PR that adds these tags to the function used to generate the page metadata - I think this should be all that's required but absolutely open to input &amp; feedback on how to do it.</p>
