            <div class="timeline-body"><p>F-string error recovery within list parsing is good but it breaks when it's within a parenthesized context.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">bad_function_call(
    param1=f'test
    param2='test'
)
</code></pre>
<p>The re-lexing will reduce the nesting level when recovering from an unclosed f-string but the lexer isn't in an expression element so the nesting level it reduced is the one from the outer context. This means that it'll emit an <code>Indent</code> token before <code>param2</code> which is incorrect.</p>
<p>Another example is when the parser is recovering from within a format spec,</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">bad_function_call(
    param1=f'test{x:.3f,
    param2='test'
)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the parser uses the same list parsing logic for parsing both the outer f-string elements and the ones in the format specifier. This means that when it tries to recover from an unclosed f-string, it reduces the nesting level twice (1) when re-lexing from the format spec and (2) when re-lexing from the outer f-string.</p>
<h3>Todo</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Reduce the nesting level only if the parser is recovering from within an expression element of an f-string (<code>fstring.is_in_expression</code>)</li>
<li>[ ] Avoid calling into re-lexing when recovering from the format specifier. Let the recovery from the outer context (f-string) take care of that.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(1) is difficult because by the time we're re-lexing, the f-string context is no longer on the stack because the lexer removed it when encountering a newline character. Another potential reason to do https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11916.</p>
