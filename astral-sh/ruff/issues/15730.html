            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>It would be nice if the rule documentation pages (e.g. https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/literal-membership/) directly linked to an issue search on this repo for the rule code (e.g., https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20plr6201%20 ). This can help users understand the subtleties of a rule better by pointing them to previously reported problems with the rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think ideally rules that have known issues would either have them fixed or would have a &quot;Known issues&quot; section in their docs, like e.g. https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/os-path-join/#known-issues :-)</p>
<p>But I do like the idea that this could be an automated thing that we roll out for all our docs pages at once.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A listing of known issues is nice and arguably better but it means manual maintenance work.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that even closed issues may provide helpful context. For example, for PLR6201, there are some closed issues that provide more information on the performance effects of the change.</p>
