<p>List of keywords searched before creating this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F841</code></li>

<p>Minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test.py
C = 13

def f():
    match 13:
        case C:
            pass
</code></pre>
<p>Invoked command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ruff check --isolated --select F841 test.py
</code></pre>
<p>Current Ruff settings: -</p>
<p>Current Ruff version: <code>ruff 0.9.6</code></p>
<p>I expected it to not mark line 6 with <code>F841</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a true positive because Python doesn't treat the <code>C</code> in the <code>case</code> as a constant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt;&gt;&gt; C = 13
&gt;&gt;&gt; match 2:
...     case C:
...         print(C)
...
2
</code></pre>
<p>It should actually probably mark both <code>C = 13</code> <em>and</em> <code>case C</code> as unused.</p>
<p>I believe you have to use an <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/#matching-against-constants-and-enums">enum</a> (or other dotted name) to match against a constant like this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wait, is it pattern matching my constant?</p>
<p>If so I guess the behavior's correct. It's defining a variable and it's unused. Just a bit confusing.</p>
<p>I think you can close this one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I find this behavior very tricky and have run into it myself before :)</p>
<p>I'll keep the issue open for now to see if we could possibly emit two warnings here. That's what Rust does, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let c = 1;  // unused variable
    match 2 {
        c =&gt; {} // unused variable
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I think that would also help to clarify the <code>case</code> issue, at least a little bit.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I took a closer look at this, and this <em>is</em> a bug that we'd like to fix with the Rust-style behavior, but it's being tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6704, so I <em>will</em> close this for now. Thanks for opening the issue!</p>
