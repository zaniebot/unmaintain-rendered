            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This plugin is quite similar than <code>flake8-quotes</code>, but it contains some nice checks such as warning about unnecessary quote escapes, e.g. <code>'foo\&quot;bar'</code> (which, in fact, are created by ruff's fixer - I've opened a separate issue about this: #8617).</p>
<p><code>.flake8</code> config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">[flake8]

literal-multiline-quotes = single
literal-docstring-quotes = double
literal-avoid-escape = true

f = &quot;check 'that'&quot;
g = 'check \'this\' &quot;and that&quot; \'and this\''
h = &quot;check \&quot;this\&quot; 'and that' \&quot;and this\&quot;&quot;

i = &quot;foo\'bar&quot;
j = 'foo\&quot;bar'


def foo():
    '''doc'''

</code></pre>
<p>In particular it would be nice if anything related to avoid escaping would actually pick the quote style to ensure the least amount of escapes (in case the string contains both types of quotes). Maybe even consider switching to a triple-quoted string, but maybe that's a bit more controversial and should be configurable...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My first impression is that some of these feel redundant with existing rules, e.g., &quot;Use double quotes for docstring&quot; exists in the <code>D</code> rule set. The one I could imagine including is the unnecessary escape rule. We have <code>W605</code> which checks for <em>invalid</em> escapes, but not <em>unnecessary</em> escapes.</p>
<p>I do consider this low priority since the formatter already performs this normalization and removes unnecessary escapes, but I'd accept a contribution for such a rule in the `Q set.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That was the main one I was interested in. These ones at least sound interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>LIT015 - Use double quotes for continuation strings to match</li>
<li>LIT016 - Use single quotes for continuation strings to match</li>
</ul>
<p>This code currently triggers a warning in flake8-quotes but not in ruff (with single-quote preference):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">foo = (
    &quot;i'm&quot;
    &quot;really&quot;  # &lt;-- does not need double quotes
    'cool'
)
</code></pre>
<p>But probably this could be a setting that affects the existing Q000 rule (whether consistency for continuation strings should be preferred, avoided or ignored).</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>LIT101 - Remove raw prefix when not using escapes</li>
<li>LIT102 - Use raw prefix to avoid escaped slash</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no rules for this yet. Could be a nice one to add.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>LIT103 - Use raw prefix for re pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no rule for this one yet. It's pretty common to always use raw strings for regexps regardless whether there are any escapes in it or not (but it's particularly useful when there are escapes!), so at least for those passed directly as literals to the various functions from the <code>re</code> module a warning could be shown (probably not worth trying to track variables when the regex string is first assigned to a variable and that variable gets passed to one of these functions, unless there's already functionality for such logic making it simple to do as well).</p>
