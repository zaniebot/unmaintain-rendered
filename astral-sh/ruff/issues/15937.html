<p>The following code is correct</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Iterable
a = Iterable[&#x27;ciao&#x27;] | &#x27;ciao&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>However it gets tagged as wrong by UP35 and automatically fixed to</p>
<pre><code>from collections.abc import Iterable
a = Iterable[&#x27;ciao&#x27;] | &#x27;ciao&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>And the fixed code is wrong.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m marking this issue as a bug since it&#x27;s true that the autofix changes behaviour here, and ideally we should fix that. FWIW, though, I&#x27;d recommend always quoting the entire union if you&#x27;re using forward references in a PEP-604 union, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>from collections.abc import Iterable
a = &#x27;Iterable[ciao] | ciao&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>You can get unpredictable results (like this) otherwise. This is the official advice given at https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-union</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The original code is wrong as well, see <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/runtime-string-union/"><code>runtime-string-union</code></a> for why.</p>
<p>However, since you&#x27;re using an implicit type alias, ruff can&#x27;t know that using <code>|</code> here is not allowed. If you want ruff to be able to detect <code>TC010</code> here, then you need to switch to an explicit type alias: https://play.ruff.rs/9bd2d888-0d78-43af-bc0e-2e7b8da5d5dc</p>

<p>I&#x27;d say that the original code is &quot;ill-advised&quot; @Daverball, but it&#x27;s true that it does work at runtime :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You&#x27;re right. I didn&#x27;t know the aliases in the typing module had some special magic to convert strings to <code>ForwardRef</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah... and it&#x27;s arguably somewhat regrettable that they do, since it leads to highly confusing situationsn like this :/ but it can&#x27;t realistically be reversed now</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I was not aware that even my code was &#x27;ill-advised&#x27; wrong!
Thanks for letting me know!</p>
<p>However my point stands...
I had some &#x27;working&#x27; (albeit incorrect) code that ruff broke when I added UP rules.
I was not aware of TC rules.
I imagine you&#x27;d like to avoid this happening.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to suggest turning on TC010 with UP035 and some other UP rules as well?</p>

<p>Yes, we agree that this is a bug in Ruff that should be fixed :-) The autofix for this rule isn&#x27;t meant to change the behaviour of your code!</p>

<p>Hmm, not sure -- this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen this come up, so I don&#x27;t think many people run into this issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The easiest way to address this would probably be to mark the fix as unsafe if the parent node to any of the references is a union <code>BinOp</code> and either the node directly to the left or directly to the right is a string.</p>
<p>Eventually if #15222 or #15635 gets merged, we could reuse that fix to extend the quotes and make the fix safe again if it doesn&#x27;t get rid of any comments.</p>
