<p>Currently we use <code>ubuntu-20.04</code>:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/877c1066d3373f9089e71a15123b769d924ff2a6/.github/workflows/release.yml#L53</p>
<p>But, it&#x27;s deprecated and will be removed soon: <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/11101">actions/runner-images#11101</a></p>
<p>Note that the <code>release.yml</code> is auto-generated via <code>cargo-dist</code> (<a href="https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/1760">axodotdev/cargo-dist#1760</a>).</p>
<p>This shouldn&#x27;t block any releases in February but they could fail in March given the brownout periods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ubuntu 20.04 runner image will be fully unsupported by April 1, 2025. To raise awareness of the upcoming removal, we will temporarily fail jobs using Ubuntu 20.04. Builds that are scheduled to run during the brownout periods will fail. The brownouts are scheduled for the following dates and times:</p>
<p>March 4 14:00 UTC – 22:00 UTC
March 11 13:00 UTC – 21:00 UTC
March 18 13:00 UTC – 21:00 UTC
March 25 13:00 UTC – 21:00 UTC</p>
