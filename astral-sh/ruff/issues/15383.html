            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve opened individual issues for the remaining tasks for overloads, marking this as complete. The main task which is alpha-worthy is the implementation of the overload call evaluation algorithm but others can be done later on.</p>
<p>I also had a couple of tasks here which I don&#x27;t think requires a separate issue for the reasons mentioned below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update property tests to generate overloaded callables, if possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple way to do this would just to be to generate a random number of callables between 2-5 and mark them as overload but not provide an implementation because otherwise the implementation would be required to be consistent with the overloads. My main worry here is the soundness of the overloaded definition. It can very well generate an overlapping overload which might create unsoundness which would then create failures in property tests.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I looked at a couple of them and the signatures are different than what&#x27;s present in the typeshed. I think this is for a reason so I&#x27;m dropping this for now and something that could be done on a case-by-case basis in the future when we&#x27;re at a place where these special cases aren&#x27;t required.</p>
<p>Happy to hear if others have any comments here.</p>
