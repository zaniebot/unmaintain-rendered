            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ruff</code> does not correctly identify f-strings with no placeholders if they are being concatenated with other f-strings that <em>do</em> have placeholders. e.g:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">placeholder = &quot;placeholder&quot;
(
    f&quot;first line no placeholder&quot;
    f&quot;second line with {placeholder}&quot;
)
(
    f&quot;first line with {placeholder}&quot;
    f&quot;second line with  no placeholder&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ruff check t.py
All checks passed!
</code></pre>
<p>The error is correctly found if there is no other f-string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">placeholder = &quot;placeholder&quot;
(
    f&quot;first line no placeholder&quot;
    &quot;second line with no placeholder&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ruff check t.py
t.py:3:5: F541 [*] f-string without any placeholders
Found 1 error.
[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.
</code></pre>
<p>This was demonstrated in a clean venv with <code>ruff</code> 0.3.5.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It was agreed in #10886 that this rule, to match the behaviour of <code>pyflakes</code>, should not detect this as a violation.</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that there's any deliberate reason for doing that in <code>pyflakes</code> (it was brought up in PyCQA/pyflakes#552 but the only discussion was about why the AST is that way rather than why the rule doesn't consider it a problem). But, for compatibility, leaving this rule alone makes sense.</p>
<p>I'll close this issue, since F541 is behaving as expected.</p>
