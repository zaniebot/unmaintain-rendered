# force-wrap-aliases = true has no effect

_Issue opened by @tekumara on 2022-12-09 07:04_

```
from .utils import (
    test_directory as test_directory,
    test_id as test_id
)
```

is fixed as

```
from .utils import test_directory as test_directory
from .utils import test_id as test_id
```

when _pyproject.toml_ contains:
```
[tool.ruff.isort]
force-wrap-aliases = true
```

I though it would remain as is, as per the docs

ruff 0.0.171

Ah right, I didn't this realise from the docs, but it looks like `force-wrap-aliases` requires `combine-as-imports`, eg:

```
[tool.ruff.isort]
combine-as-imports = true
force-wrap-aliases = true
```

will leave the following as is:
```
from .utils import (
    test_directory as test_directory,
    test_id as test_id
)
```

It appears `combine-as-imports` applies only to lines longer than the line length, whereas `combine-as-import` together with `force-wrap-aliases` means every import gets its own line.

Yeah that’s right. I can add a note in the docs.
