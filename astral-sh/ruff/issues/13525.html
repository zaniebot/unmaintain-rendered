            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff is a great linter and formatter, we all don&#x27;t have any doubts 👍🏼 Thank you guys for maintaining this project!</p>
<p>However, Ruff also includes some rules related to static type-checking, for example: ANN.</p>
<p>Could it be possible to set up Ruff to automatically turn off those rules if a type-checker is configured, let us say <code>mypy</code>? In such a scenario, extra &quot;type-checking&quot; with Ruff looks like a redundancy to me.</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind words</p>

<p>I see the motivation for this but we very intentionally avoid reading configurations from other tools to avoid surprising behavior and incompatibilities (we don&#x27;t know the other tool&#x27;s version and ruff would break if the tool changes its configuration).</p>

<p>Some of those rules indeed overlap with what some type checkers do, but I consider their nature to be mostly linting (it enforces a specific style) rather than correct typing. I think it&#x27;s best if users disable the rules manually if they know that their type checker of choice already covers them.</p>
