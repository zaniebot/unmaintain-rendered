            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To avoid long lines for my variable declarations, sometimes I put the type hint for the variable on the line above. This avoids it getting reformatted into three lines by Black. A silly example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Hello:
    world: str
    world = &quot;Something with enough characters that I want to put the type on a separate line above to avoid ugly parenthesis.&quot;
</code></pre>

(Reformatted with Black because my line was too long when I put the type in it.)

<pre><code class="language-python">class Hello:
    world: str = (
        &quot;Something with enough characters that I want to put the type on a separate line above to avoid ugly parenthesis.&quot;
    )
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When I run ruff with this config, the second line gets removed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
select = [&quot;PIE794&quot;]
fix = true
</code></pre>
<p>Leaving just this behind...</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Hello:
    world: str
</code></pre>
<p>At first I thought this could be updated to not count type type annotations as a a variable &quot;definition&quot;. But given <a href="https://github.com/sbdchd/flake8-pie#pie794-dupe-class-field-definitions">the context</a> of the rule (&quot;...can occur in large ORM model definitions&quot;), I am not sure that would work. I think FastAPI uses dataclass-like classes for ORM stuff. And those just declare the type annotations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># A Pydantic model
class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    joined: date
</code></pre>
<p>The solution I am thinking of right now is not allowing two declarations of the same &quot;type&quot;, where the types are assigning a value or just adding a type annotation. That would catch duplicate <em>actual</em> definitions in dataclass-like things and regular classes, while allowing me to do my formatting trick.</p>
<p>But the parenthesis really are not that bad, and maybe that solution is a lot of work. So this is a very tentative feature request.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, I was running this on version 0.0.237.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I hate saying no to things, especially when the proposal is as clearly laid out as this one... but I think this would add more complexity than I'd like, to accommodate a pretty specific use-case (no offense intended -- I can totally see why you prefer the above, I just don't see it as a super common pattern).</p>
