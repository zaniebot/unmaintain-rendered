            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>we have a rather large codebase and we extensively use <code>ruff</code> to manage rules and lint across the developers in the organizations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is a good idea to introduce a new ruff lint rule.
But invariably there is a portion of the codebase that does not respect the new rule. Absolutely understandably.</p>
<p>It would be great to have some sort of ratcheting system.</p>
<ul>
<li>We introduce a new rule, so new code must follow it.</li>
<li>Old code that already follow the rules cannot break the rule.</li>
<li>Old code that does not respect the rule, can still break the rule.</li>
<li>As soon as old code respect the rule, it cannot go back to breaking it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that this will require keeping state, and that we may not be in the position to implement it.</p>
<p>The closer thing I can come up with is introducing the new rule and push all the files that don't follow it in the <code>per-file-ignore</code>, however we do need a way to get files out of there as soon as they start following the rule.</p>
<p>Ideally, a file in the <code>per-file-ignores</code> that pass the lint, should raise a warning or even an error. A bit like https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-noqa/#unused-noqa-ruf100</p>
<p>I would not mind running a separate command, or the lint with a different command line argument.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One of the ways we've considered handling this is through &quot;baselines,&quot; which are tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1149. Another option mentioned in that thread is using the <code>--add-noqa</code> flag to suppress all of the known instances of an error, which is at least a bit more precise than ignoring the files outright. I think that's still probably the best option today, especially now that <code>--add-noqa</code> supports an optional reason argument (like <code>--add-noqa=&quot;ruff baseline&quot;</code>) and will work with RUF100.</p>
<p>Applying <code>RUF100</code> to unused <code>per-file-ignores</code> is interesting too, I hadn't thought about that before!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>&quot;baseline&quot; is what I called &quot;state&quot; in my original message, I reckon.</p>
<p>That would work as well for us.</p>
<p>I am glad that this was already asked and already some brain power was used on it. If you need any use case example, I will be more than happy to help.</p>
