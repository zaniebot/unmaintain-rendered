            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my repository, I would like to start using ruff, but I face the following issue</p>
<ul>
<li>ruff uses noqa comments for line local disables</li>
<li>I have a local flake8 plugin which adds certain checks</li>
<li>I use yesqa to find unnecessary noqa comments</li>
</ul>
<p>This combination is not possible to use, as yesqa will remove noqa comments from ruff. As the maintainer of yesqa/flake8 claim a &quot;kind of ownership&quot; of the noqa comment and won't implement something, it would be great if ruff could allow an alias for noqa.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@kasium I can relate to your problem, I've mostly transitioned to ruff at this point, but have to still rely on a small number of flake8 plugins to fill in some gaps.</p>
<p>While I agree that it would be nice to keep something like <code>yesqa</code>/<code>flake8-noqa</code> functional in this hybrid setup, it's also true that if the number of codes you still need flake8 for is low, then the need for <code>yesqa</code> or <code>flake8-noqa</code> should also be low enough, that it's a reasonable trade-off to just not have it for those few external rules. All of the other unused noqa comments will be covered by ruff. I don't think this issue is large enough, that it warrants ruff having to work around the unwillingness of flake8 plugin authors to implement the equivalent of the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_external"><code>external</code></a> setting to <code>yesqa</code>/<code>flake8-noqa</code>.</p>
<p>If you do decide that you still need it for the remaining flake8 rules you can't move to ruff, you can always fork <code>yesqa</code> or <code>flake8-noqa</code> and implement that feature yourself. In fact if you're fine with using <code>flake8-noqa</code> instead of <code>yesqa</code> (you'd lose out on the automatic fix), then @Avasam already has done most of the work for you: https://github.com/plinss/flake8-noqa/pull/30</p>
<p>But I imagine it would be very easy to add the equivalent feature to a fork of <code>yesqa</code> as well.</p>
