            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>My preferred settings have been to enforce no line length, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">lint.select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]

lint.ignore = [&quot;E501&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Ignoring <code>E501</code> prevents line length warnings.  However, I also want to use <code>isort</code> via I001, but if an import statement exceeds the default line length of 88, I get this error: <code>I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted</code>.  This error is pretty vague since it mentions nothing about line length, but when I use <code>--fix</code> it breaks the line into numerous ones, which is undesirable.</p>
<p>In the past I've been able to get around this by setting <code>line-length = 10000</code>, but as of <code>ruff</code> 0.14 it seems that a maximum of 320 is enforced.  So now it seems impossible to permit unlimited line length while using I001.</p>
<p>Is there another workaround?  Or perhaps there should be a new <code>line-length</code> configuration specifically for <code>isort</code>, analogous to <code>pycodestyle.max-line-length</code>?</p>

<p>(personally I'd use it to simply ignore line length on imports, which I do in JS/TS)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be more open to adding an option to disable the line length wrapping for imports instead of allowing arbitrarily large values. However, we'd have to make this change in both the linter and formatter.</p>
