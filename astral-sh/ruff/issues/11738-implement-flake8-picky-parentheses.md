# Implement flake8-picky-parentheses

---

_Issue opened by @benjamb on 2024-06-04 15:17_

- [ ] `PAR001`: `Redundant parentheses (general)`
- [ ] `PAR002`: `Parentheses used for tuple unpacking`

Perhaps less important if using a formatter, such as black:

- [ ] `PAR101`: `Opening bracket is last, but closing is not on new line`
- [ ] `PAR102`: `Closing bracket has different indentation than the line with the opening bracket`
- [ ] `PAR103`: `Consecutive opening brackets at the end of the line must have consecutive closing brackets`
- [ ] `PAR104`: `Only operators and comments are allowed after a closing bracket on a new line`
