Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>TCH rules currently produce much more warnings than flake8-type-checking, but may be less relevant.</p>
<p>Consider this snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pkg import A,B

def test(value: A):
   return B()
</code></pre>
<p>With ruff, you'll get a warning. However, the flake8 plugin will not trigger: adding one of the two imports in the TYPE_CHECKING block would not prevent the module from being imported at runtime, at the extra cost of 3 more lines and splitted imports.</p>
<p>The same applies to TCH003: import from <code>typing</code> don't benefit much, as we already import it for <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Any

if TYPE_CHECKING:
   ...

a: Any = &quot;str&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I feel like the having flake8 way would be beneficial, either by default or with an option flag.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to all the ruff contributors, this is an incredible tool!</p>
<p>Tested on ruff 0.0.235</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm realising my comment may not be very clear:</p>
<p>TLDR: TCH warnings for types imported outside of TYPE_CHECKING should probably be ignored (by default or opt-in) if there is another import from the same module that is required out of type checking, as it's more verbose with no changes to imported modules at runtime.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with this! Would be a good change. It may not've come up with the existing flake8-type-checking test suite (which I ported over :))</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh it's indeed a bug, as it is different from the plugin default configuration.</p>
<p>However, it looks like there are options to change these behaviours in the original plugin:
