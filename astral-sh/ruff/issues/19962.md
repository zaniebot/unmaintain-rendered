# `--output-format sarif` does not provide information on autofixes

---

_Issue opened by @alexanderlinne on 2025-08-18 07:56_

### Summary

When using `uv run ruff check --output-format json .`, the output for an issue contains a `fix` field if an autofix is available. When using `uv run ruff check --output-format sarif .`, the `results` however do not contain the autofix as specified in [the SARIF spec](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/csprd01/sarif-v2.1.0-csprd01.html#_Toc10541319).

### Version

ruff 0.12.9

This should be relatively straightforward to add. I'll be happy to accept a contribution

Since this was fixed with #20300
the issue can be closed, yes?
