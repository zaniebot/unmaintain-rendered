            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could potentially truncate after the first line.</p>
<p>One thing that&#x27;s on my mind is to re-work Diagnostics in general and, as part of that, I would have pushed towards printing diagnostics with more context by default (multiline diagnostics). Ideally, the system would support a &quot;verbose&quot; mode that prints extra context information that may be too verbose by default.</p>
<p>Why I&#x27;m bringing this up. Has it been an intentional decision only to print one-line diagnostics when running the <code>check</code> command and if so, what was its motivation?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser - It&#x27;s mostly born out of a &quot;consistent-with-Flake8-by-default&quot; attitude. We do support printing Clippy-like context via the <code>--show-source</code> flag (which can also be set in <code>pyproject.toml</code>):</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309177/226152193-8a74de4c-3ccf-4397-bd10-8a1197daf19e.png" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-18 at 11 36 43 PM"></p>
<p>But, clearly, it&#x27;s not the default. That&#x27;s not based on a principled stance other than that Flake8 also supports a <code>--show-source</code> flag and also doesn&#x27;t default to it. We could definitely <em>consider</em> making that the default.</p>

<p>Happy to help! Static analysis is a field that I care about a lot, and I want better tools for everyone. And it&#x27;s not like there is any competition between linters, since we tend to target different languages 😄
I&#x27;m also trying to learn things from Ruff (performance mostly), though since the implementation of <code>elm-review</code> is done in a very different language, I don&#x27;t know how much I will be able to put to use in practice.</p>
<p>But let&#x27;s not side-track the initial topic anymore 😅, always happy to discuss static analysis in other places.</p>

<p>but that specific file linked just happens to have a multi-line unexpected token (a triple quoted string literal in this case):</p>
<pre><code>    PATTERN  &quot;&quot;&quot;
    try_stmt&lt; &#x27;try&#x27; &#x27;:&#x27; (simple_stmt | suite)
                  cleanup=(except_clause &#x27;:&#x27; (simple_stmt | suite))+
                  tail=([&#x27;except&#x27; &#x27;:&#x27; (simple_stmt | suite)]
                        [&#x27;else&#x27; &#x27;:&#x27; (simple_stmt | suite)]
                        [&#x27;finally&#x27; &#x27;:&#x27; (simple_stmt | suite)]) &gt;
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

<p>hence why the output is multi-line.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, that was confusing due to contents of the string. Still it looks like the error message need to be escaped (and prorably shortened too?) when being formatted, is it?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly! That&#x27;s why I wanted to run locally and check and realized its just part of the source code.</p>
<p>Not sure if we shorten/trim here, we can choose either really. I think it makes more sense to show the token that is invalid in its entirety considering that large-ish tokens like this one are not really the norm. Either way, if needed we&#x27;ll discuss this further in the issue you opened.</p>

<p>This seems reasonable to me. #3931 adds a new <code>DisplayParseError</code> that implements our custom rendering for <code>SyntaxErrors. We can customize it to change the rendering of </code>UnrecognizedToken<code>to only show the message, or render the first line only (truncate with</code>...`). I can take a stab at it</p>
