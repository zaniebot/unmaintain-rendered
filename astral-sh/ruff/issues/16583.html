            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>It would be nice if red-knot could detect inconsistent base class ordering (like PyRight does).  I am proposing this because I would like to delete my tool: https://github.com/NeilGirdhar/inheritance_graph, which helps in debugging why the ordering is inconsistent.  It would be nice to have this functionality in red-knot as well!</p>
