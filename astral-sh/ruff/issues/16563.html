            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Hello,
Was reading your ruff server doc, do you plan to add code completion and navigation inside ruff server so we could ditch pyright or jedi and use ruff server only ?</p>
<h3>Version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @ginolegigot</p>
<p>We are working on a standalone type checker that will support completion and code navigation. How and when we'll bring this feature to Ruff is something we're still trying to figure out.</p>
<p>Our goal is to ship a first alpha/beta later this year and maybe a stable version by the end of the year and you can follow its development by filtering issues by the <em>red knot</em> label.</p>
