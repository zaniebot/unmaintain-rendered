Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>It's a very quick thing and maybe solved with a flag that already exists but you didn't find it. Today I updated ruff to the latest version and I see that now the check command is more verbose and gives more details than previous versions:</p>
<p>Now:</p>

<p>Before (from the internet) because I didn't take a screen before:</p>
<img width="910" alt="ruff_before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05550db9-2e30-4419-bf48-0f49abe1e40c">

<p>Basically it prints one line for each error, instead of 4 lines spelling out the position with ^^^^^.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is intended and was introduced with ruff 0.5.0. See https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.5.0</p>
<p>Pass <code>-output-format=concise</code> for the previous behavior.</p>
