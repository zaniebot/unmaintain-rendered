            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While working on #12595, @zanieb suggested to split out the design for calls-to-action for unsafe fixes and display-only fixes, since it is not obvious what the design there should be. A few key points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should there be per-fix calls-to-action (which is what we started out with) or only a summary?</li>
<li>Should unsafe fixes be displayed by default? As of the status quo at the end of #12595, the answer is “no”, but maybe they should in <code>check</code> mode, or perhaps there should be a flag to display <em>all</em> fixes. The new behavior means that there is actually no way <em>to</em> display those fixes without also running the fixer.</li>
<li>What should the language and formatting be? Color? Bold? etc.?</li>
</ul>
