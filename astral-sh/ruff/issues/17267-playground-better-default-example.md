# [playground] Better default example

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2025-04-07 07:31_

The default script in red knot's playground is: `import os`. 

We should use an example that demonstrates Red Knot's capability better

Any suggestions? I don't mind updating the playground (should only take me a minute)

I actually spent some time thinking about this yesterday! Will send a PR with a proposal later.

As a frequent user of the playground, I think: yes, it would be great to have an example to get started. But I would also just like to see that once. So I think I would like the "reset" button to just create an empty `main.py` file.

Not that we have to do this (right away), but some playgrounds also have something like a dropdown selection of various examples, which can be illustrative as well.

Monaco's playground is like this, but I don't think it has good ergonomics. I very much prefer react's embedded playground for examples like this (https://react.dev/learn). For the beginning, it could simply be a markdown with examples and links to the playground
