<p>With preview enabled, the fix for <code>PERF401</code> can duplicate comments if they are inside an empty tuple inside the <code>if</code> test. <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/7a4d8896-1d7a-45c5-96c9-5f92b73709ff">playground</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best answer, but I think the current implementation is over-zealous at formatting, which is why so many comments need to be moved. If it kept the original formatting of the code, there are a good amount of places where comments don&#x27;t need to be moved.</p>
<pre><code>original = list(range(10000))
filtered = []
for (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 1
    i  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 2
) in (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 3
    original  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 4
):  # needs to be moved 5
    # needs to be moved 6
    if (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 7
        1,  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 8
    ):  # needs to be moved 9
        # needs to be moved 10
        filtered.append(  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 11
            i  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 12
        )  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 13
</code></pre>
<p>The playground currently does <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/9fc6d544-73ec-4edf-b0b8-1a1ad6c96f1d">this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>original = list(range(10000))
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 1
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 2
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 3
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 4
# needs to be moved 5
# needs to be moved 6
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 7
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 8
# needs to be moved 9
# needs to be moved 10
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 11
# doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 12
filtered = [i for i in original if (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 7
        1,  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 8
    )]  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 13
</code></pre>
<p>But all those could remain unmoved since they are within an expression that needs to have parenthesis to be multiline anyways</p>
<pre><code># needs to be moved 5
# needs to be moved 6
# needs to be moved 9
# needs to be moved 10
filtered = [(  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 11
    i  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 12
) for (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 1
    i  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 2
) in (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 3
    original  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 4
) if (  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 7
        1,  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 8
)]  # doesn&#x27;t need to be moved 13
</code></pre>
<p>Another option would be to always move all comments for consistency.</p>
<p>Not sure which one though, or if there are more besides these two.</p>
