            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Following #15241, some of the internal error messages from <code>red_knot_test</code> are now swallowed by the framework, for example this one here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/b26448926a8c2f61befa17b8ffa1dd0ac3232c9c/crates/red_knot_test/src/lib.rs#L32-L37</p>
<p>On a PR branch I was working on, I got this (not very informative!) test failure:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b918b880-9ea9-41a7-9829-3e8b38a7c8cf" alt="image" /></p>
<p>If I revert https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/75015b0ed91b728f22897c3bf12af5e6451e163a on that PR branch, I get this instead, which is much more helpful:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The panic that is being swallowed is not within the closure that is wrapped in <code>catch_unwind</code>.  I think the issue here is that the panic hook is global, and so if you're running tests concurrently, one thread might install the custom panic hook for its <code>catch_unwind</code> call while another thread is in the middle of e.g. this parse operation that might fail.</p>
