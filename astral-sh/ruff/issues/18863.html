<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/bad-file-permissions/"><code>bad-file-permissions</code> (S103)</a> has false negatives and false positives.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/blob/1.8.5/bandit/plugins/general_bad_file_permissions.py#L63-L69">The upstream rule checks <code>0o33</code></a> but Ruff’s S103 only checks <code>0o12</code>.</p>

import os
os.chmod(&quot;/etc/secrets.txt&quot;, 0o21)

$ flake8 ./s103_1.py
./s103_1.py:2:1: S103 Chmod setting a permissive mask 0o21 on file (/etc/secrets.txt).

$ ruff --isolated check s103_1.py --select S103
All checks passed!
</code></pre>
<p>Only the bits of <code>0o33</code> matter for the permissiveness check. S103 should not be suppressed when those bits can statically be determined in the result of a bitwise OR, even when the full result can’t.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That Ruff only checks Group execute and world write, but not group write or world execute, has been the case since the rule was added (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/1636/).</p>
<p>The upstream rule distinguishes between group write/execute (medium) and world (write/execute) but that's not what's implemented in Ruff. https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/pull/570/files</p>
<p>The rule does have special handling for bitwise operands but it only supports values up to <code>u16</code> as the left/right side:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be open to taking a stab at this.</p>
<p>@MichaReiser, do you have additional context on why the Ruff rule differs from the upstream rule? Would aligning them be desirable?
As for the <code>u16</code> limit, is there a specific reason to keep it? For reference, this limitation came about in #7584 to get rid of the <code>num-bigint</code> dependency/improve performance.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, not more than what you can find from looking at the git history. Aligning with upstream is probably desired but we should double check that the change is in line with the rule's intent (and we probably need to gate it behind preview mode)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so. We shouldn't re-introduce <code>num-bigint</code>, it's probably enough to change the check to use <code>usize</code> instead (or <code>u64</code>)</p>
