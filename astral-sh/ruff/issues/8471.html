Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I'm considering enabling ruff.pydocstyle for an existing project that is supposed to follow NumPy's style but isn't systematically checked yet. The issue I'm having is that most errors I'm getting are about missing docstrings in test functions. I would like to ignore tests files entirely but only for this subset of rules, is there a way to do it ? If not, I'd suggest adding a <code>extend-exclude</code> option to <code>[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks again for building this wonderful tool !</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I'd recommend <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#per-file-ignores"><code>per-file-ignores</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
# Ignore all directories named `tests`.
&quot;tests/**&quot; = [&quot;D&quot;]
# Ignore all files that end in `_test.py`.
&quot;*_test.py&quot; = [&quot;D&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>You can use this same approach to ignore other errors in tests too.</p>
