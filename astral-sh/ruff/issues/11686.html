            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the past, it was fairly common for people to simply put <code>Iterator</code> on context managers simply out of convenience, as typing out <code>Generator</code>, required adding in two (mostly useless) generic params. However, this can lead to runtime failures not caught by a type-checker, take this example from <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/2772">python/typeshed#2772</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import contextlib
from typing import Iterator

@contextlib.contextmanager
def f() -&gt; Iterator[int]:
    return iter([1])


with f():
    pass


with f():
    raise TypeError(&#x27;wat&#x27;)
</code></pre>
<p>Due to how breaking this change is, the typeshed maintainers were are reluctant to change the underlying annotation to require a <code>Generator</code>. It was actually proposed offloading this responsibility to linting tules, or special rules within the type-checkers themselves.</p>
<p>Now, <code>Iterator[int]</code> can be simplified to <code>Generator[int]</code> with the addition of type var defaults, and their usage in the cpython implementation, and the typesheds, see: <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/11867">python/typeshed#11867</a></p>
<p>I would propose adding a rule to autofix <code>Iterator[T]</code> to <code>Generator[T]</code> on 3.13+ for any functions decorated with <code>contextlib.contextmanager</code>, or when deferred annotations are present in the file, as otherwise a runtime error will be encountered. In cases where neither are true, an error can simply be flagged and fixed manually (either through quoting <code>Generator[T]</code>, or doing <code>Generator[T, None, None]</code>).</p>
<p>This will help ensure that type-checkers such as Pyright and MyPy can flag and catch issues that might be hidden as a result.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just recently came across this due the following PR being raised against packaging: <a href="https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/1046">pypa/packaging#1046</a></p>
<p>I wonder if another solution would be custom rules in <code>ty</code> for known <code>typeshed</code> inaccuracies?</p>
