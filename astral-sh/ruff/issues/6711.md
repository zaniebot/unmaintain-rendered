# Add `next` to FBT003 exclusions

---

_Issue opened by @Garrett-R on 2023-08-21 04:38_

Following on from [this discussion](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/6302) and [this PR](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6307), it might be good to add the Python builtin `next` to the exclusions list for [FBT003](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/boolean-positional-value-in-call/).

Consider this code:

```python
next(my_generator, False)
```

The rule is upset about `False` here, but there is no keyword arg you can use.  Trying to use `default=False` yields: `TypeError: next() takes no keyword arguments`.
