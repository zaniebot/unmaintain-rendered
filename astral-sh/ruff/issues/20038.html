            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Are there any plans on implementing a similar flag for <code>ruff check</code> like <code>pylint --fail-under &lt;score&gt;</code>? E.g. let the <code>ruff check</code> pre-commit hook pass if the score is over 90%.
There are cases where we need to make changes to an old code base, and we can't fix all the linter issues, or add a <code># noqa: {}</code> on all the failing issues. Having a threshold that could still pass the linting would be a great addition.
Or is there a way to simulate this behavior with Ruff?</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ruff 0.12.9</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, that's interesting! I think the way we're likely to handle this is either with baselines (#1149) or a warning severity (#1256, not sure that would help here exactly).</p>
<p>The closest thing we have right now is probably the GitLab output format, which has a <code>fingerprint</code> for each diagnostic, intended for matching up diagnostics over time for GitLab's <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/testing/code_quality/#code-quality-report-format">Code Quality</a> reports. You might be able to hack something together with that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ntBre the gitlab output format looks like it could be hacked into something usable. One question though, ruff check --output-format marks <em>all</em> issues with severity <code>major</code>. Can this be configured somehow with pyproject?</p>

<p>We were planning to update that once we had real severity levels for our diagnostics in general.</p>
