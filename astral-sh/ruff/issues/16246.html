            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>Occasionally I have seen f-strings used like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_variable = &quot;foo bar&quot;
print(f&quot;{my_variable}&quot;)

if f&quot;{my_variable}&quot; == &quot;baz&quot;:
    return
</code></pre>
<p>In these instances, the f-string usage is improper because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The f-string contains only this variable, and nothing else. Using the f-string syntax is superfluous.</li>
<li>If the user wanted to use a non-string variable as a string, then explicitly casting it using <code>str(my_variable)</code> would be more Pythonic.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't seen a RUF rule to this effect, though I've seen a few other f-string rules. I think this would be a fine addition.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this rule suggestion.</p>
<p>As you pointed out: Whether the use of <code>my_variable</code> is unnecessary depends on if <code>my_variable</code> is already a string. Ruff's capability to detect this right now are very limited and I worry that the rule would have too many false-negatives (it couldn't flag an f-string like that if it can't determine the type of <code>my_variable</code>.</p>
