Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I recently <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-comprehensions/pull/490">updated flake8-comprehension's C416</a> check to extend to dict comprehensions as well. It should also be auto-fixable just like the other C416 checks. Since the new version is now released on PyPy, it is a good idea to update to it.</p>
