Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I noticed Ruff is missing this nice lint from pyupgrade:
https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade#import-replacements</p>
<p>Basically, it replaces <code>from typing import Sequence</code> with the new <code>from collections.abc import Sequence</code> and similar.</p>

<p>Feel free to close this in favor of https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/827 ; otherwise I'll close this myself once the PR is merged.</p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, I'll just close this in favor of #827. Thanks!</p>
