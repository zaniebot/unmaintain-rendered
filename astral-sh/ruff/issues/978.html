            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>More of a question than a request, have you looked into supporting any of the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/code-inspection.html">PyCharm inspections</a>? I found a lot of overlap with the existing ruff and to be implemented pylint rules though, but there might be some worth checking out.</p>
<p>Does ruff support something similar to the  <em>Redeclared names without usage</em> one (like I requested <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3471">here</a>)?</p>
<p>PS: Seeing all the good progress being made with ruff is super exciting 💖</p>

<p>I haven't looked closely but I mostly use PyCharm so I <em>am</em> familiar with them. I do want to add unused argument detection soon.</p>
<p>Would <em>Redeclared names without usage</em> be equivalent to Flake8's <a href="https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/F811.html">F811</a>?</p>

<p>That is very similar at least, by the description it looks like it detects redeclared imports only. I believe the pycharm rule works on any attribute. An example would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class A:
    b = &quot;ninja&quot;
    b = &quot;turtles&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Or like the old example in the linked pylint issue:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class OptionType(graphene.InputObjectType):
    freeform_enabled = graphene.Boolean(required=True)
    freeform_enabled = GenericScalar(required=True)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gonna close this for now as F811 is being tracked separately (and I'd like it to be as expansive as is suggested here).</p>
