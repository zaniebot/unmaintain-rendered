            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>We do use <code>combine-as-imports</code> for the lint.isort settings.
However, the following passes ruff check despite the typing being imported twice:</p>
<pre><code>import typing
from typing import Any

def test_function(my_input: Any) -&gt; typing.Any:
  return my_input
</code></pre>
<p>My expectation would be for ruff to catch this as a duplicate import, and force the import simplification.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I can see how unifying the imports is desired but it imposes a few challenges:</p>
<p>The first is that it depends on personal preference on how the final code should look like. Should <code>typing.Any</code> be replaced with <code>Any</code> or the other way round where <code>Any</code> is replaced with <code>typing.Any</code>? What if there are multiple named imports and references to <code>typing</code>? What if there are no named imports for some usages of <code>typing</code>? I suspect that this heavily depends on personal preference and some users might not want that <code>typing</code> gets removed altogether.</p>
<p>That's why I think this is something that's out of scope of the <code>isort</code> rule and remains something that requires manual intervention. There's also the technical challenge that it requires rewriting all usages in the file</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">Import typing as t

plop.Any, t.Any

<p>Hum... to me this should not be authorized. Dual import doesn't make much sense in my opinion</p>

<p>Auto-fixing it would clearly be quite hard, and as you've said, probably out of scope. But at least raise an error?</p>
