(`pyupgrade` doesn't catch it either.)

The behaviour wanted here is probably that of pylint's [`C0325`](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/superfluous-parens.html). On https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/970 `C0325` is marked as completed due to `UP034`, but the scope of `UP034` is much smaller so that doesn't seem correct.

The `UP043` rule could be expanded to cover more cases, but it's not really related to pyupgrade's purpose, so IMO it would make sense just to implement the pylint rule separately.

EDIT: Actually, I don't think the pylint rule even catches the above case, although it still catches more than pyupgrade, and would make more sense to extend.

Any single statement with an operator is also not detected, which is consistent with pyupgrade:
ie: `test = (1) + 2`

Honestly, ruff `UP034` doesn't catch anything for me. pylint catches all of these:

```py
assert (a == b)
if (a == b):
while (a == b):
```
and returns
```
C0325: Unnecessary parens after 'if' keyword (superfluous-parens)
C0325: Unnecessary parens after 'while' keyword (superfluous-parens)
C0325: Unnecessary parens after 'assert' keyword (superfluous-parens)
```

ruff catches nothing.

Yeah I think they're just very different rules. I would describe UP034 as catching "redundant" parentheses, so, e.g., it will catch `((1)) + 2` but not `(1) + 2`. C0325 seems to catch "unnecessary" parentheses, i.e., all cases in which parentheses are not syntactically necessary, even if they may be used intentionally for readability or otherwise.

@charliermarsh Looking forward to when it is implemented. Currently the only thing I use pylint for is that check. Once it is added I can remove that dependency : ) I am pretty sure a `--fix` is possible as well and pylint doesn't do that. So it will be not only a replacement but an improvement : )

Thanks for all your work on this tool btw. I have never looked back since discovering it. I think I first heard about it on Talk Python to Me.

@codereport - Thank you for the kind words, so glad it's working well for you! (And yeah -- once implemented, we should be able to support autofix here.)

Came here to say that I was expecting `UP034` to fix unnecessary parentheses such as the one in the example below:

```
$ echo 'import os; str( u"", errors=("strict"))' > foo.py; ruff check --fix --extend-select UP034 ./foo.py; cat foo.py | ruff format -
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).
str("", errors=("strict"))
```

(and also wish I was able to pipe the `ruff check --fix` to make the reproducer more elegant 😉, #20460)

You can use bash for this:

```
$ ruff check --isolated --diff --fix --extend-select UP034 <(echo 'import os; str( u"", errors=("strict"))')
--- /dev/fd/63
+++ /dev/fd/63
@@ -1 +1 @@
-import os; str( u"", errors=("strict"))
+str( u"", errors=("strict"))

Would fix 1 error.

```
