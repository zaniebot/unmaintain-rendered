            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The fuzzers added in #4822 can be used to catch regressions for which there exists no unit tests (see: #4863 as an example of this; caught by <code>ruff_fix_validity</code> within ~30 seconds). PRs should include a short fuzz run (5-10m) before merging. Failure cases can then be added to the unit test suite.</p>
<p>Before that happens, the following issues (discovered by fuzzing currently and will cause this CI step to fail) should be resolved:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] #4823</li>
<li>[x] #4825</li>
<li>[x] #4826</li>
<li>[x] #4827</li>

<li>[x] #9374</li>
<li>[x] #9379</li>
</ul>
<p>This change should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caching of the fuzzer corpus, <code>fuzz/corpus/ruff_fix_validity</code> (~20MB)</li>
<li>Initialisation of the fuzzer corpus if not present (I will provide an initial corpus)</li>
<li>Execution of <code>timeout 10m cargo fuzz run -s none ruff_fix_validity -- -timeout=5 || [[ $? -eq 124 ]]</code> after the <code>fuzz build</code> step</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, when parser idempotency is more stable or new fuzzers exist (such as for formatting), this should be included as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The list here is now very old. There are likely new bugs caught by this beyond what is tracked; the issue is about making sure that the fuzzer is not enabled constantly unnecessarily.</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s better to use cron jobs workflow instead.</p>
