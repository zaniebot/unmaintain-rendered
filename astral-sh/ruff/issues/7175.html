            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the great library!! I've been loving unifying around the ruff rules.</p>
<p>I was adding type hints using <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#forward-references">PEP 484 forward references</a> to avoid an import of a soft dependency. The PEP says &quot;when a type hint contains names that have not been defined yet, that definition may be expressed as a string literal, to be resolved later.&quot; The code runs fine, and the forward reference looks OK in sphinx docs. However, they hit the <code>F821</code> rule in the same way that an unrunnably undefined type hint would. Suggested fix: make forward references with undefined name raise a different error like <code>F822</code> so it can be selectively ignored rather than ignoring all instances of <code>F821</code> which is very helpful.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>class Thing:
    def a_sparse(self) -&gt; &quot;scipy.sparse.coo_matrix&quot;:
        # this function runs fine
        # doing the import in the function to keep the dependency optional
        from scipy.sparse import coo_matrix
        return coo_matrix([0])

    def broken(self) -&gt; ActuallyUndefined:
        # this function is actually broken by the type hint
        # and must be removed to run in Python
        return 'Nah'
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff output:</p>
<pre><code>mikedh@orion$ ruff repro.py
repro.py:2:28: F821 Undefined name `scipy`
repro.py:7:25: F821 Undefined name `ActuallyUndefined`

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @mikedh glad you like Ruff and thanks for the well written issue :)</p>
<p>A type checker will also complain that the name is undefined e.g. Pylance in VSCode reports the violation and mypy does as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Thing:
    def example(self) -&gt; &quot;bar&quot;:
        from foo import bar

        return bar()
</code></pre>
<pre><code>❯ mypy example.py
example.py:2: error: Name &quot;bar&quot; is not defined  [name-defined]
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
</code></pre>
<p>and they're correct that this name is not usable for type checking. If you move the import out of the method, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Thing:
    def example(self) -&gt; &quot;bar&quot;:
        return bar()
    
from foo import bar
</code></pre>
<p>there are no longer complaints of an undefined name — this is what PEP 484 generally means by deferred resolution.</p>
<p>I think what you're looking for is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from foo import bar

class Thing:
    def example(self) -&gt; &quot;bar&quot;:
        from foo import bar
        return bar()
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately this requires two imports since you need the name at runtime as well. I can see the appeal of avoiding this by introducing a separate code you can just ignore, but I'm not sure there's a point to defining the return type if it cannot be resolved by type checkers.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the suggestions!! I just did additional imports in my case. I guess I figured since one case is runnable and one isn't it would be nice to selectively ignore it by breaking it out into a different rule. Totally understand if that's not a reasonable thing to support in ruff!</p>

<p>..................The point would be to enable humans to know what typing is desired.</p>
