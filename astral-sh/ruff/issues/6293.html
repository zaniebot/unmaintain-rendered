            <div class="timeline-body"><p>in my codebase there's a <code>find</code> function where the lambda is executed immediately which means it's safe to use the loop variable this way, so i have to suppress this rule on all of its usages:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo = [1, 2, 3]
for bar in foo:
    find([1, 2, 3], lambda value: value == bar)  # noqa: B023
</code></pre>
<p>it would be nice if there was an option to specify functions where the lambda is executed immediately, like with <code>extend-immutable-calls</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.flake8-bugbear]
lambdas-executed-immediately = [&quot;find&quot;] # perhaps also a way of specifying which argument takes the lambda
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand the use-case, and it'd be nice to have a way to express this in the type system that we could leverage in Ruff, but I think this is too niche to justify a dedicated setting at present. Every setting adds some additional cognitive burden for users and has an implementation + ongoing maintenance cost, so it needs to meet some threshold for general usefulness and applicability. If we see this need arise again in the future, we can always reconsider.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Forgive necro-ing this post, but this does seem overly strict.</p>
<p>Rather than adding another option, could we just allow this usage when the lambda doesn't escape the loop?</p>
<p>It's particularly prevalent in pandas / xarray, when using a lambda as part of a pipe:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in is:
    pd.DataFrame(foo).pipe(lambda x: x.where($someuseofi)
</code></pre>
