Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Recent mypy versions have started to warn about implicit optionals on function signatures, which has been prohibited by pep 484 since https://github.com/python/peps/pull/689.
It would be great if ruff would spot and fix this automatically for you, considering how easy it is to forget to do this while coding.</p>
<p>Minimal code example:</p>
<pre><code>def implicit_optional(optional: str = None) -&gt; None:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p><code>mypy</code> output:</p>
<pre><code>test.py:1: error: Incompatible default for argument &quot;optional&quot; (default has type &quot;None&quot;, argument has type &quot;str&quot;)  [assignment]
test.py:1: note: PEP 484 prohibits implicit Optional. Accordingly, mypy has changed its default to no_implicit_optional=True
test.py:1: note: Use https://github.com/hauntsaninja/no_implicit_optional to automatically upgrade your codebase
</code></pre>
<p>The fix for python3.10 and newer would be modifying the definition to be:</p>
<pre><code>def implicit_optional(optional: str | None = None) -&gt; None:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>On the implementation side, I think this would belong to flake8-annotations but as it isn't checking for this, I'm wondering what would be the correct place to implement this?</p>
<p>For older Python versions the fix would require either <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> or <code>from typing import Optional</code> and using <code>optional: Optional[str]</code>, both of which might be too invasive for automated fixing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a good rule to add along with the auto-fix ability. Should this be added under the <code>RUF</code> or <code>ANN</code> category? I'm leaning towards <code>RUF</code>. I can take this on.</p>
