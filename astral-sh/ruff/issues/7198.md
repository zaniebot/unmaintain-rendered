_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-06 15:30_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select PT027 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
class TestSnippet(unittest.TestCase):
        with self.assertRaisesRegex(exceptions.SpecValidationError,
                        *            '^context: Must be a lowercase single word containing only a-z and numbers.$'):
            snippet.validate_spec()
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/788_IDX_0_RAND_155071351838662455195602.py:2:14: PT027 Use `pytest.raises` instead of unittest-style `assertRaisesRegex`
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/788_IDX_0_RAND_155071351838662455195602.py`, the rule codes PT027, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
