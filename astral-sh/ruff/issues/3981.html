Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>not entirely sure which rule is changing it, but for some reason the help text string for a Django ORM column description is being rewritten from using a fancy forward quote: <code>’</code> to use a tilde `</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> customer_email = models.CharField(
-    max_length=255, help_text=&quot;The customer’s email address.&quot;
+    max_length=255, help_text=&quot;The customer`s email address.&quot;
 )
</code></pre>
