            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to group the errors in ruff by file and output them in a more structured format Similar to the image below where issues are grouped by file and then displayed in a table like view below the file name.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<img width="790" alt="CleanShot 2022-11-28 at 13 15 02@2x" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64056131/204392314-3fa8408a-bbfe-448a-8d18-e91fed97390b.png">

<p>Obviously this is mostly a personal preference, but I find that much easier to read than the current output.</p>
<p>I could see this being implement in a two different ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an additional option to <code>--format</code> flag that displays an output like above. This is likely the easiest option</li>
<li>Accept a template of some kind in either the config file or as a parameter to --format.  Perhaps with a template engine like <a href="https://github.com/Keats/tera">tera</a>. This is the most flexible, but difficult and would add additional dependencies</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm happy to work on a PR for this if it's a feature you're interest in including in ruff.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your work on this!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I'd be happy to support this. It's a bit more ESLint-like. I think a separate format option would be a reasonable place to start -- I don't feel the need to support extensive templating right now. Maybe like <code>--format grouped</code>? But we can workshop the name later.</p>
