            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If a user has <code>D</code> in the rule selection, the rules that are actually selected depends on the docstring convention that&#x27;s chosen. Currently, this information only lives at the bottom of this FAQ section: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#does-ruff-support-numpy-or-google-style-docstrings. It would be useful to have this visible in an obvious place for which I see two options:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pydocstyle_convention"><code>ruff.lint.pydocstyle.convention</code></a> section</li>
<li>For each of the <code>Dxxx</code> rule page, specify how setting the <code>lint.pydocstyle.convention</code> may affect the selection of this rule</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I&#x27;d prefer option (1) as the documentation is in a single place instead of distributed across multiple rule pages.</p>
