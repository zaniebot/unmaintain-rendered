<p>The expected behaviour is that the return value of a function decorated with <code>pytest.fixture</code> is not expected to be documented, as such objects are not expected to be called by the user.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know about this. I agree that it doesn't really make sense to enforce the usual set of docstring rules on, well, any test functions. But I'm not sure that I like the idea of special-casing specific third-party libraries for this kind of rule (even very popular libraries like pytest). My usual approach is just to set <code>per-file-ignores</code> in my Ruff config so that all docstring-related rules are ignored for my test files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a fair point. Ignoring the rule would be a solution, though there are some functions in test files over which I would still want to run <code>pydoclint</code> checks (for example, complex mocks and utility functions).</p>

<p>It sounds difficult for an automated tool to decide for which functions <code>pydoclint</code> should run if only some functions should be checked. I guess my recommendation would be to move these utility functions to a different directory that still gets checked.</p>
