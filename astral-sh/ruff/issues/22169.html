<p>This bit</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Annotated

a = {
    &quot;c&quot;: str,
}
Annotated[a[&quot;c&quot;], str]
</code></pre>
<p>yields:</p>
<pre><code>% uv run ruff check

4 |     &quot;c&quot;: &quot;cat&quot;,
5 | }
6 | Annotated[a[&quot;c&quot;], str]
  |
</code></pre>
<p>However, as far as I can tell this should be valid.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some additional notes on <code>Annotated</code> for whenever this gets looked into, ruff also does not catch the following issues (from typing docs), but maybe that&#x27;s more <code>ty</code>&#x27;s turf:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Annotated[a[&quot;c&quot;]]</code> should fail: &quot;It&#x27;s an error to call <code>Annotated</code> with less than two arguments&quot;.</li>
<li><code>Annotated[&quot;a&quot;, str]</code> should fail: &quot;The first argument to Annotated must be a valid type.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! <a href="https://play.ty.dev/8344dcbb-1714-4b59-b867-51604b44cc43">ty</a> is also reporting an invalid type form error on the <code>a[&quot;c&quot;]</code> subscript, though, so I think this may be intentional?</p>
<p>I looked a bit at the <a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/annotations.html#type-and-annotation-expressions">typing spec</a> and for any existing ty issues but someone like @AlexWaygood may know better whether this is correct.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11378">astral-sh/ruff#11378</a> may also be related on the Ruff side.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, the first argument to <code>Annotated</code> is expected to be a valid &quot;annotation expression&quot; (which is a term of art described in https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/annotations.html#type-and-annotation-expressions). <code>a[&quot;c&quot;]</code> is not a valid annotation expression, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s causing the issue here. In annotation expressions, string-literal expressions are expected to be &quot;forward references&quot; to names not-yet defined, which is why Ruff is emitting the &quot;undefined name&quot; F821 error here: there&#x27;s no <code>c</code> variable defined anywhere in this module. The only place where a string literal inside an annotation expression is <em>not</em> expected to be a forward reference is if it&#x27;s inside a <code>typing.Literal</code> slice: <code>typing.Literal[&quot;c&quot;]</code>, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11378 seems a bit different to me -- that issue is about arguably valid annotations that Ruff doesn&#x27;t understand (because it doesn&#x27;t have type inference). However, the annotation in this issue is invalid according to the typing spec, unfortunately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see what you are saying, but I&#x27;m not sure I agree that <code>a[&quot;c&quot;]</code> actually represents a string literal , and as such I don&#x27;t think it need be a forward referenced. As far as <code>Annotated[]</code> is concerned, it is only receiving the resolved output of the alias <code>a[&quot;c&quot;]</code> and not the key internal to that alias itself (unless type inference skips interpretation, that I really don&#x27;t know much about).</p>
<p>If invalid, this has some pretty weird implications, such as <code>Annotated[a[&quot;c&quot;], str]</code> being invalid but <code>Annotated[a.keys()[0], str]</code> being somehow more valid. Also in testing, I found that <code>Annotated[a[&quot;a&quot;], str]</code> is considered by ruff to be valid, despite being somewhat silly and just random chance that a dictionary key matches a scoped variable name that is very clearly is not actually referencing.</p>
<p>FWIW there are no issues with python actually interpreting this, and in practice this type is &quot;load bearing&quot; in the way pydantic types tend to be so it&#x27;s not just a pure hint. So we can confirm the reference method is considered valid enough to the interpreter. I&#x27;d suspect because it works we would see enough of this in the wild for it to be considered the defacto API contract that couldn&#x27;t at this point be broken without a deprecation plan.</p>
<p>Anyhow I don&#x27;t have strong opinions on what it <em>should</em> be, if your interpretation is unambiguously the spec then it is what it is.</p>
