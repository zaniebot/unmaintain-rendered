            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently, the Airflow ruff rules do not fail on certain deprecated imports from <code>airflow.utils</code> for Airflow version <code>3.1.5</code>. Ideally, the airflow deprecations ruff rules should trigger a failure for <a href="https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/7c4520ba62ec4bb5a35e07fb451dcda276a2a841/airflow-core/src/airflow/utils/__init__.py">these deprecated class imports</a>.</p>
<p>Worth noting: There are other similar <code>__deprecated_classes</code> dictionaries defined in the airflow-core submodules, which may also be worth filing issues for as needed. A good bit of them are already covered by the ruff rules, but I imagine many of these deprecations came about from Airflow <code>3.1</code>, and those newer deprecations may need to be reflected in <code>ruff</code> accordingly.</p>

<p>@sjyangkevin is working on it. @amoghrajesh and I will finalize a list. Instead of fixing everything, I guess we're just to recommend our users not to use some of them.</p>
