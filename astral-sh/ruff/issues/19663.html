            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I noticed with <code>D419</code> that there is no unsafe fix for simply removing empty docstrings that are detected. I think this would be a simple yet useful feature, and was wondering about the feasibility of adding it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I'm not sure how helpful such a fix would be. I feel like an empty docstring is more of an indicator that someone forgot to come back and fill it in rather than forgot to delete it. But I'm certainly open to other opinions!</p>
