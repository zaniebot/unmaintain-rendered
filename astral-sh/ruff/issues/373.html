            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. It solves the problem.
Maybe it would be good to invalidate the ruff cache in the ruff binary is not the same between invocations as first I thought you pushed unrelated changes to master as the errors were the same after recompilation.</p>
<p>Found another one:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff test_import.py 
No pyproject.toml found.

Found 1 error(s).
test_import.py:3:1: F401 `numpy` imported but unused

</code></pre>
<p>It might be more tricky to solve as in involves type annotations in quoted strings.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys

import numpy as np

if sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 10):
    from typing import TypeAlias
else:
    from typing_extensions import TypeAlias


CustomInt: TypeAlias = &quot;np.int8 | np.int16&quot;

<p>Hmm yeah. We do put the Cargo version in the cache key, so it's invalidated between <em>releases</em>. But I can see how this would be confusing when running against Git etc.</p>
