# Another TRY201 false positive

_Issue opened by @LefterisJP on 2023-01-30 00:45_

This is about a TRY201 false positive and unlike https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/2164 I think it's a bug.

Consider this
```python
a = 1
b = 2

def foo(arg) -> None:
    raise TypeError

try:
    a + b
except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:
    if isinstance(e, ValueError):
        try:
            foo()
        except TypeError:  # now raise ValueError e
            raise e from None 
```

Run it with `ruff 0.0.237` and `TRY201` enabled and you will get `test.py:14:19: TRY201 Use `raise` without specifying exception name`

This is a false positive as doing `raise` alone would raise the `TypeError`.
