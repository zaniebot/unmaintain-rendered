            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With the release of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.4.0"><code>v0.4.0</code> of <code>ruff</code></a>, I noticed that some of <code>ruff</code>'s dependencies were not updated to their latest versions.  The <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit"><code>ruff-pre-commit</code></a> package released <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit/releases/tag/v0.4.0"><code>v0.4.0</code></a> at the same time <code>ruff</code> was updated, but <code>ruff</code> still referenced <code>v0.3.7</code> of the package, not the newly updated version.</p>
<p>In a similar light, I noticed that the version of the <a href="https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill"><code>dill</code></a> package being used was not the latest version that now <a href="https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/releases/tag/0.3.8">fully supports Python 3.12</a>.</p>
