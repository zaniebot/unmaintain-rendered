Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>version: ruff 0.0.260</p>
<p>The line length calculation for non-ascii characters is incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>x = '12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234'
y = 'これは長い列です90これは長い列です90これは長い列です90これは長い列です90これは長い列です90これは長い列です90これは長い列です90これは長'
</code></pre>
<p>Both lines are under the character limit, but ruff flags the second line as too long, reporting the number of bytes rather than the number of characters.  This changed recently.  0.254 accepted this file, but 0.260 rejects it:</p>
<pre><code>ruff bug.py
bug.py:2:81: E501 Line too long (140 &gt; 80 characters)
</code></pre>
<p>pyproject.toml:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
line-length = 80

select = [&quot;E&quot;]

[tool.ruff.flake8-quotes]
inline-quotes = &quot;single&quot;

<p>Ruff reports both lines because both exceed the unicode width of 88:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line has a width of 120 characters</li>
<li>The second line has a width of 152 characters</li>
</ul>

<p>I also misunderstood about this. (I assumed ruff uses &amp;str.chars().count().)</p>
<p>Do you have any plan for move to grapheme cluster count ? (ex: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51818497/how-do-i-count-unique-grapheme-clusters-in-a-string-in-rust">use unicode_segmentation</a>)
Of course, this counting is more expensive than &amp;str.len(). but, is important (&amp; easy for understanding err) for people use non-ascii chars language. please consider this!</p>

<p>Ruff did use <code>chars().count()</code> but we changed it in #3714 to align with black. Pycodestyle does use <code>chars().count()</code> because <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/pull/345">their reasoning</a> is that they don't want to add the complexity to their tool and PEP8 recommends using ASCII only.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/psf/black/commit/ef6e079901d53a42dfae4ab10b081ce7a73a47b5">This commit</a> in the black repository has a good explanation why they (and Ruff) choose unicode width over character or grapheme count.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a case where ruff is reporting an over count line (112 vs our standard 88) but if we attempt to split it into two lines black auto-formats it back to one line because it'll fit on one line.</p>
<p>Is there still some misalignment between ruff and black, or is there a correct &quot;fix&quot; to this (other than adding <code>#noqa: E501</code> to the end)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I only now realized that Black only changed the behavior for the preview style but not for the &quot;stable&quot; style.

<p>@eviljeff could you try using Black's preview style to see if that fixes the issue? I wonder if we should add a configuration setting to allow users to pick their preferred &quot;width&quot; measurement unit.</p>

<p>It does fix that problem - <code>black --preview</code> splits the the string onto two lines which ruff accepts.</p>
<p>(Although if we wanted to use that as a workaround it wouldn't be a solution today as <code>black --preview</code> - for some reason - is rewriting <code>&quot;['categories'].&quot;</code> to <code>'[\'categories\'].'</code> which ruff then raises as <code>Q003</code> 🤷‍♂️.  I hope that's fixed in black before the change moves to stable)</p>

<p>Personally, I prefer measuring for the line length seen in a (modern) code editor that supports unicode, because a line limit is mostly about readability, but practically, aligning with black is the most efficient solution (unless black adds a similar setting - which I would guess is unlikely given the project ethos of minimal configuration).</p>

<p>fwiw, looks like that bug(?) has been reported already as https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3643 (the example I included was also a multi-line string)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I think that the new behavior (using unicode-width instead of byte-count) should be an opt-in feature because Black's preview style is also an opt-in feature until Jan 2024... it's too far.</p>
<p>Note that, for the Black's preview style, &quot;there are no guarantees around the stability of the output&quot; according to their <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy">stability policy</a>. I don't think we should use it for production code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Black's preview style is about to be released and it includes the change to measure strings using the unicode width rather the character length. Ruff's formatter already uses unicode width.</p>
<p>We also updated our documentation to improve the explanation that it isn't the character limit when using emoji or east asian characters.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Even ruff uses Unicode width to measure line length, the editor font might not respect that, which appears as an in-consistency line length in ruff's auto-formatting or E501 reporting.</p>
<p>To resolve this, your favorite editor shall employ a carefully designed font.</p>
