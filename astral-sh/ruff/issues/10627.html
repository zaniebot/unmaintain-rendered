            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, I wish to fix ruff package on Alpine Linux. Currently the package won't build on s390x arch because of a dependancy that won't update its own dependancies. I'm talking about clearscreen which uses an old version on nix which contains a bug for s390x. The bug has been patched on nix but clearscreen seems almost abandoned.</p>
<p>Here is the issue https://github.com/watchexec/clearscreen/pull/20</p>
<p>I don't know rust so I can't contribute, but anyway I think it would be wise to get rid of a dependancy in such state.</p>

<p>It seems that the package is still maintained. The maintainer commented on https://github.com/watchexec/clearscreen/pull/20 with that they're happy to upgrade the <code>nix</code> package once the PR builds successfully.</p>
<p>That's why I think the best forward is to help push the upgrade PR forward rather than vendoring, forking or replacing</p>
<p>An alternative is to use something like <code>crossterm</code> but its clear command but that comes with a lot of functionality that we don't need today.</p>
