<p>Ruff 0.8.0 ignores <code>ambiguous-variable-name (E741)</code> automatically in pyi files. This prompted me to look at other rules I disable specifically for <code>.pyi</code> files and found the following which I think should apply in all cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PLR0904</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-public-methods/</li>
<li><code>PLR0913</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-arguments/</li>
<li><code>PLR0917</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-positional-arguments/</li>
<li><code>PLW3201</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/bad-dunder-method-name/</li>
<li><code>SLOT</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-slots-slot</li>
<li><code>FBT</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-boolean-trap-fbt</li>
<li>Possibly some of <code>A</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-builtins-a</li>
<li>Maybe <code>PLC2701</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/import-private-name/</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#x27;t gone back and validated if these still trigger in stub files since I added them to <a href="https://github.com/BesLogic/shared-configs/blob/main/ruff.toml">our shared config</a>, sorry if I tagged a rule that&#x27;s already ignored.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! Your analysis all seems correct to me. I&#x27;d happily accept PRs disapplying these rules to stub files.</p>
<p>For E741 we were quite cautious, and made the change preview-only for several minor releases before stabilising the change. I don&#x27;t think we need to be as cautious this time around. Our <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/">versioning policy</a> states that it&#x27;s fine to apply changes in patch releases if they reduce scope (and these <em>would</em> be reductions in scope); we only need to wait for a minor release if a change increases the scope of a rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I leave that to @Samuel-Therrien-Beslogic to decide - as I said, I did not do anything regarding the last two bullet points. So it depends on whether there is interest in continuing to discuss those items.</p>

<p>For <code>PLC2701</code>, I think that some users may still want a warning about using private names that are subject to change and suddenly break a stub, as per:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further, as private imports are not considered part of the public API, they are prone to unexpected changes, especially outside of semantic versioning.</p>
<p>Instead, consider using the public API of the module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This rule ignores private name imports that are exclusively used in type annotations. Ideally, types would be public; however, this is not always possible when using third-party libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(that last sentence is why I&#x27;ve been ignoring it, since more often then not there&#x27;s no alternatives other than re-writing Aliases, TypeVars and Protocols)</p>
<p>So I&#x27;m not 100% convinced either way whether this should be disabled for everyone.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>flake8-builtins (A)</code></p>
<p>The following I&#x27;m pretty sure should be disabled in stubs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A002</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-argument-shadowing/</li>
<li><code>A003</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-attribute-shadowing/</li>
<li><code>A005</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-module-shadowing/</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the rest:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A001</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-variable-shadowing/
This could happen with aliases and other top-level variables. Non-runtime type aliases should be private in the first place. Devs also shouldn&#x27;t try to import builtins from a module that happens to import said builtin. And finally this rule mostly tries to protect against <em>using</em> the shadowed variable. In a typing-only context, you should mostly be guarded by type tests anyway.
I think this should be ignored in stubs.</li>
<li><code>A004</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-import-shadowing/
Very similar as <code>A001</code> but can actually be worked around with import aliases and re-export aliases. (which would trigger <code>A001</code> instead)</li>
<li><code>A006</code> https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-lambda-argument-shadowing/
I don&#x27;t think lambdas apply to type stubs anyway. Probably doesn&#x27;t need to be ignored.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did an experiment where I enabled nearly all rules in typeshed, and here&#x27;s what I found typeshed would disable in PYI files (that isn&#x27;t just an opinionated matter): <a href="https://github.com/Avasam/typeshed/pull/39">Avasam/typeshed#39</a>/files#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pep8-naming (N)</code>: As @harahu just mentioned, most pep8-naming rules don&#x27;t apply for third-party stubs<ul>
<li><strong>But</strong> relevant rules could be made to apply to names decorated with <code>@type_check_only</code>, since that&#x27;s a clear signal the stub author is very likely in control of that name.</li>
<li><code>N811</code>, <code>N812</code>, <code>N813</code>, <code>N814</code>, <code>N817</code> are probably fine in stubs, as long as the name isn&#x27;t re-exported (in <code>__all__</code>, or <code>var = var</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>A001</code>, <code>A002</code>, <code>A004</code>: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15293">astral-sh/ruff#15293</a></li>
<li><code>PLC2701</code> as previously mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14535">astral-sh/ruff#14535</a>#issuecomment-2496160152 (that&#x27;s just my work account, same person here), <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15294">astral-sh/ruff#15294</a>, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15295">astral-sh/ruff#15295</a></li>
<li><code>PIE796 non-unique-enums</code>: I already raised <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15132">astral-sh/ruff#15132</a> for different reasons</li>
<li><code>FURB189 subclass-builtin</code>: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15291">astral-sh/ruff#15291</a> (Stub author should follow runtime superclass when possible)</li>
<li><code>PLW1641 eq-without-hash</code>: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15292">astral-sh/ruff#15292</a> (If runtime doesn&#x27;t implement <code>__hash__</code>, stubs shouldn&#x27;t show it as such)</li>
<li><code>flake8-bandit (S)</code><ul>
<li><code>S105</code>, <code>S106</code>, <code>S107</code>: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15206">astral-sh/ruff#15206</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As for opinionated rules: <code>RUF022</code>, <code>RUF023</code>, <code>F403</code>, <code>F405</code> (caught by type-checkers), <code>FURB180</code> (often breaks mypy/stubtest) are disabled for reasons specific to typeshed and can be kept out of this conversation.</p>
