        bar
)
$ ruff --select F401 --add-noqa foo.py
Added 1 noqa directives.

        bar  # noqa: F401
)

```

Ah thank you. I probably didn't extend `--add-noqa` to handle those "parent-style" comments when we added support for them.

Does `--select RUF100 --fix` remove the dupe? (Still a bug.)

yes, `ruff --select RUF100,F401 --fix foo.py` restores the original version
