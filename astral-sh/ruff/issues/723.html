            <div class="timeline-body"><p>e.g. Trying ruff 0.0.114 on the Biopython codebase as an alternative to flake8 (for which is almost unbelievably fast, sub-second even if I deliberately run <code>rm -rf .ruff_cache/</code> first. Nice!):</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff Bio --extend-ignore E501,B007,E741,F401,F841,D105,B009,B010,B011
Bio/PDB/MMCIF2Dict.py:120:41: E713 Test for membership should be `not in`
</code></pre>
<p>Attempting to copy and past that into my git commit message at the command line is complicated due to the back ticks (bash attempts to run the command <code>not in</code>). Typically flake8 plugins use single quotes, where that is not a problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Many characters remain special to Bash inside double quotes. The way to suppress their special meaning is by surrounding them with single quotes (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html">documentation</a>):</p>
<pre><code>git commit -am &#x27;Fix E713 Test for membership should be `not in`&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>which would actually become harder if ruff used single quotes itself.</p>
<p>(That said, if it were my project, I might have opted for Unicode curly quotes: <code>Test for membership should be ‘not in’</code>, like GCC.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know there are workarounds, my point was with flake8 and pycodestyle I don&#x27;t need one because it uses single quote chars:</p>
<p>https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/2.9.1/pycodestyle.py#L1418</p>
<p>i.e. I see this as a minor but annoying change in potentially switching from flake8 to ruff.</p>
<p>(Unicode quotes would be a neat alternative, they probably would work near universally nowadays.)</p>
<p>As an aside, the real flake8 and pycodestyle seems to miss this particular example <a href="https://github.com/biopython/biopython/pull/4159">biopython/biopython#4159</a> very strange (e.g. <code>$ flake8 --isolated --select E713 Bio/PDB/MMCIF2Dict.py</code> to rule out a configuration issue) - so that&#x27;s an upside.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me take a look at a few other tools and see how they handle this! I initially liked the use of backticks since they render correctly in Markdown and (to my mind) had become a standard for indicating code snippets. But it&#x27;s not worth it to me if it&#x27;s causing a bunch of inconveniences.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>“A bunch of inconveniences” seems overblown. Rust errors use backticks <code>``</code>; the Rust team has put a lot of effort into error message ergonomics generally, and thought about this specific question at least enough to put it in their <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/diagnostics.html#diagnostic-structure">style guide</a>. I didn’t find any evidence of complaints from people incorrectly pasting backticks from Rust errors into their shell.</p>
<p>ASCII quotes <code>&#x27;&#x27;</code> or <code>&quot;&quot;</code> would be confusable with real Python syntax, and they’d still be misinterpreted under naïve shell pasting. Unicode quotes <code>‘’</code> or <code>“”</code> would be pretty and unambiguous (in good enough fonts), but might require a bit more effort from ruff contributors to maintain consistency. I assume we can all agree that the hideous <code>`&#x27;</code> “pairs” emitted by some older tools merit no consideration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm yeah. While I totally understand the critique @peterjc, I think I&#x27;m going to leave this as-is for now. If we continue to hear complaints, I&#x27;ll definitely reconsider!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s fine, it is only a minor inconvenience to me. Thank you.</p>
<p>I can see this was a deliberate choice away from the Python tools&#x27; use of single quotes to the back-ticks favoured by the Rust team (quoting the style guide Anders linked to):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When code or an identifier must appear in a message or label, it should be surrounded with backticks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rust team were probably swayed by the back-tick use for literals in markdown and RST.</p>
