            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do realize that ruff's <code>SLF001</code> is modeled after <code>flake8-self</code> and a such, there may be opposition for implementing behavior diverging from the latter.
However, I often find the situation that boils down to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cat a.py
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Accessor:
    def __init__(self, parent: &quot;Parent&quot;) -&gt; None:
        self._parent = parent

    def act(self) -&gt; None:
        self._parent._private()


class Parent:
    def _private(self) -&gt; None:
        pass

    def get_accessor(self) -&gt; Accessor:
        return Accessor(self)
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ruff check --select SLF001 a.py
a.py:6:9: SLF001 Private member accessed: `_private`
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>In actual code <code>Accessor</code> contains multiple references to <code>Parent</code>'s private members. Currently, to avoid <code>SLF001</code>, every such line should be annotated with <code># noqa: SLF001</code>. I would not want to disable <code>SLF001</code> globally as I believe it to be useful, however, it would be great to have something similar to C++'s <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/friend-class-function-cpp/">friend class</a> which would allow one to mark <code>Accessor</code> as a friend of <code>Parent</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahh yeah, I think this is gonna be hard to support, since we don't have a builtin syntax or <code>typing</code> mechanic to express it in code, and even then, we'd need to be able to do stronger type inference than Ruff is capable of today.</p>
