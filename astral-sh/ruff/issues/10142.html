            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Probably many people that start to use ruff linter have been using pylint previously. These users might already have some pylint rules disabled in their codebase:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class ComplexBanana:  # pylint:disable=too-many-public-methods
</code></pre>
<p>Could and should ruff read those disable comments and treat them as <code>noqa</code> comments? I think it would ease the crossover.</p>
