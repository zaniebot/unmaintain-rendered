            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I found an issue where Ruff doesn't detect a syntax error in f-string. Consider this simple source:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os

location = f's3://{os.environ.get('bucket', 'dev')}'
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff reports no issues:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ uv tool run ruff check ruff_bug.py
All checks passed!
$ uv tool run ruff format ruff_bug.py
1 file left unchanged
</code></pre>
<p>However, the module is invalid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python ruff_bug.py
  File &quot;ruff_bug.py&quot;, line 3
    location = f's3://{os.environ.get('bucket', 'dev')}'
                                       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>Tested in ruff 0.5.1 and 0.6.4.  It seems like Ruff isn't catching this invalid syntax with mismatched quotes in the f-string.</p>
<p>Is this an expected behaviour?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, and no.</p>
<p>It's expected behavior because this is a known limitation of Ruff and there have been a few related issues like https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10163</p>
<p>But no, because we agree that this is not a good user experience. The problem is that our parser currently doesn't respect the project's target version. It always uses the latest syntax which allows using the same quotes for the f-string and inner expressions. There's an issue to either make the parser target-version aware OR create a lint rule that flags all syntax that isn't compatible with the project's target version.</p>
