            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A long ways off, but creating this tracking issue to add ideas as they arise.</p>
<p>Python 3.15 will introduce <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0810">PEP 810 - Explicit lazy imports</a>. We will certainly have to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Update the parser</li>
<li>[ ] Update the formatter</li>
<li>[ ] Update the semantic model (though according to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0810/#typing-and-tools">this subheading</a> these will be treated the same as ordinary imports for our purposes)</li>
</ul>
<p>But we may also want to consider some lints. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sorting these imports (this requires a few design decisions)</li>
<li>Adjust the fixes in <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-type-checking-tc"><code>flake8-type-checking</code></a> to suggest that typing-only imports be <em>lazily</em> imported rather than gated behind <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code>, as per <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0810/#what-about-type-annotations-and-type-checking-imports">this use-case in the PEP</a>.</li>
<li>Relatedly - replacing existing <code>if TYPE_CHECKING: ...</code> imports with lazy imports.</li>
<li>Suggesting lazy imports any time we see an import not at the beginning of the file. (Developers sometimes approximate lazy imports these days by importing in the body of a function, for example.)</li>
<li>More aggressive/opinionated lints - e.g. &quot;make all imports lazy&quot;, with an unsafe autofix.</li>
<li>Conversely, <em>removing</em> <code>lazy</code> if we can guarantee that the import will be evaluated (e.g. by a top-level statement in the module).</li>
</ol>

<p>Somewhere in between, less aggressive: Suggesting lazy imports whenever a symbol <em>isn't</em> obviously used at the module root level (still imperfect, but less false-positives than &quot;make all imports lazy&quot;)</p>
<p>In other words: &quot;5. Make all imports lazy, except when detected to be used at module root&quot;.</p>
<p>Further refinement with code analysis could try to follow function calls, but that seems niche.</p>
