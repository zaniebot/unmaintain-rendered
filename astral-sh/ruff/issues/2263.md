# Implement autofix for RET504 Unnecessary variable assignment before `return` statement

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-27 16:07_

A fixer for `RET504 Unnecessary variable assignment before 'return' statement` would be nice.

```diff
 def random_zone():
-    random_zone = f'{uts.random_string()}.{uts.random_string()}'
-    return random_zone
+    return f'{uts.random_string()}.{uts.random_string()}'
```

At least for this simple case I imagine this easy to implement?
