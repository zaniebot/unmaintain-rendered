<p>You could also link the individual rules mentioned elsewhere to the links you created. In <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#task-tags"><code>task-tags</code></a> setting, <code>ERA</code> and <code>E501</code> are mentioned and could link back to the links you added in this PR. They all seem to follow the regex <code>\(`[A-Z]{1,3}[0-9]{0,4}`\)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion @JonathanPlasse. I wonder if doing this automatically might lead to quite a few false positives and, therefore, if it might be better to do this manually in the specific documentation sections.</p>
<p>An example of a false positive could be if <code>V101</code> in the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#external">external settings section</a> was linked to <code>https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#V101</code>, which is currently not valid a valid rule section. Another example that matches your provided regex is &quot;(<code>key</code>)&quot; in the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/invalid-envvar-value/">invalid-envvar-value (PLE1507)</a> rules; this would direct users to <code>https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#key</code>, which is also not currently a valid rule section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid false positives like <code>V101</code> we could check if the rule exists.
<code>(`key`)</code> should not match the regex as it uses lower cases.</p>
<p>This is dependent on #4158 being merged.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The idea was to automatically create links when rule codes are mentioned (e.g. <code>`E501`</code> in <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#line-length">settings.line-length</a>).
This is similar to the links automatically created for mentioned settings.</p>
