Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p><code>pydocstyle</code> code <code>D102</code> is raised on any public methods that do not have a docstring. I agree with this in principle, except that I have many cases where I have a common base class which defines some method's interface (and documentation), but that method's specific implementation will be defined by child classes or needs to be modified by a child class. E.G.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Parent:
    def foo(self, arg1, arg2, arg3):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Some documentation about foo.&quot;&quot;&quot;


# possibly in a different module or package
class Child(Parent):
    def foo(self, arg1, arg2, arg3):
		return arg1 + arg2 + arg3
</code></pre>
<p><code>ruff</code> flags <code>foo</code> in <code>Child</code> with <code>D102</code>, when in fact this is documented by <code>Parent.foo</code>.</p>
<p>In most cases, documenting the method in the child class would be equivalent to copy/paste of the docstring from the parent class, which I dislike. I would like the optional ability for <code>ruff</code> to ignore <code>D102</code> on methods defined in their parent classes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that this would be an improvement. We probably can't really support it until we start doing cross-file analysis (otherwise, it would only work if <code>Parent</code> and <code>Child</code> were defined in the same module, which seems like a minority of cases).</p>

<p>This would be a really nice thing to have for cross-file analysis. Hopefully, you can get it to work even in cases where <code>Parent</code> is defined outside the package being linted (i.e. if I am building of an interface defined by an external library). Though even getting it to work within just the package being linted would be a massive improvement</p>

<p>Even this would be nice, as I do have code that falls into this category (although I would still have to turn it off in general).</p>

Everything else is better. But this is a huge problem for me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a bit of a bump, but I wanted to ask if cross-file analysis is now a more supported thing in ruff (as you pointed out @charliermarsh), in which case I would be willing to give implementing this a shot :)</p>
<p>Its a bit of a blocker for one of our projects, and I have resorted to just disabling <code>D102</code> entirely for the time being (but would love to active it at some point!)</p>

<p>Oh I guess you'd still want to trigger when no base method has a docstring.</p>
<p>Depends if you'd prefer false-positives or false-negatives here. But not as straightforward as I thought.</p>
