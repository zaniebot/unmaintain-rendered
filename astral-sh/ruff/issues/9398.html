            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Been getting these errors in vs code as of late:</p>
<pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at crates\ruff_linter\src\rules\pycodestyle\rules\invalid_escape_sequence.rs:215:18: called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace )
</code></pre>
<p>This error message asked me to post here.</p>
<p>Would like to point out this usually happens while I'm typing code, so obviously there are going to be syntax errors but I'm not sure why Ruff is trying to parse them. If I need to post this on a different repo please let me know.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. Do you happen to know what version of Ruff you're using? Or of the VS Code extension?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like this was resolved in newer versions of Ruff, based on this similar issue: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9542.</p>
