Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Currently, <code>noqa</code> directives need to reference the exact rule prefix and code (e.g. <code>SLF001</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">device._switch.connect()  # noqa: SLF001
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice to reference the rule short name (as in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/private-member-access/">documentation</a>), as I personally have trouble keeping track of numerical rules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">device._switch.connect()  # noqa: private-member-access
</code></pre>
<p>This is more of a feature request than a real issue so let me know if this is by design. If not, would you accept a PR implementing this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! We do intend to make this change and there's some discussion on it here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1773. It hasn't been prioritized yet but there's a very high likelihood that we migrate to human-readable rule names.</p>
