Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Short summary: I think this problem is very similar to https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA/issues/806</p>
<p>I am using the current latest version: <code>0.0.278</code>
This problem arises when you have a jupyter notebook containing a cell with imports without a trailing newline, followed by another cell without a leading newline, and you run ruff with rule <code>I001</code> selected.</p>
<p>My example notebook has the following cells:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>If I run the command below, it shows an I001 violation, because there is no blank line separating the imports from the rest of the code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ruff check ruff-isort.ipynb --no-cache --select=I001 --isolated --show-source
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-text">ruff-isort.ipynb:cell 1:1:1: I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
  |
1 | / import os
2 | | print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
  | |_^ I001
  |
  = help: Organize imports

Found 1 error.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
</code></pre>
<p>Also, when I run the command with the --fix option, no changes are made to the file and the error persists.</p>
<p>As in the nbQA issue mentioned above, the issue might be addressed by adding 2 newlines between cells instead of 1 in the intermediate code.</p>
<p>Thanks all for this amazing tool!</p>
