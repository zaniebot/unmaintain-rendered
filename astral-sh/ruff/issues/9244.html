            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i think there's a huge overlapping userbase of python users who work in the data engineering space. the current lanscape of good tooling to format and lint sql files is not great and something like ruff for those scenarios could be huge.</p>
<p>basically ruff to replace sqlfmt and sqlfluff would be awesome.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@OneCyrus It looks like <a href="https://github.com/nrempel/sleek">Sleek</a> may be up your alley for the time being, at least as far as formatting goes. It was easier to set up than sqlfmt.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If this is implemented would that make ruff format SQL within the strings, or this feature only asks to format SQL files separately?</p>
<p>Slightly unrelated, but what's the recommended way to write python code with raw SQL?</p>

<p>@benfdking I'd also be pretty intrigued on what y'all's intended outcome for this. (I really enjoy sqruff by the way, I can completely understand sqruff being a completely separate tool.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also enjoy sqruff due to its speed, but there's still quite a few things that feel not implemented. It would be good to get more hands on deck. I've been working on quite a few fixes as I get it integrated into my project I'll be submitting a pr for, but would still be great to have it built into ruff.</p>
