# Make --quiet more quiet

---

_Issue opened by @jlangeveld on 2022-11-03 07:58_

Would it be possible to make the output more quiet when using the `--quiet` option?
Right now ruff reports
- That there are diagnostics
- That it's possible to fix some of them automatically.

But that means I have to use `grep -v` to filter out the diagnostics.

Good idea.

Will fix this today. I want to do a small refactor around those settings.
