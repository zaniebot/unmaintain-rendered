Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>pre-commit config:</p>
<pre><code>  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    # Ruff version.
    rev: v0.0.277
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [&quot;--fix&quot;, &quot;--exit-non-zero-on-fix&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I'm still getting E501 errors which should ideally get fixed as autofix is enabled. Not sure if i'm missing something or if it's an issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hy @sahajvss</p>
<p>Ruff only supports fixes for some rules and rule <code>E501</code> is one such rule for which does not yet support an autofixing (but may in the future). The <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/">rule table</a> in the documentation shows which violations support autofix.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies why <code>E501</code> doesn't get fixed. If not, don't hesitant to reply again.</p>
