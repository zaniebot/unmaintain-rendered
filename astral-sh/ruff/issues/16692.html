<p>I know this goes further from the scope of the rule from which it was derived, but IMO this is an important option. If there is a strong reason to ban an API - either because you're trying to eliminate a pattern, or because you want to enforce a internal wrapper, banning just the single import doesn't go all the way. Several Python packages tend to explicitly re-export certain module members for convenience - for example <code>celery.app.shared_task</code> and <code>celery.shared_task</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah I figured; we currently have a custom pylint checker, but since astroid actually evaluates Python, it's able to see that <code>celery.app.shared_task == celery.shared_task</code>, and we're able to use that to universally catch most usual types of manipulation that could result in the rule being bypassed.</p>
<p>For what it's worth I've already re-done the rules with <code>banned-api</code> and just explicitly included the common re-exported paths, since it's so much more convenient (and we won't have to maintain a custom linter rule), but it would be good to have a general solution.</p>
