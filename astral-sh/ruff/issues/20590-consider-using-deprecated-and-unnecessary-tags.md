# Consider using `Deprecated` and `Unnecessary` tags for more rules

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2025-09-26 07:03_

With https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20565 landed, it's now very easy for rules to set the `Unnecessary` or `Deprecated` tags which changes how violations are displayed in editors. We should consider setting those tags for more rules.
