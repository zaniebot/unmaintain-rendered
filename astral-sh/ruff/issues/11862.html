            <div class="timeline-body"><p>same false positive here:</p>
<p><code>from django.db.models import Q as Query</code></p>
<p>imho N811 should not be applied to single character &quot;names&quot;, as naming conventions for single character names are ambigous anyways and in this particular case no one can say by just looking at the name if it is a constant or a class. <code>Q</code> here is a class, yet the above is flaged with N811, taking <code>Q</code> for a constant.</p>
<p>Maybe it would also be good to use no single character names for variables or classes, but that's another topic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Addressing the false positive for <code>from uuid import UUID as UUIDType</code> is tricky. It seems to be a violation of PEP8, although a lot people would probably consider it acceptable for the class to be all-caps. A potential solution would be to whitelist common all-caps words like UUID, but obviously that's fragile, and I don't think anyone wants to go down that rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I do, however, have a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14584">PR</a> for the following false-positives:</p>
<p><code>from foo.bar import A as Apple</code>
<code>from foob.bar import Apple as A</code></p>
