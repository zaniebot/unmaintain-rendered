# Autofix D403

---

_Issue opened by @mmarras on 2023-01-23 22:46_

Rule D403 
>First word of the first line should be properly capitalized

is not not part of autofix.

I suggest that it should be included and just go ahead and capitalize.

I'd be interested to see how reliable this is in practice.
