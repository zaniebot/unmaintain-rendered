            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I noticed when adding in pydocstring lint rules that ruff doesn't have a rule to warn when there's an argument definition in a docstring that isn't in the function parameters. This would be good to have when refactoring code.</p>
<p>Here's a minimal repro with the pydocstring rules turned on: https://play.ruff.rs/0f9db152-4bdf-4c4f-a4e9-8b3ccba1848c</p>
<p>I couldn't find another issue tracking this, so I'm starting a new one. If this is a dupe, apologies.</p>
<p>`&quot;&quot;&quot;example.&quot;&quot;&quot;
def fibonacci(n):
&quot;&quot;&quot;Compute the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<pre><code>Args:
n: number
x: extra arg
&quot;&quot;&quot;
pass`</code></pre>
<p>I would like/expect to see an error for &quot;x: extra arg&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, I assumed we had a rule for that too. The closest, but opposite, is <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-param/#undocumented-param-d417">undocumented-param (D417)</a>. I think this case would be covered by <code>DOC102 Docstring contains more arguments than in function signature</code> from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12434, though. I see that there's a PR for DOC102 actually, I'll comment there as well.</p>
