            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is expected behavior or a potential issue, but I’ve come across a situation that I couldn&#x27;t fully resolve using existing answers on this topic. I hope someone here can help clarify things.</p>
<p>For my company, we’re evaluating various linters and formatters. During our testing, we explored <strong>Ruff</strong> and created a <code>test_script.py</code> file containing numerous code smells - specifically, several instances of code duplication (9 lines repeated multiple times within the same file), as well as many unused classes, functions, local variables, and arguments.</p>
<p>We noticed that Ruff, unlike some other static analysis tools, <strong>does not appear to detect code duplications</strong> within the same file. Additionally, while it seems to detect unused local variables and arguments, <strong>unused classes and functions are not flagged</strong> as expected.</p>
<p>Is there a specific reason for this behavior?<br>
And more importantly, is there a way to configure Ruff (or extend it) to detect <strong>both code duplications</strong> and <strong>unused functions/classes</strong>, across the whole project but also <strong>within the same file</strong>?</p>
<p>Looking forward to your insights.
<br>
Best regards,<br>
Alex</p>
Version
<p>ruff 0.11.7</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @ALPA-Industry-and-Technology</p>
<p>Ruff currently doesn&#x27;t support duplicate code detection. There are two open issues around it (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/17724">astral-sh/ruff#17724</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10522">astral-sh/ruff#10522</a>). There&#x27;s no specific reason that Ruff doesn&#x27;t support it other than that there have always been more pressing issues to work on.</p>
<p>For unused functions and classes. Python&#x27;s module system makes detecting unused functions and classes non trivial because all module-level symbols are public. That means, detecting unused functions and classes (and variables) requires searching for all usages across all files. We hope that we&#x27;ll be able to provide such a lint rule in the future with your new semantic analysis that we build as part of our experimental type checker ty. But it isn&#x27;t something that ruff supports today because ruff&#x27;s analysis is single file only.</p>
