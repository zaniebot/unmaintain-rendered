            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To better understand what I mean see <a href="https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/environment/overview/#environment-configuration">here</a> and below in the hatch docs which also uses Material for Mkdocs.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/assets/13859009/573e8730-c72c-4b50-8214-7c5e184f55f9" alt="image" /></p>
<p>It doesn't seem the case in the hatch docs that if you select one such tab that all the tabs that follow automatically select the same tab. I don't know how it is done but that is the case in the hugo docs for example <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-directory">here</a> and below and it is a really nice feature.</p>

<p>I think this would be a great improvement to the <code>ruff</code> docs in terms of readability and understanding for users.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The same style could be used in other areas within the docs too for example the installation instructions as <a href="https://rye-up.com/">here</a> in the rye docs - again another project using Material for MkDocs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be great, especially for showing <code>pyproject.toml</code> vs. <code>ruff.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>
<p>Content tabs are linked based on their label, not offset. This means that all tabs with the same label will be activated when a user clicks a content tab regardless of order inside a container.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this from the page you linked suggests maybe what I described implemented in the hugo docs is possible with Material for MkDocs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would be happy to help too. I'm a bit reluctant to take it all on owing to the pace this project is moving and my time. I wouldn't want to disappoint people. Maybe, if it is a lot of work we could split it between myself and trag1c?</p>
