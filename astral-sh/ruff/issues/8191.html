<p>I already use <code>--check</code> and I know the formatter exits 0 without it. What I&#x27;m suggesting is a way to make it format <em>and</em> exit non-zero if anything changed in the same way as <code>check --fix --exit-non-zero-on-fix</code>. The problem with using <code>--check</code> alone is that if you run <code>pre-commit</code> locally, you first have to run <code>pre-commit</code> to see that things need formatting, then run <code>ruff format</code> separately without <code>--check</code>. I can&#x27;t just remove <code>--check</code> because then when the CI runs <code>pre-commit</code>, it won&#x27;t fail if somebody committed code without first formatting it, it will just quietly make the changes which is not useful on CI where those changes won&#x27;t persist.</p>

<p><code>ruff format --check</code> has different semantics than <code>ruff check --fix</code>. It only checks if files would be reformatted but it doesn&#x27;t change the files on disk. You want to use <code>ruff format</code> (without check) if you want to format AND persist the files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh sorry. I misunderstood you. If I understand you correctly, you&#x27;re asking that <code>ruff format --check</code> exits with a non-zero exit code if it would reformat any files but it would also write the changes back to disk so that running <code>ruff format</code> isn&#x27;t necessary locally.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a bit torn where to integrate this functionality best. We could either to <code>ruff format --exit-non-zero-on-fix</code> (undecided on the name of the flag) without using check. However, the option would be incompatible when using with <code>--check</code> or <code>--diff</code>.</p>
<p>Did you use black before? If so, how did your setup look like?</p>

<p>This seems like a reasonable approach if we do implement it. It isn&#x27;t incompatible with <code>--check</code> though, it just has no effect. With <code>--diff</code> I don&#x27;t know our exit code behavior.</p>

<p>Exactly, but as an additional flag rather than changing <code>--check</code> so as to avoid breaking everyone&#x27;s current CI workflows. 😏</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb I do have a need for this, so perhaps this could be re-opened? My use case: I can&#x27;t use pre-commit, because my project is a subdirectory in a larger git repo (&quot;monorepo&quot;). pre-commit decided to <a href="https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/466#issuecomment-921945015">not support</a> this use case, so I have my own &quot;pre-commit&quot; script, which indeed, I want to fail if it makes changes. Currently I wrote this:</p>
<pre><code>if ! ruff format --check .; then ruff format .; false; fi
</code></pre>
<p>but having a --exit-non-zero-on-fix would be much nicer.</p>
<p>If this is approved, I will be happy to try and implement this.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>What I understand from the script is that it runs <code>ruff format .</code> only if <code>ruff format --check</code> failed. Can you explain the reason for it? I would also be interested to understand what functionality you miss from using <code>ruff format --diff</code>. It doesn&#x27;t write the files as <code>ruff format</code> does.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser it&#x27;s convenient for me to have one script which formats files and returns a nonzero code if it modified files. This is the behavior of the pre-commit tool. It&#x27;s convenient because I use the same tool on my machine before committing, to format all the files, and also in CI, to block a pull request which isn&#x27;t formatted according to the rules. For running on my machine, I need it to format the files. For running in CI, I need it to return nonzero if files aren&#x27;t formatted. It&#x27;s convenient to combine the two uses.</p>

<p>something like</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also need this.  Like above its fine to make the changes &quot;ruff format&quot; - we just need to know if it ended up making any changes...</p>
<p>If &quot;ruff format&quot; returned a 1 if it made changes then we know.  We stop the pre-commit.  Developer does a git status and can see we already fixed some things.  They review and do a commit and all is good.</p>
<p>Otherwise, as mentioned before we have to run ruff twice.  (Though since it is so much faster than black that isn&#x27;t as bad as it could be!  :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a similar need.   I&#x27;m moving to <a href="https://moonrepo.dev/">moon</a> for monorepo task management, and it has most of what I need for a pre-commit alternative, and by eliminating pre-commit I can have a single source of truth for task execution.</p>
<p>As a developer running a formatter on pre-commit, I want the formatter to format my code, but I <em>also</em> want pre-commit to abort so that the user can review the changes that were made (same behavior as with <code>pre-commit</code> tool).   As it stands, I have to run <code>ruff format</code> twice:  with and without <code>--check</code>.</p>

<p>*: You&#x27;d have to either fold the <code>git</code> checking into the command running <code>ruff format</code> or the overarching command which is running <code>ruff format</code> (and there&#x27;s a chance both is impossible/improbable)</p>
