            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Imagine a code like this:</p>
<pre><code>
values: dict[tuple[int, str]] = {&quot;thirteen&quot;: (13, &quot;Lorem&quot;), &quot;twentytwo&quot;: (22, &quot;Ipsum&quot;), &quot;two&quot;: (2, &quot;Dolor&quot;)}

def cleanup_dict(timeout: int) -&gt; Iterator[str]:
    items = list((key, value) for key, (expiration, value) in values.item() if expiration &lt; timeout)
    for key, value in items:
        yield key, value
        del values[key]

# does nothing
cleanup_dict(20)

# only runs partial
next(cleanup_dict(20))

# runs the iterator
deque(cleanup_dict(20), 0)
</code></pre>
<p>It might be a bad design to mix action and iterator, but what about a rule detecting iterators not executed? A Bonus point would be to detect a not fully executed iterator too. While it might be obvious in this example, given a few bad names and splitting the code over separate files would probably already obfuscate the problem quite well.</p>
<p>So my suggestion would be a rule which triggers on the first call (&quot;does nothing&quot;), but not on the third call (with deque). Whether the rule should also trigger on the second call is up to debate, maybe this could be split in a separate rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Detecting iterators that aren&#x27;t used at all seems reasonable to me. I don&#x27;t think we can warn about only partially used iterators because that&#x27;s a very valid use case.</p>
<p>Either way, I think we should wait for better type inference to make this rule useful.</p>
