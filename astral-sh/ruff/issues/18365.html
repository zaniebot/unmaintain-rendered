This indicates a bug in Ruff. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BInfinite%20loop%5D

...quoting the contents of `package/__init__.py`, the rule codes F401, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report and the great example! I can reproduce this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the best way to fix this, but one option could be some kind of special handling for <code>__init__.py</code> files in PLC0414. I know we have that for F401. We should probably just avoid offering a fix that would conflict with F401 in <code>__init__.py</code> files.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Is it also acceptable to just disable PLC0414 in <code>__init__.py</code> files entirely? Seeing as there's an exception for F401 already, I don't think it makes sense to warn for redundant aliases there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Or is PLC0414 just in general incompatible with the idea of using redundant aliases?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh you're right, we probably shouldn't offer a diagnostic at all in <code>__init__.py</code>, not just avoid a fix.</p>
<p>And yeah, I think <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/useless-import-alias/">PLC0414</a> is a pretty straightforward rule currently, it forbids any redundant alias even if removing it would change the program's behavior. That's why the fix is unsafe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fix is marked as always unsafe because the user may be intentionally re-exporting the import. While statements like import numpy as numpy appear redundant, they can have semantic meaning in certain contexts.</p>
