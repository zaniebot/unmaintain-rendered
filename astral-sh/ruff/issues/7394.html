<p>Pack of files, which contains differences between black/ruff - https://github.com/qarmin/Automated-Fuzzer/releases/download/test/Broken_Black_Formatting_0_0_289.zip</p>
<p>This files I took directly from pypi packages, without any changes/minimization</p>
<p>I tested 1,500,000 python files and I found 7535 different files, so that means that only 0.5 % formats differently.</p>
<p>This zip file contains 3 type of files - file formatted by black, file formatted by ruff, diff between them</p>
<p>E.g.
12330_black.py</p>
<pre><code>def somar(valor1, valor2):
    resultado = valor1 + valor2
    return (
        &quot;A Soma: &quot;
        &quot;{valor1} + {valor2} = {resultado}&quot;
        &quot;&quot;.format(valor1=valor1, valor2=valor2, resultado=resultado)
    )
</code></pre>
<p>12330_ruff.py</p>
<pre><code>def somar(valor1, valor2):
    resultado = valor1 + valor2
    return &quot;A Soma: &quot; &quot;{valor1} + {valor2} = {resultado}&quot; &quot;&quot;.format(

<p>I compared <code>ruff format .</code> with <code>black .</code>.
Is there a way to remove automatically known incompatibilities?</p>
<p>To find differences, first I formatted file with ruff, next I formatted them with black and from output I took list of files that were formatted second them to report them here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for doing this! It's really cool to see the compatibility statistics at-scale. I don't think there will be an easy way to deduplicate these with known fixes, but I'm gonna spend a few minutes skimming through and triaging where I can.</p>
<p>It would be nice to re-run this after a few releases to see how the metrics evolve.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, first of all, a special thanks for your hard works on this part of Ruff @MichaReiser.
There is an opinion in my mind, that could we know the reason why the specific format style picked? Just like linter rules and their auto-fixes. I didn't go deep on codebases, just saw few PRs, is it even possible?</p>
<p>I think categorize formatting styles, can help improve investigating on solutions for issues like current issue.
For example, a separated metadata file for formatted ranges of files and its style rule name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># test.py_meta.toml
lines_range = &quot;1..5&quot;
reasons = [&quot;await expression parentheses&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>By these metadata we can skip known incompatibilities.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hy @T-256</p>
<p>Ruff's formatter follows Black's style guide and is an opinionated formatter. It intentionally provides very few settings. That means it doesn't provide options to opt-in to individual formatting styles.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My new set of python files, now use 4.5 million of files from pypi instead 1.5 million like before, so it is quite strange that number of problem is few times lower.</p>
<p>Looks that I messed something with script to gather results so until I fix them, numbers of problems should not be compared to each other, because each time different set of files was used</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since number of allowed incompatibilities increases(https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7323), I don't see the point in automatically generating such a large number of differences between programs, because there is no method to force 100% compatibility with black so each example requires manual analysis</p>
