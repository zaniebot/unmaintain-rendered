            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be fantastic if the playground had a &quot;reset&quot; button. I often close the <code>knot.json</code> tab and then I need to manually recreate it or go to the Dev tools and clear local cache + reload the page.</p>
<p>I tried to quickly implement this myself, but that turned out to be a bad idea, because it turns out calling <code>localStorage.clear();</code> is not enough. And beyond that, I have no idea what I'm doing. Well, at least it looked great:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a great idea. I'm not sure where to place the <em>Reset</em> button. I don't want to put it into the header because it then breaks the mobile layout (which, admittedly isn't great but it looks reasonable)</p>
<p>Other options are to either add it to the tabs bar or add it as an item in the editor context menu (hard to discover, has the wrong scope)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess, an alternative is to put it into the header but hide it on mobile. Not great but I don't think anyone's writing playgrounds on mobile anyway</p>

<p>I actually did this quite a lot with mypy-playground, which is quite mobile-friendly: it was a great way to triage mypy issues while travelling. But it's quite hard to write code in the Ruff and red-knot playgrounds, so I generally don't use them at all on my phone right now</p>
