Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Please see this snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from functools import wraps


def wrapper(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def wrapped_f(*args, **kwargs):
        if 1 == 1:
            pass
        if 1 == 1:
            pass
        if 1 == 1:
            pass
        return f(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapped_f
</code></pre>
<p>And the below <code>pyproject.toml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.mccabe]
max-complexity = 3

[tool.flake8]
max-complexity = 3
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>ruff==0.0.265</code> will print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; ruff --select=C901 a.py
a.py:4:5: C901 `wrapper` is too complex (5 &gt; 3)
a.py:6:9: C901 `wrapped_f` is too complex (4 &gt; 3)
Found 2 errors.
&gt; flake8 a.py
a.py:4:1: C901 'wrapper' is too complex (5)
</code></pre>
<p>The 2nd error about <code>wrapped_f</code> if correct, as its cyclomatic complexity is above 3.  However, I think the 1st error about the <code>wrapper</code> (outer) function is a false positive, as it has a cyclomatic complexity ≤ 3.</p>
<p>In other words, I think <code>ruff</code> has a false positive <code>C901</code> for closures, only the inner should throw.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, <code>flake8==6.0.0</code> does not have this false positive, but I think they mark the extra complexity in the wrong place (at <code>wrapper</code>, not <code>wrapped_f</code>).</p>

<p>@charliermarsh have a look at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/19228. I think it is hard to argue that this function is complex. It should not be flagged imo.</p>
