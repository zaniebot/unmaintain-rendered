Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<h1>Region block comments</h1>
<p>Is it possible to keep the alignement of <code># region</code> / <code># endregion</code> code-folding comments? Or at least keep them consistent between open and close?

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm afraid. This isn't supported today. The formatter doesn't support the concept of region comments and always indents the comments to the same level as the statements.</p>
<p>I hoped that you could make it work by suppressing the comment but Ruff normalizes the indentation even in that case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test(test: name):
    a_long_body

# fmt: off
# region test
# more
# fmt: on    
    some_region

# fmt: off
# endregion
# fmt: on
    after_region
</code></pre>
<p>Gets formatted to</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test(test: name):
    a_long_body

    # fmt: off
    # region test
    # more
    # fmt: on
    some_region

    # fmt: off
    # endregion
    # fmt: on
    after_region
</code></pre>
<p>And having to use <code>fmt:off</code> around each region is rather verbose.</p>
<p>The challenge with supporting a feature like this is that I've seen different preferences and styles when it comes to formatting region comments AND the notation starting and ending a region (beyond that, it further complicates the comment formatting logic to know of region concepts).</p>
<p>The first step to move this forward would be to come up with a style proposal that has wide support in the community. We could then explore how a feature like this gets implemented, considering that there's sufficient demand for it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice if the position, both line and indentation, of region/endregion comments were generally untouched and ignored by the formatter.</p>
<p>I'm currently writing some FastAPI routes and their tests inline. So I want regions for each API method + test(s) combo.</p>
<p>Instead of getting to do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># region create
@app.post...
def create(&quot;/users&quot;...):
    ...

def test_create():
    ...
# endregion create

# region update
@app.post...
def update(&quot;/users/{user_id}&quot;...
    ...

def test_update():
    ...
# endregion update
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff formats as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># region create
@app.post...
def create(&quot;/users&quot;...):
    ...

def test_create():
    ...


# endregion create


# region update
@app.post...
def update(&quot;/users/{user_id}&quot;...
    ...

def test_update():
    ...


# endregion update
</code></pre>
<p>It works but it's a lot of extra whitespace.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't remember if I was able to do so in previous Ruff versions, but in 0.6.1 I am able to move the #endregion comment up and indented into the end of the method. So I get consistent code folding comments and it's still working in VSCode.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since #region/#endregion is recognized out of the box by the major IDEs (JetBrains, VSCode, etc.) I think it could be considered a standardized way of doing it rather than a preference.</p>
<p>But for anyone who needs a workaround, adding an additional <code>#</code> will work:</p>
<pre><code>##region Region name
...
##endregion
</code></pre>
