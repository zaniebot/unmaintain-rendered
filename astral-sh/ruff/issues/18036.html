            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Tested with ruff 0.11.8</p>
<p>Consider this (contrived) case of comments appearing in a dictionary definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Moo:
    x: float
    y: float

Moo(**{
    # Interesting observation about x
    &quot;x&quot;: 1.0,
    # Interesting observation about y
    &quot;y&quot;: 2.0
    })
</code></pre>
<p>applying autofix for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-dict-kwargs/">PIE804</a> (which is not marked unsafe) gives the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Moo:
    x: float
    y: float


Moo(x=1.0, y=2.0)
</code></pre>
<p>which has dropped the comment.</p>
<p>Ideally I think the comments should be preserved, but otherwise perhaps this autofix should be marked as unsafe?</p>
<hr />
<p>I came across this in the wild where previously some code constructed a big dictionary, and I was then porting it into a dataclass.. so was using the PIE804 autofix as above to save some typing. But then discovered that the comments got thrown away.</p>
