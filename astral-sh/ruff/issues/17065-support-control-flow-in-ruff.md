# Support control flow in Ruff

---

_@dylwil3_

This is a tracking issue for the re-implementation/re-packaging of the control flow graph in Ruff. The hope is that may eventually power some finer analyses and improve the correctness of some of our lint rules.

Thanks goes to @augustelalande for completing the implementation of the control flow graph that currently exists in Ruff! Many of the ideas present there have survived to the new specification and implementation.

# Task list

Control flow graph
- [x] Setup: `CFG` struct, builder (skeleton), visualization, and snapshot testing #17064 
- [x] Basic jumps: `return` and `raise` #17121
- [ ] Loops: `for` and `while` along with `continue` and `break`: #17175 
- [ ] Switch statements: `if` and `match`: #17268 
- [ ] Exception handlers: `try` and `with`
- [ ] `assert`

Statically known branches
- [ ] `if`/`elif` conditions
- [ ] `match` conditions

Optional
- [ ] Benchmark alternative graph designs, e.g. the arena approach [used here](https://docs.rs/petgraph/latest/petgraph/graph/struct.Graph.html) or returning to the bivalent approach from the original implementation


A detailed specification for what we're attempting to implement can be found below.

# Overview

A control flow graph is a grouping of statements into _basic blocks_
and edges indicating possible paths that a program may take through
those statements. In general, this is an _over_ approximation to the
actual paths that could be taken in a program. The restrictions placed
on which edges we draw are essentially purely syntactical. Finer analyses,
such as pruning based on statically known branches, are deferred.
To build a control-flow graph, we step through each statement in order.
By default, statements are added to the current basic block until we
reach a statement that invokes control flow. These are exactly the following:
| Switch | Loops | Jumps | Exception Handling |
|---------|---------|------------|--------------------|
| `if` | `for` | `break` | `try` |
| `match` | `while` | `continue` | |
| | | `raise` | |
| | | `return` | |

There are also `assert` and `with` statements, which are syntactic sugar
for a combination of the above.

We now discuss how each kind of control flow is handled.

## Switch Statements

Upon reaching a switch statement, the statement
itself terminates the basic block, and several outgoing
edges are added, labeled by the condition that needs to
be satisfied in order to traverse that edge. For example:

```python
if cond:
  f()
else:
  g()
```

Produces:

```text
         +--------+
         |  Start |
         +--------+
             |
             v
          +--------+
  +-------| SWITCH |
  |       +--------+
  |          |
  | cond     | not cond
  |          |
  v          v
+-----+     +-----+
| f() |     | g() |
+-----+     +-----+
  |          |
  +-----+----+
        |
      +--------+
      |  End   |
      +--------+
```

## Loops

A loop consists of a _loop guard_, a _body_, and an optional
_else_ clause. The _loop guard_ is a condition we check to
determine whether to re-enter the loop body, the _body_ is again
a list of statements, and the _else_ clause is a possible
exit from the loop body or guard (depending). For simplicity,
let's ignore the else clause for a moment and specialize to the
case of `while` loops.

When we reach a `while` loop, we begin by creating a new
basic block that is comprised entirely of the `loop` guard,
and which unconditionally follows the preceding basic block.
The loop guard consists of the test clause for the `while` statement.
This loop guard will have an outgoing node to the _loop exit_
and another to the loop body; the edge followed corresponds to the
veracity of the test clause.

The loop body will almost always have two outgoing edges: one
which points back to the loop guard, and another that goes to the
loop exit. An exception would be the case of a jump statement, like
`continue` or `return`.

For example,

```python
while cond:
  continue
```

would create

```text
         +--------+
         |  Start |
         +--------+
             |
             v
          +-----------+
  +-------| LOOP GUARD|<+
  |       +-----------+ |
  |          |          |
  | else     | cond     |
  |          |          |
  |          v          |
  |      +----------+   |
  |      | continue |---+
  |      +----------+
  |         
  |         
  |   +--------+
  +-> |  End   |
      +--------+
```

## Exception Handling

Before discussing jumps, which ought to have been
relatively straightforward, we must introduce a wrinkle:
exception handling. Control flow would be much simpler
if it weren't for `try` statements!

First, we have to alter our interpretation of what
the control flow graph actually represents when we
are inside of a `try` statement. Basic blocks within
a `try` statement no longer indicate sequences of statements
that are unconditionally executed one after the next.
Instead, we are to interpret these blocks as statements
that may or may not be aborted early due to an exception.

We then introduce two "virtual" blocks which are tasked
with cleaning up the program state and resuming ordinary
control flow. They are `EXCEPTION DISPATCH` and `RECOVERY`
blocks, which we use in the presence of `except` and `finally`
clauses, respectively.

For example:

```python
try:
  maybe_raise()
except ValueError:
  this()
except TypeError:
  that()
finally:
  cleanup()
```

results in:

```text
        +-------+
        | START |
        +-------+
            |
            v
        +---------------+
        | maybe_raise() |
        +---------------+
            |
            v
        +-----------+
        | DISPATCH  |-------------+
        +-----------+             |
ValueError|        | TypeError    | else
  +---------+  +--------+         |
  | this()  |  | that() |         |
  +---------+  +--------+         |
          |        |              |
          v        v              |
        +-----------+             |
        | cleanup() |<------------+
        +-----------+
              |
              v
        +-----------+
        | RECOVERY  |
        +-----------+       
```

The recovery block is especially useful in the handling
of deferred jumps, which we now discuss.

## Jumps

Upon reaching a jump statement, we must first examine
the stack of _try context_s. That is, we need to know whether we
are in certain clauses of a (nested) `try` statement,
in which case we must account for exceptions or defer
the jump until after executing a `finally` clause.

More specifically, a `TryContext` consists of:

- one of the five possible subsets of `try`/`except`/`else`/`finally` that can occur
- the current state: in `try`, `except`, `else`, or `finally`
- a list of deferred jump statements

To determine whether we should continue to defer jump statements,
we ask whether any of the `TryContext` members are in a `try` state,
or in an `except`/`else` state with an upcoming `finally` clause.
If so, we pop the last `TryContext`, append its deferred jumps to the
new last `TryContext`, and proceed to the next block.
Outside of these conditions, in the ordinary course of things,
we terminate the basic block
and add an outgoing edge. The target of the edge is:

- the innermost loop guard, in the case of `continue`
- the innermost loop exit, in the case of `break`
- the terminal node, in the case of `return` or `raise`

Finally, when we are in the `RECOVERY` block after a `finally` clause,
and we have checked that we do not need to further defer jumps,
we then resolve all deferred jumps and pop a `TryContext`.
Resolving the jumps just means that we add edges to the corresponding
targets out of the `RECOVERY` block.
