https://pypi.org/project/safety/</p>
<p>Incredible value to my past projects as it monitors automatically python libraries dependencies for known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Parts of the project are tied to a for-profit business. If that is an issue, maybe an alternative CVE database can be found (did not research it).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed my recent experience shows also that pip-audit seems much better now :</p>
<ol>
<li>Their database is fully open-source (safety is only open-source on a monthly basis, which is inadequate for critical vulnerabilities, and they might change these terms in the future)</li>
<li>It is fully synchronized with the osv database</li>
<li>It contains cases (at least on my python environment) that safety does not report</li>
<li>Safety has a false positive with jinja2 that they have politely declined to fix :
https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/1994</li>
<li>Pip-audit has the ambition to become part of the pip toolset</li>
</ol>
<p>If ruff wants to go forward with vulnerability checks, the pip-audit database might be a much better candidate.
I also think ruff could add value by being much faster (pip-audit is quite slow)</p>
