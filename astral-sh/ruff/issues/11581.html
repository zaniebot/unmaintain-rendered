            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In aiohttp, we usually use exceptions to return non-OK status codes. A frequent line is</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">raise web.HTTPFound(&quot;/&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>to redirect to <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>I hope you'll agree that assigning <code>&quot;/&quot;</code> to a variable beforehand wouldn't aid readability in any way. As such, it would be great to either</p>
<ul>
<li>ignore these exceptions by hard-coding them in ruff or</li>
<li>allow users to specify exceptions to be ignored by EM101 in the config. Bonus points if we could just write <code>aiohttp.web.HTTPRedirection</code>, which is a superclass.</li>
</ul>
