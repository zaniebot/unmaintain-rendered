            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting. I guess the problem why the term isn't in a general purpose dictionary is because it is a term specific to computer science. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memoize</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wouldn't be surprised if some words “specific to computer science” were initially actual misspellings. I don't see a substantial difference between the definitions of <code>memorize</code> and <code>memoize</code>, one that would explain the new spelling. Besides, it seems to me the usual word in computer science for “<em>store (the result of a computation so that it can be subsequently retrieved without repeating the computation</em>” is <strong><code>cache</code></strong>.</p>
<p>It is true <code>memoize</code> has been used more “widely” <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=memoize&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019">since 1980</a>, but <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=memoize%2Cmemorize&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019">many orders of magnitude less than <code>memorize</code></a>. I wonder how to find the seminal misspelling around 1970-1980, just to check whether it seems intentional or not. Perhaps it originates in Lisp and is intentional after all. From the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Advance_Papers/kp8dAQAAIAAJ">Advance Papers of the Fourth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,Tbilisi, Georgia, USSR, 3-8 Sept. 1975, Volume 2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>so they only have to be computed once ( “memoization” ), and using automatic simplification of the lower levels of access functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>whether and how to “memoize” data, and so on.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">wikipedia page for memoization</a> suggests the spelling was intentional, and describes it as a specific type of caching</p>
