<p>We are using <code>v0.4.1</code> with preco-commit and setting single-quotes but it is not enforced...
This is our config:</p>
<pre><code>[lint]
select = [
    &quot;E&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;F&quot;,
    &quot;Q&quot;,
]

[lint.flake8-quotes]
docstring-quotes = &quot;double&quot;
inline-quotes = &quot;single&quot;

[format]
quote-style = &quot;single&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>and this is the sample string which is untouched</p>
<pre><code>logger.info(
    f&quot;Connecting to {username}@{hostname} via ssh. If you encounter any issues, you can try `ssh -v -p {self._ssh_port} {username}@{hostname}` with the password &#x27;{self._ssh_password}&#x27; and report the issue on GitHub.&quot;

<p>Interesting, this &quot;bug fix&quot; seems to be a &quot;bug&quot; to me and the original version seemed more correct 🤣  but I see why you want to choose this.</p>
<p>If one chooses to use single quote, does Q000 attempt to change it to double quotes in this case? From a developer&#x27;s perspective, I don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s single quote or double quote - as long as the linter could enforce a consistent behavior, I am happy.</p>

<p>No, the rule wouldn&#x27;t convert a single-quoted string to a double-quoted string if the user preferred the &quot;single&quot; quotes in their config. But, in your case, there&#x27;s a single quote in the string content which is why Ruff doesn&#x27;t flag the string. This is to maintain consistency across all the parts of an implicitly concatenated string. For example, the following is inconsistent because some parts uses single quotes while others uses double quotes.</p>
<pre><code>        logger.info(
            f&#x27;Connecting to {username}@{hostname} via ssh. &#x27;
            f&quot;If you encounter any issues, you can try `ssh -v -p {self._ssh_port} {username}@{hostname}` with the password &#x27;{self._ssh_password}&#x27; and report the issue on GitHub. &quot;
            f&quot;If you started OpenDevin with `docker run`, you should try `ssh -v -p {self._ssh_port} {username}@localhost` with the password &#x27;{self._ssh_password} on the host machine (where you started the container).&quot;
        )
</code></pre>
<p>I think in this case you might get away with using <code>!r</code> instead of explicit quotes:</p>
<pre><code>        logger.info(
            f&#x27;Connecting to {username}@{hostname} via ssh. &#x27;
            f&#x27;If you encounter any issues, you can try `ssh -v -p {self._ssh_port} {username}@{hostname}` with the password {self._ssh_password!r} and report the issue on GitHub. &#x27;
            f&#x27;If you started OpenDevin with `docker run`, you should try `ssh -v -p {self._ssh_port} {username}@localhost` with the password {self._ssh_password!r} on the host machine (where you started the container).&#x27;
        )
</code></pre>
<p>This should put the quotes around the <code>self._ssh_password</code> value. For example:</p>
<pre><code>In [3]: print(f&#x27;hello {x!r}&#x27;)
hello &#x27;world&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>Does this help?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The behaviors here are intentional and I think we&#x27;re unlikely to make a bunch of changes to the rule, since we generally recommend using the formatter to enforce this anyway (which also allows specifying single-quote for inline with double-quote for docstrings).</p>
