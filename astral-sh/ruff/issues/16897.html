            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>One of the features I am missing in <code>neovim</code> is that when I rename a file, all imports that should be changed are being changed automatically. I have seen <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/5148#issuecomment-1557415101">this</a> from pyright team so it doesn't seem that they plan to work on it. And it will be only supported on pylance.</p>
<p>I am not quite sure if a formatter like ruff should have these features or this should be a separate tool. But it would be nice to add them. And also note that I am not talking about this feature specifically, I am talking about refactoring in general.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ruff 0.8.4</p>
