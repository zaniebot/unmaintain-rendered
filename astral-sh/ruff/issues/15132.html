            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Found this whilst applying various Ruff groups on typeshed out of curiosity.</p>
<p>According to the updated typing spec for typing enums (see <a href="https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2024/12/mypy-114-released.html">Mypy: Change to Enum Membership Semantics</a> and https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/enums.html#defining-members, this is the recommended way to type an enum in stubs where the type is known but the value isn't:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Key(enum.Enum):
    alt = cast(KeyCode, ...)
    alt_l = cast(KeyCode, ...)
    alt_r = cast(KeyCode, ...)
    alt_gr = cast(KeyCode, ...)
    # ...
</code></pre>
<p>This will trigger <code>PIE796</code></p>
<p>However I think that a fix could be simpler than that: This rule probably shouldn't apply to stubs as it's out of the control of a stub's author (ref https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14535 )</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Rather than disabling the entire rule, I think the pattern should simply be ignored for stub files when checking for duplicates. It is possible that a stub author might add two members with the same value by mistake (say, via a copy and paste error).</p>
