Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I recently came across the SIM115 rule which encourages the use of context manager for <code>open()</code></p>
<p>I use pyfilesystem2 - which uses <a href="https://docs.pyfilesystem.org/en/latest/reference/osfs.html?highlight=openbin#fs.osfs.OSFS.openbin">fs.openbin</a></p>
<p>Is there any option in ruff to provide the functions which should be recommended as context managers ?
I learned that logger related rules have a <code>logger-objects</code> here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6764
Is there a similar <code>context-manager-objects</code> setting or something similar to encourage my developers to always use the <code>openbin</code> function with a context manager ?</p>
