# Pattern matching

_Issue opened by @jgsimard on 2022-12-08 21:25_

Hi, 
do you plan to support pattern matching as introduced in 3.10 ? I get 

E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax


Thanks

Yeah I definitely plan on supporting it. It requires some big upgrades to the parser so hasn't happened yet, but it will.
