<p>I was wondering if there are any plans for creating plugins for Pycharm for the formatter and linter Ruff.</p>
<p>Most of the people I have ever worked use Pycharm as the main driver for dev and we find ourselves using the terminal within to use Ruff.</p>

<p>PyCharm support is something that's on our minds and we agree that it's important. For now, you can give the unofficial pycharm plugin a try https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/#pycharm-unofficial</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for your insights, @MichaReiser. We've been utilizing the plugin you recommended, primarily due to the lack of alternatives. However, we've encountered some challenges with it. Specifically, the plugin doesn't seem to perform linting as effectively as needed. We've noticed that certain linting issues aren't identified during its use, leading to unexpected feedback from our CI/CD pipeline. To address this, we're considering the implementation of pre-commit hooks as a means to automate and enhance the linting process.</p>

A lot of people at my company use PyCharm but find ourselves running ruff from the command line. I believe this should be taken as a priority.

We're very interested in providing a better experience in PyCharm and we'll definitely be dedicating resources to it. I think most of the remaining uncertainty is how to use our LSP to provide the same experience in both paid and free PyCharm versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please consider prioritizing this.</p>
<p>The plugin maintained by @koxudaxi routinely get's confused about what version of ruff it should be using in a given project and most recently has started just erroring all the time and trying to use a version of ruff from a project that's not even open.</p>
<p>This is creating a horrible development experience and there's many of us that have over a decade of experience with Pycharm and moving to VSCode is a huge ask.</p>

<p>It's good to see movement, but I opened a <a href="https://github.com/koxudaxi/ruff-pycharm-plugin/issues/376">bug report months ago</a> about how the plugin continuously switches which install of ruff is in use and always swaps this globally across all instances of the IDE.  This leads to the wrong version and/or the wrong configuration being used and it's a bit of a nightmare.  It's been going on 7 months and there's been zero action against a pretty significant issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding my voice of support for this. This week I decided to try PyCharm with ruff but I wasn't able to get it working out of the box using the unofficial plugin (probably related to https://github.com/koxudaxi/ruff-pycharm-plugin/issues/531) . In VSCode, the ruff integration is great and offers features such as formatting the selected lines rather than the full file which I find very useful in my current work. Official PyCharm support would be great. Now I'm left considering switching back to Black so I can use PyCharm.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm the author of the Ruff PyCharm Plugin, and I just learned yesterday that official support is actually moving forward. I'm truly delighted to hear this news 🎉</p>
<p>In fact, I met with the PyCharm team at PyCon US in May to discuss official Ruff support. To put it simply, I requested that they add this support. I don't know if my request contributed to this decision, but I'm very happy to see that support was actually added yesterday.</p>
<p>I developed this plugin because I needed to use Ruff in PyCharm for my daily work. I still use this plugin every day to work with Ruff.
I was aware of the issues where the plugin doesn't work in certain environments. However, since I can only dedicate time to OSS during my personal time, I've been occupied with family commitments, maintaining other OSS tools I've created, and activities related to being a PEP 750 co-author. I apologize for not being able to resolve some of these issues.</p>
<p>That said, I've continued to make necessary updates many times to keep up with PyCharm version upgrades, along with bug fixes. Nevertheless, I didn't want my plugin to negatively impact the reputation of Ruff or PyCharm, which is why I made the request to the PyCharm team. Of course, I'm grateful to both Astral and JetBrains for sponsoring me over the years through GitHub Sponsors. Thanks to their support, I was able to purchase a Mac for OSS development.</p>
<p>It appears that the changes were already merged, but there will likely be an official announcement when it's released.</p>

It would be greatly appreciated if you could leave a comment here once it's ready to be officially announced.</p>
