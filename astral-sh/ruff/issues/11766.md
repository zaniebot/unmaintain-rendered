# `ruff server` does not load new configuration files when they are created

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-06-05 22:28_

If you create a new `pyproject.toml` / `ruff.toml` configuration file in your workspace, we reload any existing configuration but do not 'register' the new configuration file.

This has been a known limitation of `Index::reload_settings`:

```rust
/// Reloads relevant existing settings files based on a changed settings file path.
/// This does not currently register new settings files.
```

I'm not sure whether this is actually a problem or not because it's suppose to be handled on the client side. The client will send us request on file events (create, change, delete). So, this should work.

As seen in the test plan of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12253, I'm creating a new `pyproject.toml` file in a nested folder and the diagnostics are being refreshed accordingly. At the end, I delete the file and it's refreshed as per the root `pyproject.toml` file.
