<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>Docs mention E201 3 times with (, [ and {. So I assume it&#x27;s just whitespace after any of them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh First time contributing and I&#x27;ve never worked with ASTs before. I think I have some code in place but would welcome support on this. I could open a PR to show what I have currently, if that is acceptable.</p>
<p>Basically stuck on the AST logic implementation and believe I have the rest in place.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can put up a PR and we can go through it there I think.</p>
<p>I was thinking that since the E3 series seems to be whitespace oriented it might be worth implementing them as a part of this issue as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Run into this as well when testing <code>ruff</code> on a relatively large, mostly legacy code base where it provides an immense speed boost over <code>flake8</code>; but we&#x27;ll have to wait until basic stuff along the lines of <code>E302</code> is supported.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do think <code>ruff</code> is fantastic, and I&#x27;m planning to adopt it soon both in various hobby projects and at work, but maybe &quot;near-parity with Flake8&quot; is a bit misleading for the time being?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@vytas7 - Appreciate it!</p>
<p>We prioritized the rules based on the assumption that Ruff would be used alongside Black -- so we just haven&#x27;t focused on implementing rules like <code>E302</code> that are made obsolete by an autoformatter. (It doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t implement them, just that they weren&#x27;t / haven&#x27;t been prioritized.) That&#x27;s one of the key assumptions baked into any &quot;parity with Flake8&quot; claims. I hope it doesn&#x27;t come across as misleading, it&#x27;s all documented in the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8">FAQ</a>, definitely not my intent.</p>
