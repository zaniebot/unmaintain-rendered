            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a lot of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/main/crates/red_knot_test">mdtests</a> in red-knot that have this pattern in them to create instance types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def bool_instance() -&gt; bool:
    return True

x = bool_instance()

def int_instance() -&gt; int:
    return 42

y = int_instance()

# do some reveal_type calls or whatever in the test now with `x` and `y`
</code></pre>
<p>Now that https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14802 has landed, however, we don't need nearly as much boilerplate in our tests. Instead, we can do something much more elegant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def f(x: bool, y: int):
    ...
    # do some reveal_type calls or whatever with `x` and `y`
</code></pre>
<p>We should go through all the Python snippets in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/main/crates/red_knot_python_semantic/resources/mdtest to reduce the boilerplate in our mdtests.</p>
