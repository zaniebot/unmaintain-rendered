            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>RUF200</code> should detect invalid contents of a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, but the <code>license</code> field does not seem to be validated correctly.</p>
<p>Minimal example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project]
name = &quot;xyz&quot;
version = &quot;0.0.1&quot;
license = &quot;MIT License&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>goes through, despite the value being set incorrectly (the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#license">specs</a> require this to be <code>license = {text = &quot;MIT License&quot;}</code>). This can be particularly surprising for people transitioning from <code>poetry</code>, where the syntax above was the expected one (yet in a differently named section), see for example https://github.com/rspeer/python-ftfy/issues/218</p>
<p>[Info] tested ruff versions: <code>0.4.1</code>, <code>0.6.9</code>; command: <code>ruff check --select ALL --isolated pyproject.toml</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. Ruff currently doesn't support any linting for pyproject.toml or ruff toml files. We should definitely support this but it's further out. I'll merge this with https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10487 which asks for a very similar functionality</p>
