            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As noted in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970#issuecomment-1341901539 , in #970 D102 is different from its pylint counterpart C0116.</p>
<p>It only requires that a function has docstring in the class hierarchy and does not require the overriding method to have a docstring (only the base method).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Foo:
  def validate(self):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Doc.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    ...

class Bar(Foo):
  def validate(self):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>I'm creating a separate issue to give this topic some visibility and to discuss it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The same applies to <code>D105</code> when overriding a base class' magic method, which already has a docstring. In pylint <code>C0116</code> this is ok, in <code>D105</code> it's not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Perhaps you can comment if this is intended or could be changed? This would not be a breaking change, more of a &quot;softening&quot; of the rule to be more compatible with repositories moving to ruff from pylint.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sigma67 - The challenge here is that, unlike Pylint, Ruff doesn't do analysis <em>across</em> files right now. So we could support this <em>within</em> a file, but we wouldn't be able to detect that the <code>validate</code> on <code>Bar</code> is an implementation of a parent interface if <code>Foo</code> is defined in another file.</p>
<p>One valid solution here is that we do ignore <code>D102</code> if you mark the method with <code>typing.override</code> or <code>typing_extensions.override</code>, which signals to type checkers that the method is intended to override a parent method.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh  I see, thanks for the clarification and the hint regarding <code>typing.override</code>, that's quite helpful.</p>
<p>Are there future plans for cross-file analysis?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sigma67 -- Yes, it will absolutely be part of Ruff in the future. It's a big project though so will take some time :)</p>
