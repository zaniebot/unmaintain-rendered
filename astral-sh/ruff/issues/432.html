            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Use case: when formatting with the text editor, I send the file contents as stdin and replace the file contents with the stdout of <code>ruff</code>, but that output ends-up being the message about an update being available.</p>
<p>I just ran into it, I can't send a PR right now, but may be able to do it tomorrow night or Sunday. Reporting it just in case someone wants to work on it first :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Weird that I'm still seeing this issue (on ruff 0.0.79, I was offered an upgrade to 0.0.80 in the stdout). For now I'm setting <code>--quiet</code> in the editor config, but I'll also try to investigate to get more details.</p>
