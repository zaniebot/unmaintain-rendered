            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I've noticed some strange behavior when saving code, as some of the import statements get removed even though they are referenced in the actual code.</p>
<p>I am using Sublime Text 4180 + LSP-ruff v2.03, and this is my ruff.toml:</p>
<pre><code>unfixable = [&quot;F401&quot;]

[lint.isort]
split-on-trailing-comma = false

[format]
skip-magic-trailing-comma = true
</code></pre>
<p>As a concrete example, if we take the code from here:</p>
<p>https://gist.githubusercontent.com/N8python/2431ab577d1de60e46180fa43a743c61/raw/453e677891eeb229ec4f05033ab6e0a4a8957aa3/MORE.py</p>
<p>and paste it into a new file and then save, everything above the &quot;# Copyright © 2023-2024 Apple Inc.&quot; gets dropped after saving. Some of those imports are required.</p>
<p>I then press <code>undo</code> <em>twice</em>, and the imports get magically added back, but the code is still linted. This behavior of having to press undo to fix things is unexpected. Moreover, pressing undo does not take the code back to the original pasted code (which is counter-intuitive).</p>
<p>There is something funny going on here :) I hope this makes sense. Thanks!</p>

<p>Can you specify the project structure? Like, where is the Python file and where's the Ruff config file (<code>ruff.toml</code>) ?</p>
