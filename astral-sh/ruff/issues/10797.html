            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a tracking issue for supporting dynamic client settings in workspaces.</p>
<p>Right now, client settings are created during server initialization and remain static while the server runs. This causes issues when workspace folders are dynamically added to a workspace - right now, we give them an empty settings field, but this is not the correct behavior. The VS Code extension should support updating the client settings for a workspace, and the server should listen for client settings updates.</p>
<p>Dynamic client settings would also enable us to persist the server across settings changes without reloading.</p>
