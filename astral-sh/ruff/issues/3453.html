            <div class="timeline-body"><p>None of the following trigger <code>B018</code> <code>useless-expression</code> for me, when I would expect them all to:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;foo&quot; + &quot;bar&quot;  # should trigger B018

&quot;foo&quot;  # should trigger B018

object().__class__  # should trigger B018

<p>I might be missing something about what this rule is supposed to do though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m <em>guessing</em> they got rid of strings to avoid false positives with docstrings (<a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/pull/209">PyCQA/flake8-bugbear#209</a>/files).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m guessing they don&#x27;t detect function calls since it&#x27;s not really possible (with current information) to know whether a function call is effect-ful or pure.</p>
<p>We could definitely detect binary operations though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was actually unable to get this rule to trigger at all-- do you have an example of something that triggers it? Like, <code>1 + 5</code> doesn&#x27;t trigger it either.</p>

<p>Yeah, the expected behavior is not to detect a straight function call, but when it&#x27;s followed by attribute access (as in my example) then I would think it should be detected. FWIW that&#x27;s pylint&#x27;s behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Prior to my open PR, the rule was only enforced in function and class bodies. I think this was consistent with bugbear but has since changed, so it’s reflected in the PR.</p>
