<pre><code>&quot;foo&quot; + &quot;bar&quot;  # should trigger B018

&quot;foo&quot;  # should trigger B018

object().__class__  # should trigger B018

<p>I might be missing something about what this rule is supposed to do though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is consistent with <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/blob/37bd2a079e1b2ebc0a72c8cf1a8e1c90c6c69148/bugbear.py#L1042">flake8-bugbear</a> although I'm not sure why their rule is limited to those cases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm <em>guessing</em> they got rid of strings to avoid false positives with docstrings (https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/pull/209/files).</p>
<p>I'm guessing they don't detect function calls since it's not really possible (with current information) to know whether a function call is effect-ful or pure.</p>
<p>We could definitely detect binary operations though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was actually unable to get this rule to trigger at all-- do you have an example of something that triggers it? Like, <code>1 + 5</code> doesn't trigger it either.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, the expected behavior is not to detect a straight function call, but when it's followed by attribute access (as in my example) then I would think it should be detected. FWIW that's pylint's behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Prior to my open PR, the rule was only enforced in function and class bodies. I think this was consistent with bugbear but has since changed, so it’s reflected in the PR.</p>
