            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello there :wave:</p>
<p>Kudos for this great tool, it's more than useful for so many projects.
I noticed that with the latest release, ruff is throwing errors on RUF029 on async interators.
The snippet below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import asyncio
from typing import Tuple


async def example(time: int) -&gt; Tuple[int, int, int]:
    await asyncio.sleep(time)
    return (1, 2, 3)


async def my_function() -&gt; str:
    vals = [str(val) for val in await example(1)]
    return &quot;,&quot;.join(vals)
</code></pre>
<p>is working alright with v0.4.1. But when running v0.4.2, it raises:</p>
<pre><code>RUF029 Function `my_function` is declared `async`, but doesn't `await` or use `async` features.
</code></pre>
<p>Now the strange part is that I looked around and found #11070 which supposedly fixes this exact problem mentioned in #11043. I've tried to downgrade and upgrade several times, I'm getting the same problem consistently on 0.4.2 but not on 0.4.1.</p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding #11043 and this isn't the same problem? Or did the fix not cover everything?</p>
<p>I'm not proficient with Rust, but happy to help if I can!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
