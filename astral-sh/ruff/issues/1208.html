            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not really an issue <em>per se</em> since the default of 88 is documented in README, but a discussion point.</p>
<p>Shouldn't <code>ruff</code> default to the same maximum line length of 79 as <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length">specified in PEP8</a>?
Apart from just the sake of following PEP8, this makes <code>ruff</code> incompatible with <code>flake8</code> if using both with default settings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do appreciate the suggestion but I opted for 88 for consistency with Black. I don't think there's really a right answer here (though I could document it).</p>
