Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I am using <code>ruff.toml</code> for my configuration and my Python package is configured with <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>
<p>In my ruff configuration, I omitted <code>target_version</code>.</p>
<p>I am using <code>ruff v0.0.270</code>.</p>
<p>When I launch <code>ruff check -v .</code> from the root of my repository I get,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[2023-06-06][13:32:44][ruff::settings::pyproject][DEBUG] <code>project.requires_python</code> in <code>pyproject.toml</code> will not be used to set <code>target_version</code> when using <code>ruff.toml</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the expected behavior (infer from <code>pyproject.toml</code>) is not supported from <code>ruff.toml</code>, I think that the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#target-version">documentation</a> should be clearer.</p>
<p>If instead this is supposed to work maybe it's a bug or I missed something...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is the expected behavior although I'm not sure the reasoning behind this. @charliermarsh could provide more info about this. But I do agree that this should be added in the documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is the expected behavior -- I'll update the documentation. We don't want to reconcile settings inferred from multiple files, it adds a lot of complexity to the code and ultimately to the user-facing behavior. I think it's the right tradeoff, but it should be better documented here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why do you say &quot;inferred from multiple files&quot;? You would infer anyway from <code>pyproject.toml</code>, no?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By &quot;inferred from multiple files&quot;, I mean that we would need to identify both the <code>ruff.toml</code> and the <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and extract + reconcile information from both of them, rather than using a single configuration file as the source of truth.</p>
