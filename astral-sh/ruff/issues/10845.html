<p>I&#x27;m replacing black formatter with ruff formatter and when reformatting the codebase with <code>ruff format</code> command, I keep seeing this warning:</p>
<pre><code>warning: `ruff format` is a work-in-progress, subject to change at any time, and intended only for experimentation.
</code></pre>
<p>Could you please confirm if the formatter is stable and not likely to be removed in the future? If so, please consider this warning log since it&#x27;s very confusing and makes users reluctant to use.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please try a more recent version of ruff (latest currently is 0.3.5)
I don&#x27;t think the formatter will be removed, but (just like for black) some choices in how code is formatted may change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, as @153957 says, 0.0.291 is quite an old version of Ruff :-) If you use <code>ruff&gt;=0.2</code>, the message should go away.</p>
<p>With regards to your broader question on the stability of the formatter: we describe the stability of the formatter in our versioning policy, which you can find here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/. In a nutshell: we promise to do our utmost to ensure that Ruff&#x27;s &quot;stable&quot; formatting style will never change in a patch release -- this means that as long as your code contains valid syntax, bumping Ruff&#x27;s version from e.g. 0.3.5 to 0.3.6 shouldn&#x27;t result in the formatter reformatting your code. (If you bump Ruff from 0.3.6 to 0.4.0, however, it <em>might</em> reformat your code.)</p>
