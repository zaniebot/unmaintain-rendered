# Feature request - lint for detecting print statements

_@brass75_

The projects I tend to write (as many) do not use `print` in production code however we do sometimes use them in debugging. It would be great if there was a lint we could turn on to detect forgotten `print` statements.

Is [print-found](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/print/) what you're looking for?
