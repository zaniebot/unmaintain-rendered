            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am using ruff 0.3.3 and Flake8 7.0.0 on a project and get different results from both tools. Nothing spectacular, but it raises uncertainty if ruff is really a drop-in replacement as it states or not.</p>
<p>Running it on my django-tailwind-cli project I get an error message from flake8 and I don't get it from ruff. flake8 is correct. I have code in my project that violates A003 from flake8-builtins.</p>

<p>Any idea? What other differences exist? I checked the FAQ and only found references to flake8-bugbear there. And the rules for ruff state that it is checking A003.</p>
