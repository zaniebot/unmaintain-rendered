            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider the snippet</p>
<pre><code>elif type(event) == RiskEvent:  # since some common helper methods call this function
  return False
</code></pre>
<p>This is an instance of E721 as it rightly should be, and <code>ruff check</code> will correctly detect that. The long comment is within the line length limit and so the condition won't be parenthesized and flowed either. However if you <code>ruff check --add-noqa</code>, you get the expanded comment <code># ... # noqa: E721</code> which does overflow the line length, causing the expression to be parenthesized and reflowed into</p>
<pre><code>elif (
  type(event) == RiskEvent
):  # since some common helper methods call this function  # noqa: E721
  return False
</code></pre>
<p>Which is still an instance of E721 because the <code>noqa:</code> has been flowed off the problem line.</p>
