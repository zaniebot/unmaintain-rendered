            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It appears that ruff isn't handling pytest fixtures correctly.</p>
<p>Consider the following files (adapted from a pytest example):</p>
<p>fruit.py</p>
<pre><code>import pytest


class Fruit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.name == other.name


@pytest.fixture
def my_fruit():
    return Fruit(&quot;apple&quot;)


@pytest.fixture
def fruit_basket(my_fruit):
    return [Fruit(&quot;banana&quot;), my_fruit]
</code></pre>
<p>and test_fruit.py:</p>
<pre><code>from fruit import (
    my_fruit,
    fruit_basket
)

def test_my_fruit_in_basket(my_fruit, fruit_basket):
    assert my_fruit in fruit_basket
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>ruff --isolated test_fruit.py</code> I get:</p>
<pre><code>test_fruit.py:2:5: F401 [*] `fruit.my_fruit` imported but unused
test_fruit.py:3:5: F401 [*] `fruit.fruit_basket` imported but unused
test_fruit.py:6:29: F811 Redefinition of unused `my_fruit` from line 2
test_fruit.py:6:39: F811 Redefinition of unused `fruit_basket` from line 3
Found 4 errors.
[*] 2 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using <code>ruff 0.0.262</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>#3295 pointed me to <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/how-to/fixtures.html#using-fixtures-from-other-projects">this</a>. Pytest suggests avoiding importing fixtures in favor of adding them to <code>conftest.py</code>. In that case, I'm personally a bit torn on implementing this - on one hand, it's definitely confusing behavior since the import is in fact used, but on the other it's not recommended to do so.</p>
<p>I'm almost leaning towards fixing the unused import bug, but maybe implementing a separate rule centered on avoiding fixture imports? FWIW, it seems like <a href="https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3493">Pylint</a> has the same issue as the one mentioned here. The suggested solution is to simply rename the fixture file (<code>fruit.py</code>, in this case) to <code>conftest.py</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, reading through the discussion, I think I agree with the conclusion that was reached in #3295: since Pytest itself recommends against this pattern, I'd rather not special-case in Ruff. (I'm not even sure how we could special-case it without introducing lots of false negatives. Best-case is that we could avoid <em>autofixing</em> these cases but still flag them.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Today, <code>F401</code> autofixes wiped away my fixture imports a few times.  I can think of several workarounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>conftest.py</code> (which I am avoiding for reasons beyond this issue's scope)</li>
<li>Manually insert <code># noqa: F401</code> before invoking <code>ruff</code></li>
<li>Place <code>F401</code> in <code>unfixable</code> aspect of config</li>
</ol>
<p>I went with option 3, marking <code>F401</code> as <code>unfixable</code>.</p>
