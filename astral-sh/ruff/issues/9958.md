# Formatter trims empty lines after `;` 

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-02-12 18:06_

```Python
b = """
    This looks like a docstring but is not in a notebook because notebooks can't be imported as a module.
    Ruff should leave it as is
""";


a = "another normal string"
```

The formatter should preserve the empty lines between `b` and `a` but it does not today.

Giving a quick 10 second look, the issue is probably on this line:

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/fe79798c12b4771cee0b0c59964ad7bd751c3779/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/suite.rs#L419-L420

As `lines_after` doesn't take into account the `;` token which results in the value being 0 and then the hard line break is added instead.

Maybe we should use `lines_after_ignoring_end_of_line_trivia` but that doesn't ignore `;` either.
