            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The benchmarks that run on each pull request are useful, but they're somewhat noisy and require a release build, which means we spend a lot of GitHub Action worker-time running the benchmarks, even for PRs that very-confidently won't affect performance.</p>
<p>Instead, we'd like to move towards running the benchmarks on selective PRs by adding a comment. Rome has a workflow for this, which we likely learn from: https://github.com/rome/tools/blob/main/.github/workflows/bench_analyzer.yml.</p>
