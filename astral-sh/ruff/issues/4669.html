Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>if I accedently have flake8 enabled, sometimes it's enable dby the IDE itself globally, or a collegue opens the code base from his IDE, as ruff noqa has its own error code (for e.g. <code>AGR001</code> here) that flake8 is not aware. We can see some unexpected IDE warning:</p>

<p>Is it possible to create new ruff specific <code>noqa</code> keyword ? maybe <code>noruff</code> ?</p>
