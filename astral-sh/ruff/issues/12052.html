<pre><code>@pytest.fixture
def tool_manager():
    return ToolManager()
    
def test_create_tool(tool_manager):
    do_something()  
</code></pre>
<p>I believe in cases like this ANN001 should not be fired because we still don't have a fixture type annotation. what then should be the best way to deal with this, please?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Considering this example, I think the type of <code>tool_manager</code> would just be whatever the <code>tool_manager</code> fixture is returning which is <code>ToolManager</code>. So, in general you can provide the return type of the fixture as the argument type.</p>
