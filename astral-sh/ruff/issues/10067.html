            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi all! As always, thanks for <code>ruff</code>.</p>
<p>This is a potential feature request, but a pretty minor one. Please close if you don't think it's worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Observed behavior</h2>
<p>I have a ruleset enabled that includes <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/print/">T201</a>, which in turn forbids use of <code>print(...)</code>. This is generally a reasonable rule.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to <em>intentionally</em> use <code>print(...)</code> in some contexts where doing so is idiomatic, e.g. the <code>__main__</code> scope when a module is invoked as a script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;warning expected here&quot;)

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    print(&quot;no warning expected here&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>As is, both of these <code>print(...)</code>s trigger T201.</p>
<h2>Expected behavior</h2>
<p>The current default is reasonable.</p>
<p>However, it would be nice to have some kind of flag or option to allow T201 in the <code>__main__</code> pseudo-scope. With that option, only the first <code>print(...)</code> would trigger, while the second would be allowed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That sounds reasonable. Would you expect that all <code>print</code> calls inside of a <code>__main__</code> block are allowed, even if they are eg. nested inside of a function or class?</p>

		print(&quot;Why?&quot;) 
		
	why_not()

<p>Yep, that's my thinking -- I think any <code>print()</code> that is in a lexical scope of <code>__main__</code> should be allowed.</p>
