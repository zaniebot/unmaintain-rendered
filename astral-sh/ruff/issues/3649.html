            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently I'm having an issue in my project where I have a <code>./typing</code> folder that contains only stubs (<code>.pyi</code> files) alongside my project folders, in a structure similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>src/
├── ...
├── ...
└── ...
typing/
└── module/
    └── file.pyi
pyproject.toml
</code></pre>
<p>I'm facing an issue specifically with a clash of <em>ruff's isort</em> options and <em>black</em>; By setting <code>lines-after-imports = 2</code> under <em>ruff</em>, <em>black</em> and <em>ruff</em> will clash on the <code>.pyi</code> files, where <em>ruff</em> will apply 2 lines between the imports and stubs, and <em>black</em> will apply 1 line, conforming to the relevant PEP. This does not happen to the normal python files under <code>src</code>, where both tools leave 2 blank lines between the imports and code.</p>
<p>Is there a way to configure <em>ruff</em> to also leave only one line in the <code>.pyi</code> files? If not, I think it would be useful to be able to configure for these files specifically, the same way you can set configurations specifically for <code>__init__.py</code> files.</p>
<p>Relevant configurations I use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff]
src = [&quot;src&quot;, &quot;typing&quot;]
fix = true
select = [&quot;F&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot;]

[tool.ruff.isort]
lines-after-imports = 2
no-lines-before = [
    &quot;future&quot;,
    &quot;standard-library&quot;,
    &quot;third-party&quot;,
    &quot;first-party&quot;,
    &quot;local-folder&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, my fix is to have a second <code>pyproject.toml</code> file under <code>./typing</code> with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
extend = &quot;../pyproject.toml&quot;

[tool.ruff.isort]
# Stub files have a different default lines between imports
lines-after-imports = -1
no-lines-before = [
    &quot;future&quot;,
    &quot;standard-library&quot;,
    &quot;third-party&quot;,
    &quot;first-party&quot;,
    &quot;local-folder&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Extra information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruff version: <code>0.0.257</code></li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this is possible right now.</p>
<p>If you use <code>lines-after-imports = -1</code> in both places, we do treat <code>.pyi</code> files differently for defaults, and I believe we're consistent with Black too (in <code>.py</code> files, we add two lines-after-import if the trailing content is a function or class, etc). But there's no way to provide different settings for different file types.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gotcha. I was having git differences when applying ruff to a project that was already running black; Turns out black was allowing (not enforcing) 2 blank lines after imports for ALL files, while ruff enforces only one blank line if there's not top level function / class definition.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I've become intimately familiar with Black's rules :joy: At the top-level, they <em>allow</em> up to two blank lines, but they only <em>enforce</em> two blank lines in certain contexts.</p>
