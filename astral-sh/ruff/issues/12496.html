            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, rules are listed under https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules. When a rule is selected, for instance, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unpacked-list-comprehension/">unpacked-list-comprehension</a>, there is no way to return to the overview.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is recommended to consider adding a discussion button, similar to the edit buttons, on the following URLs:</p>
<ol>
<li>https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/adding-a-git-repository/?h=repo#code-actions</li>
<li>https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/buttons/?h=button</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 2 enables the direct opening of a new discussion thread about the rule. This highlights the importance of discussion in reviewing the implemented rules, as demonstrated in #12345.</p>

<p>Make sense ... had only the feeling people tend to open faster an Issue then going to the discussion panel.</p>

<p>So, rules and format are excluded from the navigation bar so as not to mess up the sidebar, but does this actually mean that a customized JS has to be used?</p>

<p>Sorry for the question, @charliermarsh and @zanieb, but do you know where the actual docs are in the org, I could not find the markdown files for the rules.</p>
