# Check if number of variables in unpacking assignment matches slice notation

_Issue opened by @not-my-profile on 2023-01-05 10:41_

```python
foo, bar = values[:1] # not enough values to unpack
foo, bar = values[:3] # maybe too many values to unpack
```

I think this check would be a nice addition because static type checkers only perform this check if values has the type `tuple` but they don't perform it when values has e.g. type `list` (since lists of different lengths have the same type).

Sidenote: This check would only work for conventional containers because custom `__getitem__` implementations could return an arbitrary number of values independent of the passed slice object.
