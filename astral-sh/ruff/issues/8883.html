Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Can an autofix be created for the preview rule <code>PLW1514</code> ? Even if it's &quot;unsafe&quot;. Updating hundreds of instances manually is quite tedious.</p>
<p>In Python 3.10+ this would autofix to <code>encoding=&quot;locale&quot;</code>, in Python &lt;=3.9 this would autofix to <code>encoding=locale.getpreferredencoding(False)</code> (see: https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/). Search &amp; replacing those if I want a specific encoding is easier. An option to specify prefered encoding can also be set (which could even be re-used by a new rule that ensures consistent encoding is used with desired value, like <code>&quot;utf-8&quot;</code>)</p>
