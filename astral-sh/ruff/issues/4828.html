Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Okay, I'll be the first to say it, but this bug is really not that important. I'm reporting it primarily because it implies that there may be other issues with semicolon/newline processing in other situations I haven't observed yet.</p>
<p>The following snippet is a valid Python script (no trailing newline):</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">0\
;
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff attempts to correct it to the following (with trailing newline, but it's escaped):</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">0\
</code></pre>
<p>As a result, there is an EOF syntax error. This only applies to a situation where a) there is a semicolon at the <em>end</em> of the input (no trailing newline), and b) the line before is escaped.</p>
<p>Discovered with #4822.</p>
