            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>While updating our black compatibility tests for https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/20768, I ran into a failure related to this test case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">f&quot;{f'''{'nested'} inner'''} outer&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is valid on Python versions before 3.12 (when quote reuse became allowed in f-strings), but the formatted result converts the innermost quotes to double quotes, making it invalid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">f&quot;{f'''{&quot;nested&quot;} inner'''} outer&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I was hoping to put up a quick PR fixing this, but I'm still working on it and figured I might as well open an issue. I bisected the issue to #13906, but that's not too helpful because this PR is when we first introduced f-string formatting, as Micha pointed out on Discord.</p>
<p>Something interesting I've found besides the bug itself is that our main <code>format</code> test doesn't really catch this. <code>fstring.py</code> actually has more unsupported syntax errors before formatting than after, which I think prevents our error fingerprinting from working as intended. Our test runner produces a snapshot with the invalid quotes above, without panicking from the new unsupported syntax error, like the black test did.</p>
<p>I've played a bit with more information we could add to the fingerprint, but unfortunately I haven't found a good solution there yet either.</p>
