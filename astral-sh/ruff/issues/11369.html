<p>Context: Discussion https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/11367</p>
<p>The idea is that each rule should have a history or log of when it was added as preview, when it became stable and when it had changes in behavior. Also the version if it became deprecated or removed.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Rule FOO123
v0.1.2 - Added as experimental
v0.2.7 - Behavior changed for classes with letter J
v0.3.0 - Rule became stable
v0.3.2 - Rule deprecated in favor of BAR999
v0.4.0 - Rule removed</p>
<p>This page https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/ could show which minor version the rule became stable if it is stable or the patch version if it is still experimental:</p>
<p>| Code  | Name  | Message  | Availability |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FOO201 | class-comparison-one | Checks when class is compared to function |  0.2 | ✔️ 🛠️ |
| FOO202 | class-comparison-two | Checks when class is compared to method |  0.3.4  | 🧪 🛠️ |</p>
<p>In our application we have preview = true because we are moving quite fast with ruff iterations and even experimental ruff rules are usually much better than relying on other linters. Having this would help a lot on us prioritizing rules that been experimental for longer or that have been added on versions that our devs have installed already.</p>
