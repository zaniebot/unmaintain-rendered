            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at the current output in v0.0.240, e.g. for <code>PLR0913</code>:</p>
<pre><code>❯ ruff rule PLR0913
too-many-args

Code: PLR0913 (Pylint)

Message formats:

* Too many arguments to function call ({c_args}/{max_args})
</code></pre>
<p>I have the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no description of <code>{c_args}</code> or <code>{max_args}</code>. What is from configuration, what is from the execution?<ul>
<li>What is &quot;c_args&quot;? Map placeholders to more friendly names for display?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We could explain that this rule is affected by <code>max-args</code> in <code>[tool.ruff.pylint]</code></li>
<li>We could show the value, including whether it is the default or which configuration file it came from</li>
<li>We could show whether the rule is enabled/selected or disabled/ignored<ul>
<li>Show which configuration file decided this</li>
<li>State whether the rule conflicts with another rule or configuration option and show which got disabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think we should document the placeholders used in the format strings. If they are unclear they should be renamed e.g. <code>c_args</code> isn't really a good variable name (what does the &quot;c&quot; stand for?).</p>
<p>We are planning on adding written descriptions of the rules which would make the format strings much less important.</p>
<p>I agree about all your other points though :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going to close this just because we've started to include the configuration settings in the Markdown docs as a convention, so it's part of #2646.</p>
