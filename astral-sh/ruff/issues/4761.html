            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Running, e.g., <code>cargo run -p ruff_cli -- check ../scipy --select E201,E202,E203 --fix</code> doesn't actually cause those rules to be marked as fixable. In <code>src/settings/mod.rs</code>, we initialize the set of fixable rules with <code>let mut fixable_set: RuleSet = RuleSelector::All.into_iter().collect();</code>. However, nursery rules are omitted from <code>RuleSelector::All</code>, to avoid adding them when users do <code>--select ALL</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh feel free to assign this to me, I can take a look. Seems like we'll have to union the <code>fixable_set</code> with the command line rules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I'm actually curious how we want to do this. I was originally thinking the easiest way would be to find all autofixable rules in the <code>--select</code> block, then change them into <code>RuleSelectors</code> and add them to <code>Configuration::fixable</code>. I don't think that would respect the specificity differences between <code>--select</code> and <code>--extend-select</code>. I guess we can just merge them and let <code>Configuration</code> handle it later, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure. I was wondering if we could change the <code>let mut fixable_set: RuleSet = RuleSelector::All.into_iter().collect();</code> initialization line in some way, such that it includes <em>all</em> rules rather than using the <code>ALL</code> selector.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah interesting, okay let me take a look at that. That seems like it'd be easier than what I was thinking anyway (parsing <code>RuleSelectors</code> from the CLI into <code>Rules</code>, checking if they're autofixable, then translating back into <code>RuleSelectors</code>).</p>
<p>I wonder if it's worth having <code>RuleSelector::All</code> be <em>all</em> rules, and <code>RuleSelector::Stable</code> (or some other name) represent all non-nursery rules. We already expose the &quot;nursery&quot; idea to users, so I think it's safe to bring into a <code>RuleSelector</code> (<a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/indentation-with-invalid-multiple-comment/">ref</a>). That'd be a pretty breaking change though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What if we did the opposite: added a RuleSelector::NURSERY? And then initialized the fixable set to ALL and NURSERY.</p>
