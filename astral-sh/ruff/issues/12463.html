            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @MichaReiser. I'd also note that erring on the side of false positives is probably the correct tradeoff when it comes to a security-related rule. I think you'd much rather have something be incorrectly flagged as a security issue than have some dangerous code accidentally slip through the net.</p>
<p>If you don't use django at all in your project, and the rule is causing false positives for you, I'd consider just switching the rule off for now in your Ruff configuration file.</p>
