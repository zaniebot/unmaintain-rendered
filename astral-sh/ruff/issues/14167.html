Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>it should error on 9, 12 and 13.</p>
<p>Generator expressions only immediately evaluate the target, so the other fields do not need to be validated. And you appear to have missed <code>async for</code> completely for this check, but make sure to not enable that for generator expressions.
If you don't want to take my word for it or go dig through PEPs you can verify this by simply trying to let python parse the file, it will give a SyntaxError for 9/12/13 (though it abandons parsing the file on first error so you'll need to progressively comment out stuff to check)</p>

<p>no problem! Throwing in <code>async for</code> in genexp in sync func as well :)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import asyncio

<p>note that mypy will complain with <code>await-not-async</code> on this https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18124, but pyright handles it (though current version also misses errors https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/9414)</p>
