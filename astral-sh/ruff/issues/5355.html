            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a script that formats cpython twice and checks that the formatting stays the same, that we only output valid syntax and that we don't panic due to some input. I want to integrate this script into CI to avoid regressions. This also needs documentation on how to run the check locally.</p>

<p>Is this already solved or is there more that could be helpful to document?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The general way is documented at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_formatter/README.md#checking-entire-projects. I'm currently working a small but diverse set of projects that we continuously check and will add more instructions once that's done.</p>
<p>I also ran the stability checks with the 3k repo from <a href="https://github.com/akx/ruff-usage-aggregate/blob/master/data/known-github-tomls-clean.jsonl">ruff-usage-aggregate</a> and have to go through all of them and either fix them directly or open issues for each distinct one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i've posted the initial script in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5828, this ticket is effectively about automating most of the scores from that ticket.</p>
