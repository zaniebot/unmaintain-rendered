            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Recently on updating Ruff, I started getting <code>PGH004</code> errors for a paragraph comment describing <code>#noqa</code> handling [^1]. I&#x27;ve attached a minimal reproducer below; the errors started appearing in Ruff 0.0.281 and a warning which previously appeared is now absent in Ruff 0.0.284.</p>
<p>My suggested remedy would be to only match a <code>noqa</code> comment if there are only whitespace tokens between the comment marker and the <code>noqa</code> token.</p>
<p>A</p>
<pre><code># A sentence talking about using #noqa in prose.
# A new sentence talking about using #noqa.
# A third sentence talking about using #noqa

$ ruff check pgh004.py --isolated --select PGH004

$ ruff check pgh004.py --isolated --select PGH004
warning: Invalid `# noqa` directive on pgh004.py:2: expected `:` followed by a comma-separated list of codes (e.g., `# noqa: F401, F841`).

</code></pre>
<p>[^1]: The specific pararaph is:</p>
<pre><code>        # There is no point in having #noqa on literal blocks because
        # they cannot contain references.  Recognizing it would just
        # completely prevent escaping the #noqa.  Outside of literal
        # blocks, one can always write \#noqa.</code></pre>

<p>Do you mind expanding on this suggestion? What would you consider examples where we should and shouldn&#x27;t match on the token?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suppose I was envisioning something similar to <code>r&#x27;(?i)# *noqa:(.*)&#x27;</code>, but clearly this would look different in terms of tokens.</p>
<p>A common occurance is to have both a mypy ignore and a noqa comment on the same line, but I have always seen each prefixed with a <code>&#x27;#&#x27;</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think my suggestion would be to just remove the <code>#</code> prefix from the prose. Does it add much? Making the parser more lax can actually lead to a more confusing experience -- e.g., the user writes <code>#noqa</code>, and it doesn&#x27;t work, and they&#x27;re not sure why. (Even if the argument is that they should be inserting a space between in such cases, we may <em>still</em> want to warn them as such.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff currently recognises <code>#noqa</code> (sans space) as a noqa comment, as the text above is erroring -- if adding a space were mandatory that&#x27;d be fine for me!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it add much?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, yes, as it is an extremely succinct way to denote explicitly that the relevant code is parsing text exactly of that form.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be if the comment is after a logical newline with no other token, don&#x27;t parse it as a noqa comment -- e.g. here the text was in a paragraph, not in-line after an expression/statement/etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, that <em>was</em> an intentional change, as I don&#x27;t think it <em>should</em> require a space. <code># type: ignore</code> doesn&#x27;t require a space, neither does <code># nosec</code>, and I think requiring a space can make for a confusing user experience. Adding that requirement would fix the issue in this <em>specific</em> case in a way that I&#x27;d consider coincidental, because it wouldn&#x27;t really fix the more general problem of wanting to use <code># noqa</code> as a literal in docstring prose.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it&#x27;s a reasonably common convention to surround code examples with backticks, as in-</p>
<pre><code># A sentence talking about using `#noqa` in prose.
# A new sentence talking about using `#noqa`.
# A third sentence talking about using `#noqa`
</code></pre>
<p>treating backticks as escape characters is likely to be a fairly significant change in behaviour though, if it&#x27;s applied across the board</p>
