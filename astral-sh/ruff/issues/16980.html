            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>SIM102 (collapsible-if) has an exception for version and os checks. This currently matches <code>sys.platform</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if sys.platform == &quot;linux&quot;:  # no SIM102
    if foo:
</code></pre>
<p>Analogously, it should also be disabled <code>os.name</code> and <code>platform.system()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if os.name == &quot;posix&quot;: # SIM102
    if foo:
</code></pre>
<p>See https://stackoverflow.com/a/58071295 to learn about the various methods. (And if you&#x27;ve looked at this post, you&#x27;re also in a good position to have an opinion on the otherwise unrelated <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5622">astral-sh/ruff#5622</a>.)</p>

<p>Okay, TIL, and now that you ask, I&#x27;m not so sure anymore.</p>
<p>Until now, my point was merely readability: I think branching on a Python version or on an OS is a different thing than branching on business logic, so believe it&#x27;s good to have it in a separate if: Then your brain can easily focus on the part that concerns a particular OS, and skip the other parts. But this is my personal view, and I&#x27;m not sure how objective it is. My thinking was simply that if it has been decided that checks for <code>sys.platform</code> and <code>sys.version_info</code> should be treated differently for readability, then the same should apply to <code>os.name</code> and <code>platform.system()</code>.</p>
<p>But I was not aware that type checkers may be a reason. This goes back to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#version-and-platform-checking">PEP 484</a>, which says &quot;Type checkers are expected to understand simple version and platform checks, e.g.: (...) <code>if sys.version_info[0] &gt;= 3:</code> (...) <code>if sys.platform == &#x27;win32&#x27;:</code>&quot;. The <a href="https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/directives.html#version-and-platform-checking">current docs</a> are similar, but use <code>sys.version_info &gt;= (3,12)</code> as an example.</p>
<p>After some research, I found <a href="https://github.com/python/typing/issues/1732">this issue about the set of conditions being underspecified</a>... It&#x27;s a good summary of what is supported by different typecheckers. For example, pyright supports <code>os.name</code> but mypy doesn&#x27;t. None of them support platform.system()`.</p>
<p>My feeling is that a linter should be conservative here. If someone uses <code>os.name</code> to make pyright happy, this seems fine. But given that this is still very much under debate, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the right time to change SIM102...</p>
<p>In either case, I think the comments here should be updated:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/c6efa93cf7a630332901367a1badbdbadc46280e/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_simplify/rules/collapsible_if.rs#L100-L108
If I&#x27;m not mistaken, this file is only about SIM102, so this is not about ternaries. Moreover, <code>is_sys_version_block</code> also checks for <code>sys.platform</code>, so the name is misleading.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am not sure about the case given by OP, however there is at least one specific case where it might be okay to disable SIM102:</p>
<pre><code>if __debug__:  # noqa: SIM102
    if foo:
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>Although this may be considered bad practice which is another topic, the rationale behind this is to allow the interpreter to fully strip the code block when running with <code>python -O</code>.</p>
<p>This is at least what CPython does from what I can recall, as long as <code>__debug__</code> is the only test in the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
