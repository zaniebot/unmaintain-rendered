# Version 0.6.1: I001 warning on CI, while it works locally on macOS

_Issue opened by @amotl on 2024-08-19 22:01_

Hi there,

a Dependabot update to version 0.6.1 trips on CI

- https://github.com/daq-tools/commons-codec/pull/22
- https://github.com/daq-tools/commons-codec/actions/runs/10461452590/job/28969807264?pr=22

... with errors like those.
```
I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
```

However, when trying to ramp up for debugging this issue, now also using Ruff 0.6.1 locally on macOS after upgrading to it, the command `ruff check .` still succeeds. We tried to make sure we do not look at stale or otherwise bogus outcomes, by also deleting `.ruff_cache/` locally. Nothing changed: It works on my machine, but it trips on CI/GHA.

Can someone spot any flaws, or has an idea where this might be coming from?

With kind regards,
Andreas.

Everything is right. After adding https://github.com/daq-tools/commons-codec/commit/ea72c9d6e2950, CI succeeds again. This was a non-issue, apparently I made a mistake evaluating the situation. Sorry for the noise.
