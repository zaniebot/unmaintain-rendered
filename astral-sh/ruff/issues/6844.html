            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An idea for a new rule: checking that methods in subclasses that override methods from the parent are decorated with <code>@override</code>.
This decorator is defined in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0698/">PEP 698</a> and is meant to help both linters and developpers to recognize methods that are overriding methods from a parent class.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
class A:
    def foo(self) -&gt; None:
        print(&quot;foo from class A!&quot;)

class B(A):
    def foo(self) -&gt; None:
        print(&quot;foo from class B!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>A rule would detect that the <code>@override</code> decorator is missing on <code>B.foo()</code> since it overrides <code>A.foo()</code>.</p>
<p>Note that until python 3.12, <code>override</code> is only available from <code>typing-extensions</code>.</p>

<p>This sounds good to me as a great Python 3.12 milestone although I do not think it should be enabled by default.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The challenge here is that we won’t be able to enforce this except for cases in which the parent class and subclass are defined in the same file (until we have multi-file analysis).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is also the inverse problem of having <code>@override</code> on a class without bases, or <code>@overload</code> on a function without the function without <code>@overload</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>up! 🫡  Is there is any work on this since then? We're also debating on how to properly define subclassed methods and having a rule about enforcing the usage of <code>@override</code> would be very appreciated!</p>
