            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Keywords to find existing issue: F401 and ipytest. The following is very similar, but still different, it seems: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10454</p>
<p>A minimal working example would be a Jupyter notebook with the following two cells:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import ipytest
import pytest

ipytest.autoconfig()
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">%%ipytest

def test_simple():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        print(1 + &quot;a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff will report <code>F401 (unused-import)</code> for the line <code>import pytest</code>.</p>
<p>To reproduce the issue, create a notebook with the above cells, called <code>bug.ipynb</code> and run the command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ruff check demos/bug.ipynb --fix
</code></pre>
<p>I've tested with with ruff 0.6.3 and 0.6.9. I have the following in my pyproject.toml, but I don't think these settings matter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
target-version = &quot;py311&quot;

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;UP&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;PGH&quot;, &quot;PL&quot;, &quot;RUF&quot;]
ignore = [&quot;E741&quot;, &quot;PLR2004&quot;, &quot;PLR0913&quot;, &quot;PLR0912&quot;, &quot;PLW2901&quot;, &quot;PLR0915&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>As a workaround, one can (obviously) add a comment <code># noqa: F401</code> to the import line</p>
<p>When removing the line <code>%%ipytest</code>, the problem goes away, but it that doesn't help because the line is doing something useful.</p>
<p>Given the easy workaround, this is probably not urgent.</p>
<p>By the way, thanks for creating Ruff!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, the double percent like <code>%%magic</code> are cell magics which apply to the entire cell and so we ignore those cells except for a few: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/fd5fcc498b82c13b81dfb1f073bd18167c561e7b/crates/ruff_notebook/src/cell.rs#L217-L244</p>
<p>While, the single percent like <code>%magic</code> are line magics that considers only the line on which it is defined.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh that's good to know. Thanks. So the solution here would be to move the <code>%%ipytest</code> command to its own cell?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it is in its own cell. It's just that the entire cell is currently ignored by Ruff because <code>ipytest</code> is being special cased. I think we <em>could</em> do it because the lines following the <code>ipytest</code> magic should contain valid Python code. @tovrstra I'm not familiar with the magic command so just want to confirm if that's valid. I can check as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I mean is that a possible workaround is to change the notebook to have three cells:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import ipytest
import pytest

ipytest.autoconfig()

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think then the magic command won't work because it won't be applied to the cell it was previously targeting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just tested it, it's safe to include <code>ipytest</code> in the allowed cell magic in the following code. And, the implementation of <code>%%ipytest</code> also confirms that it runs the cell first and then runs pytest on top of it. So, the cell can be considered as being without the magic itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you all for the comments and the fix. My apologies for commenting late. Indeed, the <code>%%ipytest</code> should be on the first line of the cell containing unit tests. It means &quot;this cell contains unit tests&quot;. If it is put in a separate cell or further down, the tests will not get executed when running the cell.</p>
