            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like https://github.com/gluon-lang/lsp-types has released version 0.96.0 with notebook support, would it be possible to use it instead of using a custom fork?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that should be possible although @snowsignal might know more if there's any other difference apart from the Notebook support but she's on PTO for the week. Feel free to open a PR if you're interested :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think that should be possible. All we needed was that the notebook PR gets merged and released and that's now the case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>cc @karthiknadig who announced <code>lsprotocol</code> crate <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp/issues/300#issuecomment-1813500582">at here</a> and was looking for feedback. I recommend you try <code>ruff_server</code> migrated to <code>lsprotocol</code>. I tried but there were few blockers that stopped me on continue it. you can catch these blockers as feedback to improve <code>lsprotocol</code> crate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The issue blocking an upgrade to 0.96.0, as @T-256 pointed out, is https://github.com/gluon-lang/lsp-types/issues/284. We use the old <code>Url</code> type frequently in the codebase and the new <code>Uri</code> type lacks several key functions that we need, especially related to file path conversion.</p>
<p>I would be interested in exploring a move to <code>lsprotocol</code>, though as @T-256 said there could be blockers there too.</p>

<p>Can you enumerate the blockers here? We'd appreciate that. It could also be useful to provide the diff here and anyone from the team can enumerate the said blockers.</p>
