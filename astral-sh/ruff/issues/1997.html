            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Like categorization (#1774) this is another very useful concept we can steal from Rust, see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/enum.Applicability.html">rustc_errors::Applicability</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally users would be able to choose how much they want to risk when applying lints.</p>
<p>I think for rule applicability is even more relevant for Python than for Rust since pretty much all of the behavior of Python types can be overriden by implementing custom <code>__dunder__</code> methods.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What do you mean with &quot;flagging violations in the first place&quot;?</p>
<p>I think there are different factors we could possibly differentiate:</p>
<ol>
<li>How accurate is the violation detection? e.g. can false positives / false negatives occur? how likely is that?</li>
<li>How safe is the suggested autofix? Can it be wrong? Can it break the program? Could it have side-effects?</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right -- those are the two factors that I was trying to tease apart, though I think I was just tired and missed that the issue <em>title</em> is about autofixing, so any analogous concept for &quot;How accurate is the violation detection?&quot; would probably go by a different name.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it makes sense to raise this question here. I think rules that will have many false positives should just be disabled by default and categorized (#1774) accordingly.</p>
