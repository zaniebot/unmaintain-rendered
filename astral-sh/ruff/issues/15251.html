            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5454 added all PEP-585 names to UP006 but this caused multiple issues which is why I decided to revert it in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15250</p>
<p>We should revisit if we want this change and how we resolve possible conflicts, as summarized by a contributor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have raised a few issues with this change:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15246</p>
<p>Even if the detection+fix ability is better now that these are implemented in <code>UP006</code>, something needs to be done about the fact that the newly added warnings are all duplicates of warnings and fixes that already exist in <code>UP035</code>.</p>
<p>If this implementation becomes a little more polished, it probably should completely replace the implementation that's currently in <code>UP035</code>, there's really no reason to still keep that inferior implementation other than its battle-tested status. Although maybe for historic consistency, even if the <em>implementation</em> is unified towards <code>UP006</code>, the set of items that it triggers for should remain split between <code>UP006</code> (covering only builtins such as <code>list</code>) and <code>UP035</code> (covering others) like it's always been.</p>
</li>
<li><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15245</p>
<p>The fixer has bugs where it sometimes fails to kick in, and in corner cases kicks in with strange results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I'd like to see this pull request reverted and relanded later after a more detailed discussion, because it has ongoing bugs and possibly introduces undesirable/unexpected changes to what the rules are supposed to cover.</p>
