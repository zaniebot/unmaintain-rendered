<p>Although it's easy to understand this rule, the example makes no sense.</p>

<p>In the documentation, the code blocks before and after &quot;Use instead:&quot; are the same. Both of them use the spaces but not tabs.</p>
<p>The source code of the HTML page also indicates two code blocks are the same thing.</p>
