<p>If you have time could you provide a minimal example (as text rather than a screenshot) that reproduces the problem? It'd be helpful to narrow down what exactly causes the problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you have the isort extension enabled? To me, this looks a lot like https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode/issues/128 which unfortunately is actually an unfixed VS Code bug (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/174295) that results from having two extensions that both attempt to modify imports. Can you try disabling the isort extension?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I had wondered if <code>isort</code> was implicated in this but, forgot that there was a dedicated extension for it. Just turned it off. The issue is weirdly intermittent so I won't know if it fixes the problem for a bit. I think we can close for now and I can just reopen with better examples for @zanieb if it recurs.</p>
