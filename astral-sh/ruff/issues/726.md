# F401: Ignoring errors fails with capitalisation

---

_Issue opened by @AA-Turner on 2022-11-13 20:01_

Ignoring errors on a line-by-line basis should work with any capitalisation of `#noqa`, in my projects I tend to use `#NoQA`.

This failure was introduced in Ruff 111, see below:

```doscon
I:\Development>type bug.py
import this  # NoQA: F401
import antigravity  # noqa: F401

I:\Development>ruff -V     
ruff 0.0.110

I:\Development>ruff bug.py

A new version of ruff is available: v0.0.110 -> v0.0.116
Run to update: pip3 install --upgrade ruff

I:\Development>pip install "ruff==0.0.111"
...
Successfully installed ruff-0.0.111

I:\Development>ruff -V     
ruff 0.0.111

I:\Development>ruff bug.py 
Found 1 error(s).
bug.py:1:1: F401 `this` imported but unused
1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.

A new version of ruff is available: v0.0.111 -> v0.0.116
Run to update: pip3 install --upgrade ruff

I:\Development>
```
