            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently there is no rule which warns about these:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">set({1, 2, 3})
set({x for x in range(10)})
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>set()</code> wrapper can just be removed because the argument is already a set.</p>
<p>I suggest adding a rule <code>unnecessary-literal-within-set-call</code>, following the example of <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-literal-within-dict-call/">unnecessary-literal-within-dict-call</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, I was actually starting to write a rule for that issue, but then noticed this bigger &quot;omission&quot; and decided to suggest a fix for it first. Maybe #18331 can be lumped into this rule later, though it doesn't <em>exactly</em> fit.</p>
