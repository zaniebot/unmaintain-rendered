# Rule idea: Validate named imports

---

_Issue opened by @silverwind on 2024-04-17 10:41_

A rule to validate whether a named import exists on a imported file would be very useful, equivalent to [this rule](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/docs/rules/named.md) in JS. For example:

foo.py
```py
def foo:
  pass
```

bar.py
```py
from foo import foo, baz # error: named import 'baz' does not exist
```
