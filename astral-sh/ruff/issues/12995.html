<p>Not only is this an invalid type form (https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#reportInvalidTypeForm) but even if autofixed to <code>Literal[&quot;a&quot;]</code> that would fundamentally change the parameter's type.</p>

<p>I can actually repro this bug with flake8-pyi as well on this snippet in a <code>.pyi</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import Literal

x: Literal[&quot;fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooO&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>We disable the flake8-pyi rule at typeshed for our generated stubs; maybe that's what was hiding the bug? https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/a7ff1be4394cef089dd62090a2e2ad10cc77cfe6/.flake8#L16</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I merged #13002, but then immediately afterwards realised that it doesn't deal properly with type aliases. We still get two false positives on this snippet, even after #13002:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from typing import TypeAlias, Literal, Annotated

x: TypeAlias = Literal[&quot;fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooO&quot;]
y: TypeAlias = Annotated[int, &quot;metadataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>@dylwil3, don't suppose you'd be interested in a followup PR, would you? :-) The alternative approach I suggested in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13002#discussion_r1723034693 might work better here after all:</p>
<ul>
<li>we'd want to add tracking in the semantic model for when we're entering <code>Annotated</code> slices, the same as we do when we're entering <code>Literal</code> slices</li>
<li>we'd want to skip PYI053 when we're inside any <code>Annotated</code> or <code>Literal</code> slice, not just when we're inside annotations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, there's no reason to ever use quoted annotations in stubs, since forward references can be used even with <code>__future__</code> annotations enabled. We have another rule (<code>PYI020</code>) specifically for flagging <em>any</em> quoted annotation in a stub... but I suppose if you <em>are</em> going to use quoted annotations in stubs for some reason, and have <code>PYI020</code> switched off for some reason, then maybe it makes sense for this rule to ignore veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy long quoted annotations.</p>
<p>In case it's not obvious, I changed my mind about this while writing this response out 😆 So it's definitely worth adding a comment about this to the code for the rule!</p>

<p>That <em>is</em> odd. I can't immediately see why that would be... don't worry too much about fixing it if you can't figure it out; feel free to ping me if you're stuck!</p>

<p>Mystery solved - I had an invalid .pyi file since I did not actually import <code>Literal</code> or <code>Annotated</code> 🤦</p>
