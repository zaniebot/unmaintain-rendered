# Isort add extend_skip_glob

---

_@nstarman_

I'm testing if we (astropy) can switch our `isort` to ruff's but we have an ``extend_skip_glob`` which I don't think is supported by ruff. Is there an alternative, or can ``extend_skip_glob`` be added? Thanks.

Is the fix to add a per-file-ignore for I001?

Ok. Solved. Thanks!
