            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff is moving very fast which is great, but it means it's virtually impossible to reliably use the latest version.</p>
<p>It would therefore be useful to mute the &quot;A new version of ruff is available:&quot; message via a setting.</p>
<p>I have a process for upgrading dependencies, I don't want every package I use to warn me that it's out of date.</p>
<p>I know the message is only printed if I haven't run ruff recently, but still slightly distracting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you try using the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#update-check"><code>update-check</code></a> setting, and let me know if that doesn't work for you?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Solved, sorry about the noise.</p>
<p>Ironically, I was using an old version of ruff which didn't have that option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hahah :)</p>
<p>No apology needed, the docs aren't very user-friendly right now, it's on my mind!</p>
