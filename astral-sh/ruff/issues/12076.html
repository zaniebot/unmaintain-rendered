            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A lot of frameworks provide classes/functions that have a set number of arguments. It is idiomatic and/or required to have them in place even when not used (ARG002), and they often have too many args (PLR0913).</p>
<p>An example of that from Pyglet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def on_mouse_drag(x, y, dx, dy, buttons, modifiers):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>It is common to only need a couple of those arguments, but they all must be there for it to function properly. It is possible to <code>_</code> the args you don't need to get around ARG002, but that is not idiomatic and confuses thing.</p>
<p>Other examples exist that I don't have immediately on hand, things like Django class based views.</p>
<p>My proposal is a way to exempt classes (in the case of the init) and method names from these (and possibly other related?) checks.</p>
<p>Why not just disable those lints altogether? Because I want my own custom functions and methods to be held to a certain standard. Why not disable those checks on the functions where they come up? Because I will end up with dozens or hundreds of noqa comments throughout a medium sized program.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>matching a regex pattern for this would be awesome, but that may be too much to ask :sweat_smile:</p>
<p>In Pyglet for instance, exempting <code>on_mouse_*</code> and <code>on_key_*</code> go a huge way towards fixing this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Something along the lines of exceptions for mypy could also be helpful in many cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def on_mouse_drag(x, y, dx, dy, buttons, modifiers):  # noqa: ARG002[x,y,buttons,modifiers]
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>The above should complain if <code>dx</code> or <code>dy</code> are unused, but not the others and it should fail if <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>buttons</code> or <code>modifiers</code> are used. That way one can be very specific and any changes will show up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another example is django (especially DRF) custom views, where we need to keep a pk in the function parameter for DRF to work, but in reality, we use self.get_object() to get the instance. In this case, our code looks really ugly because we have so many # noqa: ARG002 everywhere.</p>
<pre><code>def clone_lunch(self, request, pk):  # noqa: ARG002
  instance = self.get_object()
</code></pre>
