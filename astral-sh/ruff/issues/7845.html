            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to have a lint rule that checks for convoluted type annotations, similar to rules that check for complicated functions.</p>
<p>The recommendation would be to move the type information to a type alias or to create a new data type (such as a <code>NamedTuple</code>) to refactor type information.</p>
<p>I don't have a specific idea about how the rule should measure type complexity (it could involve measuring nesting, unions, or just the number of parameters); I am more interested in checking if there would be an appetite for any such rule in Ruff at the moment!</p>
