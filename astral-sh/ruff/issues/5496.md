# Make flake8-quotes descriptions consistent with default settings

Whether single quotes are preferred over double quotes, or vice versa, depends on the `docstring-quotes`, `inline-quotes` and `multiline-quotes` settings, which all default to `"double"`. I think it would make more sense to make the descriptions prefer double quotes as well.

(If anyone's interested, we just need to reverse the order of the branches in the violation definition -- the docs just render the first one.)
