            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think it could be interesting for ruff to also check for unnecessary newlines at the start of files, a parallel (sort of) to to W292 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-newline-at-end-of-file/
The idea being, ruff would prevent a file to start with a new line. Currently, ruff is perfectly fine with it.</p>
<p>For example, this works even with all rules selected:</p>
<pre><code>
from marshaling import AppSettings


class Settings(AppSettings):
    CI_VERSION: str
    ENVIRONMENT_NAME: str
    SYSTEM_JWT_KEY: str


settings = Settings()

</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the suggestion. Have you considered using <code>ruff format</code>? It removes the line automatically for you (and inserts the trailing new line)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I recon it's bordeline, but also use ruff to check on files types (like behave files) that don't quite work ruff format unfortunately</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm sorry but I don't follow what you're trying to say here. Can you expand on what do you mean by &quot;don't quite work ruff format&quot;? Are you using any other filetypes which contains Python source code?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going to close this for now as we're trying to be very conservative in adding new formatting-only lint rules now that we have <code>ruff format</code>, since maintaining compatibility between <code>ruff format</code> and style rules is tricky.</p>
