            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue tracks any improvements that could or should be made when working on error recovery for the new parser. This will be <em>after</em> #10036 is merged and when error recovery work is started.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[ ] 1. Avoid including the invalid expression node for empty and unclosed container types. For example,</p>
<pre><code>[
</code></pre>
<p>Here, there are no elements and the list isn&#x27;t closed. Currently, the parser would emit an invalid node and report an error. The AST would contain a list expression with a single invalid node. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10554">astral-sh/ruff#10554</a>#discussion_r1540762104</p>
<p>This should be done for list, set, dictionary, and tuple literals and possibly their comprehension variants.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 2. Re-visit error recovery in pattern parsing. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10966">astral-sh/ruff#10966</a>#pullrequestreview-2002663533</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 3. <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10570">astral-sh/ruff#10570</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 4. Check if we should use the list parsing to recovery from a syntax error in a <code>case</code> block: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10831">astral-sh/ruff#10831</a>#discussion_r1557231096</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 5. Double starred expression in a dictionary can only be used as a standalone element. If it&#x27;s combined with either key or value in dictionary literal or comprehension, the parser doesn&#x27;t recover well. For example,</p>
<pre><code># Used as key or value
{1: 2, **a: b, a: **b}

# Used in comprehension
{**x: y for x, y in iter}
{x: **y for x, y in iter}
</code></pre>
<p>Possible solution <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10636#discussion_r1542405830">as suggested here</a> to recover is by parsing this as a power operator without a left hand side</p>
<pre><code>{ x: &lt;missing&gt;**y for x, y in data}
</code></pre>
<p>See https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/02bb3108ad625cddcec228846b9ff56cc5398976/src/compiler/parser.ts#L5506-L5569</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Possible improvement to recovery from an unparenthesized named expression at the statement level. For example,</p>
<pre><code>x := 1
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, the parser would parse the <code>x</code> as a statement and throw an error at the <code>:=</code> token as it cannot start any statement. One way would be to <em>allow</em> named expression and check if it&#x27;s parenthesized or not. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10641">astral-sh/ruff#10641</a>#discussion_r1542500243</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 6. If there are multiple expressions in a parenthesized context <strong>not</strong> separated by a comma, we could possibly use the tuple parsing. For example,</p>
<pre><code>(1 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, it could be a missing comma error but currently the parser would expect a closing parenthesis after <code>1</code>. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10641">astral-sh/ruff#10641</a>#discussion_r1542503837</p>
</li>
<li><p>[x] #20849</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 8. Currently, the top level expression parsing uses the <code>star_expressions</code> rule which is what the grammar has. This means that for an unparenthesized named expression, the error messages aren&#x27;t really that useful. We could potentially use <code>star_named_expressions</code> rule and report an error if an unparenthesized named expression was found. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10659">astral-sh/ruff#10659</a>/files#r1547373837</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 9. The default case for expression parsing gives confusing error message:</p>
<pre><code>  |
3 | (x :=
4 | 
5 | def foo():
  | ^^^ Syntax Error: Expected an identifier, but found a keyword &#x27;def&#x27; that cannot be used here
6 |     pass
  |
</code></pre>
<p>This is because the if the expression parsing didn&#x27;t find any valid start token for an expression, it first checks if it&#x27;s a keyword and if it is then it parses it as a named expression (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/9a4bed5eec6584950afc5458a2e1f3273ef168be/crates/ruff_python_parser/src/parser/expression.rs#L523-L524">source</a>). Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10659">astral-sh/ruff#10659</a>/files#r1547376735</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 10. Possible improvement when the left-hand side is missing for an infix expressions such as binary, boolean and compare expression. Currently, the parser would drop the token and parse the right-hand side as a standalone expression. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10730">astral-sh/ruff#10730</a>#discussion_r1547606839</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 11. Currently, the parser drops the left side of <code>=</code> of the keyword argument in a call expression when it&#x27;s not a name expression. The reason being that only a name expression is allowed at that position. A possible recovery would be to add it to the <code>args</code> list but that means that it&#x27;s a missing comma. For example, <code>call(x + y = 1)</code>, here <code>x + y</code> isn&#x27;t allowed. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10733">astral-sh/ruff#10733</a>#discussion_r1547831007</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 12. In <code>for</code> statement, the parser should parse the target if it&#x27;s <em>not</em> at <code>in</code> token. This could improve error recovery in case the target is absent. For example, <code>for in b: ...</code>. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10816">astral-sh/ruff#10816</a>#discussion_r1555479143.</p>
<p>The underlying problem could be something else. If the parser doesn&#x27;t find a token which starts an expression, then the expression parsing&#x27;s fallback mechanism is to first check if the token is a keyword, if so then parse it as <code>ExprName</code>, else report an error and return an empty <code>ExprName</code> (<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1039017663004942429/1144561539219734578/1227243794190045236">Internal discussion</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 13. In <code>try</code> statement, if <code>finally</code> is present then the <code>else</code> block can come only before it. If it comes after the <code>finally</code> block, it&#x27;s an error. In that case, the parser will not parse the <code>else</code> block as part of the try statement and it&#x27;ll parse the statements inside the block as per of the outer node. Refer <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10815">astral-sh/ruff#10815</a>#discussion_r1555451275</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 14. Decorators with missing expressions or decorators being applied on the wrong node. Refer https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/f4fd047ea43e2c32cf4b12e73e9106e038c2db59/crates/ruff_python_parser/src/parser/statement.rs#L2224-L2237</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 15. Avoid dropping the <code>async</code> token while parsing an async statement. Refer: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10819">astral-sh/ruff#10819</a>#discussion_r1555471523</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] 16. For <code>Mode::Expression</code>, currently the parser will drop all of the remaining tokens after the first expression is parsed. We could potentially have a better recovery by continue parsing till the current token is not the start of an expression and collect all the parsed expressions as a <code>ExprTuple</code>. The parser would raise an &quot;expected a comma&quot; error between each expression. Even after this, there could potentially be extra tokens which could represent a statement so we should keep dropping the tokens.
