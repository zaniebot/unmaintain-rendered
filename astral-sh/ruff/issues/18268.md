# Rule Request: Check for Useless `continue` at end of `for` loop

---

_Issue opened by @collinanderson on 2025-05-23 02:47_

### Summary

Rule Request: Check for Useless `continue` at end of `for` or `while` loop.

```
for a in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(a)
    continue
```
The continue here is useless and should probably be removed.

Thanks for the suggestion. I think this makes sense but might be something that we want to combine into a more general unreachable rule. @dylwil3 do we have an issue for unreachable?

Hi.

> we want to combine into a more general unreachable rule.

It is not unreachable. It is a no-op.

It is the same thing as this

```
block = "of code"
... # <- no-op
pass # <- no-op
more = "code"
````

`pass` and `...` statements mixed with other statements in the same block. The latter covered by this rule.
