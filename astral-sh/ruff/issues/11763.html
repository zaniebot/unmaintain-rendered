            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, not sure if this is the correct place, please point me in the right direction if not.
I've recently re-watched a <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0">good talk on not writing too many classes</a> and was wondering if it is possible to implement a few recommendations giver there as rules.</p>
<p><strong>Empty class rule</strong>: warn when the class just subclasses another while not doing anything, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyDict(dict):
	pass
</code></pre>
<p>__Class with two methods, one of which is <code>__init__</code>__: warn when a class has only two methods, one of which is <code>__init__</code>, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Greeting:
    def __init__(self, greeting: str = &quot;Hello&quot;) -&gt; None:
        self._greeting = greeting

    def greet(self, name) -&gt; None:
        print(f&quot;{self._greeting} {name}!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>I did a quick search through existing rules, but couldn't find anything relevant.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is roughly what's implemented in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9601. I might suggest chiming in on or watching that PR!</p>
