            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>a Dependabot update to version 0.6.1 trips on CI</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/daq-tools/commons-codec/pull/22</li>
<li>https://github.com/daq-tools/commons-codec/actions/runs/10461452590/job/28969807264?pr=22</li>
</ul>
<p>... with errors like those.</p>
<pre><code>I001 [*] Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
</code></pre>
<p>However, when trying to ramp up for debugging this issue, now also using Ruff 0.6.1 locally on macOS after upgrading to it, the command <code>ruff check .</code> still succeeds. We tried to make sure we do not look at stale or otherwise bogus outcomes, by also deleting <code>.ruff_cache/</code> locally. Nothing changed: It works on my machine, but it trips on CI/GHA.</p>
<p>Can someone spot any flaws, or has an idea where this might be coming from?</p>
<p>With kind regards,
Andreas.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Everything is right. After adding https://github.com/daq-tools/commons-codec/commit/ea72c9d6e2950, CI succeeds again. This was a non-issue, apparently I made a mistake evaluating the situation. Sorry for the noise.</p>
