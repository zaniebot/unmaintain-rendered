            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Bandit supports reporting on only high-severity issues using the <code>-lll</code> flag e.g.
<code>bandit examples/*.py -n 3 -lll</code></p>
<p>or medium and high severity issues with <code>-ll</code>
<code>bandit examples/*.py -n 3 -ll</code></p>
<p>This is quite useful when running on a large codebase to filter down to only the most serious issues.
This is a request to add this config option to Bandit in the Ruff linter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi</p>
<p>I can see how this is useful. We're considering to introduce a warning level to distinguish between different severities. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1256</p>
<p>I don't think we want to go as far as having more levels other than warning and error. I'll close this in favor of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1256</p>
