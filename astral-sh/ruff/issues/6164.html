Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>For example, the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(
    &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa %s %s&quot;
    % (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
)
</code></pre>
<p>is fixed to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(
    &quot;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa {} {}&quot;.format(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
)

</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dhruvmanila Thanks for the comment. UP032 is similar to this rule and not raised if the fixed code exceeds the line length limit.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In UP031, ignoring the line length might make sense because a formatter could fix it.</p>
