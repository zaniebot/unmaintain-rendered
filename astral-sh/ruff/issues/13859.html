<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been trying to upgrade ruff and use the formatter, so we can remove black. I have noticed this diff when using the formatter:</p>
<img width="227" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a526853-5cca-4b50-9ca1-c858c9a60081">

<p>This enum is used to validate codes from an external API, I would rather not try and handle lowercasing that data before accessing this enum. I cannot seem to find a rule to turn off this behaviour, does this not exist or am I missing something? Nothing interesting popped out to me when running <code>ruff format --verbose &lt;path&gt;</code></p>
<p>Ruff version: <code>0.7.0</code></p>
<p>Code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>from enum import Enum


class TestEnum(Enum):
    ANGRY = '\u1F621'
    SAD = '\u1F622'
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff pyproject settings:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;N&quot;]
ignore = []

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
inline-quotes = &quot;single&quot;

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = &quot;single&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Command invoked:
<code>ruff format &lt;path&gt;</code> (Doesn't matter if it's only the file, or the whole repo)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hi @DashKenny</p>
<p>The casing of the hex-values in unicode escapes doesn't change the value at runtime:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '\u1F621' == '\u1f621'
True
</code></pre>
<p>It's just a different way to format the same data.</p>
