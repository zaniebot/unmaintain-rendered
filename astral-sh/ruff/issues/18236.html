            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Directly using the <code>.__annotations__</code> attribute of an object is unsafe in a few circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>On classes with custom metaclasses, various odd things can happen (https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/#pre-existing-bugs). On Python 3.14 and newer this only happens if at least one of the classes involved uses <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>; on earlier versions it can always happen.</li>
<li>Accessing <code>__annotations__</code> on an instance of an annotated class works in released versions of Python (most of the time) but won't work in Python 3.14.</li>
<li>(Minor) Accessing <code>__annotations__</code> on arbitrary type objects will raise AttributeError on static types, e.g. <code>int.__annotations__</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is always safe to access <code>__annotations__</code> on function and module objects.</p>
<p>Therefore, it probably makes sense for Ruff to warn against any use of the <code>.__annotations__</code> attribute, perhaps with an exception for objects known to be functions or modules.</p>
<p>Similar to #17853.</p>
