# Port Pylint's `missing-raises-doc`

---

_Issue opened by @gtkacz on 2025-03-09 01:38_

### Summary

Pylint's [W9006](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/warning/missing-raises-doc.html) rule, `missing-raises-doc`, checks whether or not a developer has documented manually raised Exceptions in the relevant docstring. This practice not only improves the clarity and maintainability of the code by making the possible error conditions explicit in the documentation, but also helps users of the function/method understand how to properly handle or anticipate these exceptions.

Hi! I think this might already be flagged by our preview `DOC501` rule? https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/docstring-missing-exception/
