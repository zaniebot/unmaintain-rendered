            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>PLR0124 documentation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparing a name to itself always results in the same value (...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bu it doesn't, as one can overload <code>__eq__</code>.</p>
<p>This came up in a situation where I had an assertion like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">assert foo == foo
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote the test because foo's class had overriden <strong>eq</strong> and I needed to test that the equality still held.</p>
<p>I suggest to rewrite the first sentence, switching &quot;always&quot; to &quot;likely&quot; and adjusting the rest accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparing a name to itself likely results in a truthy value, and is probably a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I think I initially read this as &quot;Comparing a name to itself <strong>is always true</strong>, and is likely a mistake,&quot; but it actually says &quot;always results in the same value.&quot; That kind of raises the required strangeness level of an <code>__eq__</code> implementation that would break this assumption (i.e. <code>foo == foo</code> is sometimes true and sometimes false).</p>
<p>It's probably still worth calling out in the docs, but I'd probably make it more of a footnote or at least separate section rather than changing the main text since this should be rare.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @ntBre!</p>
<p>Indeed, a symbol should always equal itself; but we are not talking about the implementation of the equality operation but the scrutinization of code syntax. Given a python object can have a custom <strong>eq</strong> that can perform whatever the user desires, stating &quot;always results in the same value&quot; is false - that's implementation dependant.</p>
<p>It's nitpicking, for sure, but personally I would prefer the docs to be more precise. Maybe adding &quot;should&quot; (as in <em>should always result in the same value</em>) would suffice? Not giving the absolute idea that this is automatically true?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @ntBre that this seems like a very specific edge case that I don't think we need to highlight so prominently. But a prominent case where this is true is comparing <code>math.nan</code> with itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is it proeminent to include a <em>should</em> qualifier? Genuinely asking, sorry if I'm sounding pushy.</p>
<p>I would agree with a note to at least make sure users understand that this is a call to <code>__eq__</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wouldn't mind changing always to something like: &quot;for most objects, comparing it to itself...&quot;</p>
