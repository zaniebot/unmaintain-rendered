            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since 0.2.0 version, my fuzzer CI stopped working.</p>
<p>In CI, first I start to search for broken files, minimize sample size and at the end minimize number of rules, that are needed to produce problem.</p>
<p>Minimization of rules is done via this steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting all rules from ruff - this is done via <code>ruff rule --all</code> command and manually parsing all rules in ()</li>
<li>splitting available rules by half and checking if ruff still produce error</li>
<li>repeating until found minimal amount of rules</li>
</ul>
<p>0.2.0 version removed rule PLR1706 which is still available in <code>ruff rule --all</code> with section <code>## Removal</code> and ruff started to fail each time with message</p>
<pre><code>ruff failed
  Cause: Rule `PLR1706` was removed and cannot be selected.
</code></pre>
<p>At least for now I can modify a little rule parser, but probably this will be more problematic in future.</p>
<p>So maybe ruff could produce simple list of rules(enabled/removed etc.) like <code>AN001,AN002</code> or export them to json file via <code>rull rule --export a.json</code> or ruff rule --available-simple?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Eh.., I searched for a similar option but did not find it.</p>
<p>It would be good to add to this json the fields <code>&quot;removed'': bool</code> and <code>&quot;deprecated'': bool</code> to avoid having to parse explanation field.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes I was just about to open a feature request for this; currently the JSON output does not contain any information regarding whether a rule still exists. Either there should be a key or there should be a flag to exclude removed rules.</p>
