<p>is errantly flagged by PLW0642, but I am in these case I&#x27;m calling an overloaded function <code>operator.ixor</code> on self, not trying to assign a new variable to it. The former would have an actual side affect here, while the later would not affect it at all (which this bug is trying to catch).</p>
<p>In this case, <code>other</code> is a set, and I can update typing if that the typing is what is confusing ruff, but I wanted to
version: <code>ruff 0.6.0</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It makes sense to me to exclude augmented assignments from this rule, and it would also mean we&#x27;d have more similar behaviour to pylint here. (Pylint seems to ignore augmented assignments for their version of this rule -- though they also ignore annotated assignments, which makes less sense to me.)</p>
<p>@diceroll123 -- was there a specific reason you decided to differ from pylint&#x27;s behaviour here when you added this rule in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9267">astral-sh/ruff#9267</a>? :-)</p>
