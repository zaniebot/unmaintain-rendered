            <div class="timeline-body"><p>there is a rule descrepancy in E7111 vs F632 we can't comply with both
one says i must <code>0.1 is not None</code>
the other says i must <code>0.1 != None</code></p>
<p>may i request a <code>Ruff-specific rules (RUF)</code> that reconciles these? it basically would say &quot;use != in constant comparisons that don't involve None else use is not None syntax`</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it has to go the other way, because <code>0.1 is not None</code> is a syntax warning:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1 is not None
&lt;stdin&gt;:1: SyntaxWarning: &quot;is not&quot; with a literal. Did you mean &quot;!=&quot;?
</code></pre>
<p>We should allow <code>0.1 != None</code> (although it seems strange to have code that compares two literals like that :))</p>
