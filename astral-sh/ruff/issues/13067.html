            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not yet, I'm still on the fence on whether this should be changed or not given that most users are (I think) finding the default value useful. This is mainly from the amount of upvotes in this issue and given that it can be easily updated using the setting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see very few reasons as to why <code>editorFirst</code> should be the default value, compared to <code>filesystemFirst</code>. If a project is configured with specific linter and/or formatting rules it is safe to assume that these are the preferred and agreed upon settings for that project. I see very few, if any, scenarios in which the preferences of individual developers should be prioritized over the project settings. Especially not on formatting rules as this can result in a mess of commits.</p>
