# Implement isort `add_imports` option

---

_Issue opened by @ngnpope on 2023-01-27 11:37_

It would be handy if we could have isort's [`add_imports`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#add-imports) configuration option.

This is quite often used to add `from __future__ import annotations`:

```toml
[tool.ruff.isort]
add_imports = ["from __future__ import annotations"]
```

It's probably relatively straightforward to also implement [`remove_imports`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#remove-imports) at the same time.

There are also `--add-import` and `--remove-import` command line options, but not sure how widely used they are.

We support this! It’s just under a different name: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#required-imports

Hopefully that helps, but just LMK if I need to reopen.

Huh. How did I keep overlooking that? 🤦‍♂️

And I see #1749 will cover converting configuration.

Thanks 😄
