# D209 introduces W291

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-18 15:59_

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
def calculate_ipv6_reverse(network):
    """Return reversed network
    part of IPv4 network. """
    return str(network)
```
note the whitespace before the closing `"""`.

`$ ruff --isolated --select D --fix foo.py`
turns it into:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
def calculate_ipv6_reverse(network):
    """Return reversed network
    part of IPv4 network. 
    """
    return str(network)
```
note the invisible trailing ` `:
```
$ pycodestyle foo.py
foo.py:4:26: W291 trailing whitespace
```

We don't enforce `W291`, but I can fix this.
