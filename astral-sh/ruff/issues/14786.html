            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m working on a pretty anarchic codebase that I&#x27;m slowly wrestling into shape, but for now, the minimized structure is</p>
<pre><code>my_project
├── pyproject.toml
└── src
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── foo.py
    └── ... other modules ...
</code></pre>
<p>and all imports are done via <code>PYTHONPATH=src</code> (aka, <code>from foo import ...</code>). We&#x27;e been running ruff
for linting nearly since the start of the project with no issues, and once <code>analyze graph</code> was
introduced I immediately started using it but couldn&#x27;t get it to work; I finally got some time to look into it.</p>
<p>It works perfectly fine on the new src-layout uv projects I&#x27;ve been creating, but not on the main <code>src/</code>
codebase.</p>
<p>I created a minimal repro in <a href="https://github.com/purajit/ruff-graph-layout-test">this repo</a> (see results of <code>ruff</code> <a href="https://github.com/purajit/ruff-graph-layout-test/actions/runs/12177280068/job/33964766403">here</a>); it has a few different layouts.</p>
<ul>
<li>with the flat layout, notice how package-based imports from <code>flat_layout</code> are picked up in <code>a.py</code>,
but not the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>-relative import in <code>c.py</code></li>
<li>with the semi-flat layout (aka, what I have), none of the imports are picked up</li>
<li>with src-layout, everything works perfectly, as expected</li>
</ul>
<p>From https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#src</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These defaults ensure that Ruff supports both flat layouts and src layouts out-of-the-box. (If a configuration file is explicitly provided (e.g., via the --config command-line flag), the current working directory will be considered the project root.)</p>
</blockquote>
What I&#x27;ve tried
<p>Hacking around, I was able to get it to work with this patch (that I understand is obviously incorrect):</p>
<pre><code>git diff -U1
diff --git a/crates/ruff_graph/src/db.rs b/crates/ruff_graph/src/db.rs
index 39f74081b..ae9403e18 100644
--- a/crates/ruff_graph/src/db.rs
+++ b/crates/ruff_graph/src/db.rs
@@ -31,6 +31,6 @@ impl ModuleDb {
             // Use the first source root.
-            let src_root = src_roots
+            let mut src_root = src_roots
                 .next()
                 .ok_or_else(|| anyhow::anyhow!(&quot;No source roots provided&quot;))?;

             let mut search_paths = SearchPathSettings::new(src_root);
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I don&#x27;t really understand this (I&#x27;m rather new to Rust) - but without the patch, the value of
<code>src_roots.next()</code> doesn&#x27;t contain the required trailing <code>src/</code>, but the value here:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/fda8b1f884c8598960b2e3f0c729e17ac62bfe35/crates/ruff/src/commands/analyze_graph.rs#L63-L68
does contain <code>src/</code> - every single value, so choosing <code>.next()</code> shouldn&#x27;t matter - so I don&#x27;t understand
where that&#x27;s getting stripped out. If it weren&#x27;t getting stripped out, this would work out-of-the-box.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the nice reproduction and writeup!</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not quiet sure what&#x27;s happening. Maybe @charliermarsh has a better idea. I observe that <code>package_roots</code> always pick up the parent directory instead of the file containing the <code>project. tool</code>. I&#x27;d expect that the <code>source_root</code> always maps to the <code>lint.src</code> directory instead of just mapping to the package roots.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah - I spent some time going through, and yeah, that&#x27;s pretty much what&#x27;s happening - instead
of just taking the parent here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/8b9c843c727de463efccafc7e012414b93458dc7/crates/ruff/src/commands/analyze_graph.rs#L62-L68
should it instead run through the list of <code>linter.src</code>s and check path prefixes, similar to what&#x27;s done
here for namespace packages here? https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/8b9c843c727de463efccafc7e012414b93458dc7/crates/ruff_linter/src/packaging.rs#L29-L32</p>
<p>Otherwise, it seems like flat packages are <em>explicitly</em> not supported for <code>ruff analyze graph</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m down to PR! Want to make sure this makes sense first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven&#x27;t thought deeply about this, but isn&#x27;t the import in <code>flat_layout/c.py</code> incorrect? Having the <code>__init__.py</code> in <code>semi_flat_src/src</code> also seems incorrect... The imports would then need to be <code>from src.b import B</code>, etc. I don&#x27;t know if we should support these layouts, since they seem to be incorrectly structured?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh yes it is, sadly, that&#x27;s how our primary codebase is laid out, with imports being
done based on <code>PYTHONPATH=src</code>, and the application deployed with a plain source code copy (I
promise I&#x27;m actively working on this mess, haha). I guess I was hoping <code>ruff</code> would/could(/should?)
be able to honor <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, but maybe that&#x27;s a much larger discussion?</p>
<p>We can close this issue, since I understand the behavior now, having resolved some misunderstandings
I had and reading the code, but still curious about your thoughts.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah ok, I think I was able to narrow down the pathological case we have, so I&#x27;m now able to
boil down this issue to a minimal question:</p>
<p>Should ruff&#x27;s package discovery stop trying to detect packages once it discovers anything
specified in the <code>src</code> config?</p>
<p>Essentially, because we deploy via code-copy and setting <code>PYTHONPATH=src</code>, meaning that
<code>src/pkg</code> is imported as <code>pkg</code> rather than <code>src.pkg</code>. However, we have a vestigial <code>src/__init__.py</code>
(again, I apologize on behalf of the codebase), which caused ruff analyze&#x27;s package discovery
to still resolve everything to <code>src</code> rather than the individual modules inside it, and preventing
any imports from resolving. Deleting the <code>src/__init__.py</code> fixes the issue.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m totally fine if the answer is &quot;no, make sure your Python packaging and organization is
correctly set up&quot;, but just thought I&#x27;d follow up to resolve the confusion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having fixed our entire packaging and making everything PEPpy, I definitely don&#x27;t think <code>ruff analyze graph</code> should care about <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. However, a warning might be helpful, consider bad packaging is pretty commonplace.</p>
