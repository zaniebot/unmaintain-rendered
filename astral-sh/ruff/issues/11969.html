            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I want to be able to use the following command to check existence of type hints across a range in a python file, specifically to prevent <em>new</em> callables from being added without type hints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ruff check --select ANN --ignore ANN101,ANN102 --range &lt;start_line&gt;-&lt;end_line&gt; &lt;file.py&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this currently not available like it is in ruff format?
It hinders my ability to gradually enter checking over a large mature codebase.</p>

<p>Range formatting is an important formatter that many editors require, linting only a range is something that's less common.</p>
<p>I don't see specific reasons why Ruff can't support linting just a range, but there's quiet a bit of complexity involved and I don't expect us to prioritize this highly in the near future.</p>
