<p>Hi! <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew">Homebrew</a> maintainer here. We noticed that <code>v0.0.259</code> was tagged, but is not yet marked as latest on the repo's <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases">releases page</a>. I'm filing this issue to confirm if the release is ready to be marked as latest, so that we can go ahead and ship it. Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, <code>v0.0.259</code> is the latest release as there was a regression in <code>v0.0.258</code>. I guess he must've forgotten to mark it as the latest one.</p>
