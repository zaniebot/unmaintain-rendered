<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p><code>ruff</code> has just tried to use 100gb of memory on my machine while running the formatter twice at the same time:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/assets/8955690/45db92eb-7016-4bc1-8312-5e7517542e95" alt="image"></p>
<p>I think this is related to #8147 as it was triggered by PyCharm&#x27;s File Watcher functionality and that seems to be when that happens. This is for a pretty big project, not public so I can&#x27;t share.</p>
<p>The command that caused this was <code>ruff format</code>, the File Watcher config is shown here:</p>
<img alt="image" src="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/assets/8955690/b5c3b2be-8490-4fe1-94af-bf9991cdb315">

<p>My settings looks like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
    line-length = 120
    exclude = [
        &#x27;*/migrations/*&#x27;,
        &#x27;*_extra_messages.py&#x27;
    ]

[tool.ruff.format]
    quote-style = &#x27;single&#x27;

[tool.ruff.lint]
    extend-select = [&#x27;I&#x27;]
    ignore = [&#x27;E402&#x27;]

[tool.ruff.lint.isort]
    combine-as-imports = true
</code></pre>
<p>and I&#x27;m using version 0.2.0</p>
<p>~~For the moment, I&#x27;m going to turn off the &#x27;Trigger the watcher on external changes&#x27; flag as I presume this causing the issue, but lmk if you need more info.~~</p>
<p>That didn&#x27;t work and it&#x27;s now happening regularly. I&#x27;ve had to disable the File Watcher completely for now, I still can&#x27;t replicate using the command line.</p>

<p>That sounds very likely because there&#x27;s a bug that causes cache corruption if two processes write to the same cache file at the same time.</p>

<p>Are you saying that this only happens to processes spawned by the file watcher but running the same command over CLI doesn&#x27;t suffer the same problem? That would be surprising because both the file watcher started and the CLI started ruff should load the same cache.</p>
<p>Can you try to change your file watcher to pass <code>--no-cache</code> to see if the error persists? You can also try to clean your cache directory (default location is <code>.ruff-cache</code>)</p>

<p>I imagine it&#x27;s because of the cache corruption as you say. Using the same command in the terminal doesn&#x27;t cause the issue.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m running the file watcher now with the flag, I&#x27;ll monitor and report later on the status.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay I can now cause the error with <code>ruff check</code> in the terminal. Caps out at 100gb ram. Running with the <code>--no-cache</code> flag works.</p>
<p>Once you do a release of the new code I&#x27;ll check again</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tomhamiltonstubber thanks for the update. That&#x27;s terrifying but glad that it is related to caching. You can try to remove the <code>.ruff-cache</code> directory and use <code>--no-cache</code> in the file watcher only because it should be less likely that you run into the race when using ruff from the CLI.</p>
<p>Thanks for keeping us posted!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah my guess is that the cache itself is now in a bad state — I’d suggest removing it and running with no-cache for now if you’re seeing this consistently, but I believe it should be fixed in the next release.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I&#x27;ve been running without the <code>no-cache</code> option for the last couple of days with the new version and haven&#x27;t had any issues so I think it&#x27;s been solved. Thanks a lot!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Removing the <code>-no-cache</code> in the latest version should be okay if the caching was the root cause. But whether caching is enabled or not probably doesn&#x27;t matter in your use case</p>

<p>Can you please open a new issue and tell us more about what Ruff version you&#x27;re using and what problem&#x27;s you&#x27;re seeing</p>
