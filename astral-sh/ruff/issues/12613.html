Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Currently, Ruff uses some hard-coded name &quot;patterns&quot; to determine whether a module-local object might be a logger (for the purposes of e.g. <code>flake8-logging-format</code> G rules).</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/fc16d8d04d86aa94a8aac14bbb87089b64d443a1/crates/ruff_python_semantic/src/analyze/logging.rs#L60-L74</p>
<p>We've found that we have some loggers called <code>_LOG</code> which aren't matched, and I was disappointed to find that these aren't configurable. Maybe this should be a setting list of regular expressions or globs or something like that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suppose, at the very least, it would be nice to add <code>starts_with(&quot;_log&quot;)</code> and <code>starts_with(&quot;_LOG&quot;)</code>, but that seems like a band-aid.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This makes sense to me, at least short-term. The long term goal is to use type inference to detect if a variable is a logger</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>from duplicate: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20436</p>
<p>with config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint]
logger-objects = ['foo.get_it', 'AUTH']
</code></pre>
<p>The following use cases exists:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from foo import get_it
get_it.info('foo %s' % (1,))   # detected

blah = get_it()
blah.info('foo %s' % (1,))  # not detected
get_it().info('foo %s' % (1,))  # not detected

blub = get_it
blub.info('foo %s' % (1,))  # also not detected

AUTH.info('foo %s' % (1,))  # also not detected
</code></pre>
<p>So, I would like logger-objects to be the result of a function/method call.
Furthermore I would like to specify the log variable names, our loggers are called <code>AUTH</code>, <code>NETWORK</code>, <code>ACL</code>, etc. and therefor don't match anything like <code>.*log.*</code>.
If I just put these names into logger-objects, they are ignored.</p>
