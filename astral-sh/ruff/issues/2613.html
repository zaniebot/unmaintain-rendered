Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>It looks like  #2431 also removes quotes from literal values in type annotation</p>

<pre><code class="language-diff">- PathType = Union[str, 'os.PathLike[str]']

- _TProjectBuilder = TypeVar('_TProjectBuilder', bound='ProjectBuilder')
+ _TProjectBuilder = TypeVar('_TProjectBuilder', bound=ProjectBuilder)
</code></pre>
<p>These are both broken. <code>os.PathLike[str]</code> is not valid on Python 3.7 (and it's not an annotation). TypeVar can't have the quotes removed, the thing it's bound to doesn't exist yet. And it's also not an annotation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the <code>Literal</code> case, the issue is that you're accessing <code>Literal</code> from a module that isn't <code>typing</code> or <code>typing_extensions</code>.</p>
<p>For example, this doesn't raise an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from __future__ import annotations

from typing import Literal

x: Literal[&quot;x86_64&quot;, &quot;arm64&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>But this does:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from __future__ import annotations

from .typing import Literal

x: Literal[&quot;x86_64&quot;, &quot;arm64&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#typing-modules"><code>typing-modules</code></a> to fix this, but it doesn't support relative imports right now.</p>

<p>There's a <code>--diff</code> flag -- is that along the lines of what you're describing?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can see a diff of what changed via git, I just can't see the list of rules that were applied to make those changes. For example, if I make a fixable change to a Ruby file and run rubocop:</p>
<pre><code>Inspecting 16 files
....C...........

Offenses:

_plugins/checkproj.rb:36:7: C: [Corrected] Style/RedundantReturn: Redundant return detected.
      return @people ||= people_gen
      ^^^^^^

16 files inspected, 1 offense detected, 1 offense corrected
</code></pre>
<p>I can see exactly what rules were applied in the fixes.</p>
<p>Something like <code>Fixed:\n</code> followed by the rules that were fixed, for example.</p>
