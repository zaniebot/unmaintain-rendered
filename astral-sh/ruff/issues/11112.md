# `ruff server`: Write snapshot tests for project + editor settings resolution

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-04-23 18:18_

(Follow-up to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11062)

The server should have snapshot tests that verify that project and editor settings resolve correctly. We can use existing client settings test fixtures in combination with new mock TOML configurations, and then confirm that the resolved settings match the expected value.
