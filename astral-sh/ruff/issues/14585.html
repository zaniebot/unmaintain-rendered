            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This code is flagged for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/dict-index-missing-items/">PLC0206</a> with v0.8.0:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo = {}
for key in foo.keys(): # PLC0206 Extracting value from dictionary without calling `.items()`
  if foo[key]:
    foo[key] = True
</code></pre>
<p>Arguable, changing <code>.keys()</code> to <code>.items()</code> here does not improve readability because one still needs to use <code>foo[key]</code> to write into the dict:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo = {}
for key, value in foo.items():
  if value:
    foo[key] = True
</code></pre>
<p>Suggestion would be to not trigger the rule when any write to the dict is present. Interestingly, the rule already does not flag when the <code>if</code> line is removed.</p>

<p>The code isn't really meant to be taken seriously and the actual code where I hit this was more complex. If you like a slightly more complex example, take this one, which is also flagged:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo = {}
for key in foo.keys():
  if foo[key] == &quot;foo&quot;:
    foo[key] = &quot;bar&quot;
  elif foo[key] == &quot;bar&quot;:
    foo[key] = &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. I first thought that this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13821 but it's not because #13821 also reads the value while iterating</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's because the rule triggers the first time it sees <code>foo[key]</code> in a <em>load</em> context - like in the if statement.</p>
<p>I'm actually kind of borderline on whether we should or shouldn't flag, especially because we already don't flag if <code>foo[key]</code> is <em>only</em> used when someone assigns a new value to it (or deletes it).</p>
<p>Already in your second example, it starts to get a little verbose. I kind of find it more readable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for key,val in foo.items():
  if val == &quot;foo&quot;:
    foo[key] = &quot;bar&quot;
  elif val == &quot;bar&quot;:
    foo[key] = &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>One could imagine even more gymnastics:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for key in foo:
   # &lt;--- all sorts of complicated expressions with the value foo[key] ---&gt;
   if cond_now_holds:
       foo[key] = 10
</code></pre>
<p>It seems in the spirit of the rule to flag this.</p>
<p>But I also see your point. I'm on the fence.</p>
<p>(P.S. - ignore the linked PR below. Bad copy pasting ... too many tabs open 😅 )</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, @dylwil3, you're right. This is the same as #13821. That's what you get for replying late in the day :laughing:</p>
<p>I then agree that the rule should flag this pattern because it helps remove some repetition. It's unfortunate that Python doesn't allow assigning to <code>*value = new_value</code> the same way as rust does</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've got another one where PLC0206 is triggered but the loop is already 'expensive':</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyConfigParser(configparser.ConfigParser):
  def as_dict(self) -&gt; Mapping[str, Any]:
    d = dict(self._sections)  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
    for k in d:
      d[k] = self._defaults | d[k]  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
      d[k].pop(&quot;__name__&quot;, None)
    return d
</code></pre>
<p>I've already changed the code to silence the warning, but since Python doesn't provide a <em>reference</em> to the value attached to 'k', only a copy, writing to that key and calling methods on it will always require indexing by the key.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This still feels somewhat borderline to me. On the one hand, as in the previous examples, you can use the value in your reassignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyConfigParser(configparser.ConfigParser):
  def as_dict(self) -&gt; Mapping[str, Any]:
    d = dict(self._sections)  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
    for k,v in d.items():
      d[k] = self._defaults | v  # &lt;--- can use v here
      d[k].pop(&quot;__name__&quot;, None)
    return d
</code></pre>
<p>You might worry that if you don't reassign but just use <code>pop</code> then it wouldn't revise the value, but as long as you don't reassign <code>v</code> in the for loop it will still point to the mutable value, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&quot;a&quot;: {&quot;b&quot;:1, &quot;c&quot;:2}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k,v in d.items():
...    v.pop(&quot;b&quot;)
...
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': {'c': 2}}
</code></pre>
<p>I guess in this example you couldn't use <code>v</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for k in d:
    d[k] = new_object_not_depending_on_v
    d[k].pop()
</code></pre>
<p>but, of course, in that case you could have modified the new value for <code>d[k]</code> <em>before</em> assigning it to <code>d[k]</code> and you wouldn't get a lint warning.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, and that's exactly the change I made to the code to silence the warning. I don't really consider it to be an 'improvement' but it's also not harmful. The only reason I posted here is because this rule is intended to make the code more efficient, but in the situation where the value at the key is being written and/or other operations are being invoked on it, the efficiency gained is likely to be a tiny fraction of the overall time consumed by the loop.</p>
<p>The loop could also be written to use a temporary variable to hold the value of the 'default or v' expression, and then <code>pop</code> invoked on that, before writing to <code>d[k]</code>. I wouldn't consider this really an 'improvement' either, but this is all pretty subjective :-)</p>
