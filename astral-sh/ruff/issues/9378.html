            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our python dist uses a different location for the bin/ folder, thus getting its location via <code>sysconfig</code> functions doesn't work.
So, it'd be really handy to be able to specify the location of ruff executable via env var. We can have something like
<code>RUFF_BIN_PATH=/some/path/ruff</code></p>
<p>If you are ok with that, I can send a PR.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the awesome job you're doing!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm referring to <code>python -m ruff</code> or <code>import ruff.__main__</code>. If we try running <code>ruff</code> by either way, it raises an exception:
<code>FileNotFoundError: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\ruff.exe</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Where is the binary being stored?</p>
<p>If you're going to be customizing the path to the binary you're probably just better off calling it directly, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's deployed too all developer machines, but to a different folder than the default <code>../Scripts</code>.
I do call it directly, I just thought to add a more generic way of doing it, so that we can add an env var to our python dist and have it working without any special wrappers.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately I think I would prefer not to support this. It's straightforward but it feels non-standard and it does open the door to some confusing behaviors (e.g., <code>python -m ruff</code> could then resolve to a binary installed in some other virtual environment).</p>
