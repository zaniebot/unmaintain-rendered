            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for quick reply and very cool tool!</p>
<p>For example, in project first file 1 blank line between docstring and imports</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Docstring.&quot;&quot;&quot;

from package1 import module1
from package2 import module2
</code></pre>
<p>In second file - 2 blank lines:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Docstring.&quot;&quot;&quot;


from package3 import module3
from package4 import module4
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this is a common problem for me, and the rule in isort itself does not work very well.
I suggest to add 'lines-before-imports' rule for [tool.ruff.isort], like rule 'lines-after-imports'. This rule expected to format all files for similar count of blank lines between docstring and imports.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that this would be useful and would also pair well with the existing <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort-lines-after-imports"><code>lines-after-imports</code></a> config.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In addition, to avoid a possible bug in this rule. After docstring comments may be placed, for example:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Docstring.&quot;&quot;&quot;
# ruff: noqa: F403

from module import *
...
</code></pre>
<p>I think in this case the newlines between the docstring and imports should be placed after comments</p>
