<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm currently writing a CI pipeline in gitlab. I tried to make ruff generate reports in different format for sonarqube, gitlab, and grouped (for stdout). However, it seems like to do that I must call the <code>ruff check</code> command for every file format I want.</p>
<p>I think it would be beneficial to add the possibility to specify an array for output-format in the same way pytest-cov pluging works. For instance, in my case, I would do:</p>
<p><code>ruff check . --output-format=gitlab:report/ruff-gitlab.json --output-format=json:report/ruff.json --output-format=grouped</code>.</p>

<p>This has come up before in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2388 Your ask goes slightly beyond in that you want many output formats and not just two. I'll merge this issue into the existing one. A new design should take both use cases into account.</p>

<p>Yeah, github search is not great... I only found it because I knew it existed and I had to filter by labels to find it</p>
