            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I have a question regarding this linting rule (imported from <code>flake8-bandit</code>).</p>
<p>I <strong>think</strong> I understand the problems with using <code>django.utils.safestring.mark_safe</code>. But know that <code>format_html</code> is being deprecated for being used without arguments¹, I struggle to find what would be the correct way to handle something as simple as creating a filter that performs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def myfilter(case, ...):
  if case == &quot;hello&quot;:
    return &quot;&lt;i&gt;Hello world!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
  elif case == &quot;bye&quot;:
    return &quot;&lt;b&gt;Bye world!&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
  else:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>(This is not an accurate filter API, but illustrates the purpose).</p>
<p>In this case I <strong>know</strong> the HTML is safe, but I don't understand how to create a safestring from it without getting the <code>DeprecationWarningError</code> from Django (<code>format_html</code>) or noqa'ing the S308 rule (<code>suspicious-mark-safe-usage</code>).</p>
<p>I fail to see how a string constant could introduce a XSS unless there is programmer negligence, in which case all bets are off. Having said this, I might be the negligent here! 😅</p>
<p>¹: And for a good reason. When coupled with f-strings interpolation happens before Django gets to escape inputs.</p>

<p>Ruff's implementation (which I think matches bandit's) isn't very sophisticated. It only searches for calls to <code>mark_safe</code> without performing any analysis of where the content might be coming from.</p>
<p>Allowing calls to <code>mark_safe</code> where the argument is a string literal without format or f-string placeholders does sound reasonable to me.</p>
<p>For now, the spirit of the rule is that you use <code>mark_safe</code> with an explicit noqa comment, acknowledging that I've thought about this. But that's obviously not as good as not requiring a noqa comment because it then doesn't catch if someone adds placeholders in the future.</p>
<p>So what I think should be accepted is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def myfilter(case, ...):
  if case == &quot;hello&quot;:
    return mark_safe(&quot;&lt;i&gt;Hello world!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;)
  elif case == &quot;bye&quot;:
    return mark_safe(&quot;&lt;b&gt;Bye world!&lt;/b&gt;&quot;)
  else:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>I opened https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16770 with the proposed change.</p>
<hr />
<p>Relatedly, it would be great if the <code>@mark_safe</code> decorator could be used for functions which can only return a string literal. For instance, following the example of the title, it would be nice if</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@mark_safe
def my_filter(case, ...):
  if case == &quot;hello&quot;:
    return &quot;&lt;i&gt;Hello world!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;
  else:
    return &quot;&lt;b&gt;Bye world!&lt;/b&gt;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>However, this would increase complexity. Whether the symbol is being used as function or as a decorator should be detected and branched accordingly. For the second case, the decorated function should be inspected and all return statements analyzed for &quot;string-literal'ness.</p>
