            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The documentation for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-call-around-sorted/#fix-safety"><code>unnecessary-call-around-sorted</code> (C413)</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as <code>reversed()</code> and <code>reverse=True</code> will yield different results in the event of custom sort keys or equality functions. Specifically, <code>reversed()</code> will reverse the order of the collection, while <code>sorted()</code> with <code>reverse=True</code> will perform a stable reverse sort, which will preserve the order of elements that compare as equal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That makes it sound like the fix is always marked as unsafe. In fact, it is marked as unsafe for <code>reversed</code> and safe for <code>list</code>.</p>
