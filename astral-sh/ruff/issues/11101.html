<p>Ruff format converts tabs in docstrings to 8 spaces, and there does not seem to be any way to disable this.</p>
<p>I think that ruff format shouldn&#x27;t touch docstrings at all by default, as they are data, not code, and at the very least this should be configurable. On another note, 8 spaces doesnt even match the configured indent-width.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh I see. Thank you for providing the context. So, just to be clear, you&#x27;d want the docstrings indentation to be left as is but retain the 4-space indent for other parts of the codebase.</p>
<p>I think @MichaReiser might have more context on this but this seems similar to  <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10396">astral-sh/ruff#10396</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Correct, we want to use standard 4-space (or whatever is configured) indentation for the codebase, but leave the indentation within docstrings alone :+1:</p>
<p>I did see and read through that issue, but as noted there <code>docstring-code-format</code> does not apply to non-code in docstrings (and is already disabled by default) and going through a very large codebase and adding <code># fmt: skip</code> to every docstring (and probably needing a semgrep rule to enforce this going forward?) isn&#x27;t really feasible</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The existing behavior is intentional to match how Python displays docstrings at runtime. Python&#x27;s <code>cleandoc</code> function changes all tabs to 8 spaces. Because of that, Ruff is forced to change tabs to 8 spaces. Using <code>indent-width</code> spaces instead would alter how Python interprets your comments at runtime.</p>
<p>That being said. We could do better, but that requires that Ruff understands the semantics of docstrings to know if some leading whitespace is indentation or alignment (e.g. for an ASCII art where spacing matters). You can read more about this in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8430">astral-sh/ruff#8430</a>#issuecomment-1934209625</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but there&#x27;s no option to disable docstring formatting at the moment and I unfortunately don&#x27;t have a good recommendation on how you can migrate your code base easily without having to review the changes manually. D206 catches tab indentations inside docstrings, but it doesn&#x27;t provide an autofix for it. You could try enabling the rule and change all tabs manually, I know that&#x27;s cumbersome.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We were able to replace the tabs in docstrings with spaces by hand to make them visually equivalent in editor, which has worked around the issue. I think the biggest thing to note here is that this behaviour doesn&#x27;t at all match black, which doesn&#x27;t touch the docstrings, and I wasn&#x27;t able to find any mention of this in the known deviations page.</p>
