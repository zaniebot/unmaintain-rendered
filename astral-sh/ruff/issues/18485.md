# F841 - not reporting unused variable with redeclaration

---

_Issue opened by @Morkunas on 2025-06-05 20:26_

### Summary

Hello. Thank you for making such a great tool.

Here is playground link to reproduce. https://play.ruff.rs/d4a7b67c-b01b-4f84-b921-549b472f3b1d
I'd expect to see another error (similar to unused b). Something like `Local variable `a` is assigned to but never used (F841) [Ln 3, Col 5]`.

Thank you

### Version

v0.11.12

Thanks for the report! The examples in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6704 are a bit more complex, but I believe that's where we are tracking the root cause of this. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14355 for a more similar example also linked back to #6704.
