            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you have thoughts about <code>ruff</code> eventually subsuming and replacing <code>black</code> or <a href="https://blue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">blue</a>?  I&#x27;m one of the maintainers of <code>blue</code> (because we have different opinions about a few things), and it&#x27;s been pretty difficult to both keep our monkey patching of black up to date, and rely on flake8&#x27;s <code>pyproject.toml</code> support across multiple different major versions of <code>flake8</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m thinking about alternatives, and this looks like a nice framework which could be a good starting point, so I&#x27;d like to get your thoughts about this project&#x27;s direction.  Would something like this be in or out of scope?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m really interested in this and definitely consider it to be within scope. Would love to chat about how it would work and how we&#x27;d push it forward :)</p>
<p>To-date, I&#x27;ve focused on making Ruff a Black-compatible linter and code transformation tool, but I&#x27;d like it to expand to an all-in-one code formatter (ideally, though, in a way that&#x27;s totally opt-in and incrementally adoptable, so users <em>could</em> continue to use Black as a formatter and Ruff as a linter). I think coupling a linter (with autofix capabilities) with an auto-formatter can make both tools more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>Philosophically, I&#x27;m comfortable enabling a higher level of configuration than is supported by <code>black</code>. Though it&#x27;s somewhat subjective, my general philosophy towards auto-formatted settings is that I don&#x27;t care what settings are used, as long as they&#x27;re consistent in a codebase and automatically applied. I think <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#basic-configuration">Prettier</a> has done a reasonable job of exposing a few configuration settings, like space width and quotation style. <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/">Rustfmt</a> goes much further, maybe further than is desired in this case. But, regardless, it&#x27;s critical to me that Ruff enforces a single formatting style; rather, than it&#x27;s capable of enforcing and applying formatting style.</p>
<p>The biggest fundamental blocker to starting on auto-formatting is that we <em>may</em> need a CST rather than an AST. (The lexer outputs comments, so if we don&#x27;t care about preserving whitespace in code, and view auto-formatting as a function of (AST + comments) =&gt; (source code),  we may not actually <em>need</em> a CST? I haven&#x27;t done enough research to understand the requirements here.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>More information than just AST + comments will likely be needed. Black preserves <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#empty-lines">empty lines</a> between statements (up to 1 or 2 depending on where), <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#parentheses">extra parentheses</a> with certain specific exceptions, the distinction between <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#strings">normal and raw strings</a> (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>r&quot;&quot;</code>, <code>R&quot;&quot;</code>), and a <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#the-magic-trailing-comma">magic trailing comma</a> that forces vertical layout.</p>
<p>But maybe an AST-like type with just that extra information would still be nicer than a CST?</p>
<p>There’s also <code># fmt: off</code> and <code># fmt: skip</code> to deal with somehow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I&#x27;d like to see what minimal set of extensions we&#x27;d need to the AST and parser to support Black-compatible formatting.  Part of me wonders if we could generate any extra metadata by taking the AST and augmenting it through a second pass over the token stream... For example, we could collect comments and empty lines. We could also tag strings as normal or raw (though that&#x27;s not captured in the token stream -- we&#x27;d have to look at the actual source), and so on.</p>
<p>(We could move to LibCST and generate code from a CST representation, but I&#x27;m really hesitant since the parser is so much slower and the representation is indeed more complex.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For more inspiration, there&#x27;s also <a href="https://github.com/asottile/tokenize-rt">tokenize-rt</a>, which implements round-tripping for Python&#x27;s <code>tokenize</code>. However, this would require that the entire autoformatter operate on tokens rather than an AST, which seems challenging.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Closing in favor of #1904. I&#x27;m going to start work on this.</p>
<p>(I wrote more in #1904, but I&#x27;d like the autoformatter to be a little more flexible than Black, which would in theory make it a suitable replacement for Blue too.)</p>
