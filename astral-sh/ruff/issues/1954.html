            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From my understanding the rules <a href="https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/misplaced-comparison-constant.html">C2201</a> (PLC2201 in ruff) and <a href="https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify#sim300">SIM300</a> are pretty much the same.
If that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;d suggest to drop one in favour of the other.</p>
<p>PLC2201 got introduced in #1023, SIM300 in #1539.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I agree with this. My gut reaction is to remove <code>PLC2201</code>. In the future, we should be able to map rules to multiple codes for compatibility purposes (see, e.g., #1941 which lays the foundation), although there are some questions to answer around how that works with <code>--select ALL</code>, <code># noqa</code> , etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d also prefer to keep SIM300.</p>
<p>Regarding #1941:
I hope the README stays as concise as it is currently? I really love the fact that all error codes are listed in a single spot and I can just <code>ctrl+f</code> to look for codes or phrases (like &quot;concatenation&quot; for example) and can almost expect to not find duplicates.</p>
<p>Maybe introduce a column like &quot;aliases&quot; in the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#supported-rules">suppurted rules</a> section and also <em>treat</em> these codes as aliases? Meaning <code>noqa</code> statements and config files may mention other codes but ruff tracks them down to its natively known and implemented error codes. Evaluating <code>--select ALL</code> would only look in implemented error codes, not in aliases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These rules are actually <em>slightly</em> different because the Pylint rule flags any comparison (e.g., <code>i &gt;= 5</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ll probably extend SIM300 to flag those cases too.</p>
