# Respect trailing comments when avoiding autofixes

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-30 12:37_

ruff 0.0.237 just changed this, which ends with a comment:
```
-            if 200 <= exitcode < 300:
-                exitcode = 0
-            else:
-                exitcode = 1  # dooh, sys.exit returns a short, mapping 400 to 144
+            exitcode = 0 if 200 <= exitcode < 300 else 1  # dooh, sys.exit returns a short, mapping 400 to 144 
```
