            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Would it make sense to have a rule to disallow using mutable containers with <code>@cached_property</code>?</p>
<p>I don't expect it to be able to detect all cases, but the builtin collections like <code>list</code>, <code>set</code> and <code>dict</code> should be easy to detect. It may also suggest a fix for list and set, respectively tuple and frozenset.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be a lint on the return type of the function decorated with <code>@cached_property</code>? That makes some sense to me and sounds related to our <code>mutable-*-default</code> rules, but it might be difficult to flag unless the function is annotated or with ty-style type inference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Correct! Probably a good starting point may be to disallow known mutable types like list, set and dict?</p>
<p>Another alternative (that AFAIK is what python dataclasses do) may be using &quot;is hashable&quot; as condition to disallow mutable default values for the fields, but I'm not really +1 on that and I don't know if ruff is able to do that check.</p>
