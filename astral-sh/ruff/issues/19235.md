# ANN201 NoReturn AutoFix overzealous on methods

---

_Issue opened by @Skylion007 on 2025-07-09 14:59_

### Summary

The RUFF ANN autofixes are a bit overzealous on adding NoReturn for methods, particularly for the cases of raise a NotImplementedError, a base class may implement a method with a different return type, and while yes NoReturn is valid for the base class, it may violate the substitution principal. This is really the only ANN autofix I have to be weary about, the rest are generally correct.
