# PIE790: leave comments?

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-26 21:54_

`PIE790` removed the `pass` statement and the comment.
```diff
 def handler_add(dn: str, new: Dict[str, List[bytes]]) -> None:
        """Handle creation of object."""
-       pass  # replace this
```

The comment is more like an instruction for implementors. Well, this has not high quality.
But maybe it would be good to just leave the comment??
