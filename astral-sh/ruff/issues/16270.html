<p>AFAICT the only way to suppress warnings about deprecated settings in my ruff config is to run with <code>ruff --quiet</code>. Unfortunately this suppresses other useful information, like how many errors were fixed/found etc. Is there any way to just turn off the deprecation warnings?</p>

<p>It&#x27;s somewhat intentional that the warnings can&#x27;t be suppressed because those settings will be removed eventually and your setup then fails and we rather here early if users can&#x27;t migrate to consider adding a replacement or undeprecating the setting.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not saying that we shouldn&#x27;t consider adding an option to suppress deprecation warnings, but I&#x27;d like to understand the use case better first.</p>

<p>I want to set <code>ruff.lint.ignore-init-module-imports = false</code>. AFAICT there is no replacement for this behavior. You can use <code>--preview</code> mode but even with that, there doesn&#x27;t currently seem to be a way to replicate the behavior of this setting (I commented elsewhere requesting this).</p>
<p>IMO unless <em>all</em> migrations from deprecated settings are very straightforward and explained directly in the warning message (like a simple rename), then there should be a way to suppress deprecation warnings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Deprecating a setting when the new behavior is still in preview seems like a mistake. We should probably undeprecated <code>ignore-init-module-imports</code> until the new preview behavior is stabilized</p>
