            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>AFAICT the only way to suppress warnings about deprecated settings in my ruff config is to run with <code>ruff --quiet</code>. Unfortunately this suppresses other useful information, like how many errors were fixed/found etc. Is there any way to just turn off the deprecation warnings?</p>

<p>It's somewhat intentional that the warnings can't be suppressed because those settings will be removed eventually and your setup then fails and we rather here early if users can't migrate to consider adding a replacement or undeprecating the setting.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that we shouldn't consider adding an option to suppress deprecation warnings, but I'd like to understand the use case better first.</p>

<p>I want to set <code>ruff.lint.ignore-init-module-imports = false</code>. AFAICT there is no replacement for this behavior. You can use <code>--preview</code> mode but even with that, there doesn't currently seem to be a way to replicate the behavior of this setting (I commented elsewhere requesting this).</p>
<p>IMO unless <em>all</em> migrations from deprecated settings are very straightforward and explained directly in the warning message (like a simple rename), then there should be a way to suppress deprecation warnings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Deprecating a setting when the new behavior is still in preview seems like a mistake. We should probably undeprecated <code>ignore-init-module-imports</code> until the new preview behavior is stabilized</p>
