            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a single command to check both linting and formatting?
If not, this would be a nice addition in my mind. Not that it's a big deal to do it in two steps, but our CI only passes if both are correct, so basically whenever we do either, we do both.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately not, but it's high on our wish list. We just need to find the time to implement it. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8232 to track the progress.</p>
