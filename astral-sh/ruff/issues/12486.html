            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,
I am not fully sure, so, it&#x27;s more about starting discussion, but have a feeling it might be good to have a rule for such cases.
There is a standard way to get default while getting key&#x27;s value from a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>mydict.get(&quot;key_name&quot;, default_value)
</code></pre>
<p>and it works fine in most of the cases, but it&#x27;s easy to forget that it will set default only if key is not present in dict. If key is present and have some empty value like <code>None</code> get() will not return default:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict = dict(key=None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(mydict.get(&quot;key&quot;, 0))
None
</code></pre>
<p>It&#x27;s correct and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get">documented</a> behaviour, but can confuse, sometimes correct way is:</p>
<pre><code>mydict.get(&quot;key&quot;) or 0
</code></pre>
<p>but probably linter can&#x27;t know which way correct in particular cases.</p>

<p>As I mentioned - probably there is no way to know it, but perhaps linter can always suggest <code>mydict.get(&quot;key&quot;) or 0</code> as it&#x27;s what most of people would expect. And for other cases, where developer want to set default only if key if not present, linter can suggest:</p>
<pre><code>if key_name is not in mydict:
    # use default
</code></pre>
<p>as it&#x27;s much more explicit.</p>
