            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m currently in the process of migrating from flake8 and isort to Ruff.</p>
<p>Something I&#x27;ve noticed is that when leaving out a built-in section from <code>section-order</code>, a warning appears and these sections are appended to the end of <code>section-order</code>. With isort imports that correspond to a built-in section that is missing from <code>section-order</code>, are assigned to the <code>third-party</code> section instead. I used this before to combine <code>standard-library</code> and <code>third-party</code> sections into a single one as I don&#x27;t see much value in separating these.</p>
<p>As a workaround I&#x27;ve added all packages from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_stdlib/src/sys.rs to <code>known-third-party</code> but it&#x27;s rather ugly.</p>
<p>It would be great if the behavior could match <code>isort</code> or could be configured to match it somehow.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ran into this as well, isort supports a <code>default_section</code> for this purpose if you want to be explicit:</p>
<pre><code>sections = &quot;FUTURE,THIRDPARTY,FIRSTPARTY,LOCALFOLDER&quot;
default_section = &quot;THIRDPARTY&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The end goal is that stdlib and third party are combined, as it&#x27;s common in the libraries that I work on that we are using bw-compat shims etc and it&#x27;s irritating to do treat things like <code>importlib_metadata</code> differently from <code>importlib.metadata</code>. Yes you could define them explicitly but ... the extended philosophy is that the stdlib and third party should be the same from the perspective of a user - that&#x27;s why we put all this effort into moving stuff into pypi instead of in the stdlib, they aren&#x27;t that different!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like something along similar lines was just merged <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8657">astral-sh/ruff#8657</a>. It would&#x27;ve been possible to implement <code>no_sections</code> from that PR with the equivalent proposal above:</p>
<pre><code>sections = &quot;THIRDPARTY&quot;
default_section = &quot;THIRDPARTY&quot;
</code></pre>
