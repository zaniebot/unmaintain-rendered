            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, would it be possible to port <a href="https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint">darglint</a> to ruff?</p>
<p>Darglint differs from pydocstyle in that it actually check the arguments in the docstring against the ground truth (the arg list in the function signature).</p>
<p>Darglint is effective, but it runs quite slow.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
