            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately... I think this is probably unresolvable. S101 is a security-related check (to avoid using <code>assert</code> statements as a means of preventing code execution, e.g., for authorization, since <code>assert</code> statements can be disabled at runtime via <code>-O</code>), so the bar to making exceptions needs to be quite high, and I don't see how we can know that an assertion is being used exclusively for type narrowing but <em>not</em> for such runtime-related enforcement.</p>
<p>I'd probably recommend just disabling <code>S101</code> or even the <code>S</code> rules altogether outside of security-sensitive contexts. If you're in a security-sensitive context, and <em>are</em> enforcing these rules, then I think it's probably <em>correct</em> to require case-by-case <code># noqa</code> disablement.</p>
