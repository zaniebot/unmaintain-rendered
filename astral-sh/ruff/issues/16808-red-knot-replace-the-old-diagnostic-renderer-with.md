# [red-knot] Replace the old diagnostic renderer with the new one.

---

_Issue opened by @BurntSushi on 2025-03-17 15:07_

This is a small task where we should "rug pull" the old renderer and replace it with the new one.

This lets us delete some code and actually starts to _use_ the new renderer introduced in #16711. This is meant to be a precursor to #16809.
