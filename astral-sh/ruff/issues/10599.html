            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently <code>unconventional-import-alias</code> (ICN001) will always flag imports without an <code>as</code> clause, even if the conventional alias is the same as the module name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-import-conventions.aliases]
&quot;django.conf.settings&quot; = &quot;settings&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">from django.conf import settings  # ICN001 `django.conf.settings` should be imported as `settings`
from django.conf import settings as settings  # No errors
</code></pre>
<p>Instead it should detect that the module name matches the conventional alias:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from django.conf import settings  # No errors
from django.conf import settings as settings  # No errors
</code></pre>
<p>(Though I realise that another rule may want to simply <code>from django.conf import settings as settings</code> to <code>from django.conf import settings</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an interesting case... <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unconventional-import-alias/"><code>ICN001</code></a> seems to be targeted at importing as a <em>different</em> name, not enforcing that <code>import x.y.z</code> should be styled <code>from x.y import z</code>. This is certainly a bug - it shouldn't be flagged - but it feels as though the issue trying to be solved is what I have described at #10608 (and why I came here in the first-place).</p>
<p>Semi-related is that, with the above configuration, <code>import django.conf.settings</code> would imply changing to <code>import django.conf.settings as settings</code> which would be in violation of <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/manual-from-import/"><code>PLR0402</code></a> and that is fixable to <code>from django.conf import settings</code> which raises the above issue.</p>
