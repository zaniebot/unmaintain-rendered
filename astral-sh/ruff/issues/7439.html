            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In most of my projects, I use isort, autoflake, pyupgrade, and black. Love that I can potentially replace the first 3 with ruff. Ideally, I would like to replace all of these, including black, with just ruff.</p>
<p>Wondering if in the future ruff will take up (more?) code formatting work or leave that to another tool like black?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://notes.crmarsh.com/python-tooling-could-be-much-much-faster">this post</a> the second hypothesis is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An integrated toolchain can tap into efficiencies that aren’t available to a disparate set of tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many times, in your pre-commit hooks, do you read your source code from disk, parse it, and traverse the parse tree?</p>
<p>An integrated toolchain could read every file exactly once, generate the AST exactly once, and leverage that representation throughout.</p>
<p>This is one of Ruff’s goals: generate all violations in a single pass, and even autofix the low-hanging fruit without a noticeable performance penalty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is a comprehensive black-like formatter in scope for ruff someday? Or do you see ruff as strictly a linter?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is! In fact we quietly shipped an alpha of our code formatter earlier this week :) Check out the announcement here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1904#issuecomment-1716130700. Instructions for testing it out are available in the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_formatter/README.md">README</a>.</p>
