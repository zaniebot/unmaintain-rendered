            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is it possible to provide backwards compat with pylint plugins, for example?</p>
<p>I had written one, but I do find pylint to be very slow (not just my plugin :) ), so would be happy to migrate to faster option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff will almost certainly support plugins. I'm not certain when, but it's very important :)</p>
<p>I don't expect pylint (or Flake8) plugins to work out-of-the-box; instead, there'll be a separate plugin API to implement for Ruff specifically. I'm hoping that users will be able to write plugins in Rust <em>or</em> Python.</p>
<p>If your plugin is generic and/or OSS, I'm also happy to see if I can include those rules in Ruff directly, if it's helpful for you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you. Ours is very context-specific.</p>
<p>OK. Supporting Python would definitely make it more feasible for us to adopt. 👍🏻</p>
