            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13316 is merged, there are some follow-up work that needs to be done. The following is a list in the order of priority where the highest priority work is on the top:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Avoiding duplicate diagnostics. Considering <code>(a, b) = (1, 2)</code>, as the inference runs for each symbol, if there are any diagnostics that's raised during that part (like &quot;too many values to unpack&quot;), then there will be multiple diagnostics added to the builder one for each symbol. Refer https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13316#discussion_r1800219731</li>
<li>[x] Use the unpacking logic in other places where it's relevant like<ul>
<li>[x] <code>for</code> loops e.g., <code>for (x, y) in ((1, 2), (3, 4)): ...</code> (#15058)</li>
<li>[x] <code>with</code> statements e.g., <code>with (item1, item2) as (x, y): ...</code></li>
<li>[x] Comprehensions e.g., <code>[_ for (x, y) in [(1, 2), (3, 4)]]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[x] Additional diagnostics when the number of targets is not equal to the number of elements on the RHS (#15086)</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Regarding &quot;Use the unpacking logic in other places where it's relevant like&quot; task, I think the challenge here would be to implement the logic to &quot;combine&quot; union types into a single type. For example, in a <code>for</code> loop like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">for (x, y) in ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)): ...
</code></pre>
<p>The inferred type for the iterable would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">tuple[Literal[1], Literal[2]] | tuple[Literal[3], Literal[4]] | tuple[Literal[5], Literal[6]]
</code></pre>
<p>But, we should combine it to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">tuple[int, int]
# or
tuple[Literal[1, 3, 5], Literal[2, 4, 6]]
</code></pre>
<p>Or, another example where the types are &quot;mixed&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">for (x, y) in ((1, 2), (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)): ...
</code></pre>
<p>We should combine it to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">tuple[int | str, int | str]
# or
tuple[Literal[1, &quot;a&quot;], Literal[2, &quot;b&quot;]]
</code></pre>
<p>Another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">for (x, y) in ((1, 2), (&quot;a&quot;, 3)): ...
</code></pre>
<p>where,</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">tuple[int | str, int]
# or
tuple[Literal[1, &quot;a&quot;], Literal[2, 3]]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, my previous comment isn't exactly correct. We actually need to add support for union types when unpacking rather than combining the types.</p>
<p>For example, if the type is <code>tuple[int, str] | list[int]</code> and the target has two elements <code>(a, b)</code>, then the type of <code>a</code> will be a union of the first tuple type (<code>int</code>) and the iterable type of the list (<code>int</code>) which should be <code>int</code>. And, similarly the type of <code>b</code> would be a union of the second tuple type (<code>str</code>) and the iterable type of the list (<code>int</code>) which would be <code>int | str</code>.</p>
<p>cc @carljm as we talked about this in our 1:1 yesterday.</p>
