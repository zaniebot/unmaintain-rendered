            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's certainly a more noisy rule and it's unfortunate we can't provide an auto fix (because Ruff can't know what the desired behavior is). But I think it's fine to stabilize</p>
<p>Unless we want to add a heuristic for the auto fix. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>A string ending with <code>.</code> is probably a sentence -&gt; escape it</li>
<li>A string with a sequence of metacharacters (e.g. <code>.*</code> or <code>.+</code>) is probably a regex -&gt; make it raw. We can limit it to only support some specific patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first fix would have to be unsafe because it does change the program's semantics. The second one could be safe but I think it's still best to make user explicitly opt-in. We could document the heuristics in the rule and having a fix could reduce the churn for users.</p>
<p>I'd postpone the promotion to stable if the suggested fix does sound reasonable (CC: @AlexWaygood)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We discussed when implementing the rule originally whether it should have an autofix or not and concluded &quot;no&quot; because adding backslash escapes may often be unwelcome (users will often prefer to make it a raw string), but it would probably be hard for Ruff to determine whether a raw string or an escape would be preferred. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14966#issuecomment-2543194280</p>
<p>I also don't <em>love</em> the idea of adding so many heuristics to an autofix; I think it'll be harder for users to understand without reading the docs (and I doubt people go and read the docs until a rule goes and does something that they don't expect).</p>
<p>So I'd be inclined to leave the rule as it is and stabilise it. That said, I don't have a strong opinion; happy to defer to you and @MichaReiser if you think users would find an unsafe fix helpful here!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't feel strongly either and I agree that it can be confusing why the rule only suggests some fixes. However, considering how common the <em>sentence ending with a dot</em> is, providing a fix at least for that still seems useful to me.</p>

<p>I would keep it simple and always suggest <code>re.escape</code> because it works for all characters and the entire string was probably not meant to be a regex. However, I can see how this comes down to personal preferences.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This rule mixes the concepts of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#matching-characters">regex metacharacters</a> (<code>.</code> <code>^</code> <code>$</code> <code>*</code> <code>+</code> <code>?</code> <code>{</code> <code>}</code> <code>[</code> <code>]</code> <code>\</code> <code>|</code> <code>(</code> <code>)</code>) and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences">escape sequences</a> (<code>\</code>). I find this confusing.</p>
<p>In the documentation, example <code>match=&quot;A full sentence.&quot;</code> should be changed to <code>(&quot;A full sentence\\.&quot;)</code> in most cases, shouldn't it? I don't see how switching to a raw string helps in any way.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;A full sentence.&quot;
'A full sentence.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; r&quot;A full sentence.&quot;
'A full sentence.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;A full sentence\\.&quot;
'A full sentence\\.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.escape(&quot;A full sentence.&quot;)
'A\\ full\\ sentence\\.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I remember correctly, the raw string was one of our heuristics for something intentionally being a regex. So you're right that it doesn't change the result, but we were using it as a sign of intent. That could be made more clear in the documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Exactly, I understand it's a convention and a sign of intent. But it's probably a bad idea to add a (safe) fix for a mere sign of intent, especially if the fix changes <code>&quot;A full sentence.&quot;</code> into <code>r&quot;A full sentence.&quot;</code>, which is usually not the intent, instead of <code>re.escape(&quot;A full sentence.&quot;)</code>.</p>
