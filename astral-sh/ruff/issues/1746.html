<p>I checked and W503 do exist: https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html</p>
<p>Is it normal ? is it missing ? can I safely remove this ignore statement if it's not taken into account ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for trying Ruff!</p>
<p>The main limitation when comparing Ruff to Flake8 is that Ruff currently doesn't implement the Flake8 rules that are made obsolete by Black (see <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#how-does-ruff-compare-to-flake8">FAQ</a>). So that includes several of the pycodestyle rules that start with <code>E</code> and <code>W</code>, including <code>W503</code>. (That actually aligns with the comment you have above: <code># line break before binary operator | Black takes care of it</code>.)</p>
<p>So, yes, if you're using Black, it should be totally fine to ignore.</p>
