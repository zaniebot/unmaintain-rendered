            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Update to FAQ.md at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/docs/faq.md is merited as a result of this change I think.</p>
<p>Specifically, the following bullet can be removed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on your project structure, Ruff and isort can differ in their detection of first-party code. (This is often solved by modifying the src property, e.g., to src = [&quot;src&quot;], if your code is nested in a src directory.)</p>
