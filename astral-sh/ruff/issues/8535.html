            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a wild idea, but since Ruff is still in its <code>0.X</code> semver phase, maybe not a bad idea after all.</p>
<p>Should <code>ruff check</code> be renamed to <code>ruff lint</code>?</p>
<p>Since <code>ruff format</code> was introduced, the term <code>check</code> is harder to to understand what it does. In addition the website goes about mentioning the terms <em>format</em> and <em>lint</em>. As evident by this:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/assets/30827238/8c83543b-c124-4e18-9d56-4816bb5c6c77" alt="image" /></p>
<p>It adds more &quot;confusion&quot; since you have <code>ruff format --check</code>. One could think it does both the format and the normal <code>ruff check</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for raising.</p>
<p>We're interested in making <code>ruff check</code> a unified command that checks for both lint and format errors #8232. We might want to <em>separately</em> introduce a <code>ruff lint</code> command though — this seems as good a place as any for discussion on that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Like <code>ruff format</code> that applies modifications by default, I suggest <code>ruff lint</code> do the same.
The current behavior of <code>--fix</code> would be default for <code>ruff lint</code> and can be disable by <code>--check</code>. (like <code>ruff format</code> we have today)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I disagree that a <code>ruff lint</code> command should fix code by default. Ruff (afaik) is the only Python linter with the capability to fix issues, so may be confusing for people switching from something else. Linters in other languages, such as Cargo, tend not to fix by default either, so I don't believe there's a precedent for this. Additionally, the linter fixes aren't 100% safe to apply (see #8556 as an example).</p>
<p>Whether a unified <code>ruff check</code> should run something equivalent to <code>ruff lint --fix &amp;&amp; ruff format</code> is another question though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Linters I am aware of has a <code>--fix</code> for linting faults. Or e.g. Prettier (a formatter only) has <code>--write</code>. I think code transformations (which linters are) should not do fixes by default as @parafoxia mentions, due to the dangers of it. When users specifically has to add a <code>--fix</code>, they can check the changes made and are aware they are being made.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree, a <code>ruff lint</code> should identify, but not fix issues by default. There are times when the linter does not have enough context to determine if a change is appropriate and can potentially introduce a bug. In regard to formatting, I think <code>ruff format</code> is explicit in that I'm asking it to format my code and should do so by default.  I like the idea of <code>ruff check</code> identifying both lint and format, but not fixing and I kinda find <code>--fix</code> to be awkward. I would probably prefer a <code>ruff fix</code> command, but it's a balance between number of commands and options per command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My thoughts:
<code>ruff lint</code>: only lints by default
<code>ruff format</code>: formats by default
<code>ruff check</code>: shorthand for <code>ruff lint &amp;&amp; ruff format --check</code>
<code>ruff fix</code>: shorthand for <code>ruff lint --fix &amp;&amp; ruff format</code></p>
