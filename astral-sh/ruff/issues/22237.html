            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This feature request is for ruff format to place blank line below the &quot;class&quot; keyword if there is no class docstring, either via a new configuration option or as the default behavior.</p>
<p>I'm aware that ruff format aims to stay close to black and have as little configuration as possible. However, after using ruff format for a couple of weeks I got around to all formatting decisions except for this one. I'd argue that code is significantly less readable with the current behavior of removing the blank line.</p>
<p>As example, take this real world code example of a unit test for a build backend, as processed by ruff format. In this example, the class name and first method name become difficult to see at a quick glance, because they are &quot;merged&quot; together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python3">class TestInstall:
    @pytest.mark.parametrize('project', PROJECTS)
    def test_sync_editable(self, project):
        path = ROOT / project.path
        system = utils.System(cwd=path)
        system('rm -rf .venv')
        system('uv sync --editable')
        code = f'import {project.name}; print({project.name}.foo())'
        assert system(f'uv run python -c &quot;{code}&quot;') == '42\n'

    @pytest.mark.parametrize('project', PROJECTS)
    def test_sync_no_editable(self, project):
        path = ROOT / project.path
        system = utils.System(cwd=path)
        system('rm -rf .venv')
        system('uv sync --no-editable')
        code = f'import {project.name}; print({project.name}.foo())'
        assert system(f'uv run python -c &quot;{code}&quot;') == '42\n'

    @pytest.mark.parametrize('project', PROJECTS)
    def test_build_wheel(self, tmpdir, project):
        packages = []
        for folder in [project.path, *(project.deps or [])]:
            path = ROOT / folder
            system = utils.System(cwd=path)
            system('rm -rf .venv')
            system('rm -rf dist')
            system('uv sync')
            system('uv build')
            wheels = list((path / 'dist').glob('*.whl'))
            assert len(wheels) == 1, wheels
            packages += [str(x) for x in wheels]
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>Note that when there is a class docstring, black and ruff format will already insert a blank line below the docstring, clearly separating the class name from the first method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python3">class TestInstall:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Test installation&quot;&quot;&quot;

    @pytest.mark.parametrize('project', PROJECTS)
    def test_sync_editable(self, project):
        path = ROOT / project.path
        system = utils.System(cwd=path)
        system('rm -rf .venv')
        system('uv sync --editable')
        code = f'import {project.name}; print({project.name}.foo())'
        assert system(f'uv run python -c &quot;{code}&quot;') == '42\n'
</code></pre>
<p>We found ourselves inserting useless class docstrings across the code base to satisfy the formatter, which adds overhead when reading and modifying the code.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case that the first method of the class is <code>__init__()</code>, having it visually connected to the class name may be less of a concern, so the current behaviors works there too.</p>
<p>I suspect that when the formatting decision was made in black, the creators mostly had the above two common cases in mind. I would argue that explicitly placing a blank line below a &quot;class&quot; keyword that has no docstring solves a visual clarity issue in the general case, and is thus a worthwhile deviation from black (whether configurable or not).</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the feedback and the great write-up! I think this is a duplicate of #21380, which also links to some of the previous discussion.</p>
<p>We recently added an exception for function headers in #21110 and are open to doing the same for classes, but we're still collecting feedback (such as this issue!) to help us decide.</p>
