@pytest.fixture
def tool_manager():
    return ToolManager()
    
def test_create_tool(tool_manager):
    do_something()  
```

I believe in cases like this ANN001 should not be fired because we still don't have a fixture type annotation. what then should be the best way to deal with this, please?

Considering this example, I think the type of `tool_manager` would just be whatever the `tool_manager` fixture is returning which is `ToolManager`. So, in general you can provide the return type of the fixture as the argument type.
