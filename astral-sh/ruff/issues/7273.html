Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Considering the following contents of <code>issue.py</code> (no other files, no <code>pyproject.toml</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">mutables = ([0, 1, 2], [10, 11, 12])
for mutable in mutables:
    mutable += [100]
</code></pre>
<p>PLW2901 is detected:</p>
<pre><code>ruff check --select PLW2901 --isolated issue.py
issue.py:3:5: PLW2901 `for` loop variable `mutable` overwritten by assignment target
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the augmented assignment is performed in-place and is equivalent to calling <code>extend</code> (which does not trigger PLW2901).</p>
<pre><code>ruff --version
ruff 0.0.287
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I think there are reasonable arguments both ways but I'm going to opt to leave this as-is for now. Pylint has the same behavior (<code>W2901: Redefining 'mutable' from loop (line 2) (redefined-loop-name)</code>), and the variable <em>is</em> being reassigned here. This strikes me as the rule working as-intended.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for your quick response. I find <code>redefined-loop-name</code> generally useful. Considering that Ruff behavior will stay the same, do you have any thoughts on dealing with similar code? I can think of using the method form of in-place augmented assignment, but verbosity is an issue, e.g., <code>set.symmetric_difference_update</code> vs. <code>^=</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My honest recommendation would be to use the in-place update methods. Even in the example above, I find the augmented assignment a bit less clear, since, e.g., <em>this</em> doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">mutables = ([0, 1, 2], [10, 11, 12])
for mutable in mutables:
    mutable = mutable + [100]
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, it's relying on the fact that Python uses in-place operations for data types that support it.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could assign <code>mutable</code> to a temporary variable to avoid the lint error, or just use a <code>noqa</code> in these cases.</p>
