Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p><code>PLR0124</code> does usually indicate a bug, but one place where it's used in a lot of codebases is to check whether a float value is NaN as it will fail this test only if it's a NaN. As such, it would be good to not flag these comparisons if they are float or add a setting to ignore them for floats.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you expand a bit as I'm unable to follow? Do you mean that if <code>foo</code> is <code>float('nan')</code> then <code>foo == foo</code> will give <code>False</code> when it's a NaN and that's what the code is intended to check?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Although I suppose <code>math.isnan</code> might be a more idiomatic way to check it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I don't think using <code>foo == foo</code> to detect NaN is something we want to encourage — we could add a case to <code>PLR0124</code> that suggests <code>math.isnan</code> or a new rule for that?</p>
