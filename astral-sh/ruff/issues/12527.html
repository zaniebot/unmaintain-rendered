            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I use neovim and was trying to setup ruff as a formatter. I was not able to get it to work, as I thought that simply using <code>ruff</code> as my formatter would be enough, when in fact I had to use <code>ruff_format</code>.</p>

<p>In the <code>mason</code> package manager, it does not show that <code>ruff_format</code> is an available executable, just <code>ruff</code>.
The only reason I was able to get this to work is because I found other people&#x27;s configs online and tried copying it.</p>

<p>For new users who want to set formatting up maybe it would be beneficial to show <code>ruff_format</code> as the binary for the formatter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>ruff_format</code> is an identifier which comes from <code>conform.nvim</code> while <code>mason.nvim</code> (correctly) reports that we provide the <code>ruff</code> binary. The <code>ruff_format</code> is just an identifier to indicate that it&#x27;ll run the <code>ruff format</code> command and is not an actual executable. You might want to refer to the docs in <code>conform.nvim</code> / <code>mason.nvim</code>.</p>
