            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi folks, apologies if perhaps this would have been better off a Discussion object, but I reckon if code changes get involved it&#x27;s better to have an Issue to quote.</p>
<p>We at <a href="https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool">ESMValTool</a> are looking at moving from Prospector to Ruff, but we are missing one integration, namely Ruff in Codacy. I have started a thread with Codacy asking them if they are willing to create the bridge (see <a href="https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed/issues/59">codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed#59</a> ) but by the looks of it, they have a self-serve system whereby one builds their own integration package (a Docker container, in essence). My colleague @bouweandela and myself are rather keen to move away from Prospector rather sooner than later, so we&#x27;d be willing to get all the bits in place so we do that, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>would you be willing to create a <code>codacy-ruff</code> package? See example the <a href="https://github.com/codacy/codacy-prospector">codacy-prospector</a> one - looks pretty straightforward to me</li>
<li>alternatively, would you be OK with us building and deploying such a package?</li>
</ul>
<p>Very many thanks in advance, and many thanks for creating this tool! :beer:</p>

<p>That would be a great outcome! We don&#x27;t have the relevant codacy knowledge and are very busy with improving ruff&#x27;s semantic model. You can ping me if you have ruff specific questions. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know anything about codacy.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser cheers for the heads up, so your team is OK with us doing that, or you still need to run it by them? - I&#x27;ll wait, there&#x27;s no rush at our end :beer:</p>

<p>Great! Cheers, mate :beer: I&#x27;ll discuss with me colleagues, and if we agree on us building one, then I&#x27;ll get cracking with it :+1:</p>
