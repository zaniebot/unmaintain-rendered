<p>And this is the only example I can find in which a description is included. All other 125 similar sections follow this format, plain and uninformative:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown">## Options
- `foo.option1`
- `bar.option2`
</code></pre>
<p>The lack of proper links make such options non-interactable: The user can't just jump straight to the docs but forced to search all on their own. Leaving the IDE while working is uncomfortable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Personally, I have a special use case as a plugin developer: resolving these links in-place. In other words, the rule's documentation can be directly and immediately replaced with the option's documentation, right inside the IDE, no browser involved.</p>
<p>PyCharm allows plugins to determine what to do on link clicks, and I want to take advantage of that. I'm already doing this for the options' documentation (e.g., <code>extend-select</code>, which mentions <code>select</code>). Currently, I'm forced to do the error-prone task of parsing Markdown myself; this shouldn't be necessary.</p>
