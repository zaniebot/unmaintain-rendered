            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some of our docstrings contain raw HTTP examples:</p>
<pre><code>GET /looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong/uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurl?arg=foooooooooooo HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
</code></pre>
<p><code>pylint</code> provides this via <code>--ignore-long-lines</code> (https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#ignore-long-lines):</p>
<blockquote>
---ignore-long-lines

<p>Regexp for a line that is allowed to be longer than the limit.</p>
<p>Default: ^\s*(# )?&lt;?https?://\S+&gt;?$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is already addressed to a degree in #3051 for URLs. Unfortunately this does not cover other valid cases. Those cases are often very domain-specific so it would be nice to have that as a configuration option.</p>
<p>Another example that we run into in our team is docstring examples including SNMP OID paths. They can be very long as well and do not match a URL regex. An example:</p>
<pre><code>1.3.6.1.4.1.6527.3.1.2.16.27.1.1.4.14.79.76.79.51.77.98.95.97.114.98.105.116.101.114
</code></pre>
<p>Having a list of regexes would cover many of such cases. I would suggest having a <em>list</em> of regexes instead of a single value. This makes the configuration more readable if you have several patterns.</p>
