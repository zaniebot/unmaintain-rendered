<p>Remove all rules from S401 to S415 (suspicious imports) and create a single S400 rule that says</p>
<p><code>&quot;Possibly insecure import {import_name}: {reason}&quot;</code></p>
<p>Allow the imports being configured via command line</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint.flake8_bandit]
suspicious_import = {&quot;marshal&quot; = &quot;Deserialization is possibly dangerous&quot;}

suspicious_import_include = {foobar = &quot;I dont like this one&quot;}

suspicious_import_exclude = [
  subprocess
]
</code></pre>
<p>To be honest, I just dont think these rules should exist since we have the TID253 configurable via <code>banned-module-level-imports</code>.</p>
<p>My issue is with these rules existing and not being in a good range that they can be ignored in bulk. I don&#x27;t know if on next version we will get S416 or S420 (another range -- maybe I need to ignore the whole S4?) with more of these &quot;unsafe&quot; modules. In theory there could be thousands of unsafe modules and having multiple rules is just bad IMO.</p>
