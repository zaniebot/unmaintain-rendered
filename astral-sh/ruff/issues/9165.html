Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Pip installed Version: 0.1.7
VS Code extension version: v2023.56.0</p>
<p>When I am saving some code in VS Code I get the title error popping up.  In the &quot;Problems&quot; tab in VS Code, it looks like Ruff is scanning files in my <code>/usr/lib/python3.11/logging</code> directory.  I am still new to using Ruff.  Please let me know if you need further information to debug this issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@james-berkheimer - It looks like the issue here may be that you have a syntax error in <code>infrastructure.py</code>. But we should probably avoid raising the error popup on syntax errors, since they're common in the course of editing the file. Will fix!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I usually will do a quick save when editing to see if it auto-formats for me.  But I got that popup.  What prompted me to create the issue was that it seems to be looking into my system python install.  Is that anything to be concerned with?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's not a problem, just a little annoying that if you open those files, Ruff will show errors even though they're outside of your &quot;control&quot;.</p>
<p>One solution -- explicitly ignore that directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  &quot;ruff.lint.args&quot;: [&quot;--extend-exclude&quot;, &quot;usr/lib&quot;]
}
</code></pre>
