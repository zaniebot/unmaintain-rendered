# Combine CLI format and isort

---

_Issue opened by @Joe-Zer0 on 2023-10-20 04:05_

Apologies if I just missed this in the documentation.  I would like to propose combining the formatting and import formatting capabilities into a single CLI command.  The motivation for this request is so that I may use the ruff formatter with the helix editor.

From what I understand I currently must run `ruff --select I --fix <file>` then `ruff format --line-length 120 --quiet` to format both the file and the imports.  If these were combined into a single command, I could easily hook this into the helix editor.  In an ideal world there would also be a way to specify `quote-style = "single"` via the command to match personal preference.  Thanks!

We plan to enable a unified workflow to run the linter and formatter in a single command, but we're still working out the design. @MichaReiser, do you know if there's an existing issue we could merge this into?

I was about to report this as a bug.  To me the "isort" action should be done when I use the format command.

We've explicitly chosen not to include import sorting in formatting because it can change the semantics of your code at runtime which the formatter should _never_ do.

Regardless, per #8232 we intend to introduce a unified command that should suffice for this use-case. We'll track this there for book-keeping.
