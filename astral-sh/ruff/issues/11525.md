# new rule: useless `r` string

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2024-05-24 05:56_

we have [`F541`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/f-string-missing-placeholders/) which reports useless `f` strings, so it would be nice if there was a rule for `r` strings as well:
```py
foo = r"foo" # error: r prefix is not necessary

def bar():
    r"""bar""" # error: r prefix is not necessary
```
