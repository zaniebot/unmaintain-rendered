            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found that the <code>RET505</code> and <code>RET506</code> do not raise an error when there is a <code>return</code> or <code>raise</code> inside a <code>try/except</code> block.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_ret505():
    try:
        print(&quot;test&quot;)
    except Exception:
        return
    else:  # Shouldn't this raise a RET505 error ?
        return &quot;test&quot;

def test_ret506():
    try:
        print(&quot;test&quot;)
    except Exception:
        raise
    else:  # Shouldn't this raise a RET506 error ?
        return &quot;test&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks and keep up the great work on this wonderful tool !</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good point. Yes, I think it should be raised here atleast for your first example of <code>RET505</code>. I guess you meant <code>raise</code> on the last line in <code>test_ret506</code> function? If so, then yes for that as well.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that there isn't a <code>finally</code> block here because then the execution order will be different. It's <code>try</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>finally</code> and removing <code>else</code> would alter the order.</p>

<p>Whether it be a <code>return</code> or a <code>raise</code> in the <code>else</code> for both case it shouldn't matter, right ? In both case it won't be reached because of the <code>raise</code> / <code>return</code> in the <code>except</code> clause.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep, it's all about the <code>except</code> body. I think you should've commented the <code>else:</code> line since that's the violating one 👍 (which could be why Dhruv thought the <code>raise</code>/<code>return</code> in the <code>else</code> body matters)</p>

<p>Indeed, edited it as you said for better clarity.</p>
