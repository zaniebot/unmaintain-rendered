            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like this issue, I am a new her btw [I&#x27;m also new to OSC],
But I did a little research and its variable , so I am not sure its safe to change based off only on aesthetics .
Basically at smaller and mid sized dict updates its ok to just assign but on larger updates creating a secondary dict as <code>update</code> does , would greatly increase the bulk update speed.</p>
<p>While its arguable , since the performance effects is variable maybe it should be optional.</p>

<p>Even for small dictionaries, direct assignment is indeed quite a bit faster according to a very naive benchmark:</p>
<pre><code>~/dev % python -m timeit -s &quot;d = {}&quot; &quot;d.update({&#x27;key&#x27;: &#x27;value&#x27;})&quot;            
5000000 loops, best of 5: 61.2 nsec per loop
~/dev % python -m timeit -s &quot;d = {}&quot; &quot;d[&#x27;key&#x27;] = &#x27;value&#x27;&quot;        
20000000 loops, best of 5: 12.2 nsec per loop
</code></pre>
<p>And this is what you&#x27;d expect, since the bytecode created for direct assignment is a lot simpler:</p>

<p>But as I said, this benchmark is very naive:</p>
<ul>
<li>the keys and values being stored in the dictionary are all constants</li>
<li>there&#x27;s only a single item in the dictionary being passed to <code>.update()</code> when in most real-world uses of <code>dict.update</code> you&#x27;d generally pass in a dictionary that has multiple items.</li>
</ul>
<p>@spaceby would your proposed rule only apply to dictionaries with a single item being passed to <code>.update</code>? Or do you also think it should suggest this?</p>
<pre><code>-d.update({
-    &quot;x&quot;: 1,
-    &quot;y&quot;: 2,
-    &quot;z&quot;: 3,
-})
+d[&quot;x&quot;] = 1
+d[&quot;y&quot;] = 2
+d[&quot;z&quot;] = 3

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the update call with multiple entries, maybe the <code>|=</code> operator would be an idea? It seems to be slightly faster :thinking:</p>
<pre><code>❯ python -m timeit -s &quot;d = {}&quot; &quot;d |= {&#x27;x&#x27;: 1,&#x27;y&#x27;: 2,&#x27;z&#x27;: 3}&quot;

2000000 loops, best of 5: 179 nsec per loop
</code></pre>
<p>And of course with single items, <code>|=</code> should also be replaced with directly assigning the value to the key.</p>

<p>I think the performance difference is significant enough that it could easily make a difference in a hot loop somewhere... <em>but</em> I agree that the motivation is primarily stylistic here, and that this is the kind of performance difference that could easily change as performance improvements are made to CPython itself. So I agree that this should be classified as a stylistic rule.</p>

<p>Yes, this makes sense to me; all of these are essentially different manifestations of the same antipattern.</p>
<p>At this point I think I&#x27;ve seen enough support for this that I&#x27;d be happy to accept a PR implementing this rule (in the <code>RUF</code> category, I suppose, unless there have been any other linters to already implement this?).</p>
