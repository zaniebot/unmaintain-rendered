            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this rule would cover this or not: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/dunder-function-name/</p>
<p>I made a dunder blunder today, with an extra <code>_</code>. Despite <code>ruff</code>, <code>pyright</code>, and <code>pytest</code>, nothing caught my error. It was for a <code>def __lt__()</code>-type function.</p>
<p>This seems <em>fairly</em> trivial, at first glance, at least compared to other rules. Those extra underscores can really blend in with eachother.</p>
<p>If the dunder-function-name does cover it, maybe it could be documented? Or maybe two separate rules would be ideal?</p>
<p>Anyway, Ruff is an awesome project. I don't know if there's an existing Python tool that does this check.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an interesting one. I've also found mistakes like <code>__lte__()</code> instead of the correct <code>__le__()</code>, etc. which would be good to catch. This might be easily done by having a set of known dunders and comparing. Should be easy enough to do a &quot;Did you mean X?&quot; too.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Python's enum has some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#supported-dunder-names">custom dunder methods</a> and it may also be good to extend support for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#supported-sunder-names">custom sunder methods</a> too? (I've mistakenly used <code>def __missing__(...):</code> instead of <code>def _missing_(...):</code> before.)</p>

<p>Probably! Sunder method mistakes would be good to catch as well.</p>
