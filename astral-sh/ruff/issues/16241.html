            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>In some cases, an operation can fail because some sub-operation failed, and this can be somewhat arbitrarily recursive (though usually not too deep). For example, we tried to call a union, which failed because one element of the union was not callable, because it is an instance of a type which has a <code>__call__</code> method which may not be bound.</p>
<p>Currently we have to choose between either giving the details of the &quot;inner&quot; failure or giving useful &quot;outer&quot; context. In some of these cases, we may want to use &quot;sub-diagnostics&quot; where we can give an outer failure (e.g. with the full union type) as well as &quot;inner&quot; details on the root cause. Both pyright and mypy do this to some extent.</p>
<p>We'll need to figure out some principles around when and where to do this, how we can render it, and at what level of nesting we need to cut it off.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16161#discussion_r1960499406 for some more detailed discussion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In terms of <em>design</em>, I think we have a pretty good idea of how to approach this at this point. I've added the data model in #16504.</p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the next step here will be to actually try and use the sub-diagnostic API and see where it breaks. But I think the initial design work is probably done here?</p>
