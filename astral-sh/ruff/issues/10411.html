Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi,
<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-xfail-ref">pytest.mark.xfail</a> has an optional strict argument that defaults to False. When strict is False, if an xfailed test unexpectedly passes, the test suite as a whole will not fail, but when strict is True, an unexpectedly passing test will be marked as a failure.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a ruff rule that require the strict argument to be passed (with either value), so when writing tests with xfail it is explicit if passing cases are allowed or not.</p>
<p>Thanks
Rohan</p>

<p>FWIW I discovered that there is a tool that can check this kind of configuration - see https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides/repo-review/. Each check has a specific code associated with it - xfail_strict is PP305, mentioned here https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/guides/pytest/#configuring-pytest</p>
