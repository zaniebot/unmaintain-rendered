            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We previously had a scheme where functions that had a <code>_ty</code> suffix would return a <code>Type&lt;'db&gt;</code>. This has been broken in a few places, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bindings_ty</code> which returns a <code>Symbol&lt;'db&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>declaration_ty</code> which returns a <code>TypeAndQualifiers&lt;'db&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We should probably clean this up, i.e. either come up with new suffixes, with entirely new function names, or decide that we don't want to do anything about it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could we maybe just remove the suffixes? I'm not sure they add much in a Rust codebase, since all functions have return-type annotations anyway.</p>
<p>I also think it's non-obvious to newcomers to the codebase that <code>ty</code> means &quot;type&quot;. It took me a while to get used to it and I still don't really love the use of the abbreviation everywhere. (In some cases it's obviously necessary since <code>type</code> is a reserved keyword.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do think the suffixes are useful here or we have to come up with new names entirely. E.g. <code>bindings</code> suggests that it returns an iterator, <code>bindings_ty</code> makes it clear it doesn't.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I opened a https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15618 as a proposal on how to rename <code>bindings_ty</code> and <code>declarations_ty</code>, the two functions for which the inconsistency is most apparent.</p>

<p>I opened another draft which renames all <code>*_ty</code> functions to <code>*_type</code>, just to see how it looks like: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15617. This builds on top of #15618. I personally don't have a preference in either direction. If we rename those suffixes from <code>_ty</code> to <code>_type</code>, we should consider doing something similar for variables as well?</p>
