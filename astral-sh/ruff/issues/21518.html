            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>According to the document,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bare except catches BaseException which includes KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit, Exception, and others. Catching &gt; BaseException can make it hard to interrupt the program (e.g., with Ctrl-C) and can disguise other problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bare except is equal with catching BaseException explicitly.
Therefore we should report the following snippets as well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    pass
except BaseException:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Does it make sense?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blind-except/">blind-except (BLE001)</a> is meant to catch this case.  We should probably cross-link between the two rules at least.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>BLE001 also catches the <code>except Exception:</code> which conflicts with the E722's suggestion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you actually need to catch an unknown error, use Exception which will catch regular program errors but not important system
exceptions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-py">def run_a_function(some_other_fn):

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Depends on the intention for the rule: is a bare <code>except</code> bad because <code>BaseException</code> is bad? Or is it because most devs not knowledgeable about Python's exception internals won't even know that <code>except</code> isn't <code>except Exception</code> ? And avoiding bare excepts helps clarify intent whilst avoiding accidentally eating up Keyboard interrupts.</p>
<p>If you write <code>except BaseException</code>, you are being explicit about your intentions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>which conflicts with the E722's suggestion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't see them conflicting. One helps you clarify intent, the other then tells you you may be hiding away unexpected errors (rather than logging or rethrowing)</p>

<p>I mean they can't use together. E722 allow <strong>Exception</strong>, but BLE001 don't. So I can't combine them to a point where <strong>BaseException</strong> and <strong>bare expect</strong> is not allowed but <strong>Exception</strong> is allowed.</p>
<p>And since E772's intention is described as below</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bare except catches BaseException which includes KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit, Exception, and others. Catching BaseException can make it hard to interrupt the program (e.g., with Ctrl-C) and can disguise other problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, in E772, <strong>BaseException</strong> is eqaul to <strong>bare except</strong> and should be treat equally. If you think they have slight difference, then it's fine to stay still. Though I can't get it through reading the docs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So what's the intention actually? Since its name is <strong>bare-except</strong>, I prefer the latter. But without your explanation, I would have stuck with the former.</p>
