            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ruff 0.0.240 issues <code>INP001</code> for some commonly found top level files, such as</p>
<ul>
<li><code>setup.py</code> (&quot;legacy&quot; setuptools etc)</li>
<li><code>manage.py</code> (Django)</li>
<li><code>noxfile.py</code> (Nox)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think these warrant adding a top level <code>__init__.py</code>, and suggest ignoring them as far as <code>INP001</code> is concerned. (In fact, I'm not sure if this should be actually done for the top level dir in any case no matter what's in it, but I admit I haven't thought much about it at all and can't tell offhand.)</p>
<p>This would be a deviation from upstream behavior, but a sensible one in my opinion. Upstream documentation contains a <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-no-pep420/#inp001-file-is-part-of-an-implicit-namespace-package-add-__init__py">recipe mentioning <code>manage.py</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>noxfile.py</code> and <code>setup.py</code> could be outside of the <code>src</code> directory, though. Not sure about <code>manage.py</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right, those two are actually very likely always in the top level dir, no matter what <code>src</code> is set to. I believe the same applies to <code>manage.py</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps ignore everything in the top level dir <em>and</em> all directly in a <code>src</code> one, irrespective of the file names?</p>

<p>Ah, now that makes more sense 😅. Yeah, it's probably safe to ignore those files directly under the <code>src</code> directories.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By &quot;top level&quot; dir I mean the project's root dir, no matter what <code>src</code> is set to.</p>
<p>So if we have a project using the common &quot;src&quot; layout, we want to configure ruff with <code>src = [&quot;src&quot;]</code>. But at least <code>setup.py</code> and <code>noxfile.py</code> are pretty much always in the &quot;top level&quot; dir in such projects, not in <code>./src/</code>, and ruff after #2560 still issues <code>INP001</code> for them.</p>
<p>So to reiterate, I think all files directly in <em>both</em> <code>./</code> (== &quot;top level&quot;, or &quot;project root dir&quot;) and whatever is included in the <code>src</code> config, should be ignored. The latter is taken care of by #2560, the former is currently unaddressed.</p>
<p>Example affected project: https://github.com/scop/pytekukko, with the related <code>noqa</code> at https://github.com/scop/pytekukko/blob/ccd7c06ee121e5b70fa455ec5e718d4f27707664/noxfile.py#L1 removed:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>manage.py</code> usually located not in the <code>project_root</code> but in the <code>src root</code> as project root has CI configuration and all other related stuff, and inside SRC we have all the code related to running the service (<code>manage.py</code> is kind of an entry point for django)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can see how a repo might be set up that way, but in my experience the setups having <code>manage.py</code> in the project top level dir vastly outnumber ones having it elsewhere.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@scop and @charliermarsh no worry guys. This issue can be easily fixed by applying per-file ignore in the <code>pyproject.toml</code></p>
<p>Therefore please just ignore my comment.</p>
<p>P.S.: To preserve original <code>manage.py</code> file from <code>django-admin startproject</code> we have to apply multiple exceptions anyways...
Have to double check if in new version of Django the format has been changed though 😕</p>

&quot;manage.py&quot; = [&quot;I002&quot;, &quot;INP001&quot;, &quot;ISC003&quot;]
