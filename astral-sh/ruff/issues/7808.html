            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The current implementation of <code>Q003</code> rule to accommodate the nested f-strings is a bit too complex. It can possibly be simplified using two loops instead of one. The outer loop is the regular token loop while the inner loop would be for the f-strings. When the outer loop encounters the <code>FStringStart</code> token, then the control would go to the inner loop where it would be easier to just <code>break</code> if it's not possible to perform the check.</p>
<p>This is low priority and an internal refactor for readability purpose.</p>
