            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sharkdp What is the status here? It would be nice to just close out the compare-expression task, but I also think this is probably a low-priority edge case. Is there an imprecise-but-not-incorrect approach we could put in place for now, pending real use cases, and call this done?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@carljm The status is that I have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14138">this draft</a>. It&#x27;s better than nothing in that it turns a lot of <code>Type::Todo</code>s into correct answers, but it feels unfinished and potentially even wrong in some cases.</p>
<p>Glad to talk about it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We discussed offline - the PR looks pretty good to me (it&#x27;s OK if we are correct but not as precise as we could theoretically be) so we&#x27;ll get it wrapped up and landed soon.</p>
