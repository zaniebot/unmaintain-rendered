# Implement `flake8-self`

---

_Issue opened by @ngnpope on 2023-01-31 20:25_

[GitHub](https://github.com/Korijn/flake8-self), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-self/).

- [ ] [`SLF001`]():  Private member access

Detects accessing a private attribute, e.g. `obj._private`, but allows for `self._private`, `cls._private`, and `mcs._private` (for in metaclasses). It doesn't currently check that `cls._private` is only within a class method, etc., which is something that could be improved. It also always allows access to dunders, e.g. `obj.__eq__`.

I would like to differentiate the rule between `_private` and `__private`/`_Class__private` members. Maybe `SLF001` and `SLF002`.
