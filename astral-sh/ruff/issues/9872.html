            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Very similar to the issue described in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4348">astral-sh/ruff#4348</a>. I have a root dir with a file that looks a bit like:</p>
<p>proj/.ruff.toml:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[lint.isort]
section-order = [&quot;standard-library&quot;, &quot;common_pkgs&quot;, &quot;third-party&quot;, &quot;same_subcomp&quot;]
[lint.isort.sections]
&quot;common_pkgs&quot; = [&quot;numpy&quot;, &quot;behave&quot;, ]
&quot;same_subcomp&quot;= []</p>
</blockquote>
<p>proj/subdir/.ruff.toml:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>extend = &quot;../.ruff.toml&quot;
[lint.isort.sections]
&quot;same_subcomp&quot; = [&quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using a command such as ruff proj/subdir/&lt;some_file&gt; returns me an error like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>warning: <code>section-order</code> contains unknown section: <code>UserDefined(&quot;common_pkgs&quot;)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means that isort.sections is being completely overwritten, when I expected to only overwrite the value of &quot;same_subcomp&quot;. I can also confirm that the sorting of imports is not behaving as expected, as it will put numpy in the middle of the third party, when I want it to have its own block.</p>
<p>If this is the intended behavior, which I assumed it wasn&#x27;t given issue #4348, is there a simple way I can achieve <em>my</em> intended behavior without copying the definition of common_pkgs to the .ruff.toml in every subdir?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>No problem. Is the suggestion of setting to an &quot;empty&quot; object too bad in that regard? (The comment I made on the PR)</p>

<p>Sorry that was not intentional. I cleaned up my stale branches and thought it&#x27;s safe to delete any branch starting with <code>charliemarsh</code>. I restored the branch and reopened the PR.</p>

<p>There was no specific reason other than time constraints. We didn&#x27;t want to block the 0.4 release by making this decision.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To confirm the behavior change. We&#x27;ll now start merging the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>per_file_ignores</code></li>
<li><code>extend-per-file-ignores</code> (Do we still need the <code>extend</code>?)</li>
<li><code>flake8_import_convention_options.aliases</code></li>
<li><code>flake8_import_convention_options.extend_aliases</code></li>
<li><code>flake8_import_convention_options.banned_aliases</code></li>
<li><code>flake8_import_convention_options.banned_from</code></li>
<li><code>flake8_tidy_imports.banned_api</code></li>
<li><code>isort.sections</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether the new behavior is correct for all settings, or at least it becomes less clear why we would still need the <code>extend-</code> options when &quot;extending&quot; becomes the new default for tables.</p>
<p>The new <code>CombineOptions</code> allows us to use different merging behaviors for different settings, but I&#x27;m worried this will be confusing.</p>
<p>This makes me hesitant to merge this change. @charliermarsh what are your thoughts on this?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I would prefer not to but I won&#x27;t rule it out. Either way, deciding on adding a different extension strategy isn&#x27;t something we want to do lightly because it adds a lot of complexity and also makes it harder for users to understand what&#x27;s happening.</p>
