            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A rule that requires <code>noqa</code> directives to provide an explanation would encourage more readable code.  Often when looking at such a directive, it's hard to know why the author has made the choice to ignore a rule and such a rule would minimize those cases.  This could be implemented by checking for an additional comment following the directive, so that noqa directives would always look like:</p>
<pre><code># noqa: F401 # some explanation here
</code></pre>
<p>For reference, this has been implemented for <code>golang</code> in <code>golangci-lint</code> at https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/master/pkg/golinters/nolintlint/README.md</p>
