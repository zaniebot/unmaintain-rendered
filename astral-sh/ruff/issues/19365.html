<p>On a similar note I have multiple times tried to figure out in which specific version of ruff that a rule was introduced or modified (bugfix, &quot;upgraded&quot; from nursery/preview to stable rule).</p>
<p>Having versioned documentation or some version information in each rule's docpage would make this much easier than today.</p>

<p>I concur this would be nice. Rust's Clippy does this really well:</p>

<p>I would also appreciate (structured) metadata being shown in docs, such as version a rule was introduced in.</p>

<p>Adding a screenshot to save (most) readers a link click:</p>
<p><img width="1560" height="687" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda9fe9d-3cb5-49ce-84ec-70ca833bd633" /></p>
<p>Note there are 2 types of version information here:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the rule was first introduced/added</li>
<li>in addition, if new options became available after the initial introduction, they are inside a separate box</li>
</ul>
<p>To my taste, this is a little hard to parse for first time visitors - though the repeat visitor might appreciate the granular information. Looks fairly tricky to maintain those versioned boxes though for changes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Closing this after https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/21035! We now include the version when a rule was added, a link to related  issues, and a link to the source code, much like clippy. These are also included in the JSON output of <code>ruff rule</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">&gt; uvx ruff@0.14.2 rule F401 --output-format json | jq '{status, source_location}'
{
  &quot;status&quot;: {
    &quot;Stable&quot;: {
      &quot;since&quot;: &quot;v0.0.18&quot;
    }
  },
  &quot;source_location&quot;: {
    &quot;file&quot;: &quot;crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pyflakes/rules/unused_import.rs&quot;,
    &quot;line&quot;: 145
  }
