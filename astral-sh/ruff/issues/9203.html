<p>Ruff is responsible for reformatting this line when applying <em>lint</em> fixes. It should respect the max line length, and avoid folding the two lines together as a side effect of removing the open mode.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If ruff isn't confident it can apply the UP015 fixer it should just refuse to do it at all without --unsafe-fixes, of course. Either solution is valid, though I suspect users would be okay with just removing the <code>'r'</code> anyways.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The ideal behavior here is for us to re-format the fix, but in lieu of that, I don't know that <em>not</em> offering the fix is actually better -- we've had a lot of confusion in the past when adding that behavior to specific rules (it's respected in <em>some</em> cases): https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8106</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe there needs to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>a generic mechanism for autofixes to detect when they would rewrite code which formerly obeyed the line-length setting, to violate it, and mark that autofix as long-line-unsafe</li>
<li>a dedicated option, similar to --unsafe-fixes but <em>not actually called unsafe-fixes</em>, e.g. <code>--long-line-fixes</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I definitely do not think it's appropriate to violate the line length.</p>
<ul>
<li>not everyone uses, or wants to use, a formatter</li>
<li>ruff combined with autofixes can be very useful for performing one-off migrations</li>
<li>many projects have CI which is gated on flake8, but not ruff, so it would be advantageous to be able to run <code>ruff check --fix</code> and get fewer fixes, but passing CI</li>
<li>but mostly, &quot;In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.&quot; If ruff is going to emit an error code either way, then there is no point in <em>both</em> modifying the file <em>and</em> emitting an error code. Ruff should not make a decision about whether you prefer to get an error due to the UP015 code or get a different error due to the E501 code. Instead, ruff should simply report whichever error your codebase already has, and let <em>you</em> make the judgment call.</li>
