# Format type parameters on functions and classes

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-07-20 21:25_

[PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/) introduces type parameters on function and classes in python 3.12, which are currently not considered when formatting, but should be added:

```python
class ClassA[T: str]:
    def method1(self) -> T:
        ...

def func[T](a: T, b: T) -> T:
    ...
```

Their implementation can likely reuse larger parts of dict comprehensions. See https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3703 for the black implementation
