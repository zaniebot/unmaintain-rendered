Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Similar to the what darker does for black, it would be very nice for introducing ruff to a code base to only apply it to changed lines.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey! It's not possible right now -- some things like this have come up in #1149, #1931, #2189. I'm hesitant to support it since it's a hard feature to get right. I haven't used <code>darker</code>, but the problem with applying that methodology to Ruff (IIUC) is that unlike code formatting, linter errors are not always localized: you could remove an import from one part of the file, and it could cause an error in an unchanged part of the file.</p>
<p>One alternative (not what you're looking for, but thought I'd mention it) is that you can run <code>ruff --add-noqa /path/to/file.py</code> and it will add <code>noqa</code> suppressions to any lines that fail. I know this won't work in all cases, but it's an option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah definitely! Although I feel like there are probably ways to do that via Git commands and piping, and if they're workable, it's a bit easier than building logic into Ruff.</p>
<p>In Flake8, they suggest this as an alternative to their <code>--diff</code> functionality which was deprecated:</p>
<pre><code>git diff --name-only -z --diff-filter=d -- '*.py' | xargs -0 flake8 or utilize pre-commit run --from-ref=... --to-ref=...
</code></pre>
<p>But I haven't tried it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess another brute force solution would be to run ruff before and after the changes and in some sort do a set difference:</p>
<p>introducedErrors = errorsAfter - errorsBefore</p>
