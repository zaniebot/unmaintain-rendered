            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It breaks runtime type checking.</p>
<p>See the discussions: https://github.com/beartype/beartype/discussions/460
And: https://github.com/beartype/beartype/pull/440#issuecomment-2421528743</p>
<p>It also break library that use type information at runtime.</p>
<p>From flake8-type-checking itself, see: https://github.com/snok/flake8-type-checking/issues/52#issuecomment-1004842907</p>
<p>Also <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> will be removed when Python 3.13 support will end. Moreover PEP 649, implemented in python 3.14, should solve the time penalty that TC001,2,3 try to resolve.</p>
<p>Alternative solutions:</p>
<p>disable starting from Python 3.14 only. Or do exception for all library that use runtime type information as in flake8 (e.g. beartype)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @RomainBrault</p>
<p>The <code>TC</code> rules are all disabled by default. You have to opt-in to them manually. It's possible that you did that by using the <code>ALL</code> selector but I'm not sure what Ruff should do different in that case. It would be very confusing if  <code>ALL</code> doesn't select <em>all</em> rules</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, i used the ALL selector 😳 , thanks for pointing it out</p>
<p>however it would be nice to point out that <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> will be deprecated in Python 3.14 (thus not using the rule is encouraged for the version &gt;= 3.14) and the rule should be removed when 3.13 support will end.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for pointing that out. We'll revisit all rules when Python 3.14 is closer to reaching beta status, and I'll close this as there's nothing immediate that needs to be done now.</p>
