Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Not sure if this belongs here but <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/133013">the pipeline is failing</a> thus my brew and pre-commit versions are out of sync (select = [&quot;ALL&quot;] user here). I have since uninstalled homebrew and installed using pipx. just FYI</p>
