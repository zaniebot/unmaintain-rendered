<p>This is not ideal and it raises an interesting question - how to count the characters for an f-string containing replacement fields?</p>
<ol>
<li><code>f&quot;one{expr}one&quot;</code> (6 total or 3 and 3)</li>
<li><code>&quot;one&quot; f&quot;one{expr}one&quot;</code> (9 total or 3, 3, 3)</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(I don't think there's a use case for having f-strings in a <code>.pyi</code> file, FWIW, so I think the correctness issue with this specific rule is <em>unlikely</em> to come up in real life. The broader issue you're pointing to is obviously still valid, however :)</p>

<p>Yeah, Ruff will basically replace only part of a f-string. The linked PR has a solution to instead count all of the characters in a f-string and replace the <em>entire</em> f-string if it's &gt; 50 instead.</p>
