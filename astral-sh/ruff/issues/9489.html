Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi,
with the latest release (0.1.12), I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ pip install ruff==0.1.12
$ ruff check --diff .
ruff failed
  Cause: Failed to create cache file '/data/.ruff_cache/0.1.12/1566177860923460140'
  Cause: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that now it expect the cache folder to already exist.</p>
<p>The workaround is to run <code>mkdir -p .ruff_cache/0.1.12</code>, that is quite annoying.</p>
