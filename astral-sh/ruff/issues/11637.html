            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I recently came up with the idea to remove the redundant usage of the response_model keyword in FastAPI routes. FastAPI looks at the return type annotation of the decorated function by default, so using response_model while having a return type annotation with the same value is a code duplication that should be avoided.</p>
<p>As someone new to Rust and contributing to Ruff, I took this opportunity to learn and implemented this rule in #11579. If you find this rule aligns with Ruff’s goals, I would kindly ask for a code review.</p>
<p>Thank you!
Tomer Bin</p>
