            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is how a rule's documentation is rendered in PyCharm (with the help of <a href="https://github.com/InSyncWithFoo/ryecharm">RyeCharm</a>):</p>

<p><code>D203</code> is one of the rare cases (~10) where a rule's documentation has a link to another rule's. Currently, clicking on such a link from the documentation popup would open the browser. As a plugin developer, I want to avoid this and instead resolve the link in place, same as what I did with option links (e.g., <code>lint.extend</code>).</p>
<p>However, I have no way to know what rule a name refers to; if I knew its code, <code>ruff rule &lt;code&gt;</code> would work, but documentation links use hyphenated names, and <code>ruff rule &lt;name&gt;</code> has yet to be implemented.</p>
<p>This issue is similar to #14348 and is a part of #1773.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is great UX, and I like the idea of intercepting the rule links so that they appear in the editor instead.</p>
<p>I've some UX concerns about mixing rule codes and rule names in the CLI. It will set a precedence that other commands should accept rule names too.</p>
<p>Have you considered querying all rules once running <code>ruff rule --all --output-format=json</code>. The output contains the name for every rule (and its documentation). I don't expect it to be much more expensive than querying the documentation for a single rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I did consider <code>--all</code>, but the output is over 1 MB, compared to just ~1KB of a single rule. As projects can have different Ruff executables, 1 MB of JSON is a bit too large to be kept as a cache, though I will have to consider that if the PR is rejected.</p>
<p>Querying, parsing and rendering repeatedly seems like a waste, considering all other tasks the IDE must be doing at the same time. Data for dependency version inlay hints, for example, are retrieved once every 5 seconds (configurable) to ensure real-time feedback:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c0e600-dce1-40dc-8c6e-6f2c3031cbec" alt="" /></p>
<p>The most important point, however, is that querying by name feels more human.</p>
<p>We can require <code>--preview</code> for this change and stabilize it sometimes later; in fact, I considered doing so from the start, but <code>rule</code> didn't already have <code>--preview</code>.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem too bad considering an IDE context, and you can reduce it to a simple <code>name</code> -&gt; <code>code</code> mapping, which should be very compact.</p>

<p>Isn't this exactly the direction we would like to be headed?</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1773#issuecomment-1949473960">this comment</a> there is already some precedence of using human-names in the docs.</p>
<p>This change is a great next step towards tackling #1773  (human-friendly names) and #1774 (categories) and/or #3363 (presets).</p>
<p>Of course we need to be consider such as retaining numeric codes for backwards compatibility, ensuring the quality of names and mechanics such as accepting rule codes and rule names interchangeably.</p>
<p>@MichaReiser  Could the Astral team internally discuss that given these considerations we have green light to accept rule names in general, or that a detailed proposal is required? This seems to me like the most effective way of moving forward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree; we definitely want #1773.</p>
<p>I don't think this change brings us significantly closer to #1773. It doesn't tackle the hard problems but now introduces inconsistency in the CLI interface.</p>

<p>I understand that our current sentiment is not to support rule names until #1774 is figured out, or at least requires a detailed proposal on how it interacts and a commitment to tackle it as a whole.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok clear. It wasn't apparent to me that using the human-friendly names had a dependency on the recategorisation/presets, and if it wouldn't have then consistently supporting codes and names throughout the CLI would make sense (at least to me).</p>
<p>Then let's conclude that a detailed proposal taking into account the complexities of #1773, #1774 and #3363 is needed to move the needle!</p>

<p>Cache invalidation is most certainly not my cup of tea, but if there really is no other way...</p>

<p>Resolving seems snappy enough, so I guess all's well that ends well.</p>
