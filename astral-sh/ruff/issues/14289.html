<pre><code>The `warnings.warn` method uses a stacklevel of 1 by default, which will output a stack frame of the line on which the `warn` method is called. Setting it to a higher number will output a stack frame from higher up the stack.

It's recommended to use a `stacklevel` of 2 or higher, to give the caller a more appropriate context about the warning.
