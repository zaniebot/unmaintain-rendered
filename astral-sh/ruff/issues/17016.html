            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Red-knot currently doesn't recognise any symbols in <code>finally</code> suites as having visible definitions if the <code>try</code> suite has a terminal statement and there either is no <code>except</code> suite OR the <code>except</code> suite also has terminal statements. This causes quite a few false positives when running red-knot on Black (for example).</p>

    try:
        return
    except:
        return
    finally:
        f = &quot;foo&quot;
        print(f)  # error: Name `f` is not defined

def b():
    try:
        return
    except:
        return
    finally:
        f = &quot;foo&quot;
        print(f)  # error: Name `f` is not defined

    try:
        return

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is purely a combination of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15797 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/233.</p>
<p>A <code>finally</code> suite can run either as a result of an exception, or as a result of fall-through from <code>try</code> or <code>except</code> blocks. We currently model only the latter possibility.</p>
<p>And in the cases shown here, the latter possibility is unreachable, so this triggers our currently-suboptimal handling of unreachable code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I see. I suppose this simply validates our decision to treat astral-sh/ruff#15797 as high priority, then :-) I'll close this out in favour of those two issues.</p>
<p>FWIW: this appears to cause about 20 false-positive diagnostics when running red-knot on Black</p>
