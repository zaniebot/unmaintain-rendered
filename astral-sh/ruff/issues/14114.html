            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently represent &quot;known instances&quot; (e.g. special forms like <code>typing.Literal</code>, which are an instance of <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>, but need to be handled differently from other instances of <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>) as an <code>InstanceType</code> with a <code>known</code> field that is <code>Some(...)</code>.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to handle a known instance as if it were a regular instance type (by ignoring the <code>known</code> field), and in some cases (e.g. <code>Type::member</code>) that is correct and convenient. But in other cases (e.g. <code>Type::is_equivalent_to</code>) it is not correct, and we currently have a bug that we would consider the known-instance type of <code>typing.Literal</code> as equivalent to the general instance type for <code>typing._SpecialForm</code>, and we would fail to consider it a singleton type or a single-valued type (even though it is both.)</p>
<p>An instance type with <code>known.is_some()</code> is semantically quite different from an instance type with <code>known.is_none()</code>. The former is a singleton type that represents exactly one runtime object; the latter is an open type that represents many runtime objects, including instances of unknown subclasses. It is too error-prone to represent these very-different types as a single <code>Type</code> variant. We should instead introduce a dedicated <code>Type::KnownInstance</code> variant and force ourselves to handle these explicitly in all <code>Type</code> variant matches.</p>
