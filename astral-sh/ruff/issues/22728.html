            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>A rule should prevent public functions that return <strong>private classes</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the following code has a public class with a public method returning a private class.</p>
<pre><code>class _Array:
    pass


class Numpy:
    def create_array(self) -&gt; _Array:
        return _Array()
</code></pre>
<p>That forces you to import a private class.</p>
<p>In C#:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55a0e424-8cc3-48e9-af84-00073f069d46"></p>
<p><strong>Private modules and folders</strong> should also be covered. For example, in my libraries, I have lots of files/folders prefixed with an underscore (<code>_async_concurrent_dictionary.py</code>, <code>_service_lookup/_service_provider_engine.py</code>...), containing classes without an underscore. This can be considered the equivalent of <code>internal</code> of C#.
This is important because I import those classes from <code>/src</code> and <code>/tests</code>, but I don&#x27;t want user libraries to see or import the code.
This issue is related to this topic: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16892">astral-sh/ruff#16892</a></p>
<p><strong>Aliases</strong> should be covered too (<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20916">astral-sh/ruff#20916</a>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I would probably lean toward adding a single rule that handles both this and #20916, unless there&#x27;s a desire to keep them separate. I think I was picturing that we would flag any private type in a public interface, like the rustc lint in my other <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20916#issuecomment-3415533744">comment</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main challenge here is probably going to decide on what&#x27;s considered a public type. Is it all types that aren&#x27;t prefixed or only those that are accessible from outide the module/package?</p>

<p>For me:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a folder has an underscore, all inside is private.</li>
<li>If a file has an underscore, all inside is private.</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x27;s easier to think about it as the <code>internal</code> modifier of C# instead of <code>private</code>: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/internal</p>
<p>Exception: Generics, given they have more capabilities with TypeVar/TypeVarTuple/... than using the short syntax.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We also have a lot of instances where we do</p>
<pre><code># reused private aliases
type _Foo = Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]
type _Bar = int | str

# a public function
def do_it(foo: _Foo) -&gt; _Bar: ...
</code></pre>
<p>which then renders in our docs as intended:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>do_it</strong>(foo: Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]) -&gt; int | str</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while it would make sense to avoid exposing private <em>classes</em>, types starting with an underscore aren’t all that private in many cases.</p>

<p>Although this may require a configuration knob. I don&#x27;t know if this is also an issue in the Python community but I always found it very frustrating when I used a TypeScript library, where a function takes an argument or returns a value that is typed as a union, and the library even defines a type alias for it, but I can&#x27;t reuse it. Instead, I have to copy paste their definition.</p>
