            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Mypy_primer hasn't had much to say about @dcreager's recent generics work, because we've been doing new-style generics first, and not very many projects &quot;in the wild&quot; use new-style generics yet (they're only valid syntax on Python 3.12+). We should consider adding https://github.com/mikeshardmind/async-utils to our mypy_primer workflow, as it makes use of PEP-695 generics, so will give us valuable signal on how well our implementation is progressing.</p>
<p>This involves either making a PR to https://github.com/hauntsaninja/mypy_primer or our Astral fork (https://github.com/astral-sh/mypy_primer) to add the project to <code>project.py</code>. Then, once that's done, we need to update the workflow here to explicitly select the project during the <code>mypy_primer</code> CI job: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/058439d5d3f65db515d69359c99838d60776f45e/.github/workflows/mypy_primer.yaml#L71</p>
