# support light theme

---

_@kemingy_

Currently, the style of `filename` is bold white: 

https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/6733aad216295a9f7850d16291f7831cc31ec7fa/src/message.rs#LL59C71-L59C71

This means, if users are using a light theme, it's almost invisible.

I wonder if this can be another color.
