<li>I would like to ask for a rule that requires an <code>__all__</code> list to be declared in each file where there are non-private members, and all the non-private members are listed in it.</li>
<li>Another helpful rule is to detect declarations in <code>__all__</code> that are unused
~~3. Another rule would be to automatically order <code>__all__</code>~~</li>
<li>Another rule might be to enforce private module members when no exported, or require they are in <code>__all__</code> if used outside</li>

<p>This would require multifile analysis, which Ruff doesn't support today. Even then, the rule would be inherently unsafe for libraries where a symbol in <code>__all__</code> might be imported by another application. But I do agree that knowing about &quot;dead code&quot; in general would be useful.</p>

<p>Can you help me understand the motivation for explicitly requiring <code>__all__</code> when all members are public? Or is <code>__all__</code> only required if there's at least one private and one public member in the file?</p>

<p>This also requires multifile analysis</p>

<p>Yes. It's a way to enforce modules with explicit public exports.</p>
