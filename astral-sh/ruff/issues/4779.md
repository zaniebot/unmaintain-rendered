<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

It would be nice if pyupgrade can automaticly disable based on target-version

for example:

```toml
extend-select = ["UP"]
target-version = "py310"
```

then these rules should be disabled automaticly, or become noop

```
UP035 `typing.List` is deprecated, use `list` instead
UP007 [*] Use `X | Y` for type annotations
UP006 [*] Use `list` instead of `List` for type annotation
```
