            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>shift-clicking links on https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/ opens them in the same tab. Instead, it should open in a new window.</p>
<p>If you shift-click the <code>Docs</code> link on https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/ (which goes to the same page), it is a no-op.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this is something we can fix. Cmd clicking the <code>Docs</code> link opens it in a new page. Shift clicking does indeed do &quot;nothing&quot; but this seems a browser decision.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is not a browser decision; this happens because the docs site is <em>overriding</em> the browser decision, likely a side effect of how the SPA implements page navigation (instead of loading the entire page, the content is changed).</p>
<p>Try shift-clicking the <code>Playground</code> link on https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/. It works correctly because the link is external to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe, I don't know. I did a quick search for any javascript and couldn't find any that would intercept the link. It could also be something from our documentation framework. I don't think this is worth me spending much time on hunting down as we're considering switching the documentation framework anyway.</p>
