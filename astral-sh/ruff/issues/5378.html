Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Let's say I have a function in my code with a standard NumPy docstring:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def something_amazing(inputs):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Wow, this does stuff!
    
    Parameters
    ==========
    inputs: dict
        Oh boy, oh boy
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return sum(inputs.keys())
</code></pre>
<p>This will return the ruff error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">λ ruff .
awesome_sauce.py:6:9: D407 [*] Missing dashed underline after section (&quot;Parameters&quot;)
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>But when I do a <code>ruff --fix .</code>, the code now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def something_amazing(inputs):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Wow, this does stuff!
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    ==========
    inputs: dict
        Oh boy, oh boy
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    return sum(inputs.keys())
</code></pre>
<p>This happened hundreds of times in our codebases, because someone thought dashes equal signs were the same.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not sure if you want to support finding and fixing this problem. But in an ideal world I wouldn't have to worry about <code>ruff --fix</code> breaking things.</p>
<p>So, just FYI.</p>

<p>Do you think D407 should detect and replace the equals signs?</p>

<p>It would have helped my team.  Luckily, someone didn't trust the auto <code>--fix</code> flag and reviewed my PR.</p>
<p>BUT, I'm willing to concede I don't have a wide view of the huge feature set that <code>ruff</code> wants to support.  So it's up to ya'll.</p>
<p>I could take a whack at it, of course. But I haven't tried to contribute to <code>ruff</code> before, so there would be a long spin-up process.</p>
