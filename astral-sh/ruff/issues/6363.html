            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>SimpleTokenizer</code> supports backward lexing. The implementation will break when supporting Python 3.12's new F-String parsing because comments can now appear in parts that appear to be strings.</p>
<pre><code>f&quot;test{more  # quote
}&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>My preferred option would be to remove backward lexing altogether. But I'm unsure how to support <code>is_parenthesized_expression</code> without it in the formatter. The problem is that we need to look back from the start of the expression. One option I could think of is to integrate the parenthesize detection into the <code>CommentsVisitor</code> where we already track the parent nodes (necessary to avoid mistaking <code>a</code> as a parenthesized expression in <code>call(a)</code>), and we could store the last start/position and start lexing from there. This would require skipping over some tokens, which I'm not sure we can handle.</p>
<p>The other alternative is to split the <code>SimpleTokenizer</code> into one implementation that only supports forward lexing and a <code>BackwardTokenizer</code> that supports backward lexing, but takes the <code>CommentRanges</code> as a second argument.</p>
