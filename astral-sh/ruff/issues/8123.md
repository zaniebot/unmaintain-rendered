```py
import os

os.environ["https_proxy"] # error
os.environ["http_proxy"] # error
os.environ["no_proxy"] # error
```

while there is no "official" standard, most applications use lowercase for these variables, so i think this rule should ignore them. or maybe a setting could be added for variable names to ignore
