Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I ran ruff over a large codebase and noticed some differing behavior for SIM101. <code>assert isinstance(n.args[1], Node) or isinstance(n.args[1], int)</code> is not detected by SIM101 to merge the isinstance calls. In fact, it looks like any isinstance call which calls an underlying attribute lookup or <code>__getitem__</code> function seems to not trigger the ruff SIM101 rule. Is this difference between the two intentional? Or is it just a bug that was overlooked when the rule was implemented?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like the rule only looks for <code>isinstance(name, ...)</code> and not arbitrary expressions. We could support that as long as the expression doesn't contain an effect.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is probably consistent with SIM101 as-is so not labeling a &quot;bug&quot; although it would be good to fix.</p>
