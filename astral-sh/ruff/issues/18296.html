            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, the iconography showing the status of a rule (stable, unstable) is a little challenging to read when dark mode. In particular the ✔️ emoji does not have very good contrast, and they greyed-out 🛠️ emoji is a little unclear imo.</p>
<p>A simple fix is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swap the ✔️ for a ✅, or don't show anything at all (stable is assumed by most to be the default)</li>
<li>Instead of showing a greyed-out 🛠️, don't show anything at all</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently waiting for <code>rustc</code> to build <code>ruff</code> so I can try my hand at fixing this (update: my laptop is not happy with me, <code>rust-analyzer</code> generated 17 GB of temporary files while trying to compile it 💀)</p>
