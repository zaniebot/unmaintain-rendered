            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello!</p>
<p>Black is great and uncompromising but has changed over the years.
I am migrating a large codebase and the diff&#x27;s size is insane. I hope to make the process more gradual.</p>
<p>I use ruff with autofixes to decrease the diff. Having a monorepo-compatible configuration helps a lot.
After the migration I will change configs in each sub-project separately.</p>
<p>The only problem left for me is an indentation. Our very old version of black puts extra level of space (8 in total) before the args, according to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation">PEP 8</a>. The modern black only uses one level of space (just 4).</p>
<p>Is it possible to add the number of spaces as a custom rule in ruff with autofix?</p>
<pre><code># In:
def func(
    arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., argN
):

# Out:
def func(
        arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., argN
):
</code></pre>
<p>P.S.: I can&#x27;t migrate in smaller chunks because the whole codebase uses common tooling and CI.</p>

<p>I think I understand the use-case but I don&#x27;t know that we can justify adding a rule for this -- it&#x27;s a fairly specific need, but something we&#x27;ll need to implement and maintain in perpetuity.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Hi! Thank you for a detailed answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is the indentation a problem here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The indentation is not a problem by itself. The problem is that Black switched the indentation without giving a way to configure it. Both 4 and 8 spaces are ok by PEP 8 if I understand it correctly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the thinking here that would want to upgrade Black to latest, and use Ruff to modify the code to add the 8-space indentation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, exactly. I want to use Ruff to temporarily force it back to 8 spaces. After that I will use Ruff&#x27;s .toml to configure sub-projects finely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or is Ruff flagging the 8-space indentation, and you want to avoid Ruff raising errors there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually it isn&#x27;t flagging neither 4 nor 8 spaces. And I haven&#x27;t met a rule in Ruff which isn&#x27;t configurable via .toml.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I understand that it is a bit niche use-case. Not many people are skipping so many updates to catch up =) But for me this rule is a bit like a setting of single and double quotes (a problem with no way to use single quotes in Black). And I actually use Q000 and COM812 to decrease the diff, too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m going to close this in favor of the discussion happening in our own formatter here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/7310#discussioncomment-7128822. Feel free to chime in there. I think we&#x27;re unlikely to support this as a standalone lint rule, but perhaps it will end up being supported in our formatter.</p>
