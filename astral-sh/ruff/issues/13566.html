<p>Hmm, that looks like an exception raised at runtime rather than a diagnostic that pyright would emit. Regardless, it's true that there are many errors that a type checker will catch but Ruff will currently not catch. Type checkers and linters are different kinds of tools that catch different kinds of errors; it's good to use both tools together rather than relying on one or the other.</p>
<p>The good news is that we're working on a type checking tool! You can follow our progress by watching commits to the various <code>red_knot_*</code> crates in Ruff. It'll be a while until it's ready, however; until then, I'd recommend that you use a type checker alongside Ruff to catch a broad range of statically detectable errors.</p>
