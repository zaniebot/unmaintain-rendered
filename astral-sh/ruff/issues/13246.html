            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Random but I was looking back at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/3914 and now that I have more familiarity from my time in uv, I think <code>.pyw</code> should just be included by default? They're Python files, just intended to run with a GUI etc.</p>

<p>Possibly. It is a breaking change. That means we can't just merge the PR but must wait for the next minor. We should probably make this a preview change first. Although we may even decide to only ship the preview change as part of the next minor release.</p>
<p>One thing we have to be careful about is that we only include <code>pyw</code> when discovering python files to lint. I don't think we should include <code>pyw</code> files when, e.g., discovering packages.</p>
