            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I already brought this up a while back in the issue for the flake8-bandit rules, which has recently been completed.</p>
<p>I personally think it would be a good idea to support them, because they provide better visibility for potential security flaws in the code than their equivalent <code>noqa</code> comment, which I find easy to gloss over by comparison. It also means improved interoperability between bandit and ruff without the need for flake8-bandit as a compatibility shim.</p>
<p>There was some push back against the idea last time, but I wanted to try again, since ruff has has undergone some big changes in relevant portions like the parser in the meantime, from what I can tell ruff already recognizes <code>nosec</code> as a pragma so the cost of adding support should be overall a bit lower now.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be happy to give the implementation a try myself, if there is no significant push back against the idea.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to support will probably be a bare <code>nosec</code> without a code. Since that should only silence bandit rules, so it can&#x27;t be equivalent to a bare <code>noqa</code>. For the rest of the rules it should be possible to treat it as an alias to an equivalent <code>noqa</code> rule.</p>
<p>Although there&#x27;s also a broader question of the interaction with flake8-noqa. Should <code>nosec</code> comments be able to trigger <code>NQA10X</code> rules? Or do we add some ruff specific rules to tidy up <code>nosec</code> rules? bandit itself does emit warnings for <code>nosec</code> comments, where the supplied rule doesn&#x27;t apply (although there are some false positives).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel hesitant about adding new suppression pragmas without knowing the outcome of #1774. The bandit group will likely be gone afterward, and it then becomes unclear why some rules can be suppressed by <code>nosec</code> while others can&#x27;t. Unless we make <code>noses</code> an alias of <code>no,</code>, but that misses the author&#x27;s point of having something more explicit around security-related suppressions.</p>
<p>Rule categorization might also solve this if we allow <code>noqa</code> with rule names. E.g. <code>noqa: security/some-rule</code> would make for an easy grepable string.</p>
