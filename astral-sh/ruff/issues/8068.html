Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>One common issue I have when adding my own noqa rules is forgetting to add the two spaces before the NOQA comments. Link: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-few-spaces-before-inline-comment/ This rule seems like a very easy autofix to add and would probably make a great first issue. Many of the other E rules are also lacking autofixes which would be easy to implement.</p>
