Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Currently, it appears that the <code>required-version</code> [1] setting allows just a single specific version to be specified. When a version of ruff is present that differs from this version, the ruff tool errors, preventing checks from running.</p>
<p>The ask here is to allow range syntax, e.g. <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>~</code>, etc., or perhaps treat the <code>required-version</code> as a minimum similar to <code>target-version</code>, so that ruff does not fail to run in the scenario that e.g. a developer upgrades ruff in their environment but is working within a repo that wants to ensure that everyone is on some minimum version of ruff.</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff --version
ruff 0.3.0

$ cat ruff.toml
required-version = &quot;0.2.2&quot;

$ ruff check ./src/example/file.py
ruff failed
  Cause: Required version `0.2.2` does not match the running version `0.3.0`

</blockquote>
<p>I think we would need to support a full semver syntax similar to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#engines">package.json engines</a> or it might be surprising that e.g. `&lt;= isn't supported which, IMO, is entirely reasonable too</p>
<p>A first step before a PR is to spec out the exact behavior of that field with the supported syntax to avoid long discussions on the PR</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Correct, that’s what I meant — we should use Python’s PEP 440 and PEP 508 specifiers since they’re already native, standardized, used in the same TOML file, and we have parsers for them. I don’t think there needs to be any more decision-making than that, personally!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems reasonable, although PEP440 is probably more flexible than what we need (local versions). PEP508 seems unrelated because we don't need a name portion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 The gist of it is: it should just function identically to <code>requires-python</code> which is a standardized field that we already parse and support (see: <code>crates/ruff_workspace/src/pyproject.rs</code>).</p>
