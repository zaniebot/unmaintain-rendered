            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey first thank you for creating this awesome tool!</p>
<p>I am curious if the implementation crates in ruff would be published to crates.io? That would be nice since I would like to leverage it for some python-related tools.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently have no plans to publish the crates but we could reconsider for some specific crates if someone's interested in setting up a release process. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10417 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/43</p>
