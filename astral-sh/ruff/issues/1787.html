            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's not clear that <code>bar = 1</code> should be removed instead of <code>bar = 2</code>. I know that semantically, it's correct, in that <code>bar = 2</code> is the value that's resolved when you run the code. But I feel like this check is more likely to occur in situations in which you redefine a field that you already defined? In which case, the second instance would be the &quot;error&quot;?</p>

<p>hm, I don't want to risk a behavior change by using the autofixers, so I would change that to the semantically-correct version. If it was wrong before the linter shows you this and you can act upon it.</p>
