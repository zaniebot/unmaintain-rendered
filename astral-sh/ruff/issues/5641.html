Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>rules like <code>UP007 [*] Use X | Y for type annotations</code> doesn't respect target-version in type stub (pyi files)</p>
<p>pyi type <code>Dict[...]</code> are rewrite to <code>dict[...]</code> with <code>target-version='py37'</code> anyway</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for filing! This is intentional. Since stub files are never executed by the interpreter, and only exist to support static analysis, <code>.pyi</code> files are always treated as if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is enabled, i.e., you can always use features like built-in generics and the pipe union syntax: https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/stubs.html#syntax. So, we respect that behavior and allow rewriting regardless of the current Python version.</p>
