# Rule UP007 cause autofix error

_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-06 15:37_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select UP007 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
from __future__ import annotations
import typing as t
if t.TYPE_CHECKING:  # pragma: no cover
    from .blueprint import APIBlueprint
default_bypassed_endpoints: t.List[str] = [
]
default_response = {
}
def add_response(
    content_type: t.Optional[str]is not True  = 'application/json',
) -> None:
    operation['responses'][status_code] = {}
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/961_IDX_0_RAND_163585013824157063306162.py:10:19: UP007 Use `X | Y` for type annotations
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/961_IDX_0_RAND_163585013824157063306162.py`, the rule codes UP007, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
