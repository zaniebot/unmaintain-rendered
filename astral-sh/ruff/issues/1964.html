<li>The result is broken, the indentation is not respected. I am unsure what docstring format is that? RST based? at least in sphinx RST is used but I have not seen such thing. Don't know what I expect here. Maybe the ruff config could specify a doc-format.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's a couple things going wrong here, but the biggest issue, I think, is that we don't support Sphinx-style docstrings (is that what those are? Pydocstyle doesn't either) -- only NumPy and Google. We do have a setting for this <code>[tool.ruff.pydocstyle.convention]</code>, but right now, I think its best-guess is that you're using NumPy-style docstrings, and so it's matching statements like <code>return</code> as section headers.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pydocstyle has the <code>pep257</code> convention which I always use for sphinx-style docstrings but it doesn't enforce as much as the other two conventions in pydocstyle. <a href="https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint">darglint</a> has full support for sphinx-style docstrings though.</p>
<p>Also, OP's example doesn't look like the usual sphinx style to me... here is an official example: https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html For example, the type is usually specified separately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we reimplemented Pydocstyle so we suffer from many of the same limitations. I want to replace it with a <code>darglint</code>-style parser that uses an actual grammar, but it's a big project and I'm prioritizing some other things above it. I know @not-my-profile is interested in that too, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes I am working on a docstring parsing library for both a personal project and ruff, and I am planning to support all major docstring formats (epytext, google, numpy and sphinx). It will take me some time to publish that though.</p>
