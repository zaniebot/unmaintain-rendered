            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This was discussed before (See #6256). Pylint has a way to set valid magic values, ruff does not.</p>
<p>The reason for closing was given as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was an intentional divergence, if I recall correctly, since we couldn't find any motivating use-cases for parameterizing on specific values, the thinking being that if there's a value that should be allowed that's specific to the codebase, it should probably be encoded as a variable; and if a value should be allowed but isn't specific to the codebase, it should probably just be allowed by default (like 0).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can think of a few examples which are not magic and specific, but maybe not everyone wants. For example:</p>
<p>We have a project that does a lot of image handing. Generally images are unit8, sometimes unit16 if getting raw data with higher bit depth. Often certain calculations that could overflow are done as a different datatype. Before conversion you often find yourself checking for overflows.</p>
<p>255 really is not magic in a codebase that does a lot of uint8 maths. But it may be considered so in other codebases. I would like (and 65535) to not be magic, but I can see reasonable arguments for them counting as magic in other codebases.</p>
