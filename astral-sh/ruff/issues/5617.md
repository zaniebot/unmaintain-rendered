# Support `# flake8: noqa: F401`

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-07-08 16:33_

Flake8 treats this equivalently to `# flake8: noqa` -- that is, it turns off all rules for the entire file. As of #5571, we emit a warning but don't respect it at all. I think better would be to just support it in the way the user expects (i.e., turn off `F401` for the entire file). It deviates from Flake8, but #5571 deviates from Flake8 too, in a way that's less useful.
