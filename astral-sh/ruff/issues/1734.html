Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>It'd be nice if Ruff could detect trailing whitespace:</p>

<p>(even though black can eliminate them)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know if it's relevant (haven't thought through how we would implement trailing whitespace), but I started implementing Pycodestyle's logical line detection in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1130 -- although I felt at the time that it was a bit too slow to be worthwhile as a default.</p>

<p>Yes, black does. We can align with black and ignore trailing whitespace in strings (as shown in the attached screenshot).</p>
