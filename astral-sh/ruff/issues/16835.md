# Whitelist rule patterns to avoid "Invalid rule code provided to `# noqa`"

---

_Issue opened by @mharrisb1 on 2025-03-18 17:41_

### Summary

If other tools rely on `# noqa` but are not implemented by ruff will cause warnings.

For example, when using [deadcode](https://github.com/albertas/deadcode), the user can use `# noqa DCXX` comments to allow unused but ruff will complain about this usage as "Invalid rule".

Not sure what a good solution here would be but I'd like to avoid warnings from ruff here to avoid polluting logs

### Version

0.11.0

Does the [`lint.external`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_external) option work for you?
