            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When doing type inference within a module, we need full symbol tables, definitions, and CFG. (We could also possibly build these more lazily/granularly, e.g. not descend into functions unless/until we are actually type checking them.)</p>
<p>But we want to be able to persistent-cache types for public symbols in a module (that is, symbols accessible to other modules), and (if the module and it's dependencies haven't changed) load this info from cache and use it as a dependency for checking other modules, without needing an AST for this module, or full symbol tables, or definitions (which reference AST), or CFG (which also references AST.)</p>
<p>This means somehow splitting our symbol table representation to make this possible.</p>
