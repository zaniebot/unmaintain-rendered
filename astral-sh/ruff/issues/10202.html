Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>The warning:
<code>warning: Invalid rule code provided to </code># ruff: noqa<code> at stubs\six\six\moves\builtins.pyi:1: NQA102</code></p>
<p>The Python file:</p>

# But this is specifically a compatibility package.
