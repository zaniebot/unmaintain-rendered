            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>E262 is reporting both:</p>
<ul>
<li>cases where there are fewer than 1 spaces after the <code>#</code><ul>
<li><code>#comment</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cases where there are more than 1 spaces after the <code>#</code><ul>
<li><code>#   comment</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like a report when there are fewer than 1 spaces after the <code>#</code> but no report when there are more than 1 spaces.</p>
<p>Can this be configurable? or separated into different rules?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you tell me more about why you want to allow more than one space?</p>
<p>I don't think it makes sense to make this rule configurable because the goal of the pycodestyle rules is to reflect the recommendations from PEP8 and that is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Per <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#comments">PEP 8</a>, inline comments should start with a # and a single space.</p>
</blockquote>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The pattern in the code that I was trying to bring ruff into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">    {
        a: b,  #   1 -  25
        c: d,  #  26 -  50
        e: f,  #  51 -  75
        g: h,  #  76 - 100
        i: j,  # 101 - 125
    }
</code></pre>
<p>PEP8 even has an exception for the single space in block comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each line of a block comment starts with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I see it, a single comment could be both an inline comment and a block comment at the same time. That's what this example shows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for sharing. I can see how this formatting is desirable but it's out of this rule's scope (which is PEP8 centered).</p>
<p>I don't have a good solution for you other than disabling the rule for the entire project or this specific file. We may introduce support for suppressing a rule for an entire block (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3711) which could be useful to you if this isn't a very common pattern.</p>
