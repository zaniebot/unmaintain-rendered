            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>This is a rough idea that probably needs refining/discussion 🙂</p>
Overview
<p>Pytest and others expose monkeypatch/mocking APIs like:</p>
<pre><code>monkeypatch.setattr(some_module, &quot;my_important_api&quot;, replacement)
</code></pre>
<p>(and same for <code>delattr</code>.)</p>
<p>When called, this temporarily monkeypatches <code>some_module.my_important_api</code> with <code>replacement</code> (which could be an object, callable, etc.).</p>
Problem statement
<p>The above works, but has a footgun: if the user performs a refactor (e.g. from <code>my_important_api</code> to <code>my_critical_api</code>), then may miss this monkeypatch (since it&#x27;s a string literal, not a usage/reference). This is particularly likely to happen with IDE/LSP refactors, since syntax-aware rename-all functionality can&#x27;t look at these kinds of non-type string literals by design.</p>
<p>The impact of this depends: sometimes users notice it immediately (since their monkeypatch stops working), while other times it makes tests subtly incorrect or unreliable in ways that aren&#x27;t noticed until much later.</p>
Solution statement
<p>In general, users should <em>probably</em> write:</p>
<pre><code>monkeypatch.setattr(some_module, some_module.my_important_api.__name__, replacement)
</code></pre>
<p>That&#x27;ll behave the same as above, <em>but</em> will ensure that refactors/mechanical renames propagate as expected.</p>
Problems
<ol>
<li>This won&#x27;t work with dynamic attributes; not sure if this is a problem or not.</li>
<li>Using <code>__name__</code> is arguably pretty unsightly and is maybe considered unidiomatic, not sure 🙂</li>
</ol>
Alternatives
<ol>
<li><p>Do nothing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maybe Pytest and others with monkeypatching APIs should support functions as first-class &quot;nameable&quot; objects? In other words, Ruff could instead recommend:</p>
<pre><code>monkeypatch.setattr(some_module, some_module.my_important_api.__name__, replacement)
</code></pre>
<p>...and Pytest would do the <code>__name__</code> access internally. This would require upstream changes, but would be a lot visually cleaner from the user&#x27;s side.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I understand correctly, we could get by without type inference if we&#x27;re just looking for <code>monkeypatch.setattr</code> with a string as the second argument and recommending to use <code>__name__</code> instead. I think we&#x27;d only need type inference if we were trying to resolve the definition of the string. But I could definitely be missing something.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, yeah, I misunderstood the proposal. A type-aware lint rule could actually tell you when your patch is patching something that doesn&#x27;t exist, but a non-type-aware rule could just tell you to not use strings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, sorry for the confusion! I was thinking of this as a purely naive lint, i.e. no type or actual attribute awareness.</p>
