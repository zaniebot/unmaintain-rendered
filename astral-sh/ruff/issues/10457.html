            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be quite useful to be able to specify the <code>requires-python</code> version. I just had a case where I was using the zoneinfo module that was added to the standard library in 3.9, and I was surprised that Ruff sorted it under third-party imports (see also https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6475 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13354). So I think it would be great if Ruff could support the metadata comment block for that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@InSyncWithFoo a short design outline would be great. Which configuration options are supported (what about <code>exclude</code>?), how do we plan on integrating it (short outline)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I'm afraid I don't follow. What I meant to say is that I got a fix working locally for the <code>organize_import()</code> function (and thus <code>I001</code> in general), and I'm asking whether I should submit a PR, because, if the function needs to be redesigned entirely, the fix will only be a maintenance burden.</p>
<p>The fix is just to parse the metadata and override <code>settings.target_version</code> with its <code>requires_python</code> if that is found. You can see it for yourself <a href="https://github.com/InSyncWithFoo/ruff/commit/0b00c81b76d5c1f032d9015dd709355fd7975107">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@InSyncWithFoo I think it should be solved holistically. It's otherwise confusing why some rules respect the script's target versions but others don't. I'm open to only supporting a subset of the configuration options.</p>
