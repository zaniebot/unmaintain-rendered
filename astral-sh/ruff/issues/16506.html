            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue is going to be a bit under-specified, but essentially, with the new <code>Diagnostic</code> type defined in #16503, we&#x27;ll want to provide a routine for rendering it into a pleasing output. This is a prerequisite for actually using this type inside of Red Knot.</p>
<p>We already have an existing renderer build on top of the old diagnostic types. I expect to be able to re-use <em>some</em> of that, but it was somewhat hamstrung by the more limited data model we were working with.</p>
<p>I believe the main challenge in building the renderer will be collecting annotations in a way that renders sensible. For example, multiple annotations might point to the same line of code. It will be the renderer&#x27;s job to make sure we aren&#x27;t showing the same line of code multiple times.</p>
<p>We will still use our vendored copy of <code>annotate-snippets</code>, so this shouldn&#x27;t require doing the actual rendering logic for how to print code and annotations to a terminal.</p>
