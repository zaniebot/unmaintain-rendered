<p>Hi,</p>
<p><a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2011/02/this-code-is-crap.html">CRAP</a> looks like quite interesting metric:
from https://helpthisbook.com/lou-franco/swimming-in-tech-debt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The riskiest code to change has a combination of high complexity and low coverage, which makes it harder to understand and harder to verify. To make both of these metrics more evident to me, I use the Coverage Gutters and CodeMetrics extensions in VSCode. Whenever I am editing a function that is risky to change, VSCode shows a lot of red indicators around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>also I found this <a href="https://github.com/mattjmorrison/pycrap">implementation</a> but last update was 13 years ago.</p>
<p>But for make it work coverage report is needed, so, it would be sort of conditional check which works only if coverage report is available.</p>
<p>Of course it&#x27;s nice to just highlight CRAP code in IDE/editor, but I don&#x27;t know is it possible and make sense to implement it in LSP, but can be also rule with some threshold for fail if too much CRAP.</p>
