            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This relates to PR #2599 in which it is planned to have the fix work only for basic cases with comments and pretty much nothing else in between because some other cases break it.</p>
<p>Eventually once we have autofix levels (see #1992) we can add that option to not include the restrictions.</p>
