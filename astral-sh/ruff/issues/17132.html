            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I defined a fixture in <code>conftest.py</code> and I was expecting a violation since it satisfies the same logic as described in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/pytest-fixture-param-without-value/">rule description.</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># in conftest.py
def my_fixture() -&gt; None:
    pass
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test_something(my_fixture: None):
    pass
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at the code, it seems that you'd need to prefix the fixture with an underscore, so <code>_my_fixture</code> works, which I think would be to match the upstream rule (?).</p>
<p>So, the following would work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def test_some(_my_fixture: None):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>You'd also need to use <code>test_</code> prefix and not suffix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It does work when prefixing with an underscore. When reading the rationale (<a href="https://github.com/m-burst/flake8-pytest-style/blob/master/docs/rules/PT019.md">upstream</a> and <code>ruff</code>, i.e., unused fixture in the test function) it seems to me that it should apply to any fixture that is not used in the test function, so also those not prefixed. Unless fixtures should be prefixed all the time? 🤔</p>

<p>Good catch. It was just in this minimal example.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The rule uses heuristics to detect fixtures, and we need to balance false positives (where Ruff detects something as a fixture where it isn't) with false negatives. That's why it requires the underscore.</p>
