<p>This blocks usages of <code>from libfaketime import fake_time</code>.  It can be useful in some unit/integration tests, but is unlikely to be wanted in regular non-test code.</p>
<p>This would be nice to have in ruff. I'm not sure if there are other similar imports that could be detected, maybe <code>freezegun</code>?</p>

<p>If it's about flagging specific imports, than banned-api's is what you want.</p>
