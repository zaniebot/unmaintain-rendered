# Broken link in documentation

---

_Issue opened by @vectro on 2023-12-15 00:13_

A number of the documentation Markdown files contain a link to `settings.md`; but that file does not exist.

For example, the file `docs/configuration.md` contains this link:
```
For a complete enumeration of the available configuration options, see [_Settings_](settings.md).
```

`settings.md` is auto-generated and not exist on repo.

This is intentional -- the docs are intended to be consumed via https://docs.astral.sh/ and not via the checked-in Markdown, which really represent source files.
