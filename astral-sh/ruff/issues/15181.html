            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you have a <code>with</code> statement with two context managers with fairly long name, running <code>ruff format</code> will put them on a separate line:</p>
<pre><code>with (
    GenericContextManagerWithAFairlyLongName() as some_volume,
    GenericContextManagerWithAFairlyLongName() as gcm2,
):
</code></pre>
<p>I don't quite understand why, but this is considered invalid syntax in Python 3.8.</p>
<p>A reproduction can be found here:
https://github.com/bblommers/ruff-py3.8-compat/pull/2</p>
<p>The original source is included in the PR.</p>
<p>The CI workflow formats it using <code>ruff</code>, and you can see that the invocation of the original file succeeds - but invoking the formatted file fails in Python 3.7/3.8:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you set the target version (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#target-version) to 3.8 it should fix this.</p>
<p>Parentheses here are only supported in 3.9+ because the syntax wasn't possible to implement with the old parser (https://peps.python.org/pep-0617/ if you're interested)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our project does have the <code>python_requires</code> metadata set, but in <code>setup.cfg</code> instead of in <code>pyproject.toml</code> - I guess that's why <code>ruff</code> doesn't pick it up.</p>
<p>And TIL about the PEP! It actually specifically mentions this example 🙂</p>
<p>Thank you for the info @wookie184!</p>
