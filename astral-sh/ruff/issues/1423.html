            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran the pre-commit on all files and I noticed that the result is reported in a fractionated manner as shown in the image below

I was expecting an overall result at the end with the total number of errors found.</p>
<p>Is this an expected behaviour? I can't seem to get the pattern of when the result is displayed, it's not per module, nor per rule 🤷‍♂️</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I think we need to set <code>require_serial: true</code> in the hook. I added that, but the mirror-maker seems to have ignored or reverted it. Will find a way to fix.</p>
