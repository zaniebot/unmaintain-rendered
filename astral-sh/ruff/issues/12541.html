            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to have a CI job report new, unsupported codes for the plugins (or tools) that ruff already has some support for. There could be a blacklist of codes that were purposefully omitted in ruff.</p>
<p>As it stands now, users have to request support for new codes. Reading in the docs that e.g. <code>flake8-builtins</code> rules are supported may also give the wrong impression that ruff and the plugin are on par. Searching in the issue tracker may not return a relevant issue. The user then has to visit the flake8 extension&#x27;s page and compare the ruleset with ruff&#x27;s rules.</p>
<p>Since the list of supported plugins and tools is known, extracting the codes should be straightforward.</p>
<p>Would there be interest in such a CI job?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @nkakouros</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. Can you tell me more about what the CI job would do and how it would work? What does it do when it detects a missing rule?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s a reasonable request but I have no idea how we&#x27;d extract them reliably.</p>
