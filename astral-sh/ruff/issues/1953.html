            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like that ruff, for the most part, is drop-in replacement for flake8. In terms of local development, I have found this to be true and usability is fantastic.</p>
<p>The problem I've run into is that, it lacks support for <code>pylint</code> format, one of the two formatters included in flake8:
https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/internal/formatters.html</p>
<p>We use Jenkins for CI and a lot of useful mappings for pylint format are missing for the standard PEP8 text format.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyone else in the same boat? Is this worthwhile to build?</p>
<p>Also, is it in line with what this project is trying to do?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the kind words, it means a lot, truly!</p>
<p>I haven't used Pylint format before so bear with me as I confirm: the requirement here is just that we tweak the output message format, right? (E.g., today we support <code>ruff /path/to/file.py --format junit</code> to output XML; so the request here is to support <code>--format pylint</code>, and use the format specified in the Flake8 docs?)</p>
<p>If so: we can definitely support that, and it should be very easy to do.</p>

<p>I can try to fork and play around with this first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the most part, what you want is in <code>printer.rs</code>. We'd want to add a new case there for <code>SerializationFormat::Pylint</code> (and to the enum itself in <code>src/settings/types.rs</code>).</p>
