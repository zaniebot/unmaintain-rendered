            <div class="timeline-body"><p>there are several types in <code>collections.abc</code> that make no sense being there like <code>Callable</code>, <code>Awaitable</code>, <code>Coroutine</code>, so i think they should instead be imported from <code>typing</code>.</p>
<p>it would be nice to be able to disable this rule for types like those</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand this perspective, but at the same time, members like <code>typing.Callable</code> are officially deprecated since Python 3.9 (see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/">PEP 585</a>, or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable"><code>typing</code> docs</a>), and may not even exist in future versions of Python -- so we'd be adding an option to opt-in to ignoring a deprecation based on a disagreement with a change in the standard library. I want to keep a high bar for adding configuration options, and I don't think this would meet that bar.</p>
