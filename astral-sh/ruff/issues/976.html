            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems that in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/964, the call to <code>set_up_logging</code> was moved so it could take into account the configured output format:</p>
<p>https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/61ba7c8792192403f1e41dd226b6db26aa7dcdd4/src/main.rs#L271-L277</p>
<p>This means that logs generated at any point before that call use the default <code>Off</code> level and logs are never emitted. For example, the debug messages in this function are ignored:</p>
<p>https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/f6b0a606d688dd075971f039f0f818e84bd9b2f2/src/settings/pyproject.rs#L83-L95</p>
<p>I think this was done so it's safe to redirect JSON output for other programs to process, without the logging lines polluting the output.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to send logs to stderr. I can send a PR.</p>
