            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, currently N813 is raised even for cases such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import netCDF4 as nc
</code></pre>
<p>which seem innocuous from the point of view of the rule: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/camelcase-imported-as-lowercase/</p>
<p>Would it make sense to restrict the applicability of this rule to cases where <code>name.to_lowercase() == asname.to_lowercase()</code>? I would be happy to send a PR if that was the case!</p>

<p>For me that means <code>pep8-naming</code> also implemented this in a suboptimal way—this violation shouldn't show up for module aliases imo.</p>
