Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Ruff version: 0.0.253</p>
<p>Gitlab Code Quality formatter <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/2383228709f109343de7821affd128ea00046677/crates/ruff_cli/src/printer.rs#L353">sets <code>fingerprint</code></a> to a code of the issue, e.g. F401.</p>
<p>But this field should be a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html#implement-a-custom-tool">unique value</a> identifying a single violation, not its type. As a consequence, multiple violations of the same type are not visible (only the last one is shown).</p>
<p>It makes the feature unusable, for a project with currently 120 violations Gitlab only shows 7 (as there are 7 unique types of violations).</p>
