One thing that I think is very valuable about mypy is per-module configuration (in config file or inline), it would be great if red-knot had similar expressivity

We plan on adding support to have configurations per path (e.g., all files in a directory or a specific file). But I think that's roughly the equivalent of per-module configuration.

The infrastructure already exists for toggling rule. The only thing that's missing is exposing this to the user. I'll close this and create a new issue for persistent configuration.
