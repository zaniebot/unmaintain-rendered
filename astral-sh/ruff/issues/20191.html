            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>The 'https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/2820' mentions a derivative work of or direct inclusion of parts of GPL library. Won't this affect the license of the package?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our general stance is that independently implementing rules (as opposed to copying, directly adapting, or directly including source code) does not create a derivative work or introduce those kinds of license obligations. The intent is to implement compatible APIs, rather than reuse or adapt the underlying source code. The situation is a little different for tools like pyupgrade, where we did directly port logic (e.g., tokenization helpers) at one point or another. I think that line was added to the license before we'd established a clear policy here, so it should probably be removed. I can do a pass over the license to draw a clearer distinction.</p>
