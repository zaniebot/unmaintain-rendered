            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Upgraded to black 22.12.0 (preview mode) and noticed that ruff now disagrees with black over how to format this:</p>
<pre><code>def analytics_call(fn):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Decorator for all functions below that write to segment.com.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    # Catch and log errors but don't propagate. We don't want analytics write failure to bubble up
    # to user actions.
    # Ensure write_key is present or log warning.
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff <code>D202</code> wants to get rid of the blank line after docstring, but black requires that it be there (only since the next bit of code is a comment). I don't know how Flake8 does it but I think black's way makes sense here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Confusingly, if I run <code>black --preview</code> on 22.12.0 over this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def analytics_call(fn):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Decorator for all functions below that write to segment.com.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Catch and log errors but don't propagate. We don't want analytics write failure to bubble up
    # to user actions.
    # Ensure write_key is present or log warning.
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't add that newline. Is that what you're seeing?</p>
