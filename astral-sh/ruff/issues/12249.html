            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it would be useful if <code>ruff check</code> could group the output by rule violated, perhaps even with the number of instances explicitly given.
This can be useful for cases where the violation is not easily fixable to decide whether to supress it case-by-case or turn it off altogether.</p>
<p>Currently, there is a &quot;grouped&quot; option, but this groups violations per file, not per rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It almost does. I had missed that option :).
It still would be nice to allow to show each instance grouped by the rule violation. But it's definitely good enough for the issue I mentioned above.</p>
<p>It is a bit confusing that it is separate from <code>--output-format</code>, as it appears to be just another output format :)</p>

<p>I think the <code>--statistics</code> flag was adopted from <code>flake8</code> which is why it is separate. There's also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4140#issuecomment-1527807554">this comment</a> for context.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The other reason why it's different is because <code>ruff check --statistics --output-format=json</code> emits json.</p>
