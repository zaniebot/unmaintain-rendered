Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>A typical error I (and colleagues) run into is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;] 
# results in:
mylist # ['a', 'bc']

# as opposed to the intended [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] 
</code></pre>
<p>While this pattern is often well known, this pattern can often lead to unintended side effects, which are hard to track and detect.</p>
<p>This suggestion is in line with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3126/">pep3126</a> (which was rejected due to &quot;the feature to be removed isn’t all that harmful&quot;).</p>
<p>I have searched existing ruff rules and only found the ISC rules, which do not cover this pattern. The proposed pattern is in line with some of the ISC rules (<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/single-line-implicit-string-concatenation/">ISC001</a>), while I would say it disagrees with (<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/explicit-string-concatenation/">ISC003</a>)</p>

<p>Thank's. That's helpful. This is related to #13014 Overall it seems that there could be an addition of one more implicit string concatenation rule that detects suspicious usages (vs denying it for stylistic reasons). Although it isn't clear to me how to solve the overlap with ISC001, and ISC002</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The auto fix does still seem problematic to me. I can of course just disable it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vs denying it for stylistic reasons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't call denying a pattern that often carries bugs a stylistic reason - the discussion around the pep acknowledged this as well, with the reason for not removing it mainly concerning backward compatibility. A choice that I fully understand, but where it is hard to remove it is easy to prevent using linters.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I do think the change is inherently incompatible. ISC002 and ISC003 prefer implicit concatenation over explicit concatenation (ISC001 is fully compatible at least during linting). Where I would argue anytime you see a string concatenation in a list, set, etc. (<code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;]</code>) it is much more likely to be a bug than an intended string concatenation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The exact autofix behaviour you want from ISC001 here likely depends on whether the single-line implicit concatenation was introduced by a human or by an autoformatter. If the implicitly concatenated string was added by a human, then it's almost certainly a mistake, and the human likely meant to put a comma in between the two strings (as you say @KennethEnevoldsen). But if it was inserted by an autoformatter, it was probably previously a multiline implicitly concatenated string that the autoformatter realised was needleslly spread out over multiple lines; in that case, the proper autofix is to merge the two strings, as <code>ISC001</code> currently does.</p>
<p>Ideally we'd just fix Black and the Ruff formatter so that they never create single-line implicitly concatenated strings in the first place. But the <code>ISC001</code> rule (originally as a flake8 plugin) was originally created to address an issue where Black would often undesirably collapse multiline implicitly concatenated strings into single-line implicitly concatenated strings. So that's probably the motivation for the current autofix behaviour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not really possible for a linter rule to know whether the implicit concatenation was introduced by a human or an autoformatter...!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the clarification @AlexWaygood, this gives a lot of context to the current formulation of <code>ISC001</code>. From the warning it also seems to conflict with the ruff formatter:</p>
<pre><code>warning: The following rules may cause conflicts when used with the formatter: `ISC001`.
</code></pre>
<p>Just to be clear, I don't believe the auto fix behavior <code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;] -&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]</code> should be implemented.</p>
<p>I (and I imagine others as well) would prefer a set of rules with simply raise a linting error on implicit string concatenation (not only in a single line). This resolves the conflict with the formatter (as far as I understand) and makes parsing simpler. Naturally, it would be optional and incompatible with ISC003.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I <em>think</em> you can already get what you're asking for @KennethEnevoldsen using this configuration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = [&quot;ISC&quot;]
unfixable = [&quot;ISC001&quot;]

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-implicit-str-concat]
allow-multiline = false
</code></pre>
<p>That will result in Ruff complaining about both single-line and multiline implicitly concatenated strings, and it will switch off the autofix for ISC001 (even if you run Ruff with <code>--fix</code>).</p>

<p>Black has a fix in preview mode to prevent some of the ISC-related issues, but it's not been ready for the past couple of annual style releases. See https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2188.</p>
