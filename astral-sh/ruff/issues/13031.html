<p>A typical error I (and colleagues) run into is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;] 
# results in:
mylist # [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;bc&#x27;]

# as opposed to the intended [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] 
</code></pre>
<p>While this pattern is often well known, this pattern can often lead to unintended side effects, which are hard to track and detect.</p>
<p>This suggestion is in line with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3126/">pep3126</a> (which was rejected due to &quot;the feature to be removed isn’t all that harmful&quot;).</p>
<p>I have searched existing ruff rules and only found the ISC rules, which do not cover this pattern. The proposed pattern is in line with some of the ISC rules (<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/single-line-implicit-string-concatenation/">ISC001</a>), while I would say it disagrees with (<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/explicit-string-concatenation/">ISC003</a>)</p>

<p>Thank&#x27;s. That&#x27;s helpful. This is related to #13014 Overall it seems that there could be an addition of one more implicit string concatenation rule that detects suspicious usages (vs denying it for stylistic reasons). Although it isn&#x27;t clear to me how to solve the overlap with ISC001, and ISC002</p>

<p>The auto fix does still seem problematic to me. I can of course just disable it.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call denying a pattern that often carries bugs a stylistic reason - the discussion around the pep acknowledged this as well, with the reason for not removing it mainly concerning backward compatibility. A choice that I fully understand, but where it is hard to remove it is easy to prevent using linters.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I do think the change is inherently incompatible. ISC002 and ISC003 prefer implicit concatenation over explicit concatenation (ISC001 is fully compatible at least during linting). Where I would argue anytime you see a string concatenation in a list, set, etc. (<code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;]</code>) it is much more likely to be a bug than an intended string concatenation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The exact autofix behaviour you want from ISC001 here likely depends on whether the single-line implicit concatenation was introduced by a human or by an autoformatter. If the implicitly concatenated string was added by a human, then it&#x27;s almost certainly a mistake, and the human likely meant to put a comma in between the two strings (as you say @KennethEnevoldsen). But if it was inserted by an autoformatter, it was probably previously a multiline implicitly concatenated string that the autoformatter realised was needleslly spread out over multiple lines; in that case, the proper autofix is to merge the two strings, as <code>ISC001</code> currently does.</p>
<p>Ideally we&#x27;d just fix Black and the Ruff formatter so that they never create single-line implicitly concatenated strings in the first place. But the <code>ISC001</code> rule (originally as a flake8 plugin) was originally created to address an issue where Black would often undesirably collapse multiline implicitly concatenated strings into single-line implicitly concatenated strings. So that&#x27;s probably the motivation for the current autofix behaviour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not really possible for a linter rule to know whether the implicit concatenation was introduced by a human or an autoformatter...!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the clarification @AlexWaygood, this gives a lot of context to the current formulation of <code>ISC001</code>. From the warning it also seems to conflict with the ruff formatter:</p>
<pre><code>warning: The following rules may cause conflicts when used with the formatter: `ISC001`.
</code></pre>
<p>Just to be clear, I don&#x27;t believe the auto fix behavior <code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; &quot;c&quot;] -&gt; [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]</code> should be implemented.</p>
<p>I (and I imagine others as well) would prefer a set of rules with simply raise a linting error on implicit string concatenation (not only in a single line). This resolves the conflict with the formatter (as far as I understand) and makes parsing simpler. Naturally, it would be optional and incompatible with ISC003.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I <em>think</em> you can already get what you&#x27;re asking for @KennethEnevoldsen using this configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = [&quot;ISC&quot;]
unfixable = [&quot;ISC001&quot;]

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-implicit-str-concat]
allow-multiline = false
</code></pre>
<p>That will result in Ruff complaining about both single-line and multiline implicitly concatenated strings, and it will switch off the autofix for ISC001 (even if you run Ruff with <code>--fix</code>).</p>

<p>Black has a fix in preview mode to prevent some of the ISC-related issues, but it&#x27;s not been ready for the past couple of annual style releases. See <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2188">psf/black#2188</a>.</p>
