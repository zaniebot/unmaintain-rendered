# Introduce a "nursery" group for diagnostics

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-05-10 20:32_

We'd like to create a `nursery` group where we can add any new rules that must be enabled explicitly. This would allow us to ship experimental rules that require explicit opt-in for some period of time. As an example, we'd like to do this with the new `pycodestyle` rules.

If a contributor is interested in working on this, I can help scope out the work involved.
