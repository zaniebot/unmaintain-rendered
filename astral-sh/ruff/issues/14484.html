            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The fix for FAST002 is marked as always unsafe, but there isn't a <code>## Fix safety</code> section in the documentation explaining why it is marked as unsafe.</p>
<p>I can think of an obvious reason why the fix might be unsafe on Python 3.8 and lower: the fix adds imports of <code>typing_extensions</code> on Python 3.8 and lower, while the user's code might not have <code>typing_extensions</code> listed as a dependency. However, it's not immediately obvious to me (as a non-expert when it comes to <code>fastAPI</code>) what the exact reasons are for the fix being marked as unsafe on Python 3.9+.</p>
<p>It would be great to add better docs here. Cc. @TomerBin, who implemented the rule in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11579 and @charliermarsh, who merged it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At the time it was merged, we weren't handling defaults correctly. If I remember correctly, an improvement was deployed later so we need to check if it's still the case.
This is the relevant fix
