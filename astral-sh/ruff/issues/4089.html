Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>The set of rules from  #3924 was not added to the documentation</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, the docs failed to build. Will fix today.</p>
<p>In the interim, you can find these relevant docs in Bandit: https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/b602_subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true.html.</p>
<p>Note that there's some discussion around whether these rules should be tweaked or even removed (they're consistent with Bandit, but they're quite strict): #4054, #4045.</p>
