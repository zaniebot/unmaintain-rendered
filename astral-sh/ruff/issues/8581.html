            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d like to see ruff convert imports from private modules to imports from the parent package if the member is declared in <code>__all__</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe an example makes it clearer:</p>
<pre><code># ./client.py
from .myp._private import Member
from .myp._private import OtherMember

assert Member

# ./myp/__init__.py
__all__ = [&quot;Member&quot;]

from ._private import Member

# ./myp/_private.py
class Member: ...

class OtherMember: ...

</code></pre>
<p>I consider modules starting with an underscore private. Based on the rule, ruff would fix this snippet to:</p>
<pre><code># ./client.py
from .myp import Member
from .myp._private import OtherMember

assert Member

# ./myp/__init__.py
__all__ = [&quot;Member&quot;]

from ._private import Member

# ./myp/_private.py
class Member: ...

class OtherMember: ...
