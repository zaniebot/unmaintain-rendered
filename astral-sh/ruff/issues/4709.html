            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On page https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/ in the table of contents, the rules are sorted by name, and then they go on in the order in which they were added to the linter.</p>
<p>For ease of use, it is best to disable the sorting of the table of contents.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, excuse me. I meant the list here:
<img width="812" alt="image" src="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/assets/945306/f2c183bc-2944-4d61-96cf-d9569237f8b8"></p>
<p>But it turns out that these are links to pypi packages, not links within the page. It's just that this huge list of packages that are supported is confusing, I thought it was the table of contents inside the page.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, no problem. Yeah, I can see why that's confusing. It may not be correct to include those at all in this context, since the rules are enumerated on the left anyway.</p>
