  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<h3>Issue</h3>
<p>I use the <code>DJ</code> extension of ruff. I just found out that this doesn't work on forms that don't use ModelForm directly but an inherited class. This relates to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/django-exclude-with-model-form/#django-exclude-with-model-form-dj006">DJ006</a>.</p>
<h3>Code example</h3>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyModelForm(ModelForm):
    pass


class MyFancyForm(MyModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = MyFancyModel
        exclude = (&quot;my_field&quot;,)
</code></pre>
<p>When I change the inheritance from <code>MyModelForm</code>  to <code>ModelForm</code>, it complains as expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12865 and applies to all other Django rules. Ruff doesn't support multi-file analysis. Some rules have some hacky implementations that follow inheritance chains in the same file, but these are more one-offs and it breaks as soon as you move the classes to different files. We're working on a more refined semantic model for ruff that supports multifile analysis but it's still far out.</p>
