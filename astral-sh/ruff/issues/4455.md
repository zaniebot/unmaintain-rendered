<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
D403 should check that the first character of a docstring is a letter :
```
D403 First word of the first line should be capitalized: `'ele'` -> `'ele'`
```

Can you include your Ruff version? Thought we fixed this in a recent release.

That's weird, I can't reproduce it right now. Sorry for the noise (and for the too short bug report...).

No worries, if it pops up again feel free to re-open.
