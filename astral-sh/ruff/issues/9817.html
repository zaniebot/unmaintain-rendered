            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Following https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/25738, I tried updating my code to only use non-deprecated numpy API as follow</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if NUMPY_VERSION &gt;= (2, 0, 0):
    from numpy import trapezoid as trapezoid
else:
    from numpy import trapz as trapezoid  # noqa: NPY003
</code></pre>
<p>ruff keeps reformatting to</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if NUMPY_VERSION &gt;= (2, 0, 0):
    from numpy import trapezoid as trapezoid
else:
    pass  # noqa: NPY003
</code></pre>
<p>Not only does seem to ignore my noqa comments, it also feels broken that it would just remove the import statement altogether. This happens in a module that's just there to provide a compatibility layer, and doesn't use the <code>trapezoid</code> function, so I'm guessing it's playing badly with <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-import/">F401</a> ?</p>
<p>I've tried this with ruff version 0.1.9 and 0.2.0, to no avail.
Also tried with <code># noqa: NPY201</code> and <code># noqa: NPY</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@neutrinoceros - I think Ruff just has no way to know that the import exists for the purpose of a re-export. (We avoid treating <code>from foo import x as x</code> imports as unused, since that's a de facto pattern for re-exporting members.) Do you have a suggestion for how Ruff would &quot;know&quot; not to remove the import here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Separately, it should be <code># noqa: F401</code>, not <code># noqa: NPY003</code> -- since the rule that's causing the import to be removed is <code>F401</code>, so that's the rule you want to suppress.</p>

<p>damnit, I was so close to the right idea. What got me is that I didn't actually research the lint rule number for unused import <em>before</em> I wrote the ticket 😅</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't, <code># noqa: F401</code> seems sufficient actually ! thank you very much for your input. I think we can close this now !</p>
