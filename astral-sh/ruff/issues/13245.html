Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>The current <code>extend</code> configuration is great for large monorepos where we want to extend configuration from a higher level, but for teams that have multiple separate repos, but still want a unified base configuration, it would be useful to allow <code>extend</code> to extend a remote file (with that file being cached for offline use).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
extend = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canonical/starbase/v1/pyproject.toml&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#extends">Mend Renovate's <code>extends</code></a> but without the complexity of converting repository descriptions to URLs.</p>
