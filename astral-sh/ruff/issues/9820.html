            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff subsumed Python linters improving upon their performance by more than an order of magnitude. Amazing.</p>
<p>Then, the Ruff team subsumed Black and isort, again revolutionizing Python developer tools, giving us a fast, well maintained, high quality alternative with excellent documentation. Awesome!</p>
<p>There is just one more tool left in my Python workflow: Pyright. Since introducing static typing to my Python repo, it has become an essential sidekick, with the LSP making for an awesome interactive development experience as part of the VS Code extension, and the command-line static type checker has become an integral part of my pre-commit hook.</p>
<p>There is just one small problem with Pyright: it's not as fast as Ruff! A full Pyright run takes 15.430s on the 60K lines of Python in one of my repos. That can be a long time to wait when committing changes. Ruff check takes 0.068s, and Ruff format takes 0.078s.</p>
<p>This feature request is therefore for the Ruff team to do the obvious thing and implement static type checking to subsume the functionality of Pyright and other similar tools. That would make Ruff a true, all-in-one, complete tool for Python linting, formatting, and type checking - a one-stop shop for writing high quality Python code and the only tool you need in your pre-commit.</p>
