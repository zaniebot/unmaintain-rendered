<p>It looks like there's no rule for this at all (tested w/ <code>--select ALL</code>), even though it looks pretty weird and would even be easy to auto-fix.</p>
<p>There are rules for similar issues when docstrings are involved (e.g. <code>D201</code>), but nothing that does the same in undocumented code.</p>
