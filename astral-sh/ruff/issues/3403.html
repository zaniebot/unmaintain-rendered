            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A common error with Python inheritance is to try to explicitly call base class methods:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Any

class C:
    def __init__(self, x: int, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.x = x


class D(C):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -&gt; None:
        C.__init__(self, 1, **kwargs)  # Bad!
        # super().__init__(x=1, **kwargs)  # Good.


class E(C):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs: Any) -&gt; None:
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.y = 2


class F(D, E):
    pass


f = F()
print(f.x, f.y)  # AttributeError: 'F' object has no attribute 'y'
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with <code>D</code>'s definition is that <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> can come along and now <code>E</code>'s initializer is not called.</p>
<p>This is a problem with all methods (not just <code>__init__</code>) although <code>__init__</code> is the most common place this fails.</p>
<p>In general, I think it should be a Ruff error to call a base class method explicitly rather than through <code>super</code>.  Here's an example of <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/a07cb65459f24446e82354854ff6658f29414c0a/pandas/core/frame.py#L852">this error</a>.</p>
<p>The same problem would manifest with <code>__enter__</code>, <code>__exit__</code>, or any user-defined method that exhibits cooperative inheritance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have UP008, which handles the <em>arguments</em> portion to <code>__super__</code>, but I guess this is different in that we don't catch the <code>C</code> in <code>C.__init__</code>. Is that right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, seems similar.  The problem here is that you should rarely (if ever) call your superclass by its name: <code>C.__init__(...</code>.  You should instead call it like this <code>super().__init__(...</code></p>

<p>What do you mean? Ruff hasn't done anything. I'm +1-ing the feature request to catch this (to prevent regressions) with a real-world example and asking for an autofix at the same time.</p>
