Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>When ruff fails to parse a file, it appears that fixable rules are still attempted to be fixed, even though ruff can't interpret the file properly. There are likely other rules where this is a problem, but I have noticed it for when the &quot;RUF&quot; fixable rule is invoked, with the &quot;RUF100&quot; rule causing valid noqa comments to be removed when there is a failure to parse the file.</p>
<p>I propose that <code>--fix</code> should not be attempted on any file which does not parse.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path


def shadows_builtin(dir: Path) -&gt; None:  # noqa: A002
    print(dir)  # noqa: T201

def unfinished_func

</code></pre>
<p>The noqas here are valid, but there is a function being typed which leaves an invalid statement making the file invalid for parsing, the user has saved the file with ctrl+s and the ruff linter has been run on the file on save with the --fix arg, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>ruff --select &quot;RUF,A,T&quot; --fixable &quot;RUF&quot; --fix unparsable_script.py  --isolated
</code></pre>
<p>This leaves the file as</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pathlib import Path


def shadows_builtin(dir: Path) -&gt; None:
    print(dir)

def unfinished_func

</code></pre>
<p>For large files with lots of noqas, this is especially annoying.</p>
<p>Ruff version 0.0.269</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, you're right sorry. I was using the latest available from snap which wasn't the latest available from pypi. Using the latest doesn't have this issue, I can confirm! Thanks @charliermarsh</p>
