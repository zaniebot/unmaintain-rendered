            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am facing a use-case when I need to have 1 .py file very well documented, so I'd like to enable <code>D</code> rules only for that file.</p>
<p>I figured I could <strong>ignore</strong> certain rules in specific files with:</p>
<pre><code>--per-file-ignores &lt;PER_FILE_IGNORES&gt;
    List of mappings from file pattern to code to exclude
--extend-per-file-ignores &lt;EXTEND_PER_FILE_IGNORES&gt;
    Like `--per-file-ignores`, but adds additional ignores on top of those already specified
</code></pre>
<p>But there is no way to <strong>extend-select</strong> current rule set with a rule for a specific file.</p>
<p>I do not really want to enable <code>D</code> for entire project, then to ignore entire project except 1 file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like the other issue https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3172 was closed as completed (since <code>[extend-]per-file-ignores</code> is now implemented), but <code>[extend-]per-file-select</code> was never implemented. @charliermarsh, do you think we could re-open this issue?</p>
