Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Right now, the latest release of <code>flake8-to-ruff</code> is <code>0.0.216.dev0</code> (~2 weeks ago) and the latest release of <code>ruff</code> is <code>0.0.231</code> (yesterday).</p>
<p>This makes things a little bit confusing as when using the <code>--plugin</code> option <code>flake8-to-ruff</code> is complaining that plugins are not supported when they are listed in the README as supported, e.g. <code>flake8-no-pep420</code> <em>(supported since ~1 week ago)</em> and <code>flake8-use-pathlib</code> <em>(supported since yesterday)</em>.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to automatically trigger a release of <code>flake8-to-ruff</code> after a successful release of <code>ruff</code> to avoid this confusion?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah. At the very least I'll start cutting a new release every time. flake8-to-ruff is also a little behind and needs to be updated to include those plugins (a small code change), so I'll do that today too.</p>

<p>I did suspect that there might be something more to it. Thanks! 🚀</p>
