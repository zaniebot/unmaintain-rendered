            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>There are a lot of questions around --fix and --diff and so on but I didn&#x27;t find one that matched this condition.</p>
<p>We are trying to run <code>ruff check</code> in CI, and also in a git pre-commit hook which checks each commit when you do <code>git commit</code>.</p>
<p>The best behavior for the pre-commit hook, I think, is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixes are applied if possible</li>
<li>Diffs are shown for <em>all applied fixes</em> and <em>any remaining unfixable issues</em></li>
<li>Return non-zero if there any remaining issues, and the value in the case everything was fixed isn&#x27;t too important for our use-case (as the pre-commit hook knows to fail if there are modified files regardless of the exit code)</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I can tell, we can&#x27;t get this behavior curently? <code>--fix</code> doens&#x27;t show diffs for fixed issues. <code>--fix --diff</code> doesn&#x27;t apply any fixes at all.</p>
<p>In the local git hook you want the behavior above since <code>--fix</code> lets you immediately <code>add -u</code> to stage the fixes, but you also want to see the diff so you know what happened and what the diagnostic was.</p>
<p>When running the same code in CI, you really want the console output off the diff &amp; reason since --fix does not provide a benefit there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is it necessary that the shown fixes are diffs?</p>
<p>If not, we changed the <code>--output-format=full</code> (the default) to show fixes when using <code>--preview</code>. I think running <code>ruff check --fix --preview</code> should then be what you&#x27;re looking for (be mindful, <code>--preview</code> also enables the preview rule behavior. There&#x27;s currently no way of opting in to the changed CLI behavior only)</p>

<p>Not really, just some format that shows the error. I should not have said diff really: I guess the ideal format is actually the usual &quot;error is here&quot; format you get when you don&#x27;t use <code>--diff</code>.</p>

<p>Oh, that&#x27;s great. So if it&#x27;s <code>--preview</code> today, I can anticipate that it may show up as the default in the future (if there isn&#x27;t a bunch of backlash in the meantime)?</p>

<p>Yes, we plan on stabilizing this feature as part of our next minor, which we aim to release early January</p>
