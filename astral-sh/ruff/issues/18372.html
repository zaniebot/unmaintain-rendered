            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<pre><code class="language-pyi">from abc import abstractmethod
from typing import override

class BaseWithCustomStr:
    @override  # overrides `builtins.__str__`
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self, /) -&gt; str: ...  # ✅

class ImplWithCustomStr(BaseWithCustomStr):
    @override
    def __str__(self, /) -&gt; str: ...  # ❌ Defining `__str__` in a stub is almost always redundant
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>ImplWithCustomStr.__str__</code> <em>must</em> be defined here. Because if omitted, <code>mypy</code> will report it as an error:</p>
<pre><code>abstract_pyi029_repro.pyi:9: error: Class abstract_pyi029_repro.ImplWithCustomStr has abstract attributes &quot;__str__&quot;  [misc]
abstract_pyi029_repro.pyi:9: note: If it is meant to be abstract, add 'abc.ABCMeta' as an explicit metaclass
</code></pre>
<p>Stubtest also isn't happy about this, even if <code># type: ignore[misc]</code>'d.</p>

<p>The playground unfortunately doesn't support pyi files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Makes sense, this seems like a bug to me. We could probably detect this currently within the same file, but we'll need multi-file analysis to resolve base classes from other files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It'll solve this problem for my projects, and it might convince some others to also start using <code>@override</code>. But as far as I've seen, not many stub maintainers use <code>@override</code>; even typeshed doesn't (and are not interested in doing so: https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/14115).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I agree that we should at least try to avoid emitting this lint on classes that override <code>@abstractmethod</code> <code>__str__</code> methods. Obviously there's only so much we can do in Ruff there right now due to the limitations of single-file analysis, but we should do what we can.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I see the value of special-casing <code>@override</code>-decorated methods. If a <code>__str__</code> method on a class is decorated with <code>@override</code>, all that tells you is that the type checker will enforce that some superclass of that class also has a <code>__str__</code> method. And that doesn't actually tell us anything at all, because every single class in Python has a superclass with a <code>__str__</code> method (<code>object</code> has a <code>__str__</code> method). What we want to know is whether the <code>__str__</code> method on the superclass is decorated with <code>@abstractmethod</code>, and whether or not the subclass <code>__str__</code> method is decorated with <code>@override</code> doesn't help us there unfortunately.</p>
