            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When following the recommendation of 13031, you get the warning:</p>
<pre><code>warning: The following rules may cause conflicts when used with the formatter: `ISC001`. To avoid unexpected behavior, we recommend disabling these rules, either by removing them from the `select` or `extend-select` configuration, or adding them to the `ignore` configuration.
</code></pre>
<p>My understanding is that this is also solved by:</p>
<pre><code>unfixable = [&quot;ISC001&quot;]  
</code></pre>
<p>Though it still raised the warning. If that is the case I would update the error message to reflect this and remove it when <code>ISC001</code> is in <code>unfixable</code>.</p>
<p>Related to #13031, but creating a new issue as it that one solved the initial problem and this is a derived problem from the solution</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for creating a new issue.</p>
<p>The warning still applies even when <code>ISC001</code> is marked as unfixable because the issue is that the formatter could introduce new ISC001 violations. This is a problem long-term when we plan to integrate <code>format</code> into <code>check</code> because running</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lint</code> (until there are no more fixes)</li>
<li><code>format</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Then no longer guarantees that there are no diagnostics. Instead, it would become necessary to loop over <code>lint</code>, <code>format</code>, <code>lint</code>.... until there are no diagnostics which hurts performance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the clarification! It would be lovely to be able to suppress the warning (as suggested in #8272), but I understand that resolving the issue would be the ideal solution.</p>
<p>I will close this issue as the concern already seems well-covered in #8272.</p>
