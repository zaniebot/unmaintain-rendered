            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Python 3.12 started to report errors when mock assertion is done with a &quot;common&quot; mistake:</p>
<pre><code>mock.not_called()
</code></pre>
<p>This does not do what you think it does, and when you run it with Python 3.12 you will get error:</p>
<pre><code>'not_called' is not a valid assertion. Use a spec for the mock if 'not_called' is meant to be an attribute.
</code></pre>
<p>The correct way of calling it is:</p>
<pre><code>mock.assert_not_called()
</code></pre>
<p>Similar for other methods. It's very easy to miss it during review and for Python &lt; 3.12 that call gets silently ignored (obviously it looks like you are calling <code>not_called</code> method on mock and it will just record the call in the mock.</p>
<p>For projects like Apache Airflow where we optimize most PRs and run most tests with &quot;lowest&quot; supported Python (Python 3.8) this leads sometimes to false-positives where the tests start to fail in Python 3.12 &quot;canary&quot; build where it performs full suite of tests (not mentioning that this test passing on Python 3.8 does not test anything anyway because it does not make any assertion).</p>
<p>Example case where it caused our &quot;canary&quot; builds to fail https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42027</p>
<p>It would be great to detect such &quot;mistakes&quot; via static checks with ruff as a new rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed PGH005 does not currently flag this: https://play.ruff.rs/5f47abd1-efa4-4fd9-8077-616ae57edbad.</p>
<p>There's a possibility of false positives here as we don't yet have type inference in Ruff. If the object is not a mock, just a regular class that has a <code>not_called()</code> method, then we'd emit a spurious error on the <code>not_called()</code> call, because we currently only have limited capability to detect the type of an object. However, this seems relatively unlikely, given that not many classes have methods with names like <code>not_called()</code>. So I think this should be fine to implement now.</p>
