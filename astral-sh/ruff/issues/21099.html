            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It seems like <code>ruff analyze graph</code> only includes .py files but skips notebooks (.ipynb files) while plain ruff nowadays supports notebooks (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#jupyter-notebook-discovery).</p>

<p>I've to jump into my next meeting so I can't try it right now but does
ruff not list notebook files or are they listed but without any imports?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was surprised this behavior because analyze uses the same logic to discover all python files as all other commands but it then also does this:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/d9cab4d242a18102617d2a9eea1fc10a70c67a50/crates/ruff/src/commands/analyze_graph.rs#L130-L133</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it's there. Do you want to try to remove it and see if it just works?</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to have a way to exclude notebooks for people who don't care about them but that's what <code>analyze.exclude</code> can be used for.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried. As a result after commenting out the lines and running <code>cargo run -p ruff -- analyze graph --python ...</code>
shows that now the notebook files show up as keys in the resulting mapping - however, the values are all empty lists. So I think a bit more work is needed to make this actually work.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: this is the very first thing I ever did with rust and cargo so no guarantees i did everything right.</p>
