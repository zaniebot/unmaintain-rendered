Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>It would be great to add an autofix to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7953 as it's fix is pretty straightforward (just deleting the lambda and calling the function / method directly). The logic / autofix is somewhat similar to PIE807 which already has an autofix.</p>
