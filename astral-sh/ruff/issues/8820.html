<p><code>PYI024</code> seems like a relatively straightforward import rewrite fix <code>collections.namedtuple</code> -&gt; <code>typing.NamedTuple</code>. We should add an autofix and it seems relatively straightforward. Might be a good first issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the suggestion but I don&#x27;t think so as it&#x27;s not just an import rewrite but also updating the references as highlighted in the example: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/collections-named-tuple/#example</p>
<p>It&#x27;s probably impossible as the <code>typing</code> version requires the type information which the <code>collections</code> version doesn&#x27;t provide. Happy to hear your thoughts on this but I&#x27;ll close this to keep the issue tracker actionable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, in the trivial case listed in the example, we could infer the types. I agree though this is not quite as simple as originally envisioned though.</p>
