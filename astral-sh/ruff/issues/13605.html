Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Running <code>ruff analyze graph</code> on windows produce the following output where all paths are absolute and even use universal format (UNC maybe?) to display the files. E.g:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;myapp\\foo\\bar\\__init__.py&quot;: [],
&quot;myapp\\foo\\bar\\admin.py&quot;: [
  &quot;\\\\?\\C:\\Data\\myproject\\myapp\\foo\\bar\\models.py&quot;,
  &quot;\\\\?\\C:\\Data\\myproject\\myapp\\foo\\baz\\admin.py&quot;,
]</code></pre>
<p>I would expect the following:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;myapp\\foo\\bar\\__init__.py&quot;: [],
&quot;myapp\\foo\\bar\\admin.py&quot;: [
  &quot;myapp\\foo\\bar\\models.py&quot;,
  &quot;myapp\\foo\\baz\\admin.py&quot;,
]</code></pre>
<p>Also, <strong>it does not show any external dependencie</strong>s (ones in the virtual env). Does seem like a bug.</p>
<p>Finally, since this is not really a windows vs linux path thing as a dependency graph do not care about the OS, would it be possible to use posix paths on this output every time?</p>

<p>This isn't a bug -- it doesn't look at your environment at all right now. Doing so would require that you give us a way to discover the environment you care about. It's not wired up.</p>
