            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to have a way to configure this tool system-wide; I&#x27;m imagining that it could look at the standard XDG configuration sources (<code>~/.config/ruff.toml</code> and <code>/etc/ruff.toml</code>) in addition to walking up the filesystem from the current directory.</p>
<p>I know it&#x27;s not quite as pure as having a <code>pyproject.toml</code> in every directory hierarchy, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to be able to set defaults for one-off scripts.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe we actually do support this -- can you take a look at <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#how-can-i-change-ruffs-default-configuration">this section</a> in the docs? If it&#x27;s not quite what you&#x27;re asking for, LMK and I can reopen!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I was led astray because for some reason dirs decided to look in <code>~/Application Support/ruff/ruff.toml</code> on macos instead of <code>~/.config</code>; I think this is the only CLI tool I&#x27;ve ever used that does so. I moved my config in there and it works. Obviously that&#x27;s a <code>dirs</code> weirdness, though; nothing on this repo.</p>
<p>Also, fwiw, this functionality isn&#x27;t mentioned in <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/">the docs page</a>, so perhaps that&#x27;s a process improvement opportunity.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, it&#x27;s mentioned in the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/">FAQ</a>, but it should at least be mentioned in the configuration section.</p>
