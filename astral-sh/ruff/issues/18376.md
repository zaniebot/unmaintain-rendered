# Consider combining `Locator` and `SourceFile`

---

_Issue opened by @ntBre on 2025-05-29 18:21_

It could make sense (can be a follow up PR/issue to do it later) to investigate if we can remove `locator.line_index` and instead use `source_file` everywhere. We could even consider implementing `Located` on source file, which should allow us to replace most `Locator` usages.
