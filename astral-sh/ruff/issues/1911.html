            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PEP8 suggests a maximum line-length of 79 as stated on https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length. Therefore, I'm just curious as to why 88 is the default of line-length.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because Ruff <a href="https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html">is designed to be compatible with Black</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Ruff is compatible with <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a> out-of-the-box, as long as the line-length setting is consistent between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a project, Ruff is designed to be used alongside Black and, as such, will defer implementing stylistic lint rules that are obviated by autoformatting.</p>
