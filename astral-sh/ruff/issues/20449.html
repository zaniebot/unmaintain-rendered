            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>Looking at the git dependency on a forked <code>lsp-types</code>,</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/d121a76aeff8388c482410a0f65723c60821d3c2/Cargo.toml#L121-L123</p>
<p>and considering the text in https://github.com/astral-sh/lsp-types/commit/ddc7dc8b374dedd947abf14bdb4a37f257a53e92,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This fork is a temporary solution for supporting Jupyter Notebooks for our new LSP server, <code>ruff server</code>.
This fork is not actively maintained by Astral.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder what the path to using an unmodified copy of <code>lsp-types</code> as a regular dependency would look like. Is this approach still considered temporary?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11595 for some previous discussion.</p>
<p>You're right, that this work is probably less temporary than we hoped when we created it. However, there's no real rush to unfork because there have only been very few and minor upstream changes and our fork is working fine. #11595 mentions a few alternatives that we might consider once we need new LSP features that aren't part of our fork, but until then, it's hard for us to prioritize the unfork without any real gain.</p>
