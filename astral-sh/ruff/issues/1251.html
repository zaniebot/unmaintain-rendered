            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have some code-autogeneration projects where isort's <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#float-to-top">Float To Top</a> feature is super useful.  (as a reminder, it causes all non-indented imports to float to the top of the file)</p>
<p>Not sure how &quot;invasive&quot; this one is to implement here, but just wanted to put in a friendly feature request :)</p>
<p>thanks as always!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I miss too much this conveient function to quickly import modules and move them to the top automatically since most open source Python LS do not perform well on auto importing. I would rather import it manually but move them by <code>--float-to-top</code>. It would be nice to have it in ruff too.</p>
