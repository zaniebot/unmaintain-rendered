Description
<p>It seems like <code>D102</code> permits missing docstrings in public methods if Python <strong>file name</strong> starts with <code>_</code>. This probably should not be the case, since the rule name suggests that it is concerned only with <strong>method names</strong>.</p>
MRE
<pre><code># File is called &quot;_foo.py&quot; - underscore is important.

class MyClass:

    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
        pass
    
    def important_method() -&gt; None:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>Example above passes D102. If you rename the file to <code>foo.py</code> - it would fail.</p>
Run params
<ul>
<li>The command you invoked: <code>ruff check</code></li>
<li>The current Ruff settings: D102 enabled.</li>
<li>The current Ruff version: 0.7.1.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think these two are exactly the same. In my request I would expect that the current behavior persists however it would change when something is enumerated within the all global. However here, I assume you just want all private modules, public entries to face this rule.</p>
