<li>Ruff version: 0.0.285</li>
<li>Selected rule: <code>ANN</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Given the following code in a file <code>_test.py</code></p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def method(self):
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>I get the error</p>
<pre><code>_test.py:2:9: ANN202 Missing return type annotation for private function `method`
</code></pre>
<p>which implies that the <code>method()</code> is private. But actually the module itself is private, not the method. This also happens when the module is in a deeper package, where at least one parent in the hierarchy is private, e.g. <code>some/package/_private/another/test.py</code>.</p>
<p>This issue may occur fairly often, as it is common in Python to restrict the public API to internal modules via underscore <code>_</code>. However, this does not mean that the method itself is private.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe this is intentional as it aligns with the definition of public and private used by <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle">pydocstyle</a>. I do understand the argument against it, but I find the inverse to be confusing too -- if we reported these methods as public, we&#x27;d likely get folks reporting that they should be treated as private since they&#x27;re in private modules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for your explanation, you are probably right, especially if the current convention used by pydocstyle is like this.</p>
<p>I guess the underlying issue is that there are no clear definitions in Python what &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; means, as these keywords don&#x27;t exist like in other languages...</p>
<p>If above described behavior is indeed wanted an expected, this issue can be closed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have another question regarding this. I have the following code which does not return anything. I prefer to avoid writing with the arrow notation when functions do not return. I think that is clear enough. But the lintern forces me to use the def lol()  -&gt; None:  notation.</p>
