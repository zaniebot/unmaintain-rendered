Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I have a python model that contains rest endpoint queries defined as multi-line strings, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>query = &quot;&quot;&quot;
    query ...
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>ruff</code> is reporting <code>E101 Indentation contains mixed spaces and tabs</code> for the text inside the string.</p>
<p>Technically this is correct as the indentation of the query does contain a mix of tab and spaces - but in general, I feel that <code>ruff</code> shouldn't try and lint a text block.</p>
<p>Note I observed this in a notebook - I've not tested in a py file</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So pycodestyle has this behavior too, though it's unclear whether they consider it correct (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/600, https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/376, https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/45).</p>
<p>We actually disabled W109 (which flags uses of tabs) within such strings. I'm open to disabling E101 too -- but what's the valid use-case for mixing spaces and tabs within a single indent, even within a string?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ignoring leading whitespace in multiline strings seems reasonable because it is not an indentation.</p>
