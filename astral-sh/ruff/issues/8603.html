            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was browsing through the code and came across both PLR1701 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/repeated-isinstance-calls/ and SIM101 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-isinstance-call/. To my reading, they look like they do the same thing (merge <code>isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)</code> to <code>isinstance(x, (int, float))</code>. Is there a difference in implementation that I'm missing, or is it a deliberate duplication?</p>
