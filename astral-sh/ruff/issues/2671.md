<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

I saw another issue about documenting a work-around for match/case. I am not sure if that is still relevant.

minimal snippet:

$ cat ruff.py
def f(arga):
   match arga:
      case 'hello':
         print('you passed hello')

import sys
f(sys.argv[1])


Command: `ruff check ruff.py`

No ruff settings (no pyproject.toml).

$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.243

Error:

$ ruff check ruff.py
error: Failed to parse ruff.py: invalid syntax. Got unexpected token 'arga' at line 2 column 10
ruff.py:2:11: E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Got unexpected token 'arga'
