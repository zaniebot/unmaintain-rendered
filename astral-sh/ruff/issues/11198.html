* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"

as shown in the picture, the attribution &quot;_abc&quot; doesn't exist in the class. Pycharm, which I used in the picture will reminde me of this error cause its own code inspection mechanism. But ruff won't highlight this kind of error.</p>
