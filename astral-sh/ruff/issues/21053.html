            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently the Ruff linter offer &quot;grouped&quot; as one of the output formats, which groups violations by file.</p>
<p>Can there be another option to group by violation code?</p>
<p>The benefit of this option is: nowadays we often use AI coding assistants (such as Claude Code, Codex, ...) to fix linter issues for us.  I&#x27;ve found that AI performs better when fixing one type of issues at a time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s interesting. I think I would probably tell the agent to <code>--select</code> one rule at a time in that case, but we could still consider it.</p>
