            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would you be open to supporting <code>.editorconfig</code> for the <code>line-length</code> setting (called <code>max_line_length</code>)?</p>
<p>Currently, it's a small chore to setup the <code>line-length</code> correctly -- <code>black</code>, <code>isort</code> and <code>ruff</code> and also the editor need them separately (editor needs the setting for reflowing comments, which <code>black</code> doesn't do). Introducing <code>.editorconfig</code> to a project solves the editor and the <code>isort</code> problem and  if <code>ruff</code> supported it too, there would only be two settings to change if needed (one if <code>ruff</code> really becomes a formatter too).</p>
<p>(Caveat: <code>max_line_length</code> is somehow still not part of the EditorConfig spec a decade later, but is apparently widely supported by editors).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>max_line_length</code> is unfortunately a <a href="https://editorconfig.org/#file-format-details">non-standard</a> editorconfig option that may not be so widely supported.</p>
<p>But I do see editorconfig useful for formatting (specifically <code>indent_size</code>, but almost all standard properties are useful to a formatter) and it should be used when other configurations options are absent, e.g. at the lowest priority.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm currently hesitant to support <code>.editorconfig</code> since I'd really like to avoid supporting multiple configuration formats and having to merge settings defined across multiple configuration formats.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fine with me, I don't mind a explicit separate config, even if it's going to be duplicate with the <code>.editorconfig</code>, which imho every repo must have.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I understand not wanting unnecessary complexity, but it's unfortunate to leave the situation where users can end up specifying conflicting settings in different industry-standard configs and have them silently warring each other (e.g. editor indenting to 4, then ruff format re-indenting everything to 2, then editor creating more 4-space indents).</p>
