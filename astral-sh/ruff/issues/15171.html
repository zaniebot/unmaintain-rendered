            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The rule <code>one-blank-line-before-class (D203)</code> and <code>blank-line-before-class (D211)</code> are directly opposed. Same for <code>multi-line-summary-first-line (D212)</code> with <code>multi-line-summary-second-line (D213)</code>.
I believe these should instead be a single rule that is configurable to act either one way or another. It is very odd and a bit unwieldy that a rule is configurable by having to disable a code, within the same group. If you&#x27;re extending from another configuration, you have to re-select a rule <em>and</em> disable the other.
This would also make more sense in the context of shared configs, where one can enable the <code>pydocstyle (D)</code> group and configure how it acts separately.</p>
<p>(note this is a different request than <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8470">astral-sh/ruff#8470</a>, which wants to hide the &quot;incompatible rules&quot; warning with <code>ALL</code>, whilst I want these specific incompatibilities to not be a thing in the first place)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After reading a bit more, I found https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pydocstyle_convention which kinda does what I&#x27;d like simply because I happen to personally prefer <code>D211</code> + <code>D213</code> which all 3 conventions also prefer.</p>
<p>But which rules each individual convention enable/disable by default isn&#x27;t listed. It&#x27;s only written down on the specific rules pages.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cross posting here from Discord, the list is documented here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#does-ruff-support-numpy-or-google-style-docstrings although I think it&#x27;s not immediately visible and it might be useful to have this either in <code>lint.pydocstyle.convention</code> setting page or in each of the Pydocstyle rule doc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I completely missed that section! I didn&#x27;t check the FAQ for that. Only the convention page https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pydocstyle_convention</p>
<p>I agree discoverability is not the best. Would be nice if it was a bit easier to find.</p>
<p>I still find it odd for those rules to be completely opposite. But maybe the added complexity to also modify options in the convention system isn&#x27;t worth. At least not until &quot;the great rules recategorization&quot;. Selecting a base convention removes a lots of cruft around configuring pydocstyle.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be fine if the decision is to keep the rules/config as-is at this time. But with improved discovery of the specific conventions.</p>

<p>Opened <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15217">astral-sh/ruff#15217</a> to track this.</p>

<p>Agreed. I think it would be useful to think about this during the rule-categorization instead.</p>
