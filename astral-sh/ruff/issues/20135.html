<p>Hi! 👋</p>
<p>I was looking at rules that measure cohesion in ruff, and I did not find much.</p>
<p>There is this library https://github.com/mschwager/cohesion, which can work as a flake8 plugin, with a rule (<code>H601 class has low cohesion</code>).</p>
<p>Any plans to implement something similar? Or maybe something like this already exists in ruff and I missed it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah interesting, I found some related discussion on this issue around flake8-cognitive-complexity: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2418">astral-sh/ruff#2418</a>.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t have any current plans to implement something like this, but we can certainly track interest here!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d recommend using a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8351747">slightly more modern metric</a> than cohesion to measure this. I&#x27;ve done some work on this sort of thing before and it&#x27;s definitely well within <code>ruff</code>s capability by decomposing a directory into a call-graph, but I admit it&#x27;s quite a niche topic when compared to more common linting rules.</p>
