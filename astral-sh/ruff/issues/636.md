# support fix in pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @tekumara on 2022-11-07 09:08_

_pyproject.toml_ with:
```
[tool.ruff]
fix = true
```

fails:
```
$ ruff .
error unknown field `fix`, expected one of `line-length`, `exclude`, `extend-exclude`, `select`, `extend-select`, `ignore`, `extend-ignore`, `per-file-ignores`, `dummy-variable-rgx`, `target-version`, `flake8-annotations`, `flake8-quotes`, `pep8-naming` for key `tool.ruff` at line 60 column 1
```

would be fantastic to allow this :pray:
