# Formatter: `multiline_string_handling` preview style

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-11-29 02:46_

Implement Black's [`multiline_string_handling`](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/1879) as a preview style. 

Ruff already implements (as part of stable) the new style when calling functions on a multiline string:

```python
MULTILINE = """
foobar
""".replace(
    "\n", ""
)
```

Get's formatted to

```python
MULTILINE = """
foobar
""".replace("\n", "")
```

However, Ruff doesn't yet implement the new style when passing a multiline string in a function call:

```python
textwrap.dedent(
    """\
    This is a
    multiline string
"""
)
```

Gets formatted to:

```python
textwrap.dedent("""\
    This is a
    multiline string
""")
```


> **Note**: It's not yet decided if this style will make it into Black's 2024 stable style
