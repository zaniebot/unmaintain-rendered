            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>I have a dict as follows:</p>
<pre><code>'Mio': 'million',
'MIO': 'million',
'Mrd': 'billion',
'MRD': 'billion',</code></pre>
<p>Ruff marks a F601, which is - from what I know - wrong: python dict keys are case sensitive.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Which Ruff version are you using?</p>
<p>I checked with the playground (<a href="https://play.ruff.rs">here</a>) and it seems that Ruff doesn't mark a <code>F601</code> violation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>$ pip show ruff
Name: ruff
Version: 0.7.4</p>
<p>I just checked - you are right, I should updated. Newer versions seem to evolve quickly here!
Thanks for pointing that out.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm, unfortunately I'm still not able to reproduce this. Could you provide either a full code snippet, configuration, etc. or try to reproduce this on the playground and then click the &quot;Share&quot; button and copy the link here?</p>
<p>Here's my failed attempt at reproducing on the playground <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/b0877ae7-e3c0-4542-8c74-13d9897bb72f">Link</a></p>
