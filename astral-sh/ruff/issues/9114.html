Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>The E262/E265 rules checks if one space is used after inline/block comments. However, to be consistent with Pycodestyle, they will accept both <code># </code> and <code>#: </code> as valid inline comments, which is inconsistent with the wording in PEP8. I believe I've heard that this quirk is because of some conventional usage of comments for documenting class attributes, but I'm unfortunately unable to find a reference.</p>
<p>I would like a linting rule that follows PEP 8 to the letter and allows only <code># </code> in block and/or inline comments.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#bad block comment
#:bad block comment
#: bad block comment (but allowed by E265)
# good block comment

a = 1  #bad inline comment
b = 1  #:bad inline comment
c = 1  #: bad inline comment (but allowed by E262)
d = 1  # good inline comment
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>I found a Stack Overflow question about <code>#:</code>: https://stackoverflow.com/a/37352230. It looks like the source of the convention might be the Sphinx documentation generator</p>
