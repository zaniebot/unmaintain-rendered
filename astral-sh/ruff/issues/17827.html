            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When raising the original exception the ruff does not report the use of bare except. However flake8 does.</p>
<pre><code>try:
    pass
except:
    raise
</code></pre>
<pre><code>ruff check test.py
All checks passed!
</code></pre>
<pre><code>flake8 test.py
test.py:4:1: E722 do not use bare 'except'
</code></pre>
<p>https://play.ruff.rs/fb125639-d561-407e-afca-16b2fd1240cd</p>
<p>In our case it was error prone because in our except we were handling errors in except block:</p>
<pre><code>except:
   if input == 1:
     return x
   raise
</code></pre>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ruff 0.11.6</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like this was changed in #1124 to address #1119 with the logic that re-raising the exception solves the problems described in the rule <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/bare-except/">docs</a>. So I would say your playground example is working as intended, but this still seems like a potential problem when the exception is only <em>conditionally</em> re-raised, as in your example here. This is discussed a  bit <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/issues/174">here</a> too.</p>
<p>@dylwil3 is currently working on better control-flow analysis that could help to check conditional branches here.</p>
