            <div class="timeline-body"><p>MyPy released support for PEP 695 generics: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15238</p>
<p>It would be awesome to do any of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>get linting errors for code that uses older style generics (TypeVar, ParamSpec etc.) for Python 3.12+</li>
<li>get linting errors for code that uses newer style generics and should be backward compatible with lower Python versions</li>
<li>automagically upgrade older style generics to use the new syntax</li>
</ol>
<p>I see that for point 3 there is an <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4617">open related issue</a>. This issue is about the underlying rust implementation for point 3, but does not cover points 1 and 2.</p>

<p>I don't think so. I might be wrong but it seems to me like this rule is concerned with the <code>TypeAlias</code> type.</p>
<p>I am talking about the new generics style: https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/#summary-examples</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cases (1) and (3) should now be handled by the rules UP046 and UP047 added in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15565, with a few caveats being tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15642.</p>
<p>I think case (2) would be a good fit for the &quot;pydowngrade&quot; suggestion from #2501, so I'm closing this and making a comment there.</p>
