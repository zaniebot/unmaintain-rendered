            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The readme is pretty comprehensive in showing the supported lints, in relation to their corresponding flake8-plugins. I'm more interested in the inverse.</p>
<p>That is, I have a codebase that makes extensive use of flake8 plugins for linting. I would like a reference of which plugins can be <em>completely</em> replaced by ruff so that I can incrementally remove them where they overlap.</p>
<p>Is there some way to parse this?</p>
<p>For example, under the readme section for flake8-bugbear I see a list of all of the bugbear lints supported by Ruff. Short of manually cross-referencing against the bugbear docs, is there some way for me to check whether i can remove the bugbear plugin entirely by using ruff?</p>

<p>it comes close, though if we confine the dicussion only to the examples i give above-</p>
<ul>
<li>ruff doesn't implement all of bugbear's 'opinionated' lints</li>
<li>the fact that isort infers the root package and ruff does not is not documented</li>
</ul>

<p>If you post your project structure, I'm happy to help with the configuration. Ruff typically <em>can</em> infer the root, unless you're using namespace packages.</p>

<p>Sure - dont think I'm doing anything particularly strange</p>
<p>https://github.com/danieleades/sphinx-graph</p>
<p>By the way, it only affected the 'tests' directory. Isort and ruff didn't agree on how to group the imports in tests/ unless ruff had the additional config.</p>
