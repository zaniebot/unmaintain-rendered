            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is currently no rule that flags explicit string concatenation if it occurs on a single line, even though this makes for very ugly code.</p>
<p>Explicit string concatenations are flagged by ISC003 when they are on separate lines (example 1) and implicit string concatenation on a single line is flagged by ISC001 (example 2).
I would like example 3 below to also be picked up by ruff, either in combination with one of the rules mentioned, or by a separate rule altogether.
This is especially relevant, given that example 1 is converted into example 3 when running <code>ruff format</code>. This led to a code base that I was trying to clean up now being riddled with explicit one-line string concatenations.</p>
<pre><code>example_1 = (
    &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy &quot;
    + &quot;dog&quot;
)

example_2 = &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy &quot; &quot;dog&quot;

example_3 = &quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy &quot; + &quot;dog&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>running ruff:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff check --select ALL --output-format concise --ignore D
string_concatenations.py:2:5: ISC003 Explicitly concatenated string should be implicitly concatenated
string_concatenations.py:6:13: ISC001 [*] Implicitly concatenated string literals on one line
Found 2 errors.
[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDITED</strong> for more clarity</p>

<p>I think that&#x27;s in the rule&#x27;s spirit. From the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For string literals that wrap across multiple lines, implicit string concatenation within parentheses is preferred over explicit concatenation using the + operator, as the former is more readable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My issue is that there is no rule that flags this situation <code>&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy &quot; + &quot;dog&quot;</code>, even I believe that is something that should be avoided. I will clarify this in my original post.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the clarification. I now understand what you&#x27;re looking for.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but we decided to hold off on introducing new rules that conflict with our formatter because it leads to poor experience when the formatter and linter disagree (it&#x27;s a configuration hazard).</p>
