            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Given a set of ignored rules configured with <code>lint.ignore</code>, it would be great to easily identify which rules would not trigger so that these could be removed for the ignore list if desired.</p>
<p>Also related, it would be nice to add all rules currently triggering to the ignored list.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. That sounds useful. It's to some extend related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1149 which is also about rolling out ruff or new lint rules in an existing code base.</p>
