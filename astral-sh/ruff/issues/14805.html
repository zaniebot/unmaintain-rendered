            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can I request an autofix for B028: no-explicit-stacklevel?</p>
<p>I understand <code>stacklevel=2</code> may not be the one-size-fits-all solution (some implementation might need higher stack level), but I guess it's a good default value for <code>ruff</code> autofix?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I agree that an unsafe autofix to <code>stacklevel=2</code> is reasonable here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dylwil3 Really appreciate the quick fix, I noticed some minor relevant issues while cleaning up our code base:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people might notice this warning, and thought it's &quot;no explicit stacklevel&quot; that is bad, and ended up giving <code>stacklevel=1</code>, would it be good to extend B028 to cover <code>stacklevel=1</code> as well? Or perhaps we should keep it as is in case people intentionally use <code>stacklevel=1</code> for whatever reason (to point to the implementation maybe?)</li>
<li>I also noticed people explicitly give the default <code>UserWarning</code> like <code>warnings.warn(msg, category=UserWarning)</code>, this is not really doing anything bad, but seems redundant</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm happy to open a separate issue to track this if you believe it's worth the effort and feel free to reject them :)</p>

<p>If a developer explicitly specifies the stacklevel it feels a little rude to contradict them 😄 We would also have to change the rule name and diagnostic message in that case. But I agree that the documentation around &quot;Why this is bad&quot; together with the autofix suggestion makes it sound like the rule is a little stricter than it is. So maybe there is some editing to be done to the message and/or documentation?</p>

<p>I don't think I know enough about the usage here to gauge whether this would be common/helpful, but please feel free to suggest this as a new lint rule in a separate issue and folks can weigh in.</p>

<p>Yep I agree, they might know well what they're doing, so perhaps don't warn for such case. Also manual fixing for such cases is much easier, just do a regular expression search and replace.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm personally happy with the state of the docs. Our code base is built around chemistry so some people don't come from CS background to understand &quot;stack&quot;, and they just don't bother to read the documentation and ended up passing a safe default <code>stacklevel=1</code> to mute the warning I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment. I guess it's not worthy a issue as it's just a unnecessary default argument given (looks not so tidy but don't have any other side effect), there's no way for us to warn again every default value usage I guess :)</p>
<p>Thanks again and all the best</p>
