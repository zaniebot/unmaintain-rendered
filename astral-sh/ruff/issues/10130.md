# Automatically remove ignored rules which will not trigger

---

_Issue opened by @samvanstroud on 2024-02-26 10:09_

Hi,

Given a set of ignored rules configured with `lint.ignore`, it would be great to easily identify which rules would not trigger so that these could be removed for the ignore list if desired.

Also related, it would be nice to add all rules currently triggering to the ignored list.

Thanks!

Hi. That sounds useful. It's to some extend related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1149 which is also about rolling out ruff or new lint rules in an existing code base.
