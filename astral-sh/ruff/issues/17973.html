            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm dealing with a codebase that has circular dependencies and reordering the first party import statements breaks everything.</p>
<p>How can I make ruff sort imports by type (first vs third party, etc) and keep the grouping but not sort first party alphabetically?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you tell me more why sorting imports alphabetical breaks everything? That sorting shouldn't rely on any cross module (or external) information</p>
<p>Disabling sorting within groups isn't supported, see <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lintisort">isort settings</a>. You can change the sorting to be by-length instead but that isn't what you seem to be looking for.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've run into this before in Python code too. Sometimes with circular imports you can break the cycle (or at least avoid the error) by running imports in the right order. I was still using isort directly at the time, but I would hack around it with something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import b
if True:
    import a
import c
</code></pre>
<p>but one of the <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/action_comments.html">isort action comments</a> might have worked too.</p>
