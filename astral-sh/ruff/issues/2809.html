            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wanted to purpose a new lint rule. The <code>asyncio.create_task</code> function has a caveat, which is when you create a task in order to make sure it finishes you need to take a reference to it.

<p>I first read about this in <a href="https://textual.textualize.io/blog/2023/02/11/the-heisenbug-lurking-in-your-async-code/">this post</a>. Which also sites a lot of projects that are doing this wrong.</p>
<p>Is this something that ruff wants to support? I could give it a try to implement it in that case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could implement it as part of <code>RUF</code> for now. I'd support it!</p>
