            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At @pola-rs , we currently use <code>ruff</code> in combination with <code>black</code> for our Python formatting needs. We also use <a href="https://github.com/keewis/blackdoc"><code>blackdoc</code></a> for formatting our docstring code examples. Out of these three, <code>blackdoc</code> is by far the slowest.</p>
<p>With <code>ruff</code> gaining many of the capabilities of the <code>black</code> formatter, it would be great if we could also replace <code>blackdoc</code> soon and only use <code>ruff</code>.</p>

<p>Without any knowledge of the code base:</p>
<p>I think Examples blocks can already be detected as there are some docstring formatting rules in <code>pydocstyle</code> related to sections.
Then within the block, code examples should be easy to detect as lines starting with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; </code>, followed by one or more lines starting with <code>... </code>.  Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">&gt;&gt;&gt; pl.date_range(
...     date(2023, 1, 1), date(2023, 5, 1), &quot;1mo&quot;, eager=True
... ).dt.month_end()
</code></pre>
<p>You'll probably find more refined logic by looking at the <code>blackdoc</code> source code, though.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I would imagine code examples with syntax errors raise an error, and would lead to that specific example to not be autofixed.</p>

<p>I guess this brings up the question whether this should be a lint rule with an autofix or integrated into the formatter (runs automatically on save)? I assumed that this would be similar to the linked project and be part of the formatter.</p>
<p>The big challenge will be to implement fast parsing and integrate it in the otherwise already extensive docstring formatting</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/c05e4628b1d385d106e7e3d355f5d1d76fbfe401/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/expression/string.rs#L787-L905</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's my intuition but the question is would the rest of the file still be formatted? I would say yes, but the formatter then needs a way to raise a warning which we lack today.</p>

<p>Yes, definitely. Other code examples in the same docstring could probably still be formatted, even. Each example is a self-contained Python interpreter command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@stinodego Out of curiosity, was there anything that pushed you to use <a href="https://github.com/keewis/blackdoc">blackdoc</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs">blacken-docs</a>? Also, do you use <code>blackdoc</code> to only reformat Python code in doc comments, or do you also use it to reformat Python code in other files (like, say, a <code>README.rst</code> or <code>README.md</code>)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn't pick blackdoc myself, it was introduced to the project at some point by someone else and I never thought to try other tools. I had heard of blacken-docs but have never tried it myself. It seems to do more than I need.</p>
<p>We currently only format Python in docstring examples. We don't autoformat code in our README, and code in our other docs is magically imported from Python files, so we can use ruff autoformatter for those.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I spent some time looking into this and I think I've come up with a rough proposal on how to move this forward.</p>
<h2>Straw implementation proposal</h2>
<p>Tactically, my plan is to follow <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7146#issuecomment-1707749664">@MichaReiser's suggestion above</a>
and add this as <strong>opt-in</strong> functionality to the formatter in
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/964a861f946156676fc1bae5449ca9a8399302ac/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/expression/string.rs#L974"><code>format_docstring</code></a>. My initial plan is to support Markdown and
reStructuredText formatted doc strings, and within each, to support both
<code>python</code> and <code>pycon</code> code blocks. I'm proposing opt-in in at least the initial
release as a precautionary step.</p>
<p>For example, all the following Python snippets have doc strings that would be
reformatted.</p>
<p>Markdown docstrings with Python snippets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    '''
    Docs about foo.

    ```python
    def quux():
        x = do_something(foo())
        return x + 1
    ```
    '''
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Markdown docstrings with pycon (&quot;Python console&quot;) snippets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    '''
    Docs about foo.

    ```pycon
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def quux():
    ...     x = do_something(foo())
    ...     return x + 1
    ```
    '''
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>reStructuredText docstrings with Python snippets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    '''
    Docs about foo.

    .. code-block:: python
        def quux():
            x = do_something(foo())
            return x + 1
    '''
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>reStructuredText docstrings with pycon (&quot;Python console&quot;) snippets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    '''
    Docs about foo.

    .. code-block:: pycon

        &gt;&gt;&gt; def quux():
        ...     x = do_something(foo())
        ...     return x + 1
    '''
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>It's plausible we'll want to support more than this, perhaps even in the
initial implementation. But I'm unsure. I included more details about possible
extensions below.</p>
<h2>Prior art</h2>
<p>I believe the main prior art in this space is <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs">blacken-docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/keewis/blackdoc">blackdoc</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like <code>blacken-docs</code> and <code>blackdoc</code> take similar approaches,
but <code>blackdoc</code> looks a fair bit more sophisticated. Its <a href="https://blackdoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html">initial
example</a> shows that it can handle nested docstrings
(something that <code>blacken-docs</code> cannot do). <code>blackdoc</code> does still use regexes,
but also appears to use Python's standard library <code>tokenize</code> module for
tokenizing Python code.</p>
<h2>Testing plan</h2>
<p>In addition to the usual snapshot tests we can write by hand, I think another
effective way to test this is to try it on real code bases. Django, for
example, comes to mind. I'll also look for other projects using <code>blacken-docs</code>
to run this on and see what the diff looks like. That experience should then
lead to adding more unit/regression tests.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/16261">Django ran into some interesting challenges when switching over to
<code>blackend-docs</code></a>. I think the biggest issue was support
for rST literals, which I address briefly below.</p>
<p>We should also be mindful of transformations that could make the overall
Python code invalid. For example, if code snippets contain doc strings, and
the code snippet is reformatted to use the same docstring quote style as
the docstring containing the snippet, then that could produce an <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs/issues/226">invalid
result</a>. In that particular case,
I think we can solve it by using the opposite quote-style as the parent
docstring, but even that isn't bullet proof. In theory, the docstring within
the docstring might contain a code snippet itself. As a practical restriction,
we probably want to introduce some way of ensuring that only &quot;top-level&quot; code
snippets are reformatted. (Perhaps this could be done by introducing some state
in the Python formatted context?)</p>
<h2>Maybe should be in scope</h2>
<h3>reStructuredText literal blocks</h3>
<p>We will <em>probably</em> also want to support plain literal blocks. The <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs/pull/196">Django
project insisted on it</a> when adopting
<code>blacken-docs</code>. So for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    '''
    Docs about foo.

    Here's an example that uses foo::

        def quux():
            x = do_something(foo())
            return x + 1
    '''
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>The above represents a literal block where in theory any kind of &quot;code-like&quot;
text can go. But apparently it's an old convention to treat it as Python code
by default. I suspect that if we do the first four, then doing the last literal
piece won't be too hard. We could even use Ruff's heuristics for detecting
whether a snippet of code is actually Python or not. It's not clear how much
of this should be in the initial implementation though.</p>
<h3>Plain doctests</h3>
<p>I went and looked through CPython and Django source code to get a &quot;sense&quot; of
what some code snippets actually look like. It turns out that many code snippets
are just implicit &quot;pycon&quot; style without any reStructuredText code block (or
Markdown) syntax. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def _property_resolver(arg):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    When arg is convertible to float, behave like operator.itemgetter(arg)
    Otherwise, chain __getitem__() and getattr().

    &gt;&gt;&gt; _property_resolver(1)('abc')
    'b'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; _property_resolver('1')('abc')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: string indices must be integers
    &gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo:
    ...     a = 42
    ...     b = 3.14
    ...     c = 'Hey!'
    &gt;&gt;&gt; _property_resolver('b')(Foo())
    3.14
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't look like a one-off to me. They appear quite commonplace. It also
looks like <code>blackdoc</code> supports formatting these &quot;plain&quot; doctests.</p>
<h2>Not in scope</h2>
<h3>A way to toggle formatting of individual code blocks</h3>
<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs/issues/193">feature requested in <code>blacken-docs</code> too</a>.
It doesn't look like they've settled on method of doing this, and I think
<em>choosing</em> a method will require some careful thought. Namely, you really
don't want to require something in the code snippet itself because then it
clutters up your example code in the docs. So you probably need something in
the docstring itself or elsewhere. The best way to do this seems unclear enough
that it's probably worth not including in scope for now.</p>
<h3>Formatting Python code in other formats</h3>
<p>This means you won't be able to run the formatter over a <code>.rst</code> or a <code>.md</code> file
and have it format any Python code blocks in it. This initial implementation
will only support reformatting Python snippets within docstrings inside Python
files. We can consider formatting Python code in other formats as a future
project.</p>
<h3>Avoid Markdown/reStructuredText parsing</h3>
<p>I think that trying to parse docstrings as Markdown or reStructuredText
documents should be out of scope for now. If this turns out to be required (it
shouldn't be), then we should re-evaluate at that point. The reason for this is
that it likely complicates the implementation and could introduce performance
regressions (although it's likely any perf problems could be mitigated with
some care).</p>
<p>With that said, I do think this means that our detection logic will necessarily
be a little ad hoc. This means it could do some incorrect things like attempt
to format blocks that aren't actually Python. This is partially why I'm
proposing making this opt-in, at least initially.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Great to see this become more concrete!</p>
<p>For our specific use case, the &quot;plain doctests&quot; you mention are most important. We follow the numpy docstring standard, and most of our docstrings look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def cool_stuff(arg):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Do cool stuff.

	Parameters
	----------
	arg
		Some description.

	--------
	Cool stuff with an integer.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; cool_stuff(1)
	2

	Cool stuff with a string.

	&gt;&gt;&gt; input = &quot;q&quot;
	&gt;&gt;&gt; cool_stuff(input)
	'x'
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    pass

<li>It doesn't seem to respect line length in the same way, as you've noticed. We have all line length limits set to 88. I would love it if the doctest pragma comments (e.g. <code># doctest: +SKIP</code>) would not be counted towards line length.</li>
<li>It trims trailing lines with <code>...</code> sometimes. These lines are not very informative but they do in fact show up when you use the Python console, e.g. if you have a multi-line command, you have to press enter twice before the example runs. So these are a valid part of the example.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that accounts for most/all of the diff!</p>

<p>Yeah I came across this during my work and it seemed like trimming the <code>...</code> was most consistent with auto-formatting since it reflects an extra blank line at the end of the code. If it were &quot;real&quot; code, that line would be trimmed. I'm unsure of introducing specific rules that are different about formatting code snippets than outside of docstrings. Maybe @MichaReiser has an opinion here though?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't feel very strongly either way about the trailing <code>...</code>.</p>
<p>Seems like it occurs with indentation differences, so when defining functions or using a context manager. Those are relatively rare, at least in our docs.</p>
<p>I'd be fine with either pruning the trailing <code>...</code> or enforcing it. Pruning saves some lines, enforcing makes it closer to how the example would look in the actual Python console.</p>
<p>The line length differences is a more fundamental issue - I commented my thoughts on the separate issue you opened.</p>

<p>I don't have any experience writing examples in Python myself. So I can't make a recommendation on whether we should enforce the extra line or not.</p>
<p>Implementation wise I see two options for enforcing the extra line and I'm fine with either, although I would probably prefer 1. because the logic may not apply to other example formats and is closer to the problem its solving.</p>
<ol>
<li>We insert the extra empty line as part of the docstring example logic that @BurntSushi added. We can just always append it to the formatted string (or am I overlooking something?)</li>
<li>We can add a special case handling in the module formatting to emit an extra newline if the <code>embedded_snipped</code> (I don't remember the precise field name) in the <code>PyFormatContext</code> is <code>Some</code>.</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To make sure we don't lose track of the decision about the trailing empty line or not, I created an issue about it: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8908</p>
<p>@MichaReiser Aye. I think we can't unconditionally add a trailing line, so we'll need a heuristic, but I also favor that approach if we decide to go that route. And in particular, if we do need a heuristic, then we probably <em>have</em> to go route (1) since we'll probably want to base the decision on things like &quot;were there any other non-empty PS2 prompt lines.&quot;</p>
