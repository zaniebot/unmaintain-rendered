            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's obviously very cool that all of these (27) major open source projects are using ruff but the list has gotten so long that it has become a navigation hurdle for users looking for information in our README (you need to scroll further to get to the table of contents).</p>
<p>So I think it would make sense to reduce the list before the table of contents to maybe 3-4 projects and either remove the links to the other projects or move them to a section at the bottom of the README and link them with a link such as <code>[and more](#projects-using-ruff)</code>.</p>
