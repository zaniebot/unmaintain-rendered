            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be very helpful to add a flag to format only the changed blocks detected by git, something like what darker does
https://github.com/akaihola/darker</p>
<p>I know that darker are planning to support ruff as a formatter but I think it might be a good idea to be moved inside ruff itself if possible</p>

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12800</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure if the git implementation should be done in this repo, or it could be implemented https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode instead</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ahmedyasserays Ruff's native server (the default now) supports formatting modified files only by using the <em>Format modified files</em> command or configuring <code>&quot;editor.formatOnSaveMode&quot;: &quot;modifications&quot;,</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser This works on save only.
I thought it was implemented from VS Code side, and I didn't know that it's in the language server</p>
<p>Is there a way to make it work with the format shortcut (ctrl + shift + I) ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The LSP only supports range formatting but that's sufficient for VS code because it can pass the range of the changed lines.</p>
<p>You could try setting up a custom keyboard shortcut for <em>Format modified files</em></p>
