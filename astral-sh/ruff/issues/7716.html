            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>ruff</code> has some excellent opt-in rules enabled by <code>select=[&quot;ALL&quot;]</code>.  However, for large new projects, I either have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix all the non-autofix errors (hundreds to thousands)</li>
<li>Use the <code>--add-noqa</code> flag</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to request a halfway <code>select=[&quot;ALL&quot;]</code> called <code>select=[&quot;AUTOFIXABLE&quot;]</code>, where basically one can turn on all rules that have autofixes implemented.</p>
<p>To accomplish this right now, one can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>select=[&quot;ALL&quot;]</code>, writing out a blocklist <code>ignore = [...]</code> for non-autofix rules</li>
<li>Use <code>select=[&quot;I001&quot;, ...]</code>, writing out an allowlist of autofixable rules<ul>
<li>What I did here and it took hours: https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/pull/7889</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, there can be other wordings besides <code>&quot;AUTOFIXABLE&quot;</code>, maybe <code>&quot;FIXABLE&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;AUTOFIX&quot;</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whether or not a rule violation can be fixed is not constant — some rules can only be fixed in certain contexts.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure I understand why you want to be able to select all the fixable rules and ignore the others. It sounds like perhaps you're just looking for <code>ruff check --select ALL --fix-only</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would your use-case also be solved with a <code>ruff fix</code> command that fixes all fixable, selected lint rules and doesn't report additional violations?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah you're understanding my request, thanks!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this is the reason I didn't include certain autofixable rules (e.g. <code>ISC001</code>, <code>SIM102</code>) in that linked PR, I only included autofixable rules that universally fixed all errors.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ruff check --select ALL --fix-only</code> works for the initial invocation, wow that is nice!</p>
<p>However, <code>--fix-only</code> won't work for a <code>pre-commit</code> integration for all time.  Let's say someone decides to add a rule that doesn't have autofixes. I believe <code>--fix-only</code> would filter out errors that didn't have autofixes going forwards</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Can you say a bit more about this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ha it's funny, re-reading my comment that you're asking for clarification, it took me a minute to re-process what I meant. It was a bit vague, and I don't think the <code>pre-commit</code> part mattered.</p>
<p>Let's say we start with this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">fix-only = true
select = [
    &quot;B009&quot;,  # Has autofix
]
</code></pre>
<p>Then we move to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">fix-only = true
select = [
    &quot;B008&quot;,  # Has no autofix
    &quot;B009&quot;,  # Has autofix
]
</code></pre>
<p>The added <code>B008</code> will effectively be silenced by <code>fix-only</code>. I guess my thoughts were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes <code>--fix-only</code> is what this request was asking for, so I will close this out</li>
<li>But it creates a possibility for unexpectedly silenced rules</li>
</ul>
<p>Given though users opt-in to <code>fix-only</code>, I think unexpectedly silencing rules would be the fault of the user. Maybe <code>ruff</code> could log a warning if <code>fix-only</code> is silencing a rule without autofixes, but I think that is quite tricky, especially since <code>ruff</code> can inherit configs using <code>extend</code>. Writing this out made me realize I should just close this out 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know this is old, but I would love for it to be reconsidered. I'm not running Ruff manually, but rather having VSCode automatically run it. I'm interested in only enabling the rules that can be auto-fixed on save. I don't want the other ones highlighted.</p>
<p>If there's another way to do that, happy to use that instead. Thanks for all the work on Ruff!</p>
