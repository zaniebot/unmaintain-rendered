<p>keywords: BLE001, log, exception</p>
<p>The following code snippet does not trigger the BLE001 rule:</p>
<pre><code>from logging import exception


try:
    pass
except Exception:
    exception(&quot;An error occurred&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>but this one does:</p>
<pre><code>from logging import exception

try:
    pass
except Exception:
    if True:
        exception(&quot;An error occurred&quot;)
    else:
        exception(&quot;An error occurred&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This is because ruff doesn&#x27;t seem to consider the case the both branches of an <code>if</code> handle the error.</p>
<p>The reason we run into this is because sometimes we use code like the following:</p>
<pre><code>from logging import exception

try:
    pass
except Exception as ex:
    error_data = gather_diagnostic_data(...)
    if isinstance(ex, SomespecificError):
        exception(&quot;A specific error occurred&quot;, extra=error_data)
    else:
        exception(&quot;A generic error occurred&quot;, extra=error_data)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We were recently investigating the 0.4.4 upgrade and found that snippets like this:</p>
<pre><code>def method() -&gt; None:
    try:
           raise Exception()
    except Exception:
           if False:
               raise
           else:
                  return None
</code></pre>
<p>would no longer raise <code>BLE001</code> (Ruff playground for reference: https://play.ruff.rs/f65629f5-eda0-43f0-a85f-c05a0be1cb9c) because there&#x27;s a conditional handling the exception. This seems a bit problematic, given that the original issue was about cases where both (or rather, all) branches of a conditional handle the exception, but that isn&#x27;t the case here. Totally understandable if this is out of scope, just wanted to put it on the radar. Thanks (apologies if this should be filed in another issue)!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @rahulssheth. My overall feeling was that if you&#x27;re re-raising even within a branch, then the use of the catch-all exception was probably intentional, and so likely to be a false positive. Are you seeing real cases where you <em>do</em> want it to be flagged, despite a re-raise?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh good point! In most scenarios, if there&#x27;s some sort of explicit handling with a re-raise, even if there isn&#x27;t <em>always</em> a re-raise, it likely isn&#x27;t an problem. I mostly flagged this issue because I think there&#x27;s a case to be made that false positives with an ignore should be preferred to false negatives here, but I haven&#x27;t seen any real cases that merit a change of approach. Appreciate the quick feedback!</p>
