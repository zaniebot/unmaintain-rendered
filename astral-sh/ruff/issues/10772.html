<p>Hi,</p>
<p>With Ruff 0.3.5 (previous version tested was 0.3.0),
it seems Q000 keeps popping up.</p>
<ul>
<li>when only Q002 is selected (in pyproject.toml)</li>
<li>when Q is selected and Q000 is in &quot;ignore&quot; (in pyproject.toml)</li>
<li>when running <code>ruff check --ignore Q000</code></li>
</ul>
