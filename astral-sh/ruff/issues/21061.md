# `soft-keyword-shadowing` (akin to `A001`)

---

_Issue opened by @theXaMi on 2025-10-24 13:50_

### Summary

`match` and `case` are keywords that exist for some time already and we don't have any rule to prevent using them as variables. Some static token highlighters are highlighting it as a keyword because of it (including Bitbucket's diff view). I think it should exist as an optional rule to Ruff.

The only issue I see is that soft keywords also include `type` keyword, which is already covered by rule `A001`, so we would have overlapping rules, but it could be justified that it's not the same thing as it's used in two completely different contexts - it's just the token that's the same.
