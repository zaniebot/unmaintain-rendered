            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For additional context, refer to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8145#issuecomment-1817657808 and the following comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For me that would not help as I do not have a <code>tests/</code> directory. Instead, I have test files next to the files to be tested. e.g. <code>mypkg/util/string.py</code> has its test in <code>mypkg/util/string_test.py</code> and so on. I think for larger applications this is not uncommon.</p>
<p>I think ideally it would apply the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery">pytest rules for test discovery</a>, ideally with override settings or parsing of the <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/pythoncollection.html#changing-naming-conventions">respective pytest.ini options</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think mirroring the pytest rules for discovery would be sensible. It would also solve #8703, and arguably solve #6474.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, I definitely want to avoid parsing <code>pytest.ini</code> and interpreting pytest configuration -- it's just a huge pain to implement and maintain (and also requires that we know the pytest version and keep our settings in-sync with pytest's settings). So if we <em>did</em> do this, we'd need to stick to the defaults, <em>or</em> add our own limited configuration.</p>
