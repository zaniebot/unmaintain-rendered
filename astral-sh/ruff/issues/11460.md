Although it's easy to understand this rule, the example makes no sense.

In the documentation, the code blocks before and after "Use instead:" are the same. Both of them use the spaces but not tabs.

The source code of the HTML page also indicates two code blocks are the same thing.

It does (correctly) use a tab in the actual rustdoc source. Perhaps it's being converted automatically somewhere. We can just remove it.
