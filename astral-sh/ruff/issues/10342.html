            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice, if <code>--select=ALL</code> would ignore already deprecated rules.</p>
<p>I think, situations, where you select &quot;ALL&quot;, but do not want to ignore already deprecated rules are rare (but this is just a gut feeling).</p>
<p>see also #9778</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think we can have deprecation be a breaking change i.e. a rule turns off when it was previously on. It's an interesting idea though.</p>
<p>I think it <em>would</em> make a lot of sense to deselect these in preview mode (if we don't already? I think we do?).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is turned off in preview mode.
But I guess, that &quot;ALL&quot; can break already by enabling new rules, so breaking is expected, if using &quot;ALL&quot;</p>
<p>From https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#rule-selection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use ALL with discretion. Enabling ALL will implicitly enable new rules whenever you upgrade.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could it also make sense, to add a configuration option in the pyproject.toml that automatically ignores all deprecated rules?
Or is this already possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@marc-benz That was discussed a bit in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9778 I guess? I'm pretty hesitant to add that though. They'd also be ignored by switching<code>preview</code> on in your config.</p>
