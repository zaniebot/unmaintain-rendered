            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In a <code>stub.pyi</code>, I expect a blank line before a class (including its decorators) when it's defined below a function.</p>
<p>Before formatting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def hello(): ...

@lambda _, /: _
class A: ...
</code></pre>
<p>After formatting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def hello(): ...
@lambda _, /: _
class A: ...
</code></pre>
<p>For reference, the blank line is added by the formatter when the class sits below other statements, like <code>import</code>s, assignments, and other classes.</p>
<p>(I couldn't provide a ruff playground link because I couldn't figure out how to make it format a source file like it would do for stubs. Does such an option in the playground exist?)</p>
<hr />
<p>See https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4256 for reference - the missing blank line isn't intentional, but fixing it in black is apparently not trivial. Is it also not trivial in ruff?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense to me. I think that should be fairly easy to change. It might be as easy as removing</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/9ae698fe30cf3526f0e7ae237b800b3ed19a819f/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/suite.rs#L693-L706</p>
<p>We would need to gate the change behind preview mode because we can only release it as part of the next minor. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/1aad180aae84cd5d12d5a47c879183f559c871ed/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/preview.rs#L1-L0 for a few exmaples on how to do that</p>
