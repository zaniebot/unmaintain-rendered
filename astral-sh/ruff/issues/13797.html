<p>This issue is just feedback for the AST's API, not a bug.</p>
<p>I've been working with the Ruff parser, which has been really great so far. Thanks a ton for providing this code! While working with the AST, I have found the naming around <code>Identifier</code> and <code>Name</code> nodes a bit awkward. Specifically, <code>Identifier</code>'s <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/5e6de4e0c69660e8ca8608d1ac965216197756ce/crates/ruff_python_ast/src/nodes.rs#L3897"><code>id</code> field</a> is a <code>Name</code>, so I often end up with code that looks like <code>id.id</code>, because I use <code>id</code> to refer to the <code>Identifier</code>.</p>
<p>This is just a minor thing, but I thought I'd raise it. Would you consider changing the field to <code>name</code> eventually?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, <code>id.id</code> reads a bit awkward. However, most of the time, it shouldn't be necessary to access the name directly. Instead, you can write <code>&amp;*id</code> or <code>id.as_str</code> to get to the underlying string. You can also compare <code>Identifier</code> with a str etc.</p>
<p>Using <code>name</code>, unfortunately, can also be somewhat awkward:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>func_def.name.name and the same for </code>class_def`.</li>
<li><code>global_stmt.name[0].name</code>  and the same for <code>local_stmt.name[0]</code></li>
<li><code>except_handler.name.unwrap().name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We could consider renaming the field to <code>text</code> (TypeScript calls it escaped text), go for <code>name</code> regardless (same as <a href="https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/807331e9c71c50fe6133a4f2e6dbe587/21f20dfa54237927e18f8709c25f27512cf3a0ca">jsshift</a>) or <code>value</code> (swc).</p>
<p>Or we leave it as is and treat it as an internal name that you rarely need to access.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the code I'm writing (along with Sam), we often need to go from an <code>Identifier</code> to a <code>Name</code>, since we are deliberately keeping the <code>Name</code> intact as a name when passing it around, rather than reducing it to a <code>&amp;str</code> to keep more type safety, and benefit from the underlying <code>CompactStr</code> representation. As a result, <code>Name</code> is being used directly quite a bit.</p>
<p>If you look at the types, <code>Identifier</code> is a pair of <code>Name</code> and <code>Range</code>, but <code>Name</code> is just the name. As a result, naming an <code>Identifier</code> with <code>.name</code> (as you do in <code>StmtFunctionDef</code>) is reasonable (semantically, it's the <code>Name</code>, just wrapped up with a bit more stuff), but naming the <code>Name</code> within an <code>Identifier</code> as <code>id</code> feels wrong (it lacks the <code>Range</code> information that would make it an <code>Identifier</code>). As a result of that, I don't find <code>func_def.name.name</code> to be that awkward - it's not the fact it's <code>id.id</code> that is awkward, but that you don't end up with the pieces of an <code>id</code> at the end.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't fully agree with the reasoning about <code>FunctionDef</code>. IMO, <code>func.name</code> should be renamed to <code>func.id</code> to be consistent with renaming <code>Identifier.id</code> to name because the field's type is <code>Name</code>. For historical context, it used to be a <code>str</code>.</p>
<p>Either way. I don't think the name matters that much that it justifies the churn it creates for downstream tools. There are multiple projects using Ruff's parser today and while the rename isn't hard, it still imposes work on them for little gain, especially considering that it's arguable whether the new name is considerably better.</p>
<p>Having said that. I also don't care enough about the name. Feel free to go ahead with the rename if you feel strongly but consider the impact it has on other parser users.</p>
