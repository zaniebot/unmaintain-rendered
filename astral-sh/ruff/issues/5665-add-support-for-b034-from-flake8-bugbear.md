# Add support for `B034` from `flake8-bugbear`

Ref: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/releases/tag/23.7.10

> B034: Calls to re.sub, re.subn or re.split should pass flags or count/maxsplit as keyword arguments. It is commonly assumed that flags is the third positional parameter, forgetting about count/maxsplit, since many other re module functions are of the form f(pattern, string, flags).
