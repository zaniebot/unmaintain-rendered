            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for such a basic question, but I've always used the tools built into vscode.
TLDR: Are there any basic tutorials on how to use ruff inside of VSC?</p>
<p>I recently installed the Ruff extension but I'm not sure how to configure it.  Currently, I'm mostly interested in ignoring the line length warning.</p>
<p>I created a <code>ruff.toml</code> file in the root of my workspace/folder and added:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
ignore = [&quot;E501&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/line-too-long/</p>
<p>But now I don't have any detected issues (and I know I have some)</p>
<p>Are there any basic tutorials on how to use Ruff inside of VSC?</p>
<p>Thanks!
Dan</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately I don't know that we have a great <em>tutorial</em> beyond the tutorial in the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/tutorial/">docs</a>, which is mostly focused on command-line usage. But I'm happy to answer questions here or in Discord.</p>
<p>In this case, I <em>think</em> what you're experiencing is that if you use <code>ruff.toml</code> (instead of <code>pyproject.toml</code>), you should omit the <code>[tool.ruff]</code>, so your entire file would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">ignore = [&quot;E501&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>So, Ruff is probably trying to read that file and failing, and the error is being hidden in the VS Code logs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahhh...Bingo!  That was it.  I'm still learning how to use the different .toml files.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the quick reply!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries! <code>ruff.toml</code> is basically a unique thing within Ruff, and exists to support those that don't want to or can't adopt a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file (which is a standard configuration file in the Python ecosystem, but introducing it has other implications especially for existing projects that use <code>setup.py</code> or other systems).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good to know.  Most of my code is one-off to automate tasks for our staff members, so I've had learning more about <code>pyproject.toml</code> on my todo list, might be time to move it up the list and incorporate my ruff config in there.  Thanks for a great tool!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Should we add a warning if we find any ruff. Setting in a ruff.toml?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we should. We should also figure out how to surface warnings within the extension. Right now, I think it just fails silently.</p>
