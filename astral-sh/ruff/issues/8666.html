<pre><code>$ ruff check --isolated --select F401 --no-cache rufftest/ruff_sample.py
rufftest/ruff_sample.py:3:12: F401 [*] `foo.b` imported but unused
rufftest/ruff_sample.py:4:12: F401 [*] `bar` imported but unused
Found 2 errors.
[*] 2 fixable with the `--fix` option.
</code></pre>
<p>Tested with the latest master (0.1.5 + a few days worth of commits).</p>
<p>It looks like it only shows an unused import for the very last import from any given top-level package.</p>
<p>While I believe this will never result in a case where there is no warning at all in case of unused imports, it is annoying when combined with <code>RUF100</code> because now it asks me to remove the <code>noqa</code> from lines that are in fact unused imports.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I looked into this a bit and it looks like this is happening because both get added using <code>add_binding(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>, so the second one shadows the first one. No idea how to fix it though...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's a bit of history here:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/60</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7972</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5011</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to close as a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/60 for now. Submodule imports are really, really confusing and I haven't seen a proposal yet that correctly handles all the cases.</p>
