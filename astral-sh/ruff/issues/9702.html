<p>Hello, thanks for Ruff again! I noticed that enabling that rule can cause (probably) false-positive violations which I can&#x27;t say with guarantee they&#x27;re false-positive, but probably they are</p>
<p>Of course I can just disable that rule in the configuration file, but may be it should be discussed here about ignoring such cases</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import annotations

from subprocess import Popen

import ffmpeg

# ffmpeg here is library https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python
# Popen here is just type hint
process: Popen = ffmpeg.run_async(...)
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff 0.1.15</p>
<pre><code>ruff --isolated --preview --select S404 --target-version py312

&gt; S404 `subprocess` module is possibly insecure
</code></pre>
<p>Also it violates on such code</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import TimeoutExpired

import ffmpeg

try:
     ffmpeg.run(...)
except TimeoutExpired:
     ...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm this rule just seems way overzealous but there are a bunch of rules in flake8-bandit that just flag imports like this. I think my best recommendation is to turn it off. I know if we should change it unless the upstream does. I think there are other rules that actually cover <em>use</em> of subprocess.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping, actually I&#x27;ve turned it off, because I didn&#x27;t find good reason to keep it</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I&#x27;m torn on these. They&#x27;re <em>really</em> strict, but they&#x27;re also security-oriented rules, so it feels like it&#x27;s against the intent to relax them. I&#x27;m gonna close for now, though I do empathize with the annoyance.</p>
