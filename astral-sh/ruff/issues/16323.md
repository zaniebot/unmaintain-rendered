# F601 Dictionary key literal repeated check of ruff is not case sensitive, but python dicts are case sensitive

_Issue opened by @timothytrust on 2025-02-22 22:55_

### Description

I have a dict as follows:

    'Mio': 'million',
    'MIO': 'million',
    'Mrd': 'billion',
    'MRD': 'billion',

Ruff marks a F601, which is - from what I know - wrong: python dict keys are case sensitive.

Which Ruff version are you using?

I checked with the playground ([here](https://play.ruff.rs)) and it seems that Ruff doesn't mark a `F601` violation.

$ pip show ruff
Name: ruff
Version: 0.7.4

I just checked - you are right, I should updated. Newer versions seem to evolve quickly here! 
Thanks for pointing that out.

I just checked: even after updating to latest version, this error still persists. I updated to:

$ ruff version
ruff 0.9.7 (54fccb3ee 2025-02-20)

Hm, unfortunately I'm still not able to reproduce this. Could you provide either a full code snippet, configuration, etc. or try to reproduce this on the playground and then click the "Share" button and copy the link here?

Here's my failed attempt at reproducing on the playground [Link](https://play.ruff.rs/b0877ae7-e3c0-4542-8c74-13d9897bb72f)

Or could you provide the Ruff violation snapshot? Thanks :)

I found the issue & of course it was my mistake! Sorry for wasting your time. Thanks for pointing me to the playground however!
