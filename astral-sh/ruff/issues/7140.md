_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-05 06:21_


Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select D400 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
# encoding: utf"noqa"-8
# m"#" odule samba.cerpc.netlogon
# frm /us/lib/python3/dis-packag
"\
 "#"t" es/samba/dcerpc/netlogon.cpyth
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/703936860PY_FILE_TEST_121514025297412.py:4:1: D400 First line should end with a period
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/703936860PY_FILE_TEST_121514025297412.py`, the rule codes D400, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
