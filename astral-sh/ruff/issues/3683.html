Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I have a big Python project that I am migrating to use Ruff. For now, I disable some of the rules in order to enable them later (I do not want to break my CI just yet). However, I already defined some settings for the rules I will use in the future.</p>
<p>Here's a very minimal example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml"># pyproject.toml

[tool.ruff]
extend-select = [
    # TODO: fix docs in a separate issue
    # &quot;D&quot;,  # pydocstyle
    &quot;PT&quot;,  # flake8-pytest-style
]

fixable = [
    &quot;PT001&quot;,  # pytest fixture with parens
    &quot;PT006&quot;,  # tuple in pytest parametrize
]

[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]
convention = &quot;pep257&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py"># main.py

def my_func(arg):
   '''Return something
   param docs are not provided'''


   return arg+1
</code></pre>
<h2>What I expect</h2>
<p>I expect that when I run Ruff, it will only care about the enabled rules (the default <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> as well as the <code>PT</code>). <code>D</code> is not selected, so Ruff is not bothering to fix it.</p>
<h2>Actual behaviour</h2>
<p>Ruff detects (and attempts to fix) the <code>D</code> issues:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ruff . --format=grouped --show-fixes   
warning: `multi-line-summary-first-line` (D212) and `multi-line-summary-second-line` (D213) are incompatible. Ignoring `multi-line-summary-second-line`.
myproject/main.py:
  2:4  D415 [*] First line should end with a period, question mark, or exclamation point

Found 1 error.
[*] 1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
</code></pre>
<h2>Workaround?</h2>
<p>I don't know if it's expected behaviour or not. In any case, if I also comment the <code>[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]</code> out, the ruleset gets ignored properly</p>
<hr />
<p>Ruff version is 0.0.258</p>

<p>I generally want to enforce it, but not at this point in time, since the repo is too &quot;dirty&quot;. That's why I temporarily disabled the rule inside <code>select</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] and enable the corresponding D rules.</p>

<p>I see, I guess it's desired behaviour, then. Thanks!</p>
