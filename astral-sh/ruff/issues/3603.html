Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hello, I am new to Rust and Ruff. I have forked and cloned the repository to my local machine and followed the steps in the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/contributing/">Contributing</a> guide to set up my local environment.</p>
<p>When I ran <code>pre-commit run --all-files</code>, there were some failures. I fixed them by following the hook, but it still seemed a little strange. Therefore, I opened an issue and a PR to discuss whether we should accept the changes that the current <code>pre-commit</code> requires or change some <code>pre-commit</code> configurations to make it work without any failures.</p>
