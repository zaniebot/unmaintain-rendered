# Request: Autofix for `redundant-numeric-union`/`PYI041` & `redundant-literal-union`/`PYI051`

* [x] https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/redundant-numeric-union/
* [ ] https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/redundant-literal-union/

I lumped both rules together here because I think the fix is the exact same: drop a member of a union. Which is basically https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-union-member/ and sounds like a less complex version of https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-literal-union/ and https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-type-union/ which already have an autofix.

I thought these would go together, I feel bad for assuming and not splitting into two issues as I would usually do ^^"
