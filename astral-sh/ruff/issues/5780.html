            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a few nodes that are separated by a keyword. For example:</p>
<pre><code>with (x as y) # x and y are separated by the as keyword
except x as e: # Same
call(a, b) # a and b are separated by a comma
...
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice if we could unify the comment placement logic for all of these.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i wonder if an abstraction with two nodes with a single token in between makes sense, which would also force us to handle them consistently. We have the same pattern in slices (x[a:b]), argument lists x(a,b) and binary expressions (a+b). (also this feature is inconsistent because with (a as b) works but except (a as b) doesn&#x27;t).

<p>This task aims to explore if generalizing the logic is possible and, if so, implement the generalization.</p>
