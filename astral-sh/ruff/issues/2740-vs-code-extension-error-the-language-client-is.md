# VS Code Extension Error - The language client is not ready yet

---

_@mason3k_

Using version 2022.0.26 of the extension on Visual Studio Code 1.75.1:

When I use the command palette to run any Ruff linting command (auto-fix all fixable, restart server) I receive the following error in a pop-up:

"The language client is not ready yet"

Restarted VS Code to no effect. I have not customized any settings. 

Other specs:

Thanks for the work you do; I'm excited about the project.
