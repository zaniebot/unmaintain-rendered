# 📋 Black-compatible formatting of django

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-07-25 11:22_

We would like to format the black-user django as closely to black as possible. Below is a list the bugs to be solved and features necessary to reach black compatibility on django. This list is manually curated by checking `git diff` after `cargo run --bin ruff_dev -- format-dev --write django`

We don't plan on fixing the following black deviations because we believe that Ruff's formatting is more readable and implementing Black's formatting would require special handling.

* #6938
* https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6974
* #6976

@konstin should we close this issue or do you want to do another pass?

I want to shift focus to user reports and prioritize from there
