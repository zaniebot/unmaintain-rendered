# Docs request: default `pydocstyle` convention

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#does-ruff-support-numpy-or-google-style-docstrings documents that `ruff` can support `pydocstyle`.

However, it doesn't document:
- If `pydocstyle` is enabled by default
- What the default `convention` is (is `"google"` the default?)

> you'll want to explicitly enable the `D` rule code prefix

I would say this suggests it's not enabled by default, though I think it's better to explicitly state this the default behavior.

https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#max-doc-length states the default is None.

So I think https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#does-ruff-support-numpy-or-google-style-docstrings should say

> Yes! To enable a (non-default) specific docstring convention, ...

The keyword is saying (non-default)
