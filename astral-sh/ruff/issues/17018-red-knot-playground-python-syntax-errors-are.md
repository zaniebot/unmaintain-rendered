# [red-knot playground] "Python syntax errors" are reported on TOML files

---

_Issue opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-03-27 18:25_

### Summary

I added a `knot.toml` file in the playground because I forgot that it was meant to be `knot.json` in the playground. Some confusing "syntax errors" were emitted that indicated that the playground was trying to parse the TOML file as JSON!
