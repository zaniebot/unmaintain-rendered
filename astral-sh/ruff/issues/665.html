            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey,
I was thinking about adding a plugin for linting the code using ruff for the python language server (https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) but it seems like there already exists a language server using ruff, namely ruffd by @Seamooo.
I am wondering whether the plan for the ruffd language server is to become a full-blown LSP server according to the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/">Microsoft specification</a> or if the goal is to be integrated into existing LSP's?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My current thinking is that <code>ruffd</code> will evolve into a full-blown LSP server (it already <em>is</em> an LSP server following that spec, IIRC, though maybe it needs some more features).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/vscode-ruff">vscode-ruff</a> plugin also implements Ruff into an LSP, though that's based on <a href="https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls">pygls</a> as per the VS Code Python extension template, and there are plans to migrate that plugin to <code>ruffd</code>.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds great, I will ask the python-language-server maintainers in the meantime if they are interested in a plugin for linting purely.</p>
