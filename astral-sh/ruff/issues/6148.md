# RUF015 auto fix changes behavior

---

_Issue opened by @jc-louis on 2023-07-28 12:23_

Using ruff v0.0.280 with `--fix` the rule RUF015 changes code behavior:

```python
# before RUF015 auto fix
def fct(a: list, b: list):
    return a + [ele for ele in b if ele][:1]


print(fct([1], [0]))  # [1]


# after RUF015 auto fix
def fct(a: list, b: list):
    return [*a, next(ele for ele in b if ele)]


print(fct([1], [0]))  # raises StopIteration
```

We should probably remove the slice cases here.
