Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<h1>Python code</h1>
<p><code>sample.py</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;ａ&quot;
a = &quot;ａ&quot;
&quot;ａ&quot;
</code></pre>
<h1>Command</h1>
<pre><code>$ ruff check sample.py --select RUF
sample.py:1:2: RUF002 [*] Docstring contains ambiguous unicode character `ａ` (did you mean `a`?)
sample.py:2:6: RUF001 [*] String contains ambiguous unicode character `ａ` (did you mean `a`?)
sample.py:3:2: RUF001 [*] String contains ambiguous unicode character `ａ` (did you mean `a`?)
Found 3 errors.
[*] 3 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
</code></pre>
<h1>Issue</h1>
<p>There is a string in the first line of the code.
However, when I run Ruff, it raises an error of RUF002 which says &quot;Docstring contains ambiguous unicode character&quot;.
I believe that Ruff should raise an error of RUF001 which says &quot;String contains ambiguous unicode character&quot;.</p>
<h1>Settings</h1>
<p>no pyproject.toml</p>
<h1>Version</h1>
<pre><code>$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.264

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While a bit confusing, I think this might be correct, since Python does consider that top-level string <code>&quot;a&quot;</code> to be a docstring.</p>
<p>If you run <code>help(sample)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Help on module sample:

NAME
    sample - ａ

DATA
    a = 'ａ'

FILE
    /Users/crmarsh/workspace/ruff/sample.py
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the docstring appears after <code>sample -</code>. So from Python's perspective, it <em>is</em> a docstring, even if it doesn't seem like one, unless I'm mistaken.</p>
