Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>We did a large change of the PyTorch codebase with ruff in https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99890 by enabling C419 with autofixes. It mostly worked out of the box, but we did have to add back in one type comment for mypy that got deleted by the autofix: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/99890/commits/ad98f63af41f54ebb76a817037d1fda0612e3e1a</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, so it seems like we're not copying over the <code>lbracket</code> and <code>rbracket</code> fields from the <code>ListComp</code> node. Now, this is a challenge as we need to convert it into a <code>GeneratorExp</code> which only has the <code>lpar</code> and <code>rpar</code> fields. We'll need to pick the required parts from the Bracket nodes into the Parenthesis nodes.</p>
