            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>ruff format</code> removes hanging indent for a multi-line wrapped string. It makes code less readable, because distinguishing a comma at the end is much harder to visually count a real number of strings in a collection.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">python -m ruff format --diff
--- str_wrap_hanging_indent.py
+++ str_wrap_hanging_indent.py
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 some_dict = {
-    'This is the first line which well fits into one line of code',
-    'This is the second very long and very annoying line for the '
-        'demonstration of Ruff Formatter issue with hanging indent',
-    'This is the third line which well fits into one line of code',
+    &quot;This is the first line which well fits into one line of code&quot;,
+    &quot;This is the second very long and very annoying line for the &quot;
+    &quot;demonstration of Ruff Formatter issue with hanging indent&quot;,

<p>This dict contains 3 strings, but after applying <code>ruff format</code> it looks like 4 strings.</p>
<p>This is the most painful issue that stops us from using <code>ruff format</code> while <code>ruff check</code> is amazing!</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this case may conflict with other cases. Having an <code>[format]</code> option like <code>string-wrap-with-hanging-indent=false</code> by default is also OK to me.</p>
<p>This case comes from old PyLint 2.x rule W9500 <code>incorrect-substring-position</code> which I couldn't find in the newest PyLint docs. It affects hundreds of lines in our project.</p>
<p>BTW, one more example is necessary to highlight the expected result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">some_dict = {
    'This is the first line which well fits into one line of code',
    'This is the second very long and very annoying line for the '
        'demonstration of Ruff Formatter issue with hanging indent '
        'wrapped twice in total',
    'This is the third line which well fits into one line of code',
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, any thoughts and links how such case may be handled other way are welcome.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agree, this makes the code less readable. I want to change how we format nested expressions in general, I just haven't gotten to it. This is tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12856</p>
