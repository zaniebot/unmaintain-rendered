            <div class="timeline-body"><p>the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/pytest-composite-assertion/#why-is-this-bad">&quot;Why is this bad?&quot; section</a> for this rule states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Composite assertion statements are harder to debug upon failure, as the failure message will not indicate which condition failed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>however this is not the case for pytest, since it provides a breakdown of each expression in the failed assertion:</p>
<pre><code>    assert something and something_else
E   assert (True and False)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html#asserting-with-the-assert-statement">more info</a></p>
<p>since this is a pytest rule (because it comes from <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-pytest-style-pt">flake8-pytest-style</a>), this reasoning doesn't really make sense.</p>
<p>i would argue this rule doesn't actually make sense to enable at all when using pytest, and should instead only be used on regular non-pytest <code>assert</code> statements. maybe this rule should be moved to another category?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yeah, i think this is still a good rule to keep but maybe recategorized under <code>RUF</code> or something. personally i'm going to enable it everywhere except in my tests</p>
