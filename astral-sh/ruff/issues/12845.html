            <div class="timeline-body"><p>python has a number of introspection functions, among which <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals"><code>globals()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals"><code>locals()</code></a>.</p>
<p>these can currently be used both for reading of variables as well as for assignment purposes, say:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for foo in foos:
  globals()[foo] = ...
</code></pre>
<p>while it seems that ruff currently lets these slide, i believe that for both legibility as well as to facilitate static analysis, use of such invocations is considered an anti-pattern.
it would be nice to see ruff suggest users to reconsider using the likes of these.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That seems a reasonable &quot;restriction&quot; rule to me. Another relevant rule for <code>locals</code> seems to lint against mutations on <code>assignments</code> (although that's also something a type checker is good at catching).</p>
<p>I'm leaning towards deferring the implementation of such a rule until #1774 is done because there are valid use cases for both expressions. (@AlexWaygood what's your take?)</p>
