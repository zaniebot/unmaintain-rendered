# Request: Rule + Autofix to upgrade `while 1` Python 2 code to `while True`

---

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2025-12-09 18:12_

### Summary

(note: I do not want to discuss the merits of banning `while True` here, there's other issues for that: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3845 / https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/20390)

I would like a pyupgrade-spirited autofixer to migrate `while 1:`, which may be common in projects that used to support Python 2, into a more idiomatic `while True:`.

It's not hard to search & replace myself, but since it can be automated, I feel like it would fit right in with code modernization and consistency autofixers.

Whilst my use case is specifically about `while 1:`. Such a rule could be generalized to "Usage of an always-truthy literal as a `while` loop condition" and catch stuff like `while "always":`

This might be tricky or conflicting with a rule that helps you to catch accidental "always true" conditions. So I don't think we want to do this for all expressions that are always truthy but some well known cases

Agreed, that's why I scoped that additional suggestion to only literals (and not check any expressions), and only for "while loop conditions".

I'd be perfectly happy with just `while 1:`. Just trying to think of the bigger picture.
