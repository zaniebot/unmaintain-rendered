            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to have a linter that checks that all variants are covered by match expression. An example:</p>
<pre><code>from enum import Enum


class Foo(Enum):
    A = 1
    B = 2


def foo(f: Foo):
    var: int
    match f:
        case Foo.A:
            var = 1
    print(var)


foo(Foo.B)
</code></pre>
<p><code>ruff check ./</code> reports that <code>All checks are passed</code>. However, if you run the code it raises UnboundLocalError.
The way to solve it is simple (I guess): check that all branches are covered.
Definitely there can be more complex expression, like <code>case Foo.A | Foo.B</code>, <code>case _</code> which would be great to cover as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. I don't think Ruff is capable of running this today. It will require type inference to know what <code>f</code> evaluates to, to know which branches are possible. We're working on adding support for type-inference but it will take us a while.</p>
