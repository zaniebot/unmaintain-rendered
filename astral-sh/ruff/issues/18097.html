            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>There should be a lint against floating/unattached strings/docstring literals:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    foo = 1
    &quot;hello&quot;
    return foo


def bar():
    bar = 2
    &quot;&quot;&quot;world&quot;&quot;&quot;
    return bar
</code></pre>
<p>These string statements have no effects, and are almost certainly mistakes.</p>
<p>Use case: I mistakenly copy-pasted some stuff to a function, and accidentally put it above the docstring, thereby rendering the docstring useless. It would be nice if Ruff detected this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, I actually thought we had a rule for this, but I&#x27;m not seeing anything when selecting all rules in the <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/6340b9b7-a62b-4833-aadb-12979ea66a31">playground</a>. There&#x27;s some overlap with the missing docstring rules in this case, but they&#x27;d still be a likely error if the function had a docstring.</p>

<p>Oh but they do! Editors treat them as docstrings and attach them to the variables above, similarly to what happens if you put them on the next line to a <code>def</code>, <code>class</code>, or an attribute on a class.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems there&#x27;s some precedence for allowing &quot;docstrings&quot; after variables</p>
<p>https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s also somewhat common to document enum members.</p>

<p>Fair point, though in VSCode/Pylance there is a slightly more nuanced behavior that I&#x27;ve just explored a little bit.</p>
<p>In global scope or class scope, strings will be attached to the variable above. In functions/methods, strings will not be attached. An exception is the <code>__init__</code> method, where strings do get attached.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One easy and permissive implementation could be to warn on floating strings that have 1+ empty/whitespace line above them. This is anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve never seen a case of &quot;floating string as docstring&quot; where the string was separated from the variable instead of directly below it. Any such case could be easily interpreted as unintended.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another safe and reasonably strong heuristic would be to check if the code above is a variable type declaration or initialization. If so, the string is allowed because it might be getting attached to the variable. If not, the string isn&#x27;t allowed.</p>
