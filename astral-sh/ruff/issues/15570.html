<p>Even lines that are only nested 2 or 3 deep are marked with squigglies.</p>
<p>Even when there are multiple lines in a block nested 9 deep, I think it would be enough to only mark the first line of that deeply nested block.</p>

<p>I think there's a small design question about how to handle this situation, and we should be conscious of whether we are creating a breaking change by modifying where a suppression comment can go. But I agree that we can do better here.</p>

<p>I'm torn between this current approach and one that simply reports the first block that exceeds the limit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():

			if c:
				if d:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm torn on this.</p>
<p>Both too-many-branches and complex-structure report the entire function (and I expect so do other too-many-* rules). I also think that highlighting the function itself sort of makes sense, considering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Checks for functions or methods with too many nested blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a Ruff helper somewhere (I wasn't able to find it just now) that only extracts the range of the function's name. This would reduce the highlighting range but doesn't point the user to the relevant code.</p>
<p>That's where highlighting the first &quot;violating&quot; block would definitely be an improvement. But this is a breaking change (it's still a preview rule so it might be fine).</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that highlighting the indent is the right solution. It incorrectly suggests that something is wrong with the indent, which there isn't.</p>
<p>Has anyone looked into what the upstream rule odes or what other tools do in this situation?</p>
<p>Side note: The rule should probably be updated to support <code>match</code> statements</p>

<p>I take it that you are suggesting other rules should be updated as well?</p>
<p>If so, here's my take: The reported range is that of the first that exceeds the limit.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-public-methods/"><code>PLR0904</code> (<code>too-many-public-methods</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th public method is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-return-statements/"><code>PLR0911</code> (<code>too-many-return-statements</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th <code>return</code> statement is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-branches/"><code>PLR0912</code> (<code>too-many-branches</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th branch is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-arguments/"><code>PLR0913</code> (<code>too-many-arguments</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th <em>parameter</em> is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-locals/"><code>PLR0914</code> (<code>too-many-locals</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th local variable is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-statements/"><code>PLR0915</code> (<code>too-many-statements</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th statement is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-boolean-expressions/"><code>PLR0916</code> (<code>too-many-boolean-expressions</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th expression is reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-positional-arguments/"><code>PLR0917</code> (<code>too-many-positional-arguments</code>)</a>: The $(n + 1)$-th positional <em>parameter</em> is reported.</li>
</ul>
<p>This aligns with, say, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/line-too-long/"><code>E501</code></a>, which reports all characters from the $(n + 1)$-th onward. The collective range for all exceeders would be just as bad as the name of the function/class, if not worse, so the first of them would perhaps be representative enough.</p>
<p>(Off-topic: <code>PLR0913</code> and <code>PLR0917</code> will benefit from a rename and documentation update. They are currently not very distinct.)</p>
