# Possible false positives for RUF019

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

RUF019 can raise false positives if a class defines `__contains__` and `__getitem__` but not `get`. Alternatively, a class may implement `get` but do something entirely different with it.

(Yes, this is extremely contrived)

```py
class Foo:
    def __contains__(self, a):
        return True

    def __getitem__(self, a):
        return 7


class Foo2(Foo):
    def get(self):
        return "something completely different"


f = Foo()
if "" in f and f[""]:
    pass
```

I suspect you'd be unlikely to be able to do anything about this until red_knot is done, but maybe worth documenting in the meantime? Even then might not even be able to do anything about it for the `Foo2` case.

Ruff: 0.7.1

Thanks for reporting this issue. 

We should be able to do better with red knot because I understand from the rule description that it should only apply to dictionaries and not arbitrary other types. However, Ruff currently lacks a mechanism to detect dictionaries (it has one, but it has a too high false-negative rate).  Red Knot should make this trivial because it allows us to precisely answer whether `f` is a dictionary or not.

Looked into it a bit deeper, and the first example isn't nearly as contrived as first thought. Second one is a bit more contrived but maybe introducing different behaviour is worse than introducing a crash..
