# Ruff with Ale in Nvim Shows errors on things that should be ignored

Not sure if this is an issue here or with Ale. From the output of `ruff .`, you can see that S101 is being ignored. However, in the file itself I still see the warning.

And here is the config:
```
let g:ale_linters = { "python": ["ruff", "pylint"], "rust": ["analyzer"] }
let g:ale_fixers = {
\       "*": ["remove_trailing_lines", "trim_whitespace"],
\       "python": ["black", "ruff"],
\       "rust": ["rustfmt"],
\}
```

Also, we should probbably put instructions for this in the README, since this seems a lot easier than the suggested way of using ruff in vim.

Not super familiar with this tool... My best guess is that it's not passing the filename to Ruff? So we can't find the config?

Exactly. dense-analysis/ale#4414

This is definitely the issue! Thanks! Charlie, should I replace our current README with Ale since the config is WAY easier? It also one of the most popular vim tools.

Gonna close since I think this is handled by the upstream issue.

@colin99d - Can you add a section for it similar to what we have for `efm` and `null-ls`?
