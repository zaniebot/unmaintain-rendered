            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Howdy! 👋</p>
<p>Along the lines for formatting/fixing and import sorting and import removing, it'd be really nice if there was a tool (<code>ruff</code> could do it 😉 ) that would keep track of which imports were only used for type annotations and would move them to <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> blocks and replace their usage with string annotations.</p>
<p>(Once this feature is implemented, there's probably a related feature that moves imports out of <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> if they are used for realsies).</p>
<p>This would have actual tangible benefits (as opposed to just stylistic ones) as some modules are expensive to import.</p>
<p>Thanks y'all.</p>
