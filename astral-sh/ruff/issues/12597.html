            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Spinning this out of some of the discussion on #12595, as requested by @zanieb.</p>
<p>That PR adds support for displaying fixes, but hard codes in displaying <em>only</em> fixes at the <code>Applicability::Safe</code> level in the <code>Display</code> implementation. That really isn’t where it belongs: the <code>TextEmitter</code> is more appropriate. However, that also bumps into a number of other pieces related to design questions around what exactly to do for displaying those.</p>
<p>The <code>Diff</code> itself should simply produce the diff and any appropriate CTA, without configuration or handling for availability. The <code>TextEmitter</code> should be responsible for determining what to print. However, at present that is somewhat coupled because the <code>Diff::from_message</code> consumes the <code>Message</code> from which it is constructed, and produces an <code>Option&lt;Diff&gt;</code>. (As an aside: an implementation like <code>from_message</code> should idiomatically use <code>std::from::From</code>.)</p>
<p>Additionally, this should make it possible to solve the other problem with the current implementation: that it hard-codes displaying only safe fixes even when the user runs <code>ruff check --unsafe-fixes</code> (which <em>does</em> work in the absence of <code>--fix</code>, and should only <em>display</em>) fixes.</p>
