Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I love <code>ruff</code> because it includes so many rules, many of which I had never heard of before. As the tool adds new rules, I would love to be able to run something like:</p>
<p><code>ruff rules --list</code> and see:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabled rules</li>
<li>disabled rules</li>
<li>unused rules</li>
</ul>
<p>This method could exclude unstable rules, rules with auto-fix, etc.</p>
<p>I believe this would help users apply new rules faster and improve documentation. I could list all rules that apply to the project in a script to update my documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now it seems the only way to evolve with new rules is enable ALL and then blacklist everything you don't currently want. Something to see what new rules are available would be nice, this would give the developer control over <em>when</em> they want to take the time to triage new rules and not have it come when merely updating dependencies.</p>
