<p>I love <code>ruff</code> because it includes so many rules, many of which I had never heard of before. As the tool adds new rules, I would love to be able to run something like:</p>
<p><code>ruff rules --list</code> and see:</p>
<ul>
<li>enabled rules</li>
<li>disabled rules</li>
<li>unused rules</li>
</ul>
<p>This method could exclude unstable rules, rules with auto-fix, etc.</p>
<p>I believe this would help users apply new rules faster and improve documentation. I could list all rules that apply to the project in a script to update my documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now it seems the only way to evolve with new rules is enable ALL and then blacklist everything you don&#x27;t currently want. Something to see what new rules are available would be nice, this would give the developer control over <em>when</em> they want to take the time to triage new rules and not have it come when merely updating dependencies.</p>
