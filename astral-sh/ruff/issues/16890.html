            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the solution here is to fix red knot. :) The only &quot;solution&quot; here would be to catch the exception and then re-initialize the WASM module. The problem with this is that it's very likely that the WASM module will crash again.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @MichaReiser... perhaps in an ideal world the playground would catch any panics raised by red-knot. But in an ideal world, red-knot would never crash in the first place 😄 And fixing that problem seems much more important than making the playground able to catch and recover from red-knot panics</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One thing that <em>is</em> annoying is that there's no way to recover the playground when it crashed other than opening the console and clearing the local storage... (or loading a different shared playground)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah! I created the issue just in case. I agree with both of you!
If we have to come up with a reason, I guess it could become a bit of an issue if the playground ends up supporting multi-version Ruff in the future—like a panic happening only in an older version.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I added a few more try catch statements that should prevent that the playground crashes entirely but the solution ultimately is to fix red knot</p>
