            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As explained here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3549#issuecomment-1477242022 , Ruff cannot safely autofix all usages of <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/printf-string-formatting/">printf-style-formatting (UP031)</a>.</p>
<p>I would still like cases like <code>&quot;%s&quot; % may_be_a_single_element_tuple</code> to be raised, as they can be manually fixed.
I don't mind whether this is done through UP031 or as another rule (could be in FLY, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2102#issuecomment-1400731914).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This likely now relates to #3863/#7769 (fixable groups/fix applicability).</p>
<p>You may still want to split it in a different rule to separately configure &quot;fixable w/o type information&quot; vs &quot;unfixable (bad argument count)/risky fix&quot;. Idk.</p>
<p>In my case I'm looking to refactor out print-f style formatting. And prevent using it in new code across my projects. The following risky fix is acceptable during the refactoring phase (under the understanding it <em>is</em> a <strong>risky</strong> fix and needs review, but can be fixed later if missed during testing):</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">world = (&quot;World&quot;,)
print(&quot;Hello %s&quot; % world)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello World

print(f&quot;Hello {world}&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello ('World',)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @Avasam the applicability (safety level) is attached to the fix not the rule so we could generate an always applicable fix when type information is around but a sometimes applicable fix when not. Does that address your case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As far as the original post goes. I really just want to prevent printf formatting and raise location in CI . Autofix or not.</p>
<p>As far as autofixing goes. It'd be a <em>nice to have</em> for me if printf-style strings are updated even if it causes the constructed string to change. My last comment is just because I think those two features are likely related.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be happy to review a pull request that changes this rule to raise a violation when type information cannot be inferred. We should gate this behavior behind preview mode. We can explore an unsafe fix after.</p>
