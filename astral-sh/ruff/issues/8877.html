Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I don't think any linter currently checks for this, although I did open a feature request in those I knew of where this feature might be in scope (https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify/issues/188 and https://github.com/dosisod/refurb/issues/310). Whether they accept it, (and who knows when it would be implemented), this is still a check I'd like to see in Ruff as I don't directly use those other linters and autofixing should be possible. If you think this is a viable rule.</p>
<p>In-place operators lead to more concise code that is still readable. I'm not sure if there's any objective drawbacks (like a common pitfall for certain types). And performance-wise my understanding is that it should be faster (due to the in-place nature) or equivalent (thanks to Python duck-typing that will fallback to  <code>__add__</code> if <code>__iadd__</code> is not implemented).</p>
<p>Any of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">some_string = (
  some_string
  + &quot;a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery long end of string&quot;
)
index = index - 1
a_list = a_list + [&quot;to concat&quot;]
some_set = some_set | {&quot;to concat&quot;}
to_multiply = to_multiply * 5
to_divide = to_divide / 5
to_cube = to_cube ** 3
timeDiffSeconds = timeDiffSeconds % 60
flags = flags &amp; 0x1
# etc.
</code></pre>
<p>Could be re-written as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">some_string += &quot;a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery long end of string&quot;
index -= 1
a_list += [&quot;to concat&quot;]
some_set |= {&quot;to concat&quot;}
to_multiply *= 5
to_divide /= 5
to_cube **= 3
timeDiffSeconds %= 60
flags &amp;= 0x1
# etc.
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just thought of a special case with string interpolation that idk if should be included:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># from
base_value = f&quot;{base_value} end of string&quot;

# to
base_value += &quot; end of string&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Because it would break if <code>base_value</code> is not a <code>str</code> or a type that supports <code>+=</code> with a <code>str</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could first implement the simple cases of <code>var = var &lt;operator&gt; &lt;expr&gt;</code>. I think this could go into the <code>RUF</code> category. If anyone's interested, I'd be happy to give a look at the implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because anyone can make their own custom in-place operators, I think it is best to only support built-in types, though there [could] be an option to extend this to all types [...]</p>
<p>Also, I'd probably add these to your list as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = a or b
c = c and d
</code></pre>
<p>Re-write as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a |= b
c &amp;= d

<p>assuming <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> are <code>bool</code> types.</p>

<p>Different rule imo, and may require type information. But worth investigating. Even if the performance is negligible or too variant between Python versions, it could become a readability/preference rule.</p>
