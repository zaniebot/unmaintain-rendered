            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I want to use <code>ruff server</code> on a project where I want to introduce formatting and linting gradually.</p>
<p>My idea was to use the <code>include</code> feature in the <code>ruff.toml</code> config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">
# only lint &amp; format opt-in files
include = [
    'src/plots.py',
    'src/reports.py',
]
</code></pre>
<p>This perfectly works when using <code>ruff format .</code> and <code>ruff check .</code>  from the CLI, meaning that only the two files listed are formatted and linted, nothing else.</p>
<p>However when using the <code>ruff server</code> all files are formatted and linted. This is especially problematic when using the format on save or auto-fix on save feature via an IDE. Also way to many diagnostics from the linting are shown.</p>
<p>I looked at the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/64855c5f06f0ff796eb54b8db57017f0e11017f9/crates/ruff_server/src/server/api/requests/format.rs#L86-L98">formatting handler source code</a> and can see that the <code>exclude</code> list is already parsed from the config. However the <code>include</code> property is not considered at all. The same is true for <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/64855c5f06f0ff796eb54b8db57017f0e11017f9/crates/ruff_server/src/fix.rs#L36-L49">fixes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/64855c5f06f0ff796eb54b8db57017f0e11017f9/crates/ruff_server/src/lint.rs#L73-L88">linting</a>.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate, if the <code>include</code> mechanism could be added to the <code>ruff server</code> as well. Meaning that the server ignores format and fix requests, and returns no diagnostics for files not in the <code>include</code> list. In the same way it works for the CLI tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Your assessment is correct. The new server isn't considering anything from the file-resolver settings apart from <code>exclude</code> and <code>extend-exclude</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the simplest solution here is to use the logic of the various <code>FileResolverSettings</code> information from <code>python_files_in_path</code> function and incorporate it into the linting and formatting entry point for the <code>ruff server</code>.</p>
<p>But, a long term goal would to have some kind of abstraction which can resolve the path based on the given settings.</p>
