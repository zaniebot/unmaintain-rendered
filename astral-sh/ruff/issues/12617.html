            <div class="timeline-body"><p>code <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/0a603c34-c21e-4ab2-b645-54116e8fcdd0">(playground)</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def is_some(n):
    n is not None
</code></pre>
<p>here, the user is trying to do an implicit return, but python does not have implicit returns.  the hint given is this:</p>
<pre><code>B015: Pointless comparison. Did you mean to assign a value? Otherwise, prepend `assert` or remove it.
</code></pre>
<p>the chance of someone meaning to write <code>=</code> and instead writing <code>is not</code> is approximately zero.  if a pointless comparison appears at the end of a function, it should suggest returning it instead of suggesting <code>assert</code>, and the assignment suggestion should only appear if the operator contains <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>FWIW, I don't think that's the assumption the rule is making when it says &quot;Did you mean to assign a value?&quot;. Instead, I think the rule is assuming that the user meant to write something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def is_some(n):
    x = n is not None
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">GLOBAL_OBJECT = ...

def is_some(n):
    GLOBAL_OBJECT.x = n is not None
</code></pre>
<p>As a general rule, to me it seems more likely that someone made a typo than that they misunderstood the fundamentals of Python semantics (thinking that Python has implicit returns when it does not). But I think you're right that if it's the last line of the function, the more likely typo is that they forgot to use a <code>return</code> statement; it's less likely that they wanted to assign the value to something if it's the last line of a function.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I'd also accept a PR making the error message adaptive here depending on whether it's the last line of a function or not 😄</p>

<p>missing the entire left-hand side is a pretty big typo, and python is very frequently used by beginner programmers and programmers who do not usually specialize in python (like me, i'm mostly a rust programmer, but i know just enough python to get by with basic tweaks)</p>
