            <div class="timeline-body"><p>first: ruff is freakin amazing and incredibly helpful.  <em>thank you</em> for your work.</p>
<p>Apologies if this already exists and I missed it when searching:  I regularly use the <code>--fix</code> feature with pre-commit, but would like to be able to exclude certain rules from fixing, while still having them raise an error (for me to manually correct).</p>
<p>For example, I'd like <code>F401</code> to be excluded from autocorrection.  I'm aware that I could do something like <code>per-file-ignores = {&quot;__init__.py&quot; = [&quot;F401&quot;]}</code> to avoid fixing it, but then it won't alert me to them either.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having trouble with the name of this option. I think <code>fix-exclude</code> might be confusing because in the language of the configuration file, <code>exclude</code> already refers to <em>files</em> to omit. <code>no-fix</code> could be ok, but it's similar to <code>--no-fix</code> which is the command-line flag to force-disable all fixing.</p>
<p>I almost want <code>dont-fix</code>? But grammatically weird with the abbreviation. <code>skip-fix</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me know if that interface works for you! It's documented a bit in the https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/811 summary. (We desperately need proper docs for all the configuration settings!)</p>
