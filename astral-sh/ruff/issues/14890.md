# `D403` first-line-capitalized lint not alerting when the first line is after a newline

---

_Issue opened by @yoav-alexander on 2024-12-10 12:36_

My Ruff version is **0.8.2**.

When using [`first-line-capitalized (D403)`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/first-line-capitalized/)  in conjunction with  [`multi-line-summary-second-line (D213)`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/multi-line-summary-second-line/)
ruff fails to alert about the first line missing capitalization:

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """
    calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
        F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
        F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

    Args:
        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (must be non-negative).
    ...
    """
```

The ruff output is :

```
All checks passed!
```

I think the correct action would be to alert the user about the missing capitalization since the lint is basically useless when using `D213`.
Moreover, and most importantly, this is a deviation from how pydocstyle works, from which both of those alerts are
derived.

pydocstyle:

```
main.py:3 in public function `fibonacci`:
        D403: First word of the first line should be properly capitalized ('Calculate', not 'calculate')
```

If this change is accepted I think there are merits to renaming `first-line-capitalized (D403)`
to something like `docstring-start-capitalized` to avoid confusion with `multi-line-summary-second-line (D213)`
and `multi-line-summary-first-line (D212)` which are all derived from pydocstyle.
