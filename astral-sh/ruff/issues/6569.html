Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Running <code>ruff --check</code> (no configuration needed) on</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    for i in range(100):
        if i != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            a = 0
</code></pre>
<p>yields an undefined name error and a &quot;assigned to but never used&quot; error, whereas</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    for i in range(100):
        if i == 0:
            a = 0
        else:
            print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>is fine.</p>
<p>While one could argue that the former is bad style and hard to read, unfortunately there's quite a bit of code written in that style already. Is this something Ruff could understand?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for filing! Hmm, while I wish we could, I don't think we can reliably support this kind of conditional assignment. Even Pyright which has a much more sophisticated inference model marks <code>a</code> as possibly unbound in both cases. Ideally, we'd mark both cases as &quot;possibly unbound&quot;, but even that wouldn't necessarily solve your problem, since you'd still have to fight that lint error.</p>
