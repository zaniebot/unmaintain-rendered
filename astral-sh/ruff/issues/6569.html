<p>Running <code>ruff --check</code> (no configuration needed) on</p>
<pre><code>def main():

<pre><code>def main():

        else:

</code></pre>
<p>is fine.</p>
<p>While one could argue that the former is bad style and hard to read, unfortunately there&#x27;s quite a bit of code written in that style already. Is this something Ruff could understand?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for filing! Hmm, while I wish we could, I don&#x27;t think we can reliably support this kind of conditional assignment. Even Pyright which has a much more sophisticated inference model marks <code>a</code> as possibly unbound in both cases. Ideally, we&#x27;d mark both cases as &quot;possibly unbound&quot;, but even that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily solve your problem, since you&#x27;d still have to fight that lint error.</p>
