            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have a lot of warning about codes which were removed in ruff:</p>
<p><code>warning: Invalid rule code provided to '# noqa' at foo.py:123: ASYNC101</code></p>
<p>It would be nice if that wasn't a warning but another ruff rule, so that i can easily let the wrong codes be removed with <code>--fix</code>.</p>
