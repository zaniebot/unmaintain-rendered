# Ruff and reviewdog question

---

_Issue opened by @eremeevfd on 2023-10-26 15:01_

Guys, I'd appreciate a little help here, has anybody integrated reviewdog with ruff yet?  
Which `--output-format` value did you use?

@VianneyMI I saw you mentioned it here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/4982#discussioncomment-6140413 could you please share your config?

I'm gonna merge this into #8655 which is an explicit request to support the reviewdog format as a first-class `--output-format`.

Just so I understand, this was marked closed "not planned" because it's been merged with #8655 , not because we aren't going to have `ruff` + `reviewdog` support, right?

@ryaminal - That's correct, "Not planned" is confusing because it includes "issue is a duplicate" (if you hover over the description).

Ah, it does say "duplicate" but i totally missed that. doh.
Thanks for the response.
