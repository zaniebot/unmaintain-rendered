Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>The following code:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A really really really really really really really really really really really really really long docstring line.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;  # noqa: E501
</code></pre>
<p>Produces:</p>
<pre><code>⊙  ruff check --select RUF --select E --isolated foo.py                                                                                                                                                                                                                   julian@Airm ●

</code></pre>
<p>but indeed the <code>noqa: E501</code> is needed, with removing it giving:</p>
<pre><code>foo.py:3:89: E501 Line too long (117 &gt; 88 characters)
Found 1 error.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Trying to figure out what's going on here, but oddly I don't get <code>foo.py:4:10: RUF100 [*] Unused </code>noqa<code> directive (non-enabled: E501)</code> when running that command over that snippet.</p>
<p>What's the output of <code>ruff check --select RUF --select E --isolated foo.py --show-settings</code>?</p>
