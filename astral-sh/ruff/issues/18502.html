            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Several of Ruff's rules will be more aggressive in the diagnostics and autofixes they emit if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is enabled in the file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/deprecated-import/"><code>UP035</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep604-annotation-optional/"><code>UP045</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/typing-only-first-party-import/"><code>TC001</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/typing-only-third-party-import/"><code>TC002</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/typing-only-standard-library-import/"><code>TC003</code></a></li>
<li>(There may be others)</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, it's often useful to have <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> at the top of your Python file if you're running Ruff. Ruff knows that it can do a lot more with your code in these situations!</p>
<p>Ruff provides a lint rule <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/future-rewritable-type-annotation/"><code>FA100</code></a> that detects situations where <code>UP035</code> or <code>UP045</code> would make autofix edits if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> was present, and complains that you should probably add that import. But this rule has two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not have an autofix</li>
<li>It doesn't tackle situations where other rules such as the <code>TC</code> ones might make edits to your code if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> were present in the module</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruff provides a way to ensure that <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is imported in <em>every</em> file in your project: you can use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-required-import/"><code>I002</code></a> in combination with the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_required-imports">required-imports</a> setting. But applying this to a large existing codebase might cause a huge diff with many unnecessary edits in it, which is probably undesirable.</p>
<p>I propose that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a configuration option to make <code>FA100</code> more expansive, so that it also triggers in situations where the <code>TC</code> rules might make changes to your code if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> was present.<ul>
<li>I think this should be behind a configuration option, as the <code>TC</code> rules are very opinionated: not all users will want <code>FA100</code> to also apply to these situations. Alternatively, we could add a new <code>FA*</code> rule that sits alongside <code>FA100</code> and flags these situations -- <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13273#issuecomment-2336550747">this comment</a> argues in favour of doing that instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check to see if there are other rules where Ruff would be more aggressive if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> were present. Should we have <code>FA100</code> also flag modules where these other rules would make edits if <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> were present in the file?</li>
<li>Add an autofix to <code>FA100</code> that auto-adds <code>from __future__ import annotations</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm asking because I'm wondering what the behavior would be if we recategorize our rules. I feel like, nudging users towards adding the import is probably the right default behavior. Although I'm not sure where to put this rule if we recategorize the rules: Maybe a style rule?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What's a bit awkward about <code>FA100</code> is that the behavior is only useful when the other rules are enabled too. Should <code>FA100</code> not flag adding a <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> if e.g. the <code>TC</code> rules are disabled and adding the future import is only useful to a <code>TC</code> rule?</p>
<p>A third option is to have a global option that <code>TC</code> and the few <code>UP</code> rules check so that they would add the future import as part of their fixes.</p>
<p>To make a decision here, I'd find it useful to have a full list of rules that change behavior based on the presence of a future import with a short description what they use it for.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The whole reason why we received a request for improved autofixes here was that users didn't want to use <code>I002</code> to ensure that the import was added to <em>every</em> module. They found that too noisy as it made lots of unnecessary edits; they wanted something more targeted that would only add the import in situations where it would be useful.</p>
<p>It's pretty subjective whether adding <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> to a particular module is going to be useful or not. The <code>TC</code> rules are very opinionated; I would guess many fewer users have those enabled than the <code>UP</code> rules. If you don't have the <code>TC</code> rules enabled and you only want <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> added where it would be useful, you'll probably be annoyed if <code>FA100</code> starts adding the import to files on the basis that it would enable different behaviour from the <code>TC</code> rules.</p>
<p>So I don't think this new behaviour should be the default. Since writing this issue up, I've started leaning towards adding a separate <code>FA</code> rule rather than introducing a new configuration option to <code>FA100</code>.</p>
<p>I think your third option could also make a lot of sense. Though it might mean that we'd end up deprecating <code>FA100</code>, since it would essentially become redundant if its behaviour was just incorporated into the <code>UP</code> rules' autofix</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Definitely stylistic IMO. There can be some minor performance and memory gains from adding the import, but it's rarely noticeable. The main reason for adding it is so that you don't have to quote annotations so often in order to use forward references, and so that you can use newer typing features on older Python versions. They're all primarily stylistic concerns.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you think there are cases where users have the TC rules enabled but still don't want this behavior? That was the main reason I thought we could leave out the config option (though I added one in my PR): enabling the TC rules kind of serves as a proxy for the config option. I think you also have to have <code>lint.flake8-type-checking.strict = true</code> in many cases, so to opt in to this new behavior you already need to enable both rules and possibly configure <code>strict</code>. Maybe that's just an implementation detail of my current approach, though.</p>
<p>I do like the idea of a global option, it feels kind of awkward adding these FA100 calls everywhere.</p>
<p>Similarly, I didn't really like the idea of another rule because FA100 is already quite limited in scope. It made sense to me to expand its scope rather than add another narrowly-scoped rule, but maybe that's preferable. I guess it gives users the same kind of flexibility as the config option and could be more intuitive. FA100's name also doesn't really make sense when applied to the TC rules, anyway. That definitely supports adding a separate rule.</p>
<p>The rules that currently use FA100 are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/1f241b4cabe5b84d4c99b827bb088815d8d072d1/crates/ruff_linter/src/checkers/ast/analyze/expression.rs#L34">UP007 and UP045</a> (PEP 604 annotations)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/1f241b4cabe5b84d4c99b827bb088815d8d072d1/crates/ruff_linter/src/checkers/ast/analyze/expression.rs#L289">UP006</a> (PEP 585 annotations)</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe these all use the <code>__future__</code> import to backport their changes to earlier Python versions. For example, the PEP 604 <code>|</code> annotations are only allowed on 3.10 but can be used earlier with a <code>__future__</code> import.</p>
<p>(UP035 is mentioned in the issue body, but I didn't see any FA100 integration unless I overlooked it. I'm guessing @AlexWaygood meant UP007 since it's tied closely to UP045 but I could also just be wrong.)</p>
<p>I can work on a list of potential new uses today.</p>

<p>UP035 only suggests switching from <code>typing.Dict</code> to <code>dict</code> here if the <code>target-version</code> is set to Python 3.9+ <em>or</em> <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is present: https://play.ruff.rs/e7718e04-9bbd-4156-bc71-103634b01f36.</p>
<p>And if you're on Python &lt;=3.8 and you don't have <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> there, <code>FA100</code> tells you to add it: https://play.ruff.rs/4ee281fb-34b8-4f99-adf9-6633ea76ee69</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Other rules I found by grepping for <code>__future__</code> that could be affected:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/quoted-annotation/#quoted-annotation-up037">quoted-annotation (UP037)</a> -- you could unquote more annotations with the <code>__future__</code> import</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/implicit-optional/#implicit-optional-ruf013">implicit-optional (RUF013)</a> -- you can use the PEP 604 union syntax</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/runtime-string-union/#runtime-string-union-tc010">runtime-string-union (TC010)</a> -- I think FA100 is one possible fix for this rule, so a bit of a different relationship from the others but still related</li>
</ul>
<p>I also checked some of the references for methods like <code>SemanticModel::future_annotations_or_stub</code> that were used for the UP007 and UP045 detection but didn't turn up anything else. Do y'all have any other suggestions for search terms?</p>
<p>I think these cases are all a bit different from the other TC rules because they don't &quot;unlock&quot; new lints, but I guess they're still in the spirit of the issue title because the <code>__future__</code> import would be useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that a global configuration option is probably the way to go here, instead of a dedicated rule. With <code>flake8-type-checking</code> the design in the plugin was that you either choose the TC1xx rules if you want/don't mind the future import, and the TC2xx rules if you want to quote annotations instead.</p>
<p>The TC2xx use-case is currently covered by the <code>quote-annotations</code> setting instead of dedicated rules, but there is nothing covering the TC1xx use-case. My only concern with adding a global setting is that you now could choose both settings at once, which doesn't really make sense. So I would personally deprecate <code>quote-annotations</code> and make the new setting something that lets you make that same choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing (Neither TC1xx nor TC2xx are enabled)</li>
<li>Add a future import when it would help(TC1xx)</li>
<li>Quote type expressions in annotations when it would help (TC2xx)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently this would only target annotations.</p>
<p>However the TC2xx behavior arguably can be useful for other type expressions, like casts (uncontroversial) and annotated type aliases (somewhat controversial with runtime typing, more so than the annotations case).</p>
<p>Then there are type expressions that are always deferred, like type statement values and PEP 695 type parameter bounds and PEP 696 type parameter bounds, but they could still technically be relevant for runtime typing. The type statement is once again the controversial case here. Introspection of type parameter bounds and defaults is probably far less common and useful. But the main point here is that while quoting doesn't make sense, you may still choose to make transformations that would not be safe if the value is used at runtime.</p>
<p>So I think that needs some kind of setting as well, determining how aggressive those rules are allowed to be with their transformations. See #14787 for a TC-specific setting for quoting annotations. But it would probably harmonize better with the rest of the rules if it was a shared setting and didn't explicitly talk about quoting or adding future imports.</p>
<p>The most awkward part of these settings is probably the fact that we can't have the same solution for every kind of type expression. You can always quote type expressions, but it doesn't really make sense in certain contexts and adding a future import only helps with annotations pre-Python 3.14. Do we need a separate strategy setting for each kind of type expression or can we get away with something more abstract like proposed in #14787</p>

<p>I think it's fine to have more specific settings where the global setting expresses the general indent: I want to add imports where necessary vs. keep the changes minimal.</p>

<p>True, although it seems fragile for us having to remember that these two settings can interact badly, unless we prioritize one over the other, so deprecation and combining the settings seems more robust. I can't think of any case where you would want them to both be on in the same module, so it almost certainly would be an erroneous configuration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like there's some general consensus around a global setting that modifies the fixes of individual rules to include adding a <code>__future__</code> import. I think that makes sense, with the caveats that it might mean deprecating FA100 in the future and that it might require some further changes to harmonize with the quoting options. These seem like important considerations, but I feel like we can still move forward here and see how it goes.</p>
<p>If that sounds good to everyone, I'll start working on a new prototype. I'm thinking of the straightforward <code>allow_importing_future_annotations</code> for the option name, but I'm certainly open to suggestions.</p>

<p>This works as I would expect: <code>TC</code> rules combined with the <code>ruff.lint.future-annotations = true</code> setting do <strong><em>not</em></strong> add a <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> in 3.14, whereas they do in 3.13.</p>
<p>So is it not then the case that <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> should be eagerly <em>removed</em> when running on 3.14 as well?

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Since <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> still changes how annotations are represented at compile time in 3.14 it might not be a good idea yet to remove it by default, there may some corner-cases where code that runs with <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> will not run without it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I agree with @Daverball that <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> can't necessarily be removed automatically on Python 3.14. The 3.14 default behaviour is deliberately different from <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> behaviour in many respects. The hope is that most code that only needs to support Python 3.14+ will be able to drop the import without any issue, but it's not the case that the previously opt-in semantics have now become the default -- it's quite different in that respect to <code>from __future__ import print_function</code> or <code>from __future__ import with_statement</code>.</p>
<p>TL;DR -- it sounds like a good idea to have <em>a</em> rule to automatically remove <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> imports for code that only targets Python 3.14+, but I don't think that should be done by default for all code that enables <code>UP010</code>. We should either add a separate rule just for flagging <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>, or add a config option to <code>UP010</code> that lets users opt into autoremoval of <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes FWIW i was referring to the case when you have <code>requires-python &gt;= 3.14</code> in the context of eager removal of <code>from __future__ import annotations</code></p>
