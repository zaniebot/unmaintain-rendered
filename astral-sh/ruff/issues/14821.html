            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ruff does not seem to be able to detect unbound variables in python.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def test() -&gt; int:
    try:
        continue
        x = 1
    except Exception:
        pass
    finally:
        return x
</code></pre>
<p>Return no error of unbound variables</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2493 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6902 so I'll close this in favor of an existing issue.</p>
<p>The problem is that Ruff's analysis isn't branch-sensitive. It doesn't know that you can reach the <code>finally</code> with <code>x</code> unbound if the <code>except</code> branch is taken at runtime (and only if the except branch is taken before <code>x</code> gets declared).</p>
<p>We work on an improved analysis engine that can catch this kind of error.</p>
