Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi i have a similar issue to !2446, in our mono repo we have a global <code>ruff.toml</code> file which has per file ignores specified in it and we would like to add sub-project specific ignores in the child <code>pyproject.toml</code> file, but currently that will override those provided in the parent toml.</p>
<p>So i'd like to propose the addition of an <code>extend.per-file-ignores</code> so that we can add extra ignores without removing the ones provided in the parent config file.</p>
