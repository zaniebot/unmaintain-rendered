            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, this is a bit difficult to figure out i.e., whether a single path is being gitignored or not. <code>ruff-lsp</code> didn't do that either because it uses stdin and <code>ruff</code> would always provide diagnostics if checked via stdin</p>

<p>The <code>ignore</code> crate has a <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/latest/ignore/gitignore/struct.Gitignore.html"><code>Gitignore</code></a> struct which could possibly be used but we'd still need to collect all the ignore files to consider in it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'm fine not supporting this for now. But yeah, we face a similar problem in red-knot. We may have to vendor the <code>ignore</code> crate longterm and check for every new file if it is excluded.</p>
