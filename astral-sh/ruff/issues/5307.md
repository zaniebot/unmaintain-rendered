# N805: False positive with @abstractclassmethod

---

_Issue opened by @mflova on 2023-06-22 16:41_

Using the latest release.

Minimal example:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractclassmethod

class Rule(ABC):
    @abstractclassmethod
    def check(cls) -> None:
        ...
```

It forces me to rename it to `self` because it is not able to detect the pressence of `abstractclassmethod`

This one seems to be deprecated since Python 3.3 so I am not sure if it makes sense to fix it

I think it's reasonable to fix this, even if deprecated.
