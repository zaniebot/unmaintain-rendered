            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When running <code>ruff format --check</code> you get a count of files unchanged. When running <code>ruff check</code> you get nothing returned if there is nothing to report.</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff format . --check
2628 files already formatted
$ ruff check .
$ 
</code></pre>
<p>In our use case we include the output of these commands into some customer deliverables and in the case of <code>ruff check .</code> they can't tell the difference between &quot;This does nothing&quot; and &quot;There was nothing to do&quot;.</p>
<p>We can run with the verbose option -v but it generates a ton of output way overkill for our needs.</p>
<p>I note also that the -v flag makes the verbose output go to stderr and not stdout. Is this deliberate?</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff check . -v &gt; program.stdout 2&gt; program.stderr
$ wc program.stderr
   8425  108402 2300293 program.stderr
$ wc program.stdout
0 0 0 program.stdout
</code></pre>
<p>What we would like is symmetry between <code>ruff format</code> and <code>ruff check</code> so that a count of files checked are reported by <code>ruff check</code></p>
<p>Very grateful for <code>ruff</code>, brilliant tool, I hope the above does not come over demanding. Thanks for your consideration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please see #8553 — we will indicate successful checks in the next release. I think including a file count makes sense too it just needs to be implemented.</p>
<p>And yes it is intentional that logs go to standard error since it's not &quot;data&quot; meant to be piped to another tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @zanieb I missed the mention of logging in relation to the -v option because I was looking for (slightly) more verbose output.</p>
<p>Closing, thanks for the tool and the helpful response.</p>
