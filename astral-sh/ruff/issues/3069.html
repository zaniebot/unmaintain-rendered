Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/invalid-module-name/ is now raised on all the modules in my project that I have a leading underscore on. In my project, we have the convention that <code>_module.py</code> represents a private part of the API with the specific objects collected into public <code>module.py</code> files and the <code>__init__.py</code> file. This is to discourage end users from doing a <code>from my_package import _module</code> in their code (even though we specifically exclude <code>_module</code> from the <code>__init__.py</code>.</p>
<p>Typically the <code>_module</code> modules contain code that is &quot;internally&quot; public meaning we use it quite extensively inside the library, but it should not be used externally.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to add a configuration option to ruff that turns off the error for having a leading <code>_</code> on module names?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Quoting part of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#public-and-internal-interfaces">PEP8</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even with <strong>all</strong> set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages, modules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be prefixed with a single leading underscore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So my internal interfaces, that is the aforementioned &quot;private&quot; modules, should be prefixed with a <code>_</code>.</p>

<p>Yes 0.0.249 fixed this problem. Sorry I had not realized there was a newer release.</p>
