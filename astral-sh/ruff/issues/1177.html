            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We use <code>ropey</code> to support random-access and slicing on source code (see: <code>source_code_locator.rs</code>). I suspect that this is non-optimal for certain kinds of access patterns.</p>
<p>The basic problem is that we need to be able to take any (row, column) location and map that to a byte location in the raw text. This requires us to determine where the newlines are, but also, where every column lines up, since (row, column) locations are based on <em>characters</em>, not bytes (think: Unicode).</p>
<p>We used to iterate over every character in the source code and build up this mapping in advance. Later, I moved it to <code>ropey</code>, which was faster empirically and led to fewer off-by-one bugs. But for cases in which we need to rapidly slice the same string (e.g., grabbing the text for every token), surely there are faster patterns.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a good first task because it's a relatively simple and contained interface -- the locator just takes source code (<code>&amp;[&amp;str]</code>) and has to support slicing it based on locations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In theory, I <em>think</em> most efficient would be to build up this mapping during lexing, since we have to visit every character anyway.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I should probably also re-benchmark the manual version of this. I'm confused why it'd be slower than a rope for unchanging text.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Changing my tune on this... I think it really depends on the access patterns. It takes ~100 accesses or so for the Rope to be slower than the manual iterator (where we iterate over every character and build up a map from (row, column) to byte index).  We're pretty unlikely to perform that many accesses on a single file with our current access patterns. But if, e.g., we needed to get the span for every <em>token</em> (as in #1130), it could start to make a sense.</p>
