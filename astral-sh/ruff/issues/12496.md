# Consider adding a return link to rules?

---

_Issue opened by @Anselmoo on 2024-07-24 19:55_

Currently, rules are listed under https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules. When a rule is selected, for instance, [unpacked-list-comprehension](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unpacked-list-comprehension/), there is no way to return to the overview.

Furthermore, it is recommended to consider adding a discussion button, similar to the edit buttons, on the following URLs:

1. https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/adding-a-git-repository/?h=repo#code-actions
2. https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/buttons/?h=button

Option 2 enables the direct opening of a new discussion thread about the rule. This highlights the importance of discussion in reviewing the implemented rules, as demonstrated in #12345.

I would love a PR for this, I'm not sure how to make it work in MkDocs.

Would this just involve generating a link to the overview in each rule doc?

I'd rather not include discussion buttons, personally. It feels invasive, the repository is already pinned in the header.

Sorry yes, I was mostly commenting on the backlink.

Make sense ... had only the feeling people tend to open faster an Issue then going to the discussion panel.

So, rules and format are excluded from the navigation bar so as not to mess up the sidebar, but does this actually mean that a customized JS has to be used?

Sorry for the question, @charliermarsh and @zanieb, but do you know where the actual docs are in the org, I could not find the markdown files for the rules.

They're generated with `scripts/generate_mkdocs.py` which includes `crates/ruff_dev/src/generate_docs.rs`
