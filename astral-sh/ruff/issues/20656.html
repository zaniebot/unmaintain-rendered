<p>this behavior is mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep695-generic-class/#known-problems">known problems section</a> but i assume this was written before this feature was widely supported by type checkers, and i couldn't find an existing issue for this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this is still a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/bedfc6fd063e08f4d1e76ae8a780162404079298/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pyupgrade/rules/pep695/mod.rs#L321">TODO</a> from when I was first working on the rule. It's tracked in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15642 but only mentioned in the body, so it's probably a bit hard to find.</p>
<p>I'll make this a sub-issue rather than a duplicate for visibility. Contributions welcome!</p>
<p>We'll need to make this a preview change since the rule has been stabilized in the meantime.</p>
