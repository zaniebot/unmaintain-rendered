            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While #15359 fixed a ton of bugs with our diagnostic rendering, it did introduce one regression related to parser diagnostics. Specifically, prior to #15359, we would get the following diagnostic in one case of a syntax error:</p>
<pre><code>   |
12 | exept:  # spellchecker:disable-line
13 |     pass
14 | b = 1
   |  Syntax Error: Expected a statement
   |
</code></pre>
<p>(This is from <code>crates/ruff_python_parser/tests/snapshots/invalid_syntax@try_stmt_misspelled_except.py.snap</code>.)</p>
<p>Now, the <code>^</code> is missing from the above. After #15359, the caret is added, but the diagnostic is now pointing at the end of the preceding line:</p>
<pre><code>   |
12 | exept:  # spellchecker:disable-line
13 |     pass
   |         ^ Syntax Error: Expected a statement
14 | b = 1
   |
</code></pre>
<p>We <em>might</em> be able to fix this by tweaking the ranges emitted by the parser when creating a diagnostic:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/96da136e6af9791e574219099412393485f6ceca/crates/ruff_python_parser/src/parser/mod.rs#L489-L492</p>
<p>But I think it would probably be better to fix the renderer itself so that it points to the beginning of the following line automatically.</p>
<p>See #15509 which is related to this issue. These issues are technically separate since this one <em>could</em> be fixed independently of #15509. But if #15509 is fixed, then I think this one will automatically resolve itself as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A possibly-related issue came up in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19806">astral-sh/ruff#19806</a> with diagnostics at the very end of a file. Ruff (and <code>annotate-snippets</code> after #19806) currently renders diagnostics like this:</p>
<pre><code>try.py:5:1: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
  |
3 | &quot;x&quot;
4 | )
  |  ^
  |
</code></pre>
<p>with a mismatch between the line reported in the header (5) and the line the caret points to (4). This seems like the same issue because presumably <code>annotate-snippets</code> is pointing to the final newline in the preceding line rather than the first character in the next line, in both cases.</p>
<p>I looked into this a bit today, and it seems like quite a tricky part of the <code>annotate-snippets</code> code base. Constructing these lines happens in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/9bfeaaf8379cbf0479a96dd3b1482330d6854d0b/crates/ruff_annotate_snippets/src/renderer/display_list.rs#L1415"><code>format_body</code></a>, but part of the newline handling is in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/50e1ecc086d8aee95af3348379217e31c8bef162/crates/ruff_annotate_snippets/src/renderer/display_list.rs#L1049"><code>CursorLines::next</code></a>. That might not be as relevant for end-of-line checks as EOF, though.</p>
<p>Probably the part I found trickiest is how the annotations are added to a given <code>DisplayLine</code> inside of an <code>annotations.retain</code> call:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/9bfeaaf8379cbf0479a96dd3b1482330d6854d0b/crates/ruff_annotate_snippets/src/renderer/display_list.rs#L1585-L1591</p>
<p>So to get the error above to render as</p>
<pre><code>try.py:5:1: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
  |
3 | &quot;x&quot;
4 | )
5 |
  | ^
  |
</code></pre>
<p>and match the header, we both need to push another <code>DisplayLine</code> and move the annotation to it. We probably only need the second part for EOL checks rather than EOF.</p>
<p>Not sure if that helps, just a few notes for myself if nothing else.</p>
