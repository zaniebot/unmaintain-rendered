            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it does seem to have some knowledge of where to move the cursor to in some cases:</p>

<p>though i have no idea how this works and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textEdit">there doesn't seem to be any way to specify the cursor position in the lsp</a> so i guess this issue can be closed</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I don't think the language server can specify the cursor position for an edit. It's probably some heuristic that the editors follow which might even be different for each of them.</p>
