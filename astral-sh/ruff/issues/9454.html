Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-loop-control-variable/">B007</a> (unused-loop-control-variable) right now only checks a normal for loops. I think this could be expanded so it also checks the different kinds of comprehension.</p>
<p>Example of code that should be safe to fix with <code>y</code> → <code>_y</code> (correct me if I'm wrong):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(x for x, y in zip(xs, ys))
[x for x, y in zip(xs, ys)]
{x for x, y in zip(xs, ys)}
{x: x for x, y in zip(xs, ys)}
{x: &quot;value&quot; for x, y in zip(xs, ys)}
{&quot;key&quot;: x for x, y in zip(xs, ys)}
</code></pre>
<p>No unused-variables examples</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(x for x, y in zip(xs, ys) if y == 1)
[x for x, y in zip(xs, ys) if y == 1]
{x for x, y in zip(xs, ys) if y == 1}
{x: x for x, y in zip(xs, ys) if y == 1}
(x if y == 1 else 0 for x, y in zip(xs, ys))
[x if y == 1 else 0 for x, y in zip(xs, ys)]
{x if y == 1 else 0 for x, y in zip(xs, ys)}
{x: x if y == 1 else 0 for x, y in zip(xs, ys)}
</code></pre>
<p>Edge case of an unused variable which cannot be renamed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(_y for _y, y in zip(xs, ys) if _y == 1)
</code></pre>

If those are just trivial examples for iteration over some collection of tuples, I think I agree it'd make sense to suggest marking it as a <code>unused-loop-control-variable</code> although we may want a separate rule like <code>unused-comprehension-variable</code>?</p>

<p>They were meant as trivial examples.</p>
<p>My example just did what B007 does for zip in a for loop (<a href="https://play.ruff.rs/7ef36098-459d-44f9-82f8-e63249be676f">playground</a>). I agree; it would be much better to remove the zip in this case.</p>
