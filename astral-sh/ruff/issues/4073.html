            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the great work on <code>ruff</code>! I would like to ask if the official hooks in the <code>pre-commit</code> repository could be implemented in <code>ruff</code>. While these are not always related to Python, they are very commonly used and implementing them in <code>ruff</code> would benefit many projects. Some rules already overlap, such as finding <code>breakpoint()</code> code, but implementing the rest may be beneficial.</p>

<p>Nevermind, re-read 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@edgarrmondragon Thank you for the comment. I intended the example as one that was already implemented. However, the other rules, such as excluding files that are too large, checking Python AST, check YAML &amp; TOML, etc. are not implemented in <code>ruff</code> to the best of my knowledge.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd also love to see the pre-commit rules implemented.
Right now, my pre-commit rules include ruff and check-yaml and check-toml from the pre-commit repo.
If the pre-commit rules were included in ruff all checks could be done with a single tool.
While these rules aren't about .py files, they are about file types commonly used together with Python.</p>
