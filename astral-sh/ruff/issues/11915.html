            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, the rules which work with the tokens doesn't emit diagnostics after the location of the first syntax error. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo;

&quot;hello world

bar;
</code></pre>
<p>This will only raise the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/useless-semicolon/"><code>useless-semicolon</code></a> for <code>foo</code> and not <code>bar</code> because there's an unterminated string literal in between them.</p>
<p>Playground: https://play.ruff.rs/4c17a92c-0189-4b98-b961-27b04db14599</p>
<p>The task here is to disable this limit and allow token-based rules to check all the tokens. This raises a question: Now that the parser can now recover from an unclosed parenthesis (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11845), how to make sure that the rule logic knows about this and has the correct information about the nesting level? Should we reduce the nesting level if we encounter a <code>Newline</code> token?</p>
<p>We also need to make sure that this doesn't panic in any scenarios (valid or invalid source code). This can be done via lots of fuzzing.</p>
