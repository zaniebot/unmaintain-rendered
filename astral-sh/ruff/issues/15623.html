<p>Either way, you can try to run ruff without caching <code>--no-cache</code> or specify another cache directory in your configuration/CLI <code>ruff format --cache-dir /not/gcs/.ruff-cache</code></p>

<p>Thanks, the workaround works. GCS is not read only, therefore I suspect the issue may have nothing to do with GCS in particular, rather it could be any directories that are mounted through e.g., sshfs.</p>
