            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16804 completed, we have the necessary infrastructure to check subtype/assignability relationship between two callable objects. Currently, it only does the check for subtyping/assignability between two <code>GeneralCallableType</code> types, which effectively means <code>typing.Callable</code> annotation or lambdas, as those are the only things that construct the <code>GeneralCallableType</code>. (We do expose <code>knot_extensions.CallableTypeFromFunction</code> from <code>knot_extensions</code> which converts a <code>FunctionType</code> into a <code>GeneralCallableType</code> but that's mainly to help write tests for it.)</p>
<p>This issue is to check other subtype and assignability relationships involving callable objects that still need to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] A <code>CallableType</code> is always a subtype of <code>KnownClass::Object</code> (and never the other way around)</li>
<li>[x] A <code>FunctionType</code> can be a subtype of <code>Callable</code> (but never the other way around)</li>
<li>[x] Other (non-<code>GeneralCallable</code>) <code>Type::Callable</code> variants, like bound methods, can be subtypes of / assignable to <code>Callable</code>s.</li>
<li>[x] <code>InstanceType (with a __call__ method)</code> can be a subtype of <code>Callable</code> (but never the other way around)</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes. I actually thought we had already, but maybe it was removed at some point.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think it's fine to keep it closed. There are a couple other descriptor-protocol-related callable types that could still be given a subtype relation with Callable, but these are mostly internal and unlikely to surface in user code; if they ever do we can add them. Also I think they have overloads, which means it will be easier to handle them correctly once we have fuller overload support.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your work on this issue!</p>
