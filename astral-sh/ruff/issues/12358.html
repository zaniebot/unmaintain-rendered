<h2>List of keywords searched before creating this issue:</h2>
<p><code>C419</code></p>
<h2>Minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python"># test.py
a = [1, 2]
print(sum([x for x in a]))
print(sum([x for x in a], 0))
</code></pre>
<h2>Invoked command</h2>
<p>Assuming <code>test.py</code> contains the content pasted above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ruff check --preview test.py
</code></pre>
<h2>Current Ruff settings</h2>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    &quot;C419&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<h2>Current Ruff version</h2>
<p><code>0.5.2</code></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Perhaps issues aren't supposed to be created for <code>--preview</code> warnings. If so, let me know.</p>
<p>The C419 warning will trigger for line 3 but not for line 4. I expected that it would trigger for both lines.</p>

<p>No, <code>--preview</code> issues are great! Thank you! That's one of the goals of shipping in <code>--preview</code>.</p>
