            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Hi! 👋</p>
<p>I maintain a Python package (<code>XXX</code>) that includes a detailed <code>ruff.toml</code> configuration. I would like to avoid duplicating this configuration manually in each project that uses the <code>XXX</code> package.</p>
<p>Currently, Ruff doesn&#x27;t seem to support importing or extending configuration from a Python package that is installed via pip, e.g. something like:</p>
<pre><code>[include]
from = &quot;XXX.ruff&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What I’d like to achieve</strong>
I&#x27;d like Ruff to support a way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import or extend configuration from an installed Python package (e.g., scouter)</li>
<li>Or allow defining the config path programmatically</li>
<li>Or support a pyproject.toml option like:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
extend-config = &quot;XXX/ruff.toml&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This would help teams standardize linting rules across projects without copy-pasting config files.</p>
<p>Is there currently any way to achieve this? If so, could you point me to how it&#x27;s done? If not, would this be considered as a feature request?</p>
<p>Thanks for the amazing work on Ruff! 🙏</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. This has come up before, but we haven&#x27;t had time to make significant progress on it. One challenge with importing configurations from packages is that Ruff needs to become virtual environment aware and implement a fair amount of module resolution.</p>
