            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Quick question. Recently I've started getting the helpful code block displayed when <code>ruff check</code> fails and I'm not sure why. Perhaps my env was very out of date but I downgraded to version 0.5.0 and I've still got it, plus my other devs tell me they've always had it displayed so now I think I'm going mad.</p>
<p>Anyway, can I disable it? I like just the one line version. I've checked <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#">here</a> but can't seem to see anything.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">patch.py:534:9: F811 Redefinition of unused `period` from line 526
    |
533 |     @cached_property
534 |     def period(self) -&gt; int:
    |         ^^^^^^ F811
535 |         return int(self.charge_key.split('_')[-2])
    |
    = help: Remove definition: `period`
</code></pre>
<p>Preferred output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">patch.py:534:9: F811 Redefinition of unused `period` from line 526
</code></pre>
