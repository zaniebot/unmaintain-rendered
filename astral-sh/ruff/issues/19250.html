            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, we have two docstring parser which are specifically implemented for different purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>ty: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/05d0daf50f52d6ea358ba5d11315eb7581851965/crates/ty_ide/src/docstring.rs</li>
<li>Ruff: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/1ddda241f69d6e1aa651d279983a9738ddb2f892/crates/ruff_linter/src/docstrings</li>
</ol>
<p>It will be useful to have a robust docstring parser that is error resilient and is able to parse multiple into multiple formats (Google, NumPy, Sphinx, etc.)</p>
<p>This would also make it easy to build rules on top of a well-defined docstring AST and would also resolve issues in the current implementation: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Adocstring</p>
<p>This will first require a design proposal on what the AST would look like.</p>
