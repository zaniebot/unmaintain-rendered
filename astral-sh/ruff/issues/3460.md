<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Here is an example code that can throw an error:
```python
# NOTE this 2 lines are a hack to make numba work:
# https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/troubleshoot.html#my-code-has-an-untyped-list-problem
```
The code in the second line can't be trimmed down but ruff still outputs a bug of "line too long"

I thought we _did_ allow this, I'll take a look.

So I'm not able to reproduce an E501 error on that code. `ruff --isolated --select E501 foo.py` produces no output. (If I add some spaces within the URL, I _do_ get an error as expected.) Are you able to reproduce?

Correct it was some other problem on my side.

Thnaks!
