            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>Is there a way for Ruff to notify when a <code>per-file-ignores</code> item is unnecessary?</p>
<p>We have a very long list of <code>per-file-ignores</code> that we are slowly working through. It happens regularly that we do fix all violations of a specific rule in a Python file but forget to remove the corresponding item in the <code>per-file-ignores</code> list. It would be helpful if Ruff could notify in such cases. Looks like what we are looking for is very similar to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-noqa/">rule <code>RUF100:unused-noqa</code></a>. Is there such a thing?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an interesting question.</p>
<p>Short answer: no, this isn&#x27;t possible.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that this doesn&#x27;t just apply to <code>per-file-ignores</code> but to ignores in general, similar to Ruff&#x27;s unused-noqa rule (as you pointed out). It would require Ruff to not only track if a noqa had a &quot;rule hit&quot; but also if any <code>ignore</code> or <code>per-file-ignore</code> &quot;suppression&quot; was used.</p>
<p>Longterm, I think a better solution for this problem are baselines, see #1149</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, it seems like a &quot;baseline&quot; feature is something we could work with for this use case. I subscribed to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1149">astral-sh/ruff#1149</a>.</p>
