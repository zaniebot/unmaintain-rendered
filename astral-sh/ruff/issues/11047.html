            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've noticed what I think has to be a bug/regression in ruff's implementation of isort grouping. Imports that were previously reported correct by ruff are now being reported as unsorted, in a way that conflicts with pyproject.toml. This is specific to import sections.</p>
<p>Some search keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>I001</li>
<li>import sorting</li>
<li>import groups</li>
<li>isort sections</li>
</ul>
<p>Current ruff version is the package control 2024.04.19 release of LSP-ruff in sublime, which is, AFAIK, using the newest version of ruff.</p>
<p>In pyproject.toml, I have this configured (omitting the non-relevant stuff):</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint.isort]
force-single-line = true

[tool.ruff.lint.isort.sections]
testdeps = [
    &quot;tt_website_testutils&quot;,
    &quot;tt_website_tevecs&quot;,
    &quot;tevec&quot;,
    &quot;taev_ams_tevecs&quot;,]
</code></pre>
<p>However, the LSP linter incorrectly reports these as not sorted:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import tempfile
from pathlib import Path
from unittest.mock import Mock

import pytest

from contextual_singleton import Singleton
from contextual_singleton import apply_context
from taev_ams.collections.gitqlite import GitqliteAssetCollection
from taev_ams.collections.gitqlite import GitqliteSqlite
from taev_ams.collections.gitqlite import add_revision
from taev_ams.registry.registry_ import AssetRegistry
from taev_ams.tasks.collection_mgmt.create_collection import create_database

from taev_ams_tevecs.jinja_assets import LocalizedJinjaAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.sass_assets import SassAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import FakeFontResource
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import LocalizedStaticAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import SimpleStaticAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import SimpleStaticAssetV2
</code></pre>
<p>When I ask it to organize imports (via code actions), it incorrectly merges <code>taev_ams_tevecs</code> with the third-party dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import tempfile
from pathlib import Path
from unittest.mock import Mock

import pytest
from taev_ams_tevecs.jinja_assets import LocalizedJinjaAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.sass_assets import SassAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import FakeFontResource
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import LocalizedStaticAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import SimpleStaticAsset
from taev_ams_tevecs.static_assets import SimpleStaticAssetV2

from contextual_singleton import Singleton
from contextual_singleton import apply_context
from taev_ams.collections.gitqlite import GitqliteAssetCollection
from taev_ams.collections.gitqlite import GitqliteSqlite
from taev_ams.collections.gitqlite import add_revision
from taev_ams.registry.registry_ import AssetRegistry
from taev_ams.tasks.collection_mgmt.create_collection import create_database
</code></pre>
<p>I'm... not going crazy here, am I? I'm 99% sure I had ruff sorting these correctly, but I first noticed them being &quot;wrong&quot; ... yesterday? the day before yesterday? I'm not sure. Suspiciously close to the latest release, but memory is a fickle thing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10149, the behavior was changed such that sections that aren't present in the <code>sections</code> setting are mapped to the default section, which is <code>third-party</code>? So now the imports in <code>testdeps</code> are being grouped with <code>third-party</code>.</p>
<p>You might want to add something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint.isort.sections]
section-order = [
    &quot;future&quot;,
    &quot;third-party&quot;,
    &quot;first-party&quot;,
    &quot;local-folder&quot;,
    &quot;testdeps&quot;,

<p><strong>I think I would still consider this a documentation issue, though maybe just with the release notes.</strong> I know there's explicitly no guarantee of stability right now, but especially when it comes to plugins like LSP packages for IDEs (where I don't realistically have the ability to pin a ruff version), it blindsided me. I'd say part of the difficulty is definitely the slightly-different spelling from isort's docs; when I'm unsure of something, I'm frequently bouncing back and forth between them, and it's just... hard to keep track of stuff, I guess.</p>
<p>Iunno. It's 23:00 on a Friday night here, and I've had a few beers, so maybe I'm just tired haha</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll add a note on this in the documentation. I <em>think</em> this change was intentionally bringing us more in-line with isort's behavior, and I <em>thought</em> we were warning before when custom sections were omitted from <code>section-order</code>, but I might be totally wrong! I'm sorry for the trouble but glad we could resolve quickly.</p>
