<p>Just filed this issue so you can keep it from crashing!</p>
<p>Then again, it doesn’t work: Ruff still tries to parse the pyproject.toml in there. Any way to keep it from doing that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Would you be able to provide some more information about the directory structure here, or, even better, a minimal reproducible example? And does this problem happen only with VSCode or does it also happen when you invoke <code>ruff</code> from the command line?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don’t think the directory structure matters, just having an unescaped <code>{{</code> in your <code>ruff.exclude</code>, so the original comment should contain your minimum example!</p>
<p>It happens only in the extension, so this should probably be moved to the ruff-vscode repo, sorry about that!</p>
<p>The link in the panic itself directed me here, so maybe you should make it so when the extension’s server panics, people are directed to there?</p>

<p>Well it could be an issue with <code>ruff server</code> not the VSCode per se, so I think this is the right spot</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah I was confused, I thought you also had to have an invalid <code>pyproject.toml</code> somewhere, but you're saying just the unescaped braces in the VSCode settings is causing this. Okay, I'll try to reproduce.</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion: the invalid pyproject.toml is irrelevant, it’s just what prompted me to want <code>{{</code> in a path, which is kinda uncommon.</p>
<p>If you know how to keep the Ruff extension from trying to parse that file, I’d appreciate it, but it’s not necessary to cause this bug.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16407, which fixed a similar issue in the CLI. This must be a different globbing call in the server.</p>
<p>Fortunately it was pretty easy to fix with <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/fn.escape.html"><code>globset::escape</code></a>, or we could possibly try to reuse the <code>GlobPath</code> type I added.</p>
