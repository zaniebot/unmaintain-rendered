Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>If I run Ruff on this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">foo  # noqab
</code></pre>
<p>with these arguments and no config file:</p>
<pre><code>ruff check --select F,PGH004 testcase.py
</code></pre>
<p>it reports no errors.</p>
<p>I would expect Ruff to report either <code>F821</code>, because <code>foo</code> is undefined, or <code>PGH004</code>, because no rule code was specified.</p>
<p>This seems to happen whenever there is a non-whitespace character after <code>noqa</code>. If there is nothing or whitespace after <code>noqa</code>,  <code>PGH004</code> is reported as expected.</p>
<p>Tested on Ruff 0.0.274.</p>
<p>Some context: I originally had <code># noqa[SLF001]</code> in my code, in an attempt to specify a rule, but accidentally using the mypy suppression syntax instead of the flake8 suppression syntax. Fortunately I realized this mistake soon, but otherwise the blanket suppression could have hidden unexpected errors, which is exactly what <code>PGH004</code> seeks to prevent.</p>
<p>This could be fixed by implementing more of #850, but if that is going to take a while, perhaps there could be a dedicated fix for this issue, by either ignoring the <code>noqa</code> in cases like this or reporting <code>PGH004</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately, this is consistent with Flake8. If you use <code># ruff: noqa</code>, it'll act as you expect: we <em>won't</em> ignore the code, and we'll show you a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">❯ ruff check foo.py
warning: Unexpected suffix on `noqa` directive: &quot;# ruff: noqa[]&quot;
foo.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Preemptively closing because, while confusing, I think this is expected for Flake8 compatibility, and the recommended solution is to use the Ruff-specific suppression comment, but happy to keep discussing of course.)</p>
