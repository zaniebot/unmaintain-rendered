            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In Neovim when I open a python file in neovim with ruff server configured (in same as in other repo where don't see any error messages) I get this message:</p>
<p><code>LSP[ruff] Error while resolving settings from workspace /&lt;my_repo&gt;. Please refer to the logs for more details.</code></p>
<p>However the <code>:LspLog</code> in Neovim is empty. Is there some other log file where I can find more details?</p>
<h2>env</h2>
<ul>
<li>neovim 0.10.2</li>
<li>ruff 0.7.0</li>
<li>lsp_config is empty/default:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local lsp = require('lspconfig')
lsp.ruff.setup {}
</code></pre>
<h2>similar issues:</h2>
<p>I found a similar issue where the solution seemed to be to activate notifications in VScode, but this is for another editor that doesn't have the ruff server configuration.</p>

<p>There are similar settings for other editors as well. So, for Neovim you'd do the following which is mentioned as the last snippet on https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup/#neovim:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">require('lspconfig').ruff.setup {
  trace = 'messages',
  init_options = {
    settings = {
      logLevel = 'debug',
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
