<p>These two rules do the exact same thing but, have slightly different logic. They should be an alias of one another but appear to each be there own rule:
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/repeated-isinstance-calls/ and https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-isinstance-call/ do the same thing, and have the same autofix implemented. Seems like this wasn&#x27;t notice when the PR was merged <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4792">astral-sh/ruff#4792</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I prefer the original logic that always converted the isinstance call to check against a type tuple. While the new Union logic is really snazzy in Python 3.11, it is a little bit slower in practice and having the pyupgrade rule take care of it means we can opt out of it which is not possible with the PyLint check</p>
