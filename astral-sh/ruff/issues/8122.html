Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>These two rules do the exact same thing but, have slightly different logic. They should be an alias of one another but appear to each be there own rule:
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/repeated-isinstance-calls/ and https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-isinstance-call/ do the same thing, and have the same autofix implemented. Seems like this wasn't notice when the PR was merged https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4792</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I prefer the original logic that always converted the isinstance call to check against a type tuple. While the new Union logic is really snazzy in Python 3.11, it is a little bit slower in practice and having the pyupgrade rule take care of it means we can opt out of it which is not possible with the PyLint check</p>
