            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have set up my editor to run <code>ruff -- -</code>, passing the buffer contents via stdin</p>
<p>Everything with a shebang sees a false positive EXE001 &quot;Shebang is present but file is not executable&quot;.</p>
<p>Ruff can't know either way, I've only given it the file contents.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>providing <code>--stdin-filename</code> allows ruff to get this right (which I had thought I was doing, but I wasn't).</p>
<p>So that reduces the severity of this somewhat.  But still: ruff shouldn't declare that a file is or isn't executable when in fact it just doesn't know.</p>
