<pre><code>$ uv sync --group=testing
Resolved 255 packages in 6ms
error: Distribution `ruff==0.12.10 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on Linux (`manylinux_2_35_x86_64`), but `ruff` (v0.12.10) only has wheels for the following platforms: `manylinux_2_17_armv7l`, `manylinux2014_armv7l`, `linux_armv6l`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels

<h3>Version</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If this is a new break, could you try once more? This issue was filed while the release job was running, so if you just ran into this it's possible something was slightly out of sync.</p>
