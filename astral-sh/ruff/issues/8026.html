            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm actually going to open and then close this.  It's an interesting idea, but probably too much work, and may not be popular.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/084.htm">This treatise</a> on monolithic classes by OO expert Herb Sutter proposes the general principle that bare functions should be preferred when they can be implemented using the public interface of a class.</p>
<p>Could Ruff incorporate a rule for monolithic classes (more than a given number of member functions) that detects those members that could be implemented using the public interface of the class, and suggest that those members be converted to bare functions?</p>
