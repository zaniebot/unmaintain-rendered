# Improve settings documentation to include possible values for enum types

For example https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#pydocstyle doesn't say what's the possible values for the type `Convention`.

Definitely! I wonder if we can autogenerate these.

I think it's a little tricky to autogenerate these, `#[option(possible_values = "x,y,z")]` certainly will work but it feels tedious, and we don't have access to the actual value type in the proc-macro.

Yeah. I guess there are few enough values that we can just update them manually as a first pass.

I can do it, don't mind.
