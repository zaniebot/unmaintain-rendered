            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is a frequently annoy bug for my pre-commit, that running ruff format will not tell you what file was actually updated, even with '-v'.    My issue happened when I accidentally staged a file that needed work, but didn't see any file that I wanted to commit in &quot;changes&quot;.</p>
<p>See also, https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit/issues/145  which I suspect will need to add &quot;-v&quot; default args or some such once ruff format has a capability /option to show what files it modified.</p>
