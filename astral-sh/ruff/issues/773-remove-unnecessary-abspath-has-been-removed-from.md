# Remove unnecessary abspath has been removed from pyupgrade

_@JonathanPlasse_

Hi, 
I just discovered `Ruff`, love it :heart_eyes: 
This is the [commit](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/commit/a89ff428e9c6f394bd91135e5eee568df77814f2), which removed it.
Should it be removed?

Sadly yes, it should be! Anthony made me aware of this yesterday. Thanks for filing the issue.

Can I make a pull request to remove it?

Of course, that would be welcome.
