# [Rule Request] Equivalent of `RUF032` for `Fraction`

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-07-31 23:42_

### Summary

It seems odd to me that `RUF032` only covers `Decimal`, when `Fraction` has the same issues as `Decimal`:
```py
>>> Fraction(4.2)
Fraction(4728779608739021, 1125899906842624)
```
It would make for nicer parity if `RUF032` incorporated/there was a new rule for flagging `Fraction`s with float arguments as well.

Makes sense to me. I guess another option would be combining it with `RUF032`, although it doesn't really fit the name in that case ([decimal-from-float-literal (RUF032)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/decimal-from-float-literal/#decimal-from-float-literal-ruf032)).
