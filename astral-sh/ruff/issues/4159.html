<blockquote>
<p><strong>mike</strong> is a Python utility to easily deploy multiple versions of your <a href="http://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>-powered docs to a Git branch, suitable for deploying to Github via <code>gh-pages</code>. To see an example of this in action, take a look at the documentation for <a href="https://jimporter.github.io/bfg9000">bfg9000</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh we did this over at Prefect and opted for a separate repository to contain all of the built documentation rather than using a branch in the primary repository. On each release of the primary repository, a job is triggered in the documentation repository which pulls the release source, builds the documentation, checks it into the repository, and opens an auto-merged pull request for the version. On merge to main, it's deployed via Netlify to production. Unfortunately the documentation repository is not public at this time so I don't have an example to point to (cc @desertaxle changing it to public was something I was working on if you have the time to finish the process ❤️).</p>
