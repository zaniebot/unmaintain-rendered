# Implement flake8-debugger

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-11-02 03:12_

This is the 13th most popular plugin, and has a pretty small surface area.

@karpa4o4 - Yeah! Here's a recent PR that added `flake8-blind-except`: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/805/files. It helps illustrate the various steps involved in implementing a new plugin. You can follow that as a starting point, even that you'll want to add multiple rules (one for each in `flake8-debugger`), and you'll want your corresponding `src/flake8_blind_except/plugins.rs` file to contain one function per rule.

There's also the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#example-adding-a-new-lint-rule) guide which talks through adding a new lint rule, which is a subset of what's required to add a new plugin.
