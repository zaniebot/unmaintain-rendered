Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>While it is possible to handle this using <code>extend-immutable-calls</code>, you'd have to manually add all NewType wrappers into the list if the NewType is using an immutable underlying type. The user experience would be much simpler and nicer to just use the underlying type of the NewType.</p>
<p>Of course, this would require some amount of type level knowledge and cross-file knowledge so I know that it'd be hard for ruff, but it also certainly doesn't fit in a type checker.</p>
