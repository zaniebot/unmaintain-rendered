            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After discussions in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15732 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15729 an idea was proposed to add a rule for checking unnecessary membership test in empty collections.</p>
<p>This would reinstate the old behavior in rule PLR6201 to explicitly check for things like <code>if 1 in []</code> or <code>if 'a' not in ''</code>.</p>
<p>Should ruff include it?</p>
<p>Example implementation is here: #16480</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unrelated on whether we decide to add this rule. I think I'd prefer naming it <code>in-empty-sequence</code> to match python's semantics OR exclude <code>str</code> from the rule</p>

<p>Strings are immutable <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq">sequences</a> of Unicode code points. String literals are written in a variety of ways:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm personally happy with the rule, was just checking boxes - sorry for the bureaucratic red tape! @naslundx would you like to sync with main, respond to the remaining comments on the PR and we can get this landed?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On the name semantics, <code>in</code> is the operator for <code>__contains__</code> * (see message below for caveat), and <code>typing.Container</code> is the Protocol for <code>def __contains__</code>. So <code>in-empty-container</code> ?
That covers strings, lists, tuples, dicts, sets, deque, and I'm sure many other stdlib containers I'm forgetting.
Ok, these are all collections... tbh I'm having a hard time finding a stdlib container that isn't a collection XD</p>
<p>Btw sequences are collections with a few extra methods. So the originally proposed name <code>in-empty-collection</code> still works whilst including strings imo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>&quot;&quot; in iter(())</code> and <code>&quot;&quot; in iter(&quot;&quot;)</code> (ie: <code>Iterator[Never]</code>) seem to be in the spirit of this rule, but not a <code>Container</code> in the Protocol sense. But <code>in</code> also works for Iterables and implementers of <code>__getitem__()</code>  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in</p>
<p>Actually, any empty <code>&lt;whatever this rule checks for&gt;</code> passed to <code>iter</code> I guess.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not a problem at all @dylwil3 , sorry for dropping this for a while.</p>
<p>Agree with @Avasam that <code>collection</code> seems like the more proper name considering it doesn't just apply to sequences.</p>
<p>I will polish up the PR.</p>
