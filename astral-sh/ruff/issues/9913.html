<pre><code>Run git clone https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff.git ruff
Cloning into 'ruff'...
  Installing ruff v0.2.1 (/home/runner/work/Automated-Fuzzer/Automated-Fuzzer/ruff/crates/ruff)
    Updating crates.io index
error: failed to compile `ruff v0.2.1 (/home/runner/work/Automated-Fuzzer/Automated-Fuzzer/ruff/crates/ruff)`, intermediate artifacts can be found at `/home/runner/work/Automated-Fuzzer/Automated-Fuzzer/ruff/target`.
To reuse those artifacts with a future compilation, set the environment variable `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to that path.
Caused by:
  failed to select a version for the requirement `pyproject-toml = &quot;^0.8.2&quot;`
  candidate versions found which didn't match: 0.9.0, 0.8.1, 0.8.0, ...
  location searched: crates.io index
  required by package `ruff_linter v0.2.1 (/home/runner/work/Automated-Fuzzer/Automated-Fuzzer/ruff/crates/ruff_linter)`
      ... which satisfies path dependency `ruff_linter` of package `ruff v0.2.1 (/home/runner/work/Automated-Fuzzer/Automated-Fuzzer/ruff/crates/ruff)`
  perhaps a crate was updated and forgotten to be re-vendored?
Error: Process completed with exit code 101.
