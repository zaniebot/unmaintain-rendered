            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should allow content to follow suppression comments e.g. to provide a reason for the <code># noqa</code>.</p>
<p>We need to decide on a format to support with considerations of compatibility with other tools.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have been using <code>--</code> since it was encouraged by <a href="https://mysticatea.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/rules/require-description.html">this ESLint rule</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not personally too particular about the format. However, I think it would be wise to ensure compatibility with both Flake8 and Black since many incoming codebases are migrated from one or both.</p>
<p>I also think it's important that this enhancement does not break compatibility with Pyright/Mypy suppressions on the same line. This is not an uncommon occurrence, since something that violates the type system likely also violates one or more lint rules.</p>
