Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Ruff version <code>0.2.0</code>
or the bellow code following commands are not working, it should fix the space between two functions according to PEP E302 rule.</p>
<pre><code>ruff check .

<pre><code>ruff check --fix .

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh thanks! I've been considering transitioning from using pre-commit with flake8 to pre-commit with ruff. However, upon reflection, it seems this change might not be feasible at the moment.</p>
<p>🚀 I'm eager to contribute to this. Could you advise on how I might be able to assist?</p>
