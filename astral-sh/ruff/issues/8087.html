            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Apologies if I just missed this in the documentation.  I would like to propose combining the formatting and import formatting capabilities into a single CLI command.  The motivation for this request is so that I may use the ruff formatter with the helix editor.</p>
<p>From what I understand I currently must run <code>ruff --select I --fix &lt;file&gt;</code> then <code>ruff format --line-length 120 --quiet</code> to format both the file and the imports.  If these were combined into a single command, I could easily hook this into the helix editor.  In an ideal world there would also be a way to specify <code>quote-style = &quot;single&quot;</code> via the command to match personal preference.  Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We plan to enable a unified workflow to run the linter and formatter in a single command, but we're still working out the design. @MichaReiser, do you know if there's an existing issue we could merge this into?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was about to report this as a bug.  To me the &quot;isort&quot; action should be done when I use the format command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We've explicitly chosen not to include import sorting in formatting because it can change the semantics of your code at runtime which the formatter should <em>never</em> do.</p>
<p>Regardless, per #8232 we intend to introduce a unified command that should suffice for this use-case. We'll track this there for book-keeping.</p>
