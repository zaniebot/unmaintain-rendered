<p>tryceratops changed the error code of TRY302 to TRY203.</p>
<p>https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/commit/8826ded502e230aee4c0cfe92c709feb9f431a19</p>
<p>If it's too much bother to change in ruff, can we add some documentation that mentions the new error code in tryceratops in case anyone migrating to ruff misses it?</p>
