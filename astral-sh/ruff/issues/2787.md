# Support glob patterns in `pep8-naming`’s `ignore-names` option.

The original `pep8-naming` supports glob patterns in the `ignore-names` [option](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/#options). Currently, Ruff supports only fixed strings.

Just wanted to point out this would be required to effectively support custom unittest-style `assert*` methods.

Without this feature, the only alternatives are either disabling N802 entirely or manually add every single custom assertion method name as `ignore-names`.
