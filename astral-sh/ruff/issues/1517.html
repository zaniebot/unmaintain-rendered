            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have checked that same problem also occurs in <code>flake8-return</code> so it is not a bug in logic translation, but definitely there is a problem with this rule. I also see #1035 with similar problems related to this plugin/set of rules.</p>
<p>The following code is reported as breaking RET504.</p>
<pre><code>    def get_changes(self):
        ret = self.changes
        self.changes = []
        return ret
</code></pre>
<p>On one side, it fits in the description, on the other side, I do not see any better way to write such code.
Similarly to #1035 I do not use <code>flake8-return</code> earlier but would like to try these rules when seeing the description in the ruff readme.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. We could cause assignments to invalidate the rule. I think we already do that for function calls.</p>
