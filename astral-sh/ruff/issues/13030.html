            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, I'd like to propose a new rule for pytest, wherein the order of parameterized tests must be consistent within runs. By that I mean that the following should trigger the rule</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize(&quot;x&quot;, {1,2})  # &lt;-- error
def test_foo(x: int):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this is plugins like https://github.com/mark-adams/pytest-test-groups (and its various forks) that require that tests be ordered.</p>
<p>A possible way to implement this is to check that the parameter values is either a list or tuple literal, or is wrapped by a <code>sorted</code> call</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import pytest

# say we want to test against all non-square numbers up to 100

NUMBERS = set(range(100))
SQUARES = { i**2 for i in range(10) }

@pytest.mark.parametrize(&quot;x&quot;, NUMBERS - SQUARES)  # &lt;-- will trigger the check
def test_foo(x: int):
    ...

@pytest.mark.parametrize(&quot;x&quot;, sorted(NUMBERS - SQUARES))  # &lt;-- OK
def test_bar(x: int):
    ...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can see how such a rule is desired for users of <code>pytest-test-groups</code> but I'm worried that it would also flag unsorted <code>pytest.mark.parametrize</code> usages for everyone not using <code>pytest-test-groups</code> and they would have to disable the rule manually.</p>
<p>We also try to avoid adding framework-specific rules unless the framework is widely adopted in the community (a community standard).</p>

<p>I'd argue that consistently ordered tests (though not necessarily consistently-executed) tests are an accepted best-practice standard of pytest. If users want tests in random order, that should be made explicit with specific plugins like pytest-randomly.</p>
<p>As for the false-positive, I can't think of a way around that except for creating a new category for this rule. If that seems like overkill, then I assume this issue can be closed.</p>

<p>I didn't know that. I'd argue that xdist is widely enough used to warrant a rule like this</p>
