            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey friends,</p>
<p>It seems like with the arrival of the formatter (neat!) the linter-specific configs are going to be nested under <code>tool.ruff.lint</code> rather than directly under <code>tool.ruff</code>? I think that the docs are currently somewhat inconsistent with that change, though.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>select</code> is under <code>tool.ruff.lint</code> in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#using-pyprojecttoml">&quot;Configuring Ruff&quot;</a> doc, but</li>
<li><code>select</code> seems like a top-level settings in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#select">&quot;Settings&quot;</a> doc</li>
</ul>
<p>Also in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#using-pyprojecttoml">&quot;Configuring Ruff&quot;</a> doc is a mention of <code>tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores</code> and <code>tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes</code> but when I go to the Settings section to look for those, it seems like they are still under <code>tool.ruff</code> directly: <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#per-file-ignores"><code>per-file-ignores</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#flake8-quotes"><code>flake8-quotes</code></a></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>From snooping around in PRs (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7549) it seems like maybe that section is experimental and we're still deciding whether/how to show it?</p>
<p>I don't really know about the current status of that thinking.</p>
<p>I do think that current state of docs having a mix of <code>tool.ruff.lint</code> and <code>tool.ruff</code> is a bit confusing. Maybe can get some explicit language explaining the state of <code>tool.ruff.lint</code> versus <code>tool.ruff</code>? They still get merged together for v0.1.3?</p>
<p>(Anyhow, thanks! Ruff is neat!)</p>

<p>No, it's now preferable! the top-level lint names will be deprecated in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7651</p>

<p>Yes, always do <code>tool.ruff.lint.option-name</code>.
Currently, top-level names used in most of projects (because <code>.lint</code> is new), But in coming release we wouldn't have any top-level lint names in docs and later they will be deprecated.</p>

<p>Kind of yes. Using <code>ruff.lint</code> is the new preferred way, but we haven't promoted it more, because we're looking for feedback and want to have the possibility to make breaking changes to it, without it falling under our versioning policy (just yet).</p>
<p>I think the downside of this approach is what you pointed out, that we now a mixture in our documentation that leads to confusion and also doesn't make it clear that <code>ruff.lint</code> is experimental (and may change).</p>

<p>Ah, great -- sounds like it's already headed towards a more consistent state, thanks all!</p>

<p>☝️ That is true, I did see some inconsistencies linger for a bit after this issue got closed.</p>
<p>All of the cases I originally noted have been resolved <strong>at this point</strong> though. I can't find any others.</p>
<p>(I suspect we are good as of 0.2.0 because <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.2.0">that's when the deprecation of the old names shows up in release notes</a>?)</p>
