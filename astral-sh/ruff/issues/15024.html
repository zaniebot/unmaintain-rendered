            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When viewing list of potential formats to make with <code>ruff format --diff</code>, would be nice to list the associated rule (e.g. <code>E117</code>) that's behind the proposed format. Not sure if one can config ruff to ignore particular rules, but would be useful to know for pedagogical reasons as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to make sure I understand: The ruff <em>linter</em> and <em>formatter</em> are distinct- the former has rules (like the <code>pycodestyle</code> one you referenced) but the latter does not. Are you using the linter with selected rules to format and want to see changes from those rules?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The formatter doesn't work in the same way as the linter where the linter provides a set of rules that are checked and possibly fixed while the formatter has a set of rules built into the implementation that are applied. There are certain rules that overlap as you've noticed but the logic for such &quot;rules&quot; in both the linter and the formatter is different. Please refer to the linked issues for more details.</p>
