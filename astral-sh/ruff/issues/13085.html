            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think this should happen, and if it does that suggests a bug. But a quick attempt to add the assert caused a panic, so apparently we are already relying on this. We should figure out why/where, fix it, and add the assert.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like it's only one corpus example that panics with the new debug assertion (commenting it out makes the test pass):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">async def foo():
    l = {k: v async for k, v in gen()}
    return [i for i in l]
</code></pre>
<p>A more minimal example that causes a panic is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{i: j for i, j in gen}
</code></pre>
<p>In each case the repeated definition is the <code>Comprehension</code>.</p>
<p>All of the following cause the test to fail for the same reason:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{i: j for i, j in gen}
{i for i, j in gen}
{0: 0 for i,j in gen}
{0 for i,j in gen}
[i for i,j in gen]
[j for i,j in gen]
[0 for i,j in gen]
</code></pre>
<p>These cases pass:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{x[0]: x[1] for x in gen}
{0: 0 for x in gen}
</code></pre>
<p>So it seems like issue is the tuple of elements... and indeed, if you remove the <code>debug_assert_eq</code> and inspect how many definitions get added for</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[_ for a,b,c,d,e in gen]
</code></pre>
<p>you'll find it's 5.</p>
<p>But that's as far as I got and I should probably go to sleep 💤</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's good data; looks like the problem is we don't handle unpacking in comprehension iteration vars.</p>
