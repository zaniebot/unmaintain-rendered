            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Before I begin, here is some context:</p>
<p>I would love to incorporate ruff as a pre-commit formatter for one of our projects. We developed the habit of almost always separating comprehension target-expression, for-in statement(s), and optional if-expression(s) into separate lines, except for very short and trivial comprehensions. Naturally, this makes identifying these separate comprehension parts very easy at a glance, at the cost of a few more lines. Also, we have increased our line length somewhat.</p>
<p>In its current form, ruff will always collapse comprehensions to a single line if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is short enough to fit within the line length</li>
<li>there are no &quot;magic trailing commas&quot; in any of the comprehension parts</li>
</ul>
<p>We do use trailing commas ourselves, so many of our hand-formatted comprehensions that contain trailing commas in any form remain more or less unchanged after running ruff format. The ones that do not, usually get collapsed to a single line mess (also due to our increased line length).</p>
<p>One toy-example for this would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[
    i + n
    for i in range(5)
    for n in range(5)
    if i &lt; 3
]
</code></pre>
<p>which would be collapsed to a single line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[i + n for i in range(5) for n in range(5) if i &lt; 3]
</code></pre>
<p>which is not as easy to recognize at a glance as the original example.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to have an opt-in feature to always preserve line breaks in comprehensions and generators? The behavior would be the same as if there were a trailing comma anywhere in the comprehension, and each comprehension-part is given a separate line, maybe even expand the whole comprehension into separate lines if there is at least one line break in it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Respecting line breaks would set a new precedence for ruff/black. There are other formatters that rely on line breaks. For example, prettier doesn't collapse an object expression if it has a line break after the last property's value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let a = { 
	a: 1,
  	b: 2
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas the following will be collapsed because it doesn't have a line break after <code>b</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
let a = { 
	a: 1,
  	b: 2 }
</code></pre>
<p>I could see a similar rule where the comprehension wouldn't collapse if there's a line break before the closing <code>]</code>, but I'm very hesitant of adding it because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes formatting changes non-reversible. A comprehension never collapses after the formatter expanded it once</li>
<li>It's non obvious why the formatter doesn't collapse some comprehensions but does collapse others</li>
<li>It will lead to less consistent code because users can now overrule the formatter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Black's/Ruff's magic trailing comma suffers the same problem.</p>
<p>I'm more open if we could identify a formatting rule that makes comprehensions more readable in general without requiring manual intervention. Are there specific patterns in the body that should never collapse? E.g. if there's any nesting?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser  Thank you for your feedback. Your arguments sparked a discussion within our team, what the actual requirements of such a feature would be, and that the initial idea of relying on line breaks is not sufficient or feasible.</p>
<p>Initially, we though that the decision, whether to collapse or expand a given comprehension is mostly subjective. After checking a number of actual examples from our code base, we noticed a pattern that may describe what we are looking for. We usually collapse comprehensions that do not stray too far from the &quot;visual span&quot;, as in, you can see and perceive the whole comprehension without having to scan your eyes along horizontally too much, if that makes sense to you.</p>
<p>Another toy example that may show what I mean. Here are two comprehensions that would produce the same AST:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">[x for x in range(3) if x == 0]

[descriptive_name for descriptive_name in range(3) if descriptive_name == 0]
</code></pre>
<p>We would prefer the top one collapsed, since it is short enough. The bottom one we would expand, as it is more effort to scan/read along the line to know what is going on, even though it has the same complexity as the top one.</p>
<p>Using this knowledge, our suggestion would be to introduce a maximum comprehension (or generator) expression length (opt-in of course, to preserve Black compatibility). Unlike the line length parameter, it only describes the length of a collapsed comprehension expression itself, regardless of indentation or nesting. I do not know any implementation details, but I imagine it working like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a comprehension can be collapsed using existing rules, the collapsed single-line form is measured against the max comprehension expression length</li>
<li>If we are below the expression length, the collapsed form can be kept</li>
<li>Otherwise, it has to be expanded</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding nesting, I imagine this also working for deeply nested and highly indented cases. If a nested comprehension expression is short enough, it may be collapsed within a larger, expanded one. The overall line-length still wins over this, if indentation or nesting is too high.</p>
<p>Does this make sense at all? Also is this technically feasible to implement, or are we dreaming too much here?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is something I've suggested on the formatter alpha/beta feedback as well, and probably my only reticence in using Black or Ruff as a formatter (still on autopep8 + add-trailing-comma ). And bad unwrapping is the main reason (amongst others) I don't use prettier.
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/7310#discussioncomment-7027958</p>
<p>The tl;dr of my post above: there's magic commas for most of my needs where I want to force a vertical style, but nothing as such for comprehensions and conditional expressions. (unless you count using <code># fmt: skip</code> on most of them). Although i could be happy enough with a single <code>#</code> ?</p>

<hr />
<p>I feel like @Martin19037 's description fits pretty well. Having a conditional/ternary/comprehension-specific length (total line length? count just the comprehension itself?) could be weird at first, but it fits all the requirements established by @MichaReiser (consistent, reversible, no manual intervention).</p>
<p>Although there's also the question of whether the <code>in</code> operator in comprehensions should be unwrapped as well.</p>

<p>I would be happy with @Martin19037's suggestion for the comprehension specific line length.</p>
<p>If we need more of a sledgehammer solution for some reason, even a bool setting that expands all comprehensions into the multiline format would work. I find it very rare that one would be trivial enough not to expand. It is so much easier to understand what's happening in the expanded format, even if the lines end up short. I see these comprehensions as the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>I was considering adding ruff to one of my projects, but seeing that it would collapse all comprehensions turned me away.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ha, I was about to suggest something similar to the lines of &quot;Provide an option to not collapse comprehensions into one line&quot;</p>
<p>Not sure how AST looks like, but in my mind, comprehensions have 3 &quot;parts&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expression -- the thing that will be added into list / returned by generator</li>
<li>Iteration -- the <code>for</code> part, contains at least 1 rule</li>
<li>Optional Guard -- the <code>if</code> part, if exist, contains at least one rule</li>
</ul>
<p>So <em>in addition</em> to the overall line length (after collapsing), it could also have additional rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are more than N1 Iterations, do not collapse</li>
<li>If there are more than N2 Guards, do not collapse</li>
<li>If there are a total of more than N3 'parts' (expression + iterations + guards), do not collapse</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd still love to have a per-project knob to just &quot;do not collapse any comprehension&quot;, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>+1 for an opt-in option to disable formatting for comprehensions.</p>
<p>It is extremely frustrating when the formatter decides to squash a perfectly good, readable comprehension into a single line.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>What follows is some examples of my frustration with the formatter, and notes for anyone who wants to keep using Ruff but keep their readable comprehensions.</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">keys = [
    key 
    for key in key_generator 
    if key.startswith('a') 
    and key.endswith('9')
]
</code></pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">keys = [
    key for key in key_generator if key.startswith('a') and key.endswith('9')
]
</code></pre>
<p>What's worse, forcing the formatter to behave requires some really ugly comments</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># You cannot hide the # fmt: comments on the open/close lines of the collection
keys = [  # fmt: on, or # fmt: skip, do not work here
    key for key in key_generator if key.startswith('a') and key.endswith('9')
]  # fmt: off, does not work here.

# this doesn't work
keys = [ # fmt: skip
    ...
]

# but these do.  
# fmt: on/off must be on its own line.
# fmt: skip needs to be inside the comprehension... and you may need more than one.

# fmt: off
keys = [
    ...
]
# fmt: on

keys = [
    keys  # fmt: skip
    for key in key_generator
    if key.startswith('a')  # fmt: skip
    and key.endswith('9')
]
</code></pre>
<p>The least-ugly, but still undesirable solution I found, was just adding empty comments, which gets the job done for now, with minimal crufty comments.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># This works, and requires less visual clutter... It is more readable to me, but... &quot;why are there empty comments?&quot;
keys = [
    key  #
    for key in key_generator
    if key.startswith('a')  #
    and key.endswith('9')  #
]
</code></pre>
<p>This solution does not let you use extra indentation, which is perfectly valid, and can improve readability significantly in more complex comprehensions.</p>
<p>This final example demonstrates using additional indentation to improve legibility of a very complex comprehension:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># For this to remain formatted, it must be wrapped in # fmt: off/on comments
# fmt: off
matrix = [
    (key + '-07', value / 10)
    for key in key_generator
        if key.startswith('a')
        and key.endswith('9')
    for value in value_list
        if value &gt;= 1
]
# fmt: on

<p>Why did you settle on the approach of percentages of line width?  Have you considered something closer to what the most advaned text formatters (like TeX) do, which is to set a &quot;badness&quot; for various break positions?  This is much closer to what you're actually trying to optimize since a human reader feels different line break positions differently.  Human readers don't try to make certain constructs take a certain fraction of the page width.</p>
<p>Thus, instead of weird line width percentages, you might have:</p>
<ul>
<li>break within an expression: 10</li>
<li>break in a ternary condition before <code>if</code>: 3</li>
<li>break after a comma in a function call: 2</li>
<li>expression with 10 terms on one line: 1 (rather than setting a width percentage to try to chop them—this doesn't get affected by variable name lengths)</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the badness approach is amenable to dynamic programming, which makes it very efficient.</p>

<p>Implementing the badness approach would require extending the formatter infrastructure in much larger degrees. It does have some limited support for priorities but overusing it leads to exponential runtime</p>
<p>Edit: Ruff does already prioritize break points. The part that's missing is <em>expression with 10 terms on one line: 1 (rather than setting a width percentage to try to chop them—this doesn't get affected by variable name lengths)</em> where I feel like the line length seems a reasonable enough approximation of what we want. E.g. would <code>a.b</code> count as one, two or even three terms? Either way can lead to undesired breakage. But we can try to come up with some heuristics and always force a line break if we can. I'm just not convinced that this will give us much better results than line width (and introduces more complexity and is slower)</p>

<p>Fair enough, but I hope simple to implement isn't going to entrench a limited solution.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but I think you're mistaken.  TeX and other formatters use this approach for every token.  This is a classic dynamic programming problem that is solved by  the <em>Knuth-Plass Algorithm</em>.  It has <em>quadratic</em> time and space cost.  It will never be exponential runtime for any input.  And, because of the nature of Python code, whenever you close a function, you've essentially back at the base case.  Therefore, its worst case is quadratic in the number of tokens in a function totalled over all functions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. E.g. would a.b count as one, two or even three terms?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the idea is to try to imagine it from a human perspective.  I would say that's at least 2 tokens, just from the feel of it.  It doesn't really matter what you choose though since you can adjust the corresponding badness to get the effect you want.</p>
<p>A good way to set the badnesses would be to use a hyperparameter optimizer, run over well-established codebases, and use as a loss function the size of the diff.  This should efficiently tune all of the badnesses for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But we can try to come up with some heuristics and always</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the problem.  With each heuristic, you knock out a few issues, but create dozens more issues of special cases that people will want fixed.  There's a reason that TeX didn't go this route with typesetting: it produces very poor results except in the exact cases that you imagined when you came up with your heuristics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm just not convinced that this will give us much better results than line width (and introduces more complexity and is slower)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think it's slower.  Besides the quadratic runtime, the analysis is quite simple whereas you'll need to check of your heuristics against each piece of code, which is linear in both the number of heuristics and the complexity of the heuristic.</p>
<p>As for complexity, your heuristics can individually be more complex than the things you assign badness to.  Either way, I think both solutions are fairly easy to implement.</p>
<p>Is it just the dynamic programming that's daunting?</p>

Not sure why percentage instead of configuring an arbitrary number (other than it was the example you used, maybe to enable by default w/o conflicting with absolute line length?). But I don't really care either way, both works for me.</p>

<p>I do not believe there is any PEP8-justifiable reason to prefer the single-line version to the multi-line version.</p>
<ol>
<li>Readability First: PEP 8 explicitly states &quot;Readability counts&quot; and &quot;code is read much more often than it is written.&quot; Our preserve option supports this by allowing developers to maintain readable multi-line formatting for complex comprehensions.</li>
<li>Line Length Compliance: Both modes respect the 79-character limit:<ul>
<li>auto mode: Collapses only when it fits within line length</li>
<li>preserve mode: Maintains multi-line format, ensuring compliance with line length</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No Explicit Rules Against Multi-line Comprehensions: PEP 8 does not mandate that comprehensions must be on a single line. It only provides general guidance about line breaking and readability.</li>
<li>Consistency Principle: PEP 8 emphasizes consistency within a project. Our option allows teams to choose and maintain a consistent style for their comprehensions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If determinism is really so critical, I am open to adding a <code>force</code> mode that would force comprehensions to be broken onto multiple lines. I still don't really see the case for preventing it from happening when the developer decides it's a good idea.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that simply allowing the preservation of line breaks when the developer makes the decision to break the lines along the comprehension keywords (which is what I did in the PR) is very similar in philosophy to the magic-trailing-commas configuration option.</p>
<p>I am now curious -- I might run a systematic analysis over public python repositories to better understand what people typically do in real codebases.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> About 1/4 of all comprehensions across 943 github repos were multi-line. I think this demonstrates substantial community adoption of the pattern and warrants being supported by the ruff formatter, to the developer's discretion. A few common patterns jump out, but the general rule that I recommend implementing is to simply preserve line-breaks when they are included immediately before a comprehension keyword.</p>
<p>I think that it is simple, clear, and allows for consistent formatting while allowing the developer the <em>choice</em> to make their code more readable -- it requires no complex analysis of the code to find the optimal line-breaks.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzed 419k examples of comprehensions across 943 github repos tagged as language: python.</li>
<li>Of these, 27% of all comprehensions were multi-line.</li>
<li>Set comprehensions had the lowest percentage (19%), while Dict comprehensions had the highest (36%)</li>
<li>The average character length of single-line vs multi-line comprehensions (with whitespace collapsed into a single character) was about 50chars vs 115chars.</li>
<li>Within the multi-line comprehension set, 50th percentile for character length was 95 characters.</li>
<li>75th percentile for line length (normalizing tabs to 2 spaces), was 70 characters</li>
<li>Of multi-line comprehensions, 83% included the brackets on their own lines (my preference)</li>
<li>An astonishing 12% include both the opening and closing brackets on lines with other expressions (this surprised me)</li>
<li>There were about 100k non-nested multi-line comprehensions to analyze for structure</li>
<li>Across all comprehension types, the most common pattern was 2 lines, such as:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[
  item.get()
  for item in collection
]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Interestingly, 17% had single-line bodies, such as:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>[
  item.get() for item in collection
]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Most of the patterns seem to keep the <code>for</code> and <code>in</code> keywords on the same line,</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good point -- I am not excluding those in this analysis. I added a heuristic to check for possible formatting with black/ruff. It definitely does significantly skew the output. Overall, 33.5% of of all comprehensions are multi-line excluding those, whereas in the original dataset it was only 27%.</p>

<p>I think this demonstrates substantial community adoption of the pattern and warrants being supported by the ruff formatter, to the developer's discretion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't agree with the conclusion that it requires that ruff preserves comprehensions exactly as written. I do agree that we need a way that splits comprehensions in fewer places. I still want to try the approach with a more limited width for comprehensions first to see if it achieves a similar outcome without having to introduce a new option and require manual formatting</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would really appreciate the ability to disable formatting comprehensions entirely in pyproject.toml, or a nicer way to exclude a single comprehension.<br />
I have a few projects where I would like to use Ruff but don't because it mangles a few specific comps.</p>
<p>Wrapping a special case 2 new lines for <code># fmt: off</code> and <code># fmt: on</code> just feels clunky and looks ugly.</p>
<p>Even fixing it so that this style of comment works for the entire expression would a good improvement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">matrix = [  # fmt: skip
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>My personal preference and recommendation, is that every comp with more than a single clauses be split up with each clause on its own line.
If the output expression includes any computation, it should also get its own line.</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">Y = [x**2 for x in X]
Y = [
    x**2
    for x in X
    if x &gt;= 0
]
Y = [
    x for x in X
    if x &gt;=0
]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>An option to include line-breaks after each expression and clause would work for most cases.</strong></p>
<p>Still, I think there will always be some blocks which simply don't fit neatly into a rigid formatting rule, and require more careful though to keep them expressive and readable.</p>
<p>These examples defy simple conventions</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">matrix = [
    (key + '-07', value / 10)
    for key in key_generator
        if key.startswith('a')
        and key.endswith('9')
    for value in value_list
        if value &gt;= 1
]

# conditional expressions within the output expression
result = [
    x**4 if x &gt; 4 
    else
    x**2 if x &gt; 2 
    else x
    for x in range(10)
]

# computing intermediate values, and re-using expensive computations
result = [
    (x, doubled, squared)
    for x in values
    if (doubled := x*2) &lt; 1
    if (squared := x**2) &gt; .01
]

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having used the Elm formatter for many years, it seems crazy that the formatter would ever join lines that use programmer thought were more readable as multiple lines. In the Elm formatter there are two &quot;modes&quot; for an expression: horizontal and vertical. If there are any newlines in the source code of the expression, then the vertical mode is chosen.</p>
<p>This simple rule would mean the magic trailing comma rule would be obsolete (and it's not really generally useable as some expressions don't allow a trailing comma), covers this ticket, #12870, #18436, #9393, #14277, #12312, and probably many more that I didn't find. There are a lot of issues with titles like &quot;disable ruff on...&quot; which I assume some of them are actually due to this.</p>
