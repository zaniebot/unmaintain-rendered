Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>First of all, I'd like to thank you for a great and easy-to-use linter 🥳</p>
<p>I've been running into issues lately where logging calls would fail, because I unpack some <code>dict</code> in the <code>extra</code> parameter to logging methods (or directly put a variable there), and that dict has a <code>name</code> key, for example.</p>
<p>Ruff doesn't catch these issues, and I thought a good rule (or extension to one of the existing <code>flake8-logging-format</code> rules) could catch these issues and warn about them.
Knowing exactly when a bad argument will appear can be difficult, like in calls to <code>pydantic</code> classes' <code>dict</code> method, but I think warning on all places that pass an object directly to the <code>extra</code> parameter or unpack a <code>dict</code> inside it is still a good idea.</p>
<p>What do you think? I would also be willing to work on a PR for this, though my rust skills aren't as sharp as I'd like them to be for this 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you :) Do you mind including an example snippet that demonstrates the problem? (Is it that the unpacked dictionary keys are also themselves valid arguments to <code>logging</code> calls?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, should have included examples in the original message. Yes, the problem is as you stated it.</p>
<p>The following is correctly flagged by ruff G101:</p>
<pre><code>import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.info(&quot;&quot;, extra={&quot;name&quot;: &quot;fails&quot;})
</code></pre>
<p>While the following aren't caught:</p>
<pre><code>logger.info(&quot;&quot;, extra={**{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;fails&quot;}})
extra = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;fails&quot;}
logger.info(&quot;&quot;, extra={**extra})
logger.info(&quot;&quot;, extra=extra)

from pydantic import BaseModel

class PydanticFail(BaseModel):
    name: str = &quot;fails&quot;

logger.info(&quot;&quot;, extra=PydanticFail().dict())
logger.info(&quot;&quot;, extra={**PydanticFail().dict()})
</code></pre>
