You can configure Ruff to allow those comments via `task-tags`! Check out #2064.

Kebab-case is not a valid python name so it should not count as valid code.
I do not remember the name of the helper that checks if a python name is valid or not.
It could be used to remove this false positive.
I could work on it if you want.

Sure thing!

(We have an `is_identifier` method in `src/python/identifiers.rs`.)

It is not possible to fix.
In the context of a `dict`. This is a valid code if `SPDX`, `License`, `Identifier`, `BSD`, and `Clause` are `int` variables.

Ah ok. Thanks for taking a look. At least we have a valid workaround.
