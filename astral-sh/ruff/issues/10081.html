            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is potentially beyond the perimeter of Ruff's core linting/formatting concerns, but I'm curious if there's any appetite to support a simple workflow/command for auditing/printing/outputting codetag comments (<code>TODO:</code>, <code>HACK:</code>, etc) from target paths. Either as it's own subcommand, or as an option for <code>ruff check</code>.</p>
<p>Codetags are obviously extremely common/idiomatic, but as far as I can tell tooling around codetags is minimal (it seems like <a href="https://github.com/ruby/rake">rake</a> might support such a workflow with <code>rake notes</code>).</p>
<p>Minimal tooling may indicate minimal utility/interest. However, I am increasingly aware of CI build steps in the wild that use roll-your-own scripts to audit/report on codetages in similar ways. And I've been surprised at how useful it can be to just see, per file, all codetagged comments in one place.</p>
