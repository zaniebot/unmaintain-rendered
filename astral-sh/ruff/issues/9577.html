            <div class="timeline-body"><p>First of all; thx for providing this neat framework! In our team, we write alot of polars code and we like to chain such that each new polars method &quot;has it's own line&quot; so to speak. We can't seem to find any configurations that allow for this. This is quite a big deal in data science in general, that people like to chain pandas and polars in this way.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do on this end so it can be configured?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hy @mlarcane</p>
<p>No, there's currently no way to configure method chaining but I know that method chaining has come up before (I also find Ruff's/Black's formatting hard to read).</p>
<p>The main challenge with method chaining is that Black/Ruff try very hard to avoid (introducing) parentheses. But method chaining would require parentheses because of Python (a problem other languages don't have).</p>
<p>I don't expect us to work on this anytime soon but I'll leave it open and track it as a style discussion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There could be magic parentheses (analogous to magic commas) which, if present, would tell the formatter to apply the &quot;call chain style&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tmke8 That would be awesome! Really dig the magic commas (for consistency).</p>
