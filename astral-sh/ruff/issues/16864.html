            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>It would be great if ruff supported rules for linting code that uses SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>There is a flake8 plugin already available: https://github.com/miketheman/flake8-sqlalchemy This could be used as a starting point. There is also a ticket with some additional rules that would be useful: <a href="https://github.com/miketheman/flake8-sqlalchemy/issues/54">miketheman/flake8-sqlalchemy#54</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with all of the the rules the plugin currently provides, I think some of the suggested rules could be quite valuable and I also see great potential for additional rules that help with the transition from SQLAlchemy 1.4 -&gt; 2.0, similar to how there are rules for transitioning to numpy v2.</p>
<p>The <code>Warning</code> based upgrade help from 1.4 to 2.0 works well enough, but there is still a lot of churn that could easily be automated and even after your code is 2.0 &quot;ready&quot;, it&#x27;s still not really idiomatic 2.0 code, especially if you&#x27;re using type hints. Most of the upgrade steps and recommendations for 2.0 code could be turned into rules with fixes.</p>
<p>I would be interested in working on some pyupgrade style rules for SQLAlchemy, since there&#x27;s still at least one large code base I have to make the transition for.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, especially because certain idioms are considered legacy by SQLAlchemy 2.0 (e.g. the query interface but also other less important patterns) but do not raise warnings. Linter rules would be a good fit to detect and handle those, IMO.</p>
