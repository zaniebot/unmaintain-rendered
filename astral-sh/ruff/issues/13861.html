Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>It's totally valid but <code>()</code> is a bit of a strange syntax to actually spawn an empty tuple, especially when it's used within another call. e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python3">action = core.ClassName(core.ActCon.STUB, tuple())  # noqa: C408
action = core.ClassName(core.ActCon.STUB, ())

my_list.append(tuple(1, 2, 3))  # perfectly valid C408 warning
my_list.append((1, 2, 3))
my_list.append(tuple())  # noqa: C408
my_list.append(())
</code></pre>
<p>I suggest adding a setting to allow empty tuples, but possibly just allowing it generally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @LordAro</p>
<p>I'm struggling to understand how your question relates to <code>C409</code> because the rule doesn't trigger for me with the given code example  (see <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/199728fc-7494-435e-8f0d-a8bf894b90db">this playground</a>). However, your example raises <code>C408</code> and the rule recommends using literal syntax over function calls.</p>
<p>Raising <code>C408</code> for <code>tuple</code> is exactly the intent of the rule. That's why I don't think they should be excluded regardless of their position (see the rule documentation for the motivation). You can disable <code>C408</code> when you prefer the method form.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I screwed up the numbers when constructing this example didn't I? I've updated the original issue</p>
<p>C408 pertains to all collection types - I'm saying that empty tuples specifically could be a special case because the syntax ( <code>()</code> ) is used for so much else</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Although tbh maybe it's more relevant for 1-length tuples, as <code>(foo)</code> isn't a tuple but <code>(foo, )</code> is</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for updating the issue. Glad to hear that we're talking about the same :)</p>
<p>I agree, <code>()</code> is very unambiguous. I can see how <code>(foo,)</code> is harder to spot. But the rule isn't just about readability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's unnecessary to call, e.g., dict() as opposed to using an empty literal ({}). The former is slower because the name dict must be looked up in the global scope in case it has been rebound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's why I still think we should keep flagging all tuples, including zero and one element tuples because it applies to them as well.</p>
