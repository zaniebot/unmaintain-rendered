<p>It&#x27;s missing two commas!  However, if you&#x27;re generally OK with multi-line implicit concatenation (which I am), there&#x27;s currently no way to get a warning for this case.  I therefore propose adding a new rule, <code>ISC004</code>, which will warn if implicitly-concatenated strings are separated by a comment - which can be fixed by either adding an explicit <code>+</code> or moving the comment.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/flake8-implicit-str-concat/flake8-implicit-str-concat/issues/55">flake8-implicit-str-concat/flake8-implicit-str-concat#55</a>.  I would not add an autofix for this lint rule, as the intended semantics are ambiguous.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This has come up again in #20854. I wonder if there&#x27;s an argument for an ISC rule or option that catches any implicit string concatenation within a set list, or a many-element tuple, instead of detecting in-between comments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I assume this aligns with OPs intention, but pulling out an example from #20854 I would want this to be alerted on as well as OPs example:</p>
<pre><code>facts = (
    &quot;Lobsters have blue blood.&quot;,
    &quot;The liver is the only human organ that can fully regenerate itself.&quot;,
    &quot;Clarinets are made almost entirely out of wood from the mpingo tree.&quot;
    &quot;In 1971, astronaut Alan Shepard played golf on the moon.&quot;,

<p>But not this:</p>
<pre><code>facts = (
    &quot;Lobsters have blue blood.\n&quot;
    &quot;The liver is the only human organ that can fully regenerate itself.\n&quot;
    &quot;Clarinets are made almost entirely out of wood from the mpingo tree.\n&quot;
    &quot;In 1971, astronaut Alan Shepard played golf on the moon.\n&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<p>As parenthesis are often used for multi-line string concatenation, whereas multi-line containers typically used to hold multiple elements and if multi-line concatenation is desired in a multi-line container I think it would be worth explicitly putting it in parenthesis to highlight.</p>
<p>But I do appreciate there is some subjective choices here, and I would rather have OPs example alerted on than nothing at all.</p>
