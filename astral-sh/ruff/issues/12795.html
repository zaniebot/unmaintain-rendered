Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Is there anyway to disable <code>ruff </code> linting completely and leave it only for formattiong? I'm using a NeoVim configuration with Mason. What I have is a double display for linting in <code>basedpyright</code> and <code>ruff</code>:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Basically,  <code>basedpyright</code> and <code>ruff</code> installed via <code>Mason</code>, and it configures using AstroNmiv nested structure. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the same configuration for <code>ruff</code>, because it implies that user would be using it as a main linter, instead of  <code>basedpyright</code>. Here is an example: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp/issues/384#issuecomment-1941556771
<code>ruff</code> works from the package, and I can't manage to configure it inside my nvim-config.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with AstroNvim but are you saying that Ruff is configured to be the default linter in that framework and you're interested in using Ruff only as a formatter? I couldn't find any references to &quot;ruff&quot; in the repository (https://github.com/search?q=repo:AstroNvim/AstroNvim%20ruff&amp;type=code). It's a bit difficult to help without knowing the way you've configured Ruff in your editor 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's the point, it isn't configured at all, but still works. I will ask in a forum of AstroNvim for this and provide the answer once it's gotten here.</p>

<p>Here how you, presumably, can configure the same code in AstroNvim:</p>
<p><code>.../plugins/ruff_config.lua</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">return {
  &quot;AstroNvim/astrolsp&quot;,
  opts = {
    config = {
      ruff_lsp = {
        settings = {
          ruff = {
            lint = {
              enable = false,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you confirm (via docs?) the name of the Ruff server as defined in the plugin? Is it <code>ruff_lsp</code> or <code>ruff</code> (native server)? Either way, it should be <code>init_options</code> instead of <code>settings</code> if these are the server settings.</p>
