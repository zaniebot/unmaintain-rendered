# Can omit parentheses layout for patterns

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-08-28 07:37_

Ruff avoids adding parentheses to expressions that start or end with a parenthesized node (see `can_omit_parentheses`). 

This is implemented by using `optional_parentheses` in conjunction with the `in_parentheses_only_*` builders. We need something similar for patterns to support 

```python
match test:
    case A | B | ["Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"]: ...

# Formatted
match test:
    case (
        A
        | B
        | ["Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"]
    ):
        ...

# Instead of
match test:
    case A | B | [
        "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
        "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
    ]:
        ...

```

This seems to be fixed: https://play.ruff.rs/e7f95918-d71e-479f-8fae-29cdaa476463

Closing the issue but feel free to re-open it if you think otherwise.

This isn't fixed yet. Notice how the expression gets wrapped in parentheses.

We need to avoid adding the parentheses in this case. I'm not sure why the function isn't using `maybe_parenthesize(IfBreaks)` directly

We want to make this change (it improves consistency), but it's not blocking for the Beta.

The challenge here is that we need to re-implement `can_omit_parentheses` for patterns, since that logic only applies to expressions.

I'm going to remove this from the stable release since it hasn't come up often.
