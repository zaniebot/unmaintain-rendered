            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think that <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/eq-without-hash/#eq-without-hash-plw1641">eq-without-hash (PLW1641)</a> should apply to stubs (it currently does).
Stubs authors should aim to faithfully represent the runtime implementation. And if the runtime doesn't implement <code>__hash__</code>, the stubs shouldn't define it either.</p>
<p>Third-party stub authors have no control on this. First-party stubs would get <code>FURB189</code> in their source <code>.py</code> files.</p>
<p>Ruff: 0.8.5 (rule is currently in preview)</p>
