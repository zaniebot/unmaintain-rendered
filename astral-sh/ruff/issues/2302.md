# Implement `TYP001` from `flake8-typing-imports`

This rule detects whether you've imported something from `typing` that's incompatible with your supported Python version.

See: #2096.

+1. We do need a `ruff` rule as mentioned in #6650 that detects and guards `TYPE_CHECKING` only import :) Which also hopefully could improve runtime performance by not importing unnecessary packages.

Thanks a lot for your work!
