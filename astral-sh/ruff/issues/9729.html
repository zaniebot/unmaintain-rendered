            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We're sorry you're encountering this issue and the unwelcome error message.</p>
<p>We've been trying to identify the root cause of it in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8147 but have since been unable to reproduce it. It would be extremely helpful to us if you could share your cache state, commit version, and link to your project if it is an open source project so that we can reproduce locally and fix the issue.</p>
<p>I'll close this issue to track the work in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8147</p>
