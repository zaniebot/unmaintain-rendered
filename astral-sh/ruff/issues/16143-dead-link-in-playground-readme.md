Seems like the website for rome tools is not accessible tool. I can either remove it completely or I can replace it with a link to [this](https://github.com/williamtetlow/rome-tools/blob/main/website/playground/README.md) README from the github repository.

Note: Not sure if the same project, but if so I can make a fast PR

The project was renamed to Biome, so the link should now point to https://biomejs.dev/playground/
