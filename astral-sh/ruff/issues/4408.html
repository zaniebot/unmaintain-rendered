            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe this is a follow-on request from: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/3952</p>
<p>Where that discussion landed was that it is reasonable to suppress <code>ARG002</code> for overridden methods, since you cannot control the method signature. I think it follows that <code>ANN401</code> should be suppressed as well, since if we cannot control the method signature we also cannot control the types, and it is impossible to narrow or remove <code>Any</code> in such cases.</p>
