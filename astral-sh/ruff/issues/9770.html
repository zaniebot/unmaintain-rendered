<p>Wanted to start a discussion about the deprecation of <code>ANN001</code>, and <code>ANN002</code>. I have personally found these rules very helpful in gradually rolling out type-checking. The reasons why you would use them over a type-checker for enforcing these rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ruff can give much quicker feedback than any type-checker that currently exists for Python. Having this instantaneous feedback that you&#x27;re missing annotations can then help resolve issues quicker than simplify running your type-checker.</li>
<li>If you&#x27;re using Pyright for enforcing type-safety. To my understanding, here&#x27;s no effective way to use Pyright with Pycharm, meaning engineers using Pycharm don&#x27;t have a great way to get quick feedback there right as they&#x27;re writing code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I think these rules are really helpful to help transition a codebase towards type-safety, or working with libraries that benefit from type hints. For example, in FastAPI, where query parameter types are enforced at runtime through argument annotations: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/query-params/. You might want part of your codebase under strict type-checking, and another part just with these rules (in addition to other ANN) rules, as you move towards enabling your type-checker there.</p>
<p>It also strikes me as odd, that these two rules would get removed, but the rest of the rule-set wouldn&#x27;t also get gradually deprecated? I say this, because I feel if Ruff is going to keep rules like ANN 201-206, which help with enforcing return-types, why not also remove those? I get usage is likely more prevalent, and they offer return-type generation, but nonetheless.</p>
<p>There are also other rules remaining like ANN101 and ANN102, which in my opinion would be better candidates for deprecation. As with the <code>Self</code> return type, I&#x27;d argue there are very few instances where you want to manually annotate <code>self</code> or <code>cls</code>. I suppose in older versions these could be helpful, but still, 001 and 002 seem a lot more helpful than these.</p>
<p>Mostly curious if there might be the possibility of some reconsideration here, as I personally find these rules helpful. Or maybe others feel differently.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey sorry -- I think that&#x27;s just a typo in the blog post. We deprecated <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-type-self/"><code>ANN101</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-type-cls/"><code>ANN102</code></a>, the rules for annotating <code>self</code> and <code>cls</code> (which you mentioned at the end).</p>
<p><code>ANN001</code> and <code>ANN002</code> are <em>not</em> deprecated. I&#x27;ll correct this in the blog post. If you saw references to these rules elsewhere, please let me know.</p>

<p>Great to know! That makes a lot of sense! Didn&#x27;t see this anywhere else, but I&#x27;ll leave a comment if I do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry if I am misunderstanding the blog post. But when reading this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They will not warn if selected by prefix (e.g., ANN).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am reading that this should not warn without preview. However when I have this in my <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = &quot;py310&quot;

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [&quot;ANN&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>and running <code>ruff check</code> on this simple file:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    @classmethod
    def b(cls) -&gt; None:
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>I get this:</p>
<pre><code>src/test_ruff/test.py:3:11: ANN102 Missing type annotation for `cls` in classmethod
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>--preview</code> flag I get no errors. Is this the expected behavior?</p>
<p>I am running on version 0.2.0 btw</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@joellidin -- Ah, by &quot;warn&quot;, we mean, show a warning in the console indicating that the rule is deprecated. This is <em>different</em> than the rule raising or not raising violations. For example, try using <code>select = [&quot;ANN102&quot;]</code> instead of <code>select = [&quot;ANN&quot;]</code>. In that case, you&#x27;ll see:</p>
<pre><code>warning: Rule `ANN102` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
bar.py:3:11: ANN102 Missing type annotation for `cls` in classmethod
Found 1 error.
