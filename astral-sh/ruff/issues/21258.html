            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As discussed over at https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/auto-walrus/pull/85#issuecomment-3479776713, would there be interest to include <code>auto-walrus</code>'s functionality, that is</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">-    n = 10
-    if n &gt; 3:
+    if (n := 10) &gt; 3:
         print(n)
</code></pre>
<p>etc. into Ruff?</p>
<p>(Ruff might already have some control flow analysis features that could make it simple to implement the cases that would currently be <code>--unsafe</code> for <code>auto-walrus</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's some previous discussion along these lines in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3464. I think it's not clear yet if we want to have a rule adding walrus expressions, removing them, or both, especially since either option can be divisive.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I saw #3464, but that's strictly about disallowing walruses. I think there are other rules in Ruff already that are logically mutually exclusive anyway :)</p>
