            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As requested <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18297#issuecomment-2909545016">here</a>, I've moved this to a separate issue. Apparently, adding a strikethrough was decided against early in the design of the docs, so I completely understand if there are good reasons not to do this.</p>
<p>Here's what it would look like:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the. main concern here is that it just feels &quot;too much&quot;. There's the opacity, strikethrough, and the <code>x</code> icon at the end and it's not clear to me how using strikethrough would improve readability</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a fair point. I think the main benefit in my opinion is that each way of communicating it is read in a very different way. For example, I personally don't find the opacity filter to be especially helpful, and so the strikethrough communicates it better for me. This is especially the case because deprecated and removed filters have a similar opacity effect which is hard to distinguish imo.</p>
<p>If you think it's too much, even with this rationale, that's completely ok. Feel free to close this issue :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I prefer keeping it as is.</p>

<p>This is sort of intentional because new users shouldn't use those rules anymore.</p>
