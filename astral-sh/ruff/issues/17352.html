            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm wondering if there is some appetite for Ruff natively adding support for lint rules that ordinarily would be too aggressive for human developers, but are good fits for LLM-assisted coding. Here is a small smattering of the ones I would personally use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ban try...except... where the exception is suppressed</li>
<li>Ban top-level access to sys.path</li>
<li>Ban mocks</li>
<li>Ban module imports that are not top level</li>
</ul>
<p>The general heuristic is to ban things that are &quot;overly defensive&quot;, because the LLM is apt to introduce them even when it's unnecessary, and may potentially cover up real problems by doing so.</p>
<p>Some of these I can write externally to Ruff but I am somewhat interested in Ruff being a one stop shop for all the lints I want, so I'm checking the temperature here.</p>

<p>I thought we had one for <code>sys.path</code>, but it's only proposed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15806.</p>
<p>I didn't see anything too promising for mocks.</p>
<p>I think this is an interesting idea in general, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good call on existing rules. Something I need to do is go through all the non-default rules in Ruff and figure out a good &quot;LLM&quot; set lol</p>

<p>Not a banning but I proposed a set of rules related to mocks in #12850</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see it less likely that we'll add lints that are exclusively for LLMs and aren't useful to &quot;humans&quot; but none of the above fall into that category (They can be useful for some projects regardless of how they're written)</p>
