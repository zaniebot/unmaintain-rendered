            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you have both a <code>required-version</code> and a new rule enabled in your ruff config, but try to run with an older version of ruff, you get something like:</p>
<pre><code>ruff failed
  Cause: Failed to parse /.../pyproject.toml
  Cause: TOML parse error at line 23, column 5
   |
23 |     &quot;RUF102&quot;,
   |     ^^^^^^^^
Unknown rule selector: `RUF102`
</code></pre>
<p>It would be better if you got e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>ruff failed
  Cause: Required version `&gt;=0.12.8` does not match the running version `0.9.10`

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>I don't think this will be too hard to fix and may even fix a few other issues along the way (e.g warning about unknown ignored rules rather than just failing). We need to use a weaker type for rule references during deserialization and validate the rules only when resolving the settings, similar to our approach in ty.</p>
<p>Fixing this for all new settings is a bit more cumbersome but would probably also be possible by adding an <code>extra_keys</code> hash map to every deserialized struct. But that might be a bit cumbersome and fixing this only for rules probably covers the most common use case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Relevant to the recent Ruff 0.13 update. Writing the following in my shared config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">required-version = &quot;&gt;=0.13.0&quot;

[lint]
future-annotations = true
</code></pre>
<p>Results in this error on older Ruff versions:</p>
<pre><code>ruff failed
  Cause: Failed to load configuration `...\ruff.toml`
  Cause: Failed to parse ...\ruff.toml
  Cause: TOML parse error at line 17, column 1

17 | future-annotations = true
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
unknown field `future-annotations`, expected one of &lt;...&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>instead of telling me to install Ruff 0.13</p>
<p>Of course this can't be fixed retroactively, so the sooner it gets in, probably the better.</p>
