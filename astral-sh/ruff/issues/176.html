            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Noticed it while looking through some of the ruff&#x27;s code and I realized that this means that when I put scripts in a folder such as <code>.github/workflows/scripts</code>, ruff won&#x27;t lint it unless I explicitly pass the <code>.github</code> folder to it (I verified this by checking the output of ruff with <code>-v</code> flag on a project where I have Python files in <code>.github</code> folder).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m unsure what&#x27;s a good solution here though, clearly there can be hidden folders which a user would want linter to include (as the mentioned <code>.github</code> folder) <em>but</em> there are many hidden folders (and some not hidden) that you would want to be excluded by default.
flake8 keeps a small default exclusion list but personally I think it&#x27;s way too small as it doesn&#x27;t even include such a common exclusion as <code>.venv</code> folder (and what&#x27;s worse, flake8 also doesn&#x27;t allow users to add user-specific exclusions anymore either).</p>
<p>#174 might make it less painful if the default exclusion of all hidden folders were removed but I&#x27;m not sure it solves the problem entirely as I imagine you could want to test non-Git projects with ruff and still get reasonable results. I think that adding some default exclusion list could be beneficial here but I don&#x27;t think it should really be as small as flake8&#x27;s - I think Black&#x27;s default exclusion list is a lot better in that regard.</p>
