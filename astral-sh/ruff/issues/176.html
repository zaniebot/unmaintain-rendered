            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Noticed it while looking through some of the ruff's code and I realized that this means that when I put scripts in a folder such as <code>.github/workflows/scripts</code>, ruff won't lint it unless I explicitly pass the <code>.github</code> folder to it (I verified this by checking the output of ruff with <code>-v</code> flag on a project where I have Python files in <code>.github</code> folder).</p>
<p>I'm unsure what's a good solution here though, clearly there can be hidden folders which a user would want linter to include (as the mentioned <code>.github</code> folder) <em>but</em> there are many hidden folders (and some not hidden) that you would want to be excluded by default.
flake8 keeps a small default exclusion list but personally I think it's way too small as it doesn't even include such a common exclusion as <code>.venv</code> folder (and what's worse, flake8 also doesn't allow users to add user-specific exclusions anymore either).</p>
<p>#174 might make it less painful if the default exclusion of all hidden folders were removed but I'm not sure it solves the problem entirely as I imagine you could want to test non-Git projects with ruff and still get reasonable results. I think that adding some default exclusion list could be beneficial here but I don't think it should really be as small as flake8's - I think Black's default exclusion list is a lot better in that regard.</p>
