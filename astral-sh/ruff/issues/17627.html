            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Currently a case like the following wouldn't be caught. I see this reasonably often with duplicate enum members</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 1
bad_and_not_yet_caught = {x, x}
</code></pre>
<p>I guess it might not be safe to apply to any variable - eg. there are two set elements in this example. This seems like an edge case though</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from random import random
class C:
    @property
    def rand(self):
        return random()

c = C()
tricky_but_not_bad = {c.rand, c.rand}
</code></pre>
<p>FWIW neither of the above cases trigger an error with flake8-bugbear</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would probably be easy to extend the rule to simple variables (<code>Expr::Name</code>s), but that wouldn't cover the enum case. It would be a little trickier to handle a sequence of attribute accesses, but we could mark the fix unsafe in those cases to guard against dynamic properties like in your example.</p>
<p>It sounds pretty reasonable to me, but I guess we need to decide if we want to diverge from the upstream rule.</p>
