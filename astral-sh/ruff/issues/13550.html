            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the issue! Hmm, <code>DIR</code> here isn't actually a constant, though, right? Since it's a local variable, you'll be creating a new <code>DIR</code> variable each time you call the function. I think you could make both Ruff and mypy happy here by moving it out of the function into the global scope (and your code would probably run slightly faster too!).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for being unclear above. The code passes mypy (<a href="https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=c0e2064b8f69e27af164db0e41864b79">gist</a>). ruff is not aligned to the convention that mypy already enforces on both globals and locals. In fact, mypy errors out if a <code>Final</code> local is re-assigned (<a href="https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&amp;python=3.12&amp;gist=2e6774b39fc9611d7e26df7667615eb9">gist</a>), because it is certainly a bug.</p>
<p>In case of a &quot;heavy&quot; object's initialization, I can see how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize">premature optimization</a> of moving the implementation detail out of the function can help, at the expense of readability. But this is a general case, which I stumble in for simple types, and <code>Final</code> and the all-caps are intended to be sort of a &quot;noqa&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sure. But if it's a local variable, then by definition it's not a constant, since you're creating it fresh every time the function is called. It's just a <code>Final</code> local variable -- so I think Ruff's complaint is correct here :-)</p>
<p>Only global constants that are created once should be uppercase, not local variables that are created every time the function is called. <code>Final</code> indicates that a variable is not mutated after being initialised -- this can be thought of as &quot;necessary but not sufficient&quot; for a variable to satisfy the definition of a global constant.</p>
<p>The naming convention here derives from <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#constants">the relevant section in PEP 8</a>, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. Examples include <code>MAX_OVERFLOW</code> and <code>TOTAL</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, I think either of these would satisfy both mypy and Ruff:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import pathlib
from typing import Final


DIR: Final = pathlib.Path(&quot;/...&quot;)


def require_files() -&gt; None:
    if not (DIR / &quot;file_1&quot;).exists():
        print(&quot;Missing file 1&quot;)

    if not (DIR / &quot;file_2&quot;).exists():
        print(&quot;Missing file 2&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>or this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import pathlib
from typing import Final


def require_files() -&gt; None:
	dir: Final = pathlib.Path(&quot;/...&quot;)

    if not (dir / &quot;file_1&quot;).exists():
        print(&quot;Missing file 1&quot;)

    if not (dir / &quot;file_2&quot;).exists():
        print(&quot;Missing file 2&quot;)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, on a second thought, if distinguishing vars from constants is necessary for readability, it likely means the function is doing too many things. Thank you very much for your answers.</p>
