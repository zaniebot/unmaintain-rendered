            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There was a bug in Python 3.9.0 and 3.9.1 which resulted in <code>pyupgrade</code> only making this rewrite on 3.10+.</p>
<p>The issue was resolved in Python 3.9.2 and we're now on Python 3.9.16. It seems a shame to not support this.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/issues/677 for context.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We probably need to support minor version-based minimums in order to do this, right? Like, we can't enable this for all Python 3.9.X versions, can we?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think those suggestions are technically incorrect for Python 3.9.0 and Python 3.9.1 though. If you make those changes, your imports will fail on those specific minor versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A solution for users with Python &gt;=3.9.2,&lt;3.10 could be manually configuring the TID251 rule with:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.flake8-tidy-imports]
[tool.ruff.flake8-tidy-imports.banned-api]
&quot;typing.Callable&quot;.msg = &quot;Use collections.abc.Callable instead.&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a neat workaround. I'm using 3.9+ everywhere so it's viable.</p>
<p>I would hope that people aren't using .0 or .1 by now, but reality is never the ideal. I guess you can close this @charliermarsh if you're not wanting to special case this to check the patch version.</p>
