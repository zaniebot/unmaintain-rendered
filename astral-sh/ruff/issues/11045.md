Can you share more on why `FURB118` doesn't apply here?

Let's say we have this class:
```python
class Foo:
    ...
    @staticmethod
    def get_postal_code(area_code: str) -> str:
        return area_code[:5]
```
If I understand the rule correctly, the suggested change would be this I suppose?
```diff
-Foo.get_postal_code("AAAAABB")
+operator.itemgetter(slice(5))("AAAAABB")
```
**So this is not really a false positive but more than removing the `staticmethod` altogether makes us lose a lot of context.**
Usually when people define `staticmethod` like that it's because the behavior is somehow linked to the class.
I feel like this rule should maybe not trigger on static method ?

I'm not so sure, feel free to close.

(Also I feel like `operator.itemgetter(slice(...))` is not really readable, I'dl rather define a lambda for these cases)

Anyway, thanks for the tool and the quick response!

PS: This is a bit related to #10898
