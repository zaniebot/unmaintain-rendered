# `D417` only triggering when I have no `convention`

---

_Issue opened by @tylerlaprade on 2025-03-11 15:04_

### Summary

[`D417`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-param/) is supposed to be enabled when `convention = google`, but I can only get it to trigger when I remove my `convention` entirely.

### Version

`ruff 0.9.10 (0dfa810e9 2025-03-07)`

This is due to the google convention using *Arguments* as the section name and not *Parameters*. It works as expected when renaming *Parameters* to *Arguments* https://play.ruff.rs/f8364e1f-5ccb-4e66-938d-cfbcc74e9079

Aha, I see! Perhaps the extra behavior of each convention could be added to the documentation?

Also, is there a way to make the rule work on both Arguments and Parameters simultaneously?

I only briefly skimmed over the code but I don't think there is (without changing the implementation)
