            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that's an expected behavior as per the implementation. It's detected only when a docstring is followed by the pass statement. Do you think the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-pass/">documentation</a> was unclear regarding this?</p>

<p>Yes. Perhaps it's just me, but I think the documentation suggests that it catches all unnecessary <code>pass</code> statements, with a <code>pass</code> statement immediately following a docstring as <em>one example</em> of an unnecessary <code>pass</code> statement. If this really is intended, then I think the documentation (and the name of the rule) should be altered.</p>
<p>However, might there be merit to changing the implementation to catch <em>all</em> unnecessary <code>pass</code> statements? It would be more befitting of the current rule name and probably more useful to users.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm thinking in the same direction. I think the rule should be updated to catch all such cases.</p>
<p>It should be fairly simple to implement this as the function body is just a <code>Vec&lt;Stmt&gt;</code>, so we could just check the length of it. If the number of statements is greater than 1 and the last statement is a <code>Pass</code> statement then we can just remove it.</p>
