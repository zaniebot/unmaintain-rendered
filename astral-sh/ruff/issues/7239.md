# Tooling: Ruff-shades

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-09-08 08:15_

Our existing tooling focuses on comparing Ruff's and Black's formatting. This has been extremely valuable when developing Ruff but we need additional tooling to avoid shipping unintentional changes or evaluate whether a change improves readability for the whole ecosystem and not a selected set of test cases. 

Add a new ecosystem check that detects formatting changes to downstream dependencies using Ruff's formatter similar to [black's diff-shades](https://github.com/ichard26/diff-shades#readme).
