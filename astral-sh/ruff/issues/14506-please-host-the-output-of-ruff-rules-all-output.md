# Please host the output of `ruff rules -all --output-format json` on the docs website somewhere

_Issue opened by @onerandomusername on 2024-11-21 04:50_

I've created an integration for ruff, but I don't want to regen the rules every time ruff is updated, so I'm wondering if its possible for the the json file to be published online.

We already sorta talked about this and I'm kinda just making an issue so it doesn't get buried.

This would power one of the integrations within the official Discord that can view all of the rules for ruff.

Currently, I'm using a locally generated and vendored file, but that'll get out of sync pretty quick.

Here's an invite to the discord, if anyone wants to join but hasn't yet. https://discord.gg/astral-sh
