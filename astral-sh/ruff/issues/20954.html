            <div class="timeline-body">Question
<p>This idea isn&#x27;t new, I know I asked about it just about as soon as workspaces was announced, <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16712#issuecomment-2722345752">this comment from Micha</a> mentions thinking about monorepo support, and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/16712#issuecomment-3322734137">this comment</a> suggests specifically this.</p>
The problem
<p>If you&#x27;re a very wise individual who is going &quot;all in&quot; on the Astral ecosystem, you&#x27;re likely using both <code>ruff</code> and <code>uv</code>. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a monorepo-stan so <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/"><code>uv</code>&#x27;s workspace</a> call to you. You have your project set up like (somewhat arbitrarily complex for demonstration)</p>
<pre><code>[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    # Most projects belong here
    &quot;src/python/*&quot;,

    # Legacy/Infra projects
    &quot;_infra/globbinator&quot;,
    &quot;_infra/turbo-cat-wrangler&quot;,

    # Somehow Bob managed to put his project
    # in the repo root, and we&#x27;re too scared to tell him to
    # move it...
    &quot;bob&quot;
]

# Not a &quot;real&quot; package, ignore it
exclude = [&quot;src/python/sandbox&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>and you&#x27;re using <code>ruff</code> to sort imports (wisdom indeed), so unfortunately for you the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruff-determine-which-of-my-imports-are-first-party-third-party-etc">default heuristic</a> doesn&#x27;t apply here.</p>
<p>The current workarounds have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>mirror the workspace member globs in <code>[tool.ruff].src</code> (if they are compatible, globs can be tricky like that)</li>
<li>splat-o all over <code>[tool.ruff.lint.isort].known_first_party</code> (not great, since it is verbose, brittle, and it isn&#x27;t clear it plays with the rest of <code>ruff</code> features)</li>
</ol>
The solution
<p>Have <code>ruff</code> seed <code>[tool.ruff].src</code> with <code>[tool.uv.workspace].members</code> (if it exists).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ruff</code> is already parsing <code>pyproject.toml</code></li>
<li>It&#x27;s just some simple globs</li>
<li>It would make me rejoice</li>
</ul>
<p>Like all good software features, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some nasty complexities hanging out under the hood, but optimistically this <em>does</em> seem kinda like an easy no-brainer 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A better integration story between our tools is very much on our minds and I outlined (internally) a few ideas on how it could be done. Unfortunately, I was kept busy with working on other parts of ty that prevented me to make much progress on it. I hope that I can come back to it soon, once we&#x27;re further along with ty.</p>
<p>In short: We probably don&#x27;t want to parse any uv metadata from pyproject.tomls because any change to the schema (or how uv discovers projects) would then have to be coordinated across all our tools. Instead, a more likely outcome is to have a <code>uv metadata --version &lt;X&gt;</code> command that allows other tools (not just Astral tools but any python tool) to query metadata about a workspace and use that to enrich its configuration.</p>
<p>The benefit of this is that uv can change its project discovery or settings, for as long as it doesn&#x27;t break the output of the metadata command. The metadata command can also expose more information that would be hard for ruff to compute on its own, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The python version</li>
<li>installed dependencies</li>
<li>package layouts (and which package depend on each other)</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>ty doesn&#x27;t support uv workspaces yet. But it&#x27;s on our mind.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, I also think this would be a great feature for uv/Ruff (and other tools I guess, though I&#x27;m all in on Astral hahaha).. Can this issue be kept open until the metadata feature is implemented in uv <em>and</em> Ruff correctly consumes the metadata?</p>
<p>The issue is now closed as completed but none of this is currently implemented is it?</p>
