            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have an internal representation (<code>Type::Any</code>) for the dynamic type <code>Any</code>, but we don't yet understand  the <code>typing.Any</code> symbol as a spelling for that type in a type expression.</p>
<p>To add this, we'll need to track <code>typing.Any</code> as a <code>KnownInstance</code> (similar to the existing support for <code>typing.Union</code>, <code>typing.Optional</code>, <code>typing.Literal</code>), and add support for it in <code>Type::in_type_expression</code>, so that when <code>TypeInferenceBuilder::infer_type_expression</code> comes across the symbol in an annotation, we understand that annotation as describing the <code>Any</code> type.</p>
<p>We'll want to add mdtests for the &quot;happy path&quot; case like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">x: Any = 1
x = &quot;foo&quot;

def f():
    reveal_type(x)  # revealed: Any
</code></pre>
<p>We'll also want edge-case tests showing that <code>typing.Any</code> can be aliased to a different name, and still works (that is, we are recognizing <code>typing.Any</code> under any name, not just pattern-matching on the local name), and similarly that a locally-defined class named <code>Any</code> simply means its own instance type, not <code>Type::Any</code>, in an annotation.</p>
