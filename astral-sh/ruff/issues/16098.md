# What is the list of rules that setting Google convention is equivalent to?

_Issue opened by @galenseilis on 2025-02-11 14:29_

### Description

The documentation says we can set to [Google's style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) conventions. For example:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
# Enable D400 on top of the Google convention.
extend-select = ["D400"]

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "google"
```

I didn't see a list of the rules that setting `convention = "google"` is equivalent to. Is that list available somewhere?

You can find the list of enabled rules in [this FAQ section](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#does-ruff-support-numpy-or-google-style-docstrings).

I think this has come up before. It could make sense to move the documentation to the option or at least linking to it
