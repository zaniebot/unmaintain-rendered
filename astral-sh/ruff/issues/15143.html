            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>There are many discussions (<em>e.g.</em> #13698) about metaclasses and <code>N804</code>, some of which may require further inquieries. But I'm fairly certain we can already agree on the fact that <strong>enforcing <code>cls</code> for the first argument name of a metaclass' <code>@classmethod</code> if wrong</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class A(type):
    def a(self): ...  # Should FAIL: OK

    def b(cls): ...  # Should PASS: OK

    @classmethod
    def c(cls): ...  # Should FAIL: NOT OK

    @classmethod
    def d(mcs): ...  # Should PASS: NOT OK
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>tmp.py:2:11: N804 First argument of a class method should be named `cls`
  |
1 | class A(type):
2 |     def a(self): ...
  |           ^^^^ N804
3 | 
4 |     def b(cls): ...
  |
  = help: Rename `self` to `cls`

tmp.py:10:11: N804 First argument of a class method should be named `cls`

10 |     def d(mcs): ...

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this issue. I'd prefer if we keep the discussion in as few places as possible and there's already https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6017 (which also explains some of the reasons why it is the way it is today, not saying we shouldn't change).</p>
