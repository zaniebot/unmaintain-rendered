            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There's support for creating a <code>Generator</code> from a <code>Stylist</code> instance:</p>

<p>And while <code>indentation</code> and <code>line_ending</code> are being respected, <code>quote</code> is ignored:/</p>

<p>I see, would it make sense to keep the signature of <code>Generator::new</code> the same, and add a method that can change the quote style. something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">impl Generator {
 pub const fn new(indent: &amp;'a Indentation, line_ending: LineEnding) -&gt; Self {
        Self {
            // Style preferences.
            indent,
            line_ending,
            quote: Quote::default(), // Added this
            // Internal state.
            buffer: String::new(),
            indent_depth: 0,
            num_newlines: 0,
            initial: true,
        }
    }

  pub fn with_quote(mut self, quote: Quote) -&gt; Self {
    self.quote = quote;
    self
  }

}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it so it's backwards compatible, while giving the user the ability to configure the quote style if so desired.</p>

<p>Me neither, the purpose of this question is to see if this is something that the ruff team are willing to merge once there's a PR for it</p>

<p>I'm not oposed to it, but it depends on the level of complexity it introduces and requires that someone finds the time to review</p>

<p>Fair enough. ty for the swift response:)
Will poke the code a bit and see what's the effort</p>
