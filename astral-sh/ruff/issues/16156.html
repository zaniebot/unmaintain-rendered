<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>we&#x27;re using the fantastic ruff tool to keep our Python projects in shape. Thanks for all the hard work that went into it. \</p>
<p>ruff version in use: <code>0.9.6</code></p>
<p>As we&#x27;re communicating with Google Ads APIs, we run into the problem that <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/query/overview">GAQL</a> queries are detected as SQL queries and therefore raise <code>S608</code> violations.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>query = f&quot;&quot;&quot;
    SELECT
    customer.status
    FROM customer
    WHERE customer.id = {customer_id}
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>What would be the best way to handle this without turning off S608 for this specific piece of code?</p>
<p>Further information about GAQL and escaping: <a href="https://github.com/googleads/google-ads-python/issues/732">googleads/google-ads-python#732</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t know GAQL, so here are some stupid questions.</p>
<p>What happens if the query is changed so that it contains a syntax error? What if it is changed to use more resources than necessary? What if it is changed so that extra data is returned?</p>
<p>The comment in the linked issue just says &quot;[GAQL is] not susceptible to the same types of injection attacks as SQL&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that is the same as &quot;GAQL is completely fool-proof&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use <code>per-file-ignores</code> to disable <code>S608</code> on a selected set of files if you know those fails don&#x27;t contain any &quot;real&quot; SQL statements.</p>
<p>The only other remedy is to use inline <code>noqa: S608</code> suppression comments.</p>
<p>However, I do agree with @InSyncWithFoo that there&#x27;s still the risk that some can alter the query. E.G. you get all customer status if <code>customer_id</code> is <code>1 OR true</code></p>

<p>I guess Google doesn&#x27;t care as it&#x27;s limited on their side by the scope of the API token. When managing multiple customers, it&#x27;s the responsibility of the managing account to make sure no data is leaked. <br>
So yes, some kind of protection is needed.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re currently doing.</p>
<p>Alright. Thanks!
Just wanted to make sure that we&#x27;re not missing anything.</p>
