            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just so I understand, this was marked closed &quot;not planned&quot; because it's been merged with #8655 , not because we aren't going to have <code>ruff</code> + <code>reviewdog</code> support, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ryaminal - That's correct, &quot;Not planned&quot; is confusing because it includes &quot;issue is a duplicate&quot; (if you hover over the description).</p>
