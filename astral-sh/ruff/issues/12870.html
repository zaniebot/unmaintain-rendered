Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>
Line length, comprehension</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<em>Before <code>ruff --fix</code></em></p>
<pre><code>really_really_really_long_dict_name = {&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}

dict_with_really_long_names = {really_really_really_long_key_name: really_really_really_long_key_value for really_really_really_long_key_name, really_really_really_long_key_value in really_really_really_long_dict_name.items()}
</code></pre>
<p><em>After <code>ruff --fix</code></em> (Both the &quot;before ruff fix&quot; and &quot;manual attempt below&quot; lead to this)</p>
<pre><code>dict_with_really_long_names = {
    really_really_really_long_key_name: really_really_really_long_key_value
    for really_really_really_long_key_name, really_really_really_long_key_value in really_really_really_long_dict_name.items()
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Expected (or Proposed) after <code>ruff --fix</code></em> (running ruff on this also leads back to the after case)</p>
<pre><code>dict_with_really_long_names = {
    really_really_really_long_key_name: really_really_really_long_key_value
    for really_really_really_long_key_name, really_really_really_long_key_value 
    in really_really_really_long_dict_name.items()
}
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>for/in</code> line is 127 characters long, but it could come under the line length (default of 88, not set here) by splitting the <code>for/in</code> statements, which does not affect behavior in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Version/Command</strong>
Using ruff v0.5.1 with pre-commit calling <code>ruff --fix</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison with <code>black</code></strong>
Currently, this runs with the same behavior as <code>black</code>.
Another user brought up a similar suggestion here: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3498</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Thanks for asking! I'm running the following block in <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.5.1
    hooks:

      - id: ruff-format
</code></pre>
<p>If I try to coerce it first by splitting the for and in statements, it squishes it back into one line.</p>
<p>I also just tried doing a bare <code>ruff format FPATH</code> and it exhibited the same behavior (springing back into a one-liner).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks.  Yeah, it is then the formatter that doesn't split the comprehension further.</p>
<p>The main question here is what should happen when the comprehension does break over multiple lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> lcomp3 = [
         # This one is actually too long to fit in a single line.
         element.split(&quot;\n&quot;, 1)[0]
         yup
-        for element in collection.select_elements()
+        for element
+        in collection.select_elements()
         # right
         if element is not None
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>Because this does look worse. The desired result is probably that the <code>for ... in</code> should be kept together if possible</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree. If the <code>for ... in</code> can be kept to one line, it absolutely should. I'm purely thinking of cases where doing so would improve the soft adherence to the line length setting.</p>

<p>Interesting, thanks for doing that prototyping! Yeah, I assume most folks aren't using unnecessarily long variable or iterable variable names like I am (likely shoddy choices on my part), but the cases your implementation covers do seem to cover subset where the code has parentheses in the <code>for (...) in ...</code> and the parentheses get split out, perhaps unnecessarily.</p>
<p>For the prefect one, I think ideally, it could be the following, where trying to keep the <code>in</code> with the <code>for</code> led to the parentheses splitting out line-wise. (So the change was effective, but perhaps it could also compress the earlier lines.)</p>
<pre><code>            for (block_schema, _, parent_block_schema_id) 
            in block_schemas_with_references
</code></pre>
<p>That might start needing some extra logic though (as you pointed out), and I lack the intuition in this codebase to know if that's even stylistically/philosophically reasonable.</p>
<p>Additionally, in that fairly small diff, I didn't see any example of my original issue (where the <code>for ... in</code> is straight-up long without any parentheses and left all as one line), but I think you were testing out this other case so it makes sense.</p>
<p>Edit: By the way, I just saw your #12856 and corresponding Issues in black, and I'm glad the person who's already been thinking about parentheses/braces and looooooooooong variable name formatting is thinking about this!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the reason why the parentheses get split out is because the tuple contains a trailing comma. But I think the style could do better by trying to keep the closing <code>)</code> and the <code>in</code> keyword on the same line.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/19231 was a duplicate for this:</p>
<p>I am generally allowing a lower line length: 120 chars because the code base has function calls with many parameters.
On the other side I format certain list-comprehension code blocks for readability into multiple lines.</p>
<p>one example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">-    return [
-        idx * 8 + bit
-        for idx, value in enumerate(octets)
-        for bit in range(8)
-        if value &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; bit)
-    ]
+    return [idx * 8 + bit for idx, value in enumerate(octets) for bit in range(8) if value &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; bit)]
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice if the formatter would allow a setting, that already multiline-splitted list/set/dict comprehensions are not joined into one single line again.
Maybe a line-length for comprehensions may differ from a general line length for function calls / the rest.</p>
<p>Basically that is the number one blocking issue for using the formatter at all.</p>
