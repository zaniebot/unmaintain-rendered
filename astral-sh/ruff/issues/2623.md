# PIE804 raised when providing keywords as kwargs

---

_Issue opened by @153957 on 2023-02-07 11:53_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
The following code raises PIE804:
```
def abc(**kwargs):
    xyz(kwargs.get('for', 1))

abc(**{'for': 3})
```

But since `for` is a Python keyword it is not allowed to provide it directly as a keyword:
```
abs(for=3)
```

There are some 'clear' exceptions for PIE804, should these be handled by ruff or should I manually ignore these cases?

`ruff 0.0.243`

Yeah I think we should verify that all keys are valid identifiers.
