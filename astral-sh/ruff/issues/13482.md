# `ruff analyze graph` omits implicit `__init__.py` imports

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-23 13:21_

If you import `foo/bar/baz.py`, barring unusual setups, you will also implicitly import `foo/bar/__init__.py`, `foo/__init__.py`, etc. Right now, these are omitted from the module graph. We may want to include them. (By default, Pants seems to include them if the `__init__.py` files contain content.)
