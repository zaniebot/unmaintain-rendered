            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some linter rules are advisory: they warn about a code pattern which is <em>usually</em> bad, but sometimes it&#x27;s better for the code (or at least the project) if you slap on a <code># noqa</code> and keep going.</p>
<p>And some <em>other</em> linter rules are there to warn you against introducing subtle, non-local correctness issues which can lead whole teams to lose their sleep debugging something that should never have happened.  (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8451"><code>ASYNC101</code></a> warning against <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0789/">PEP-789</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, the only way to ensure that nobody unknowingly suppresses a warning in the latter category is to maintain an entire second configuration, select the subset of rules you want, and then execute a whole independent process to check all your code again.  Credit to <code>ruff</code> that it&#x27;s fast enough to do that, but I still feel it&#x27;d be a lot more elegant to accept an <code>ignore-noqa-rules</code> config option and do it in one run!</p>
<p>If this does get implemented, I promise I&#x27;ll use this new power for good and not evil 😉</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is interesting. Do I understand it correctly that what you want is that devs can&#x27;t suppress certain rules?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if an <code>--ignore-noqa</code> flag is the ideal solution for that. I&#x27;m thinking of something along the lines of <code>fixable</code>/<code>unfixable</code> (I&#x27;m currently thinking about a new configuration structure where this would even be easier), where you could select the rules that can&#x27;t be suppressed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, <code>unsuppressable</code> would also be a decent name for it.</p>

<p>Is this feature somewhere in your roadmap?</p>
