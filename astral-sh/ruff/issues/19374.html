            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I came across non-ideal behavior of the search modal while looking for a Ruff lint rule that would flag Exceptions without any message text.</p>
<p>I noticed that the search preview snippets weren't as useful as they could be. All the snippets mention where the rule comes from. But I don't care about that. I want to know &quot;What it does&quot;. That information <em>is</em> available, it's just not shown above the fold by default.</p>
<p>Feature request: make &quot;What it does&quot; be the number one thing in preview snippets.</p>
<p>See the default snippets (without having clicked anything):</p>

<p>The actually relevant summary only shows when I click on &quot;2 more on this page&quot;:</p>
