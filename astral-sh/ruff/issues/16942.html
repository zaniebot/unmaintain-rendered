            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>N805 doesn't recognize <code>aenum</code>'s metaclass when it does the same for regular enum. Examples below:</p>
<p>enum: https://play.ruff.rs/716742ee-e98f-42ef-abce-783e1cb18ac7
aenum: https://play.ruff.rs/49da9f35-57a8-4b5d-91f1-fec4b7579d06</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ruff 0.9.10 (0dfa810e9 2025-03-07)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have some special casing for the stdlib <code>enum</code>, so this would be an extension to the rule.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names">ignore</a> these property names, but that might apply to other unrelated methods too.</p>

<p>Does that mean you guys plan on adding the same support for <code>aenum</code>? I think that'd be pretty great considering <code>aenum</code> is a massive package with <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/aenum">~25M monthly downloads</a>.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. No. We have some rules with special casing for third-party dependencies but we try to keep third-party special-casing to a minimum because it is hard to keep up with every third-party dependencies and it's impossible to draw a clear line which libraries should be supported.</p>
<p>My hope here would be that aenum support falls out from our work on adding a better type inference to ruff, so that it doesn't require special casing</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Enums are already a special case within the type system. <code>aenum</code> is similarly magical; adding support for it in Red Knot would probably be even harder to justify than doing so in Ruff (at least when there is no plugin system).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser @InSyncWithFoo @ntBre thank you all for the responses! For now I've disabled <code>N805</code> on this particular file that declares an <code>aenum</code> metaclass.</p>
