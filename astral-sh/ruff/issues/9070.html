            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently types can be added in two places in a function as a type hint and in the documentation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def myfunc(value: int):
   &quot;&quot;&quot;
   Args:
      value (int): any value you want
   &quot;&quot;&quot;
   pass
</code></pre>
<p>This can lead to potential conflict between the type hint and the docstring leading to multiple sources of truth. #5541 seeks to solve this by fixing the docstring, however this could still lead to the reverse issue; that the docstring is updated but not the type hint. It also avoid duplicating information. The reason to prioritise the type hint is meaningful as it can be checked by type hinters etc.</p>
<p>There might still be reasons to have types in the docstring such as documentation, but there already exist extension which remedy this need (e.g. https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autodoc-typehints/). I probably wouldn't set it as a default though.</p>
<p>Let me know if there is something I have missed. I very much enjoy the package.</p>
<p>Edit: In a similar vein, it might also be worth discouraging &quot;Defaults to {value}&quot; in the docstring as it similar can be outdated and is already specified function signature.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the same reasoning we also dropped type information from our docstrings. The redundancy is error prone and adds little information.</p>
<p>Another similar rule would be type docstrings for classes, where the type hint can be provided by <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/#class-and-instance-variable-annotations">instance variable annotations</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pycodehash/pycodehash/pull/60/files">example</a>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Great idea! At work, we switched to <code>sphinx-autodoc-typehints</code> but now we have lots of code that is inconsistent, with old docstrings containing the type and new code omitting it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In order to implement an autofix, a new rule is needed first, right? Something like <code>Parameter type already documented via type hint</code>? This would probably fit into the <code>D4XX</code> category.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think that is orthogonal to this issue and should be treated separately, once PEP 727 has been accepted. The rule could be something like <code>Parameter already documented in function signature</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems reasonable to me! Although we do not yet have a dedicated docstring parser and may want to wait until we write one.</p>
