            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My understanding of the rationale according to https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/raise-vanilla-args/ it's to prevent overloading exceptions to be used broadly, with the specifics of the exceptions being defined by the string passed to them.</p>
<p>In general, I agree with this, but for <code>NotImplementedError</code>, do we really want to encourage people subclassing it for every feature that they haven't built yet? I treat <code>NotImplementedError</code> as a slightly nicer <code>sys.exit(&quot;This is not supported yet&quot;)</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you attaching messages to your <code>NotImplementedErrors</code>? I find the to be self-explanatory and not need a mesage.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am, here is an example:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But, just confirming -- that example doesn't trigger TRY003, since you're assigning to a <code>msg</code> variable, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh that is correct, but that probably could be considered a bug / limitation of the rule, as the string being defined in a variable outside of the raise statement has nothing to do with &quot;long exception messages that are not defined in the exception class itself.&quot;</p>
