            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Overlong values in e.g. assignment position without sometimes be parenthesized, this seems to depend on whether parenthesizing actually help too not be overlong anymore. The first step of fixing this issue is figuring out the exact criteria for what is indented and what isn't.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This behavior isn't just specific to assignments but applies in general (I haven't understood the details yet).</p>
<p>I believe <a href="https://github.com/psf/black/blob/01b8d3d4095ebdb91d0d39012a517931625c63cb/src/black/linegen.py#L1572-L1578">this</a> is the relevant logic in black. Where it splits the line by adding optional parentheses, but only keeps them if all lines now fit.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/compare/main...random-tries-to-format-strings">branch</a> where I tried to get to the bottom of it but I haven't yet found out the right rules that apply (or messed up the Printer implementation)</p>
<p>This is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6059.</p>
