            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff's parser does not support the new syntax introduced by <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/">PEP 696</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def f[T=int](): pass
</code></pre>
<p>I noticed because I'm adding this syntax to CPython and Ruff started failing in CI :).</p>
<p>I saw that you recently switched to a handwritten parser. I'm interested in taking a look at that parser, so I'd like to try to implement this myself.</p>

<p>Yes, of course! Although the parser crate (<code>ruff_python_parser</code>) lacks a bit of public-facing documentation, specifically a README and an updated CONTRIBUTING guidelines, it shouldn't black you as I can assist with the implementation. That said, I'll be working on the documentation this week.</p>
<p>I'll need to go through the PEP to list the work items needed to complete this, but for reference, there's the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6502">PEP 701</a> issue and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5062">PEP 695</a> issue.</p>
<p>At a high level, this will impact all of the major areas: the AST, parser, linter, and formatter. If you're solely interested in updating the AST and parser, that's perfectly fine; either I or someone else from the team can handle implementing the changes in the linter and formatter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I'll take a look myself first and let you know if I run into any issues. I expect the PEP 695 issue will provide a good reference as mechanically the new syntax is very similar to the bound syntax in PEP 695.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>#11120 implements support in all the places I could find in the Ruff codebase. Rust's ADTs were very nice here; the compiler basically told me almost all the places I had to update. There's a test failure that I'll look into soon.</p>
<p>At runtime this sort of thing is an error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type X[T = int, U] = str
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;-0&quot;, line 1
SyntaxError: non-default type parameter 'U' follows default type parameter
</code></pre>
<p>Since Ruff doesn't detect a few similar cases in the existing syntax (#11118, #11119), I left these error checks out of the PEP 696 support too. It might make sense to add a new lint rule checking for these and similar issues, but that can wait for a different PR.</p>

<p>We do detect this specific case for function parameters. For reference:</p>
