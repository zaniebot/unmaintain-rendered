            <div class="timeline-body"><p>consider this minimal example
<code>#!/usr/bin/python3 target = None if target != None:     print   (&quot;target&#x27;s not none&quot;)</code>
if the file that contains the script has a .py extension it will display the following</p>

<p>and if i remove the .py extension ,no warnings will display nor file can be formatted even though vscode detects
that it&#x27;s a python file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s happening because a file without an extension is excluded as it&#x27;s <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#include">not in the inclusion set</a>. This is a side effect of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/0bb2fc6eec875b1fbf06dc25fd9ea9ded4c5cc2b. Maybe in the LSP context, we should look at the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentItem"><code>languageId</code> in the <code>TextDocument</code></a> in case it&#x27;s not excluded and not present in the inclusion set.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just wasted several hours trying to debug why the Ruff server wasn&#x27;t working for me in Zed, where I was editing extension-less Python scripts that Ruff apparently silently skips. There really needs to be a way for the server to consider these files to make it generally useful.</p>

<p>No need to apologize, sharing your experience is helpful and bugs are always considered high priority :)</p>
<p>The PR that fixes this also added debug level log for cases where this kind of exlusion happens.</p>
