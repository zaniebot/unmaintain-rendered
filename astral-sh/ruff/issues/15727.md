# Provide autofix for G004

---

_Issue opened by @ktbarrett on 2025-01-24 18:02_

### Description

I'm at the crossroads of manually updating 5000+ G004 errors or simply not enabling it. It would be nice if an autofix for this error could be provided.

The supermajority of the f-string in logging calls I see use basic formats like `f"{val}"` or `f"{val!r}`, so starting with that (assuming format spec conversion isn't already available) would be a godsend. I think it should be safe to move expressions from in an f-string out of it as f-strings only support a subset of expressions within brackets.

Thanks for the report! This looks closely related to #15555, so I might close this one for now.
