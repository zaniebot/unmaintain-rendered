Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>PIE810 currently does not have implement any autofixes, but the rule should be readily autofixable using similar logic to SIM101 (which effectively does the same thing with isinstance calls). It would be nice if someone could implement this autofix. This rule is a common minor performance pitfall so having autofixes would help turning this rule on for large codebases.</p>
