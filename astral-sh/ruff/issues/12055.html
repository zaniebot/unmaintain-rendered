            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've seen some crates making clever use of invariant lifetimes (e.g. via a PhantomData which is an <code>fn(&amp;'a ()) -&gt; &amp;'a ()</code>). I haven't worked out the details yet, but I think in principle this technique should be exactly what we need to have the borrow checker enforce that the the descendant node passed to <code>AstNodeRef::new</code> is actually from the tree of the root node given. If they have exactly the same lifetime (not just lifetimes where a meet can be found), that gives the guarantee we need.</p>
<p>So not high priority, but at some point we could try that out and see if it allows us to better encapsulate the <code>unsafe</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you still have the crates around? It would be helpful to better understand what you're describing here.</p>
<p>I think we discussed that the signature <code>fn new&lt;'a&gt;(root: &amp;'a ParsedModule, child: &amp;'a T) -&gt; Self</code> isn't enough because that only constraints that <code>root</code> and <code>child</code> have a common lifetime, but that would also permit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let a = parse_module(&quot;a.py&quot;);
let b = parse_module(&quot;b.py&quot;);

AstNodeRef::new(&amp;a, a.syntax()); // Works as expected
AstNodeRef::new(&amp;a, b.syntax()); // should not work but works too
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>new</code> with <code>a</code> as root but with <code>b</code> as a child<code>works just fine because both</code>a<code>and</code>b` life as long as the enclosing scope.</p>
<p>I think what would work is the following signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn new&lt;'a&gt;(root: &amp;'a ParsedModule, child: FnOnce(&amp;'a ParsedModule) -&gt; &amp;'a T): -&gt; Self
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is that it would require to reselect <code>child</code> from <code>root</code>, which we have no convenient or performant way of doing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The most recent crate where I ran across this idea, which prompted me to file this issue (just as a reminder to look into it some time in the future, since I don't think it's a priority) was https://docs.rs/compact_arena/latest/src/compact_arena/lib.rs.html#103</p>
<p>Searching just now I ran across this article about it: https://lord.io/lifetimes-as-tokens/</p>
<p>But my tentative conclusion from skimming this article is that this technique is probably more hacky and painful than it's worth, at least for our case. The current approach with <code>unsafe</code> is fine in practice. So I think we should just close this.</p>
