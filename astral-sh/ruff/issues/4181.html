<p><em>Safe</em> fixes are fixes that don't change the semantics of the program. <em>Unsafe</em> fixes may change the program's semantics; therefore, we advise users to manually review and test the changes.</p>

<p>Hey @evanrittenhouse. Do you plan to work on all of it or individual sub-tasks?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From what I can tell, @zanieb has done quite a bit of progress on #4276 already. I'd happily take on #4184 - 87 though (and 76, if Zanie doesn't want to do it anymore).</p>
<p>I have a draft PR for #4185 out already that hinges upon the completion of #4184, so I'm trying to knock that out. There's a list of the remaining linters that have <code>unspecified</code> fixes in the description for #4185. Since I'm already doing those, I figured I could just also take on #4186 and #4187, if nobody has any objections!</p>
