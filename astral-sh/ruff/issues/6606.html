Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Addition of sphinx documentation style to pydocstyle config as so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]
    convention = &quot;sphinx&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Currently pep257, google, and numpy documentation styles are supported. It'd be nice to have this major documentation style added as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can probably add a convention that's compatible, but there would also be necessary work to actually support parsing Sphinx docstrings (e.g., https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle/pull/595). pydocstyle itself does not support this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ditto @winwinashwin. We would adopt Ruff immediately on <a href="https://github.com/CDCgov/phdi">this project</a> it there was sphinx support. Unfortunately, we have a code base full of Sphinx style docstrings and need to implement linting on them.</p>

<p>I noticed that this was going to be supported, but there haven't been news for a while. Could you please inform whether this is going to be supported in ruff?</p>
<p>Looking forward to bundle this with uv usage to have a fully configured ecosystem for our projects.</p>

<p>We plan to look at linked PRs but it might take a while because we have to balance it with other features that we want to ship. We'll make sure to update this issue or the linked PRs if there's an update.</p>
