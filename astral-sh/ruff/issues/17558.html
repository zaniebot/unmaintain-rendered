            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For a <code>ruff.toml</code> file at the root of my repo:</p>
<pre><code>line-length = 120
target-version = &quot;py311&quot;
[lint.isort]
lines-after-imports = 1
</code></pre>
<p>... it appears that the setting to use a single line after the imports is ignored by the extension, resulting in the file that is formatted on save having errors according to the command line tool</p>
<p>I am fairly sure the file is being loaded because I am able to change the line-length parameter, restart the extension, and see matching fixes being applied.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! I think I can reproduce this with both <code>formatOnSave</code> and <code>codeActionsOnSave</code> enabled but need to double check. Just wanted to let you know we are looking into it :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@rjwalters can you provide additional details for us to reproduce this? I'm looking for a minimal code snippet where you're observing this behavior and the server logs. You can also checkout the settings that will be used for a specific document using the &quot;Ruff: Print debug information&quot; command (refer to the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> guide).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, what I've found (and what @ntBre also noticed) is that the <code>lines-after-imports</code> config option is incompatible with the formatter when set to any non-default value. The default value is <code>-1</code> so the custom value <code>1</code> is incompatible with the formatter. Refer to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#conflicting-lint-rules. We've also noticed that the docs for the config option (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports) says &quot;When using the formatter, only the values -1, 1, and 2 are compatible...&quot; but that seems incorrect (cc @MichaReiser). Micha is currently on PTO and is going to be back on the coming Monday.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think your finding is correct. <code>lines-after-imports=1</code> is only compatible if what comes after the imports isn't a function or class.</p>
<p>For example, this is fine:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import os
import sys

a = 1
 
def test():
    pass

</code></pre>
<p>But this isn't:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import os
import sys

def test():
    pass
</code></pre>
