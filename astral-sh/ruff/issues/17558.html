            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For a <code>ruff.toml</code> file at the root of my repo:</p>
<pre><code>line-length = 120
target-version = &quot;py311&quot;
[lint.isort]
lines-after-imports = 1
</code></pre>
<p>... it appears that the setting to use a single line after the imports is ignored by the extension, resulting in the file that is formatted on save having errors according to the command line tool</p>
<p>I am fairly sure the file is being loaded because I am able to change the line-length parameter, restart the extension, and see matching fixes being applied.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! I think I can reproduce this with both <code>formatOnSave</code> and <code>codeActionsOnSave</code> enabled but need to double check. Just wanted to let you know we are looking into it :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@rjwalters can you provide additional details for us to reproduce this? I&#x27;m looking for a minimal code snippet where you&#x27;re observing this behavior and the server logs. You can also checkout the settings that will be used for a specific document using the &quot;Ruff: Print debug information&quot; command (refer to the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-vscode#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> guide).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m currently looking into this, I can reproduce it but seems a bit tricky to discover the root cause. I think I have a hunch of what might be going on, will verify it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, what I&#x27;ve found (and what @ntBre also noticed) is that the <code>lines-after-imports</code> config option is incompatible with the formatter when set to any non-default value. The default value is <code>-1</code> so the custom value <code>1</code> is incompatible with the formatter. Refer to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#conflicting-lint-rules. We&#x27;ve also noticed that the docs for the config option (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports) says &quot;When using the formatter, only the values -1, 1, and 2 are compatible...&quot; but that seems incorrect (cc @MichaReiser). Micha is currently on PTO and is going to be back on the coming Monday.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think your finding is correct. <code>lines-after-imports=1</code> is only compatible if what comes after the imports isn&#x27;t a function or class.</p>
<p>For example, this is fine:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys

a = 1
 
def test():
    pass

</code></pre>
<p>But this isn&#x27;t:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys

def test():
    pass
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having taken a look at this issue, the problem seems to be the following.</p>
<p>As hinted in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#sorting-imports">docs (Sorting Imports)</a>, the <code>ruff</code> Linter and the Formatter work separate from each other.
Accordingly, the Formatter doesn&#x27;t seem to take into account Linter options.</p>
<pre><code>ruff check --select I --fix
</code></pre>
<p>would indeed correctly sort imports, and apply <code>1</code> empty line after (when configured so).</p>
<p>But running <code>ruff format</code>, a hardcoded double-empty-line is inserted by the formatter after the top section of a module. (Decision is taken <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/suite.rs#L235-L240">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/statement/suite.rs#L275-L277">then here</a>.</p>
<p>If my understanding is correct, the issue is more than a simple fix. There should be a concept on what (configuration) information may be shared between the Linter an the Formatter, and how (corresp. data structures, workflows, etc.)</p>
<p>(If an initiative is welcome, of course, I&#x27;m glad to offer my contribution. But I guess the core contributors of the project may be involved in such design :-)  The documentation also suggests that there may be an ongoing effort perhaps?)</p>
