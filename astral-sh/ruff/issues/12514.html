<p>Hello, I&#x27;m configuring ruff server 0.5.5 for Neovim and having some issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>First thing I noted is that this setting https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/settings/#configurationpreference works also on Neovim, even if the docs specify that it works on VS Code.</li>
<li>About the setting mentioned above, I think that <code>&quot;filesystemFirst&quot;</code> should be the default. Apart from my personal ruff settings, if working on a someone else&#x27;s project, I think I should use the setting the user of the project intended for it, and not the ones I specified for my client.</li>
<li>With the above setting enabled/disabled, I&#x27;m not able to let the setting https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/settings/#configuration to work. I intend to use it to set some values not actually exposed by the ruff server.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is my Neovim configuration in <code>/home/user/.config/nvim/lua/user/lspsettings/ruff.lua</code>:</p>
<pre><code>return {
  init_options = {
    settings = {
      configuration = &quot;/home/user/.config/nvim/lua/user/lspsettings/ruff.toml&quot;,
      lineLength = 88,
      configurationPreference = &quot;filesystemFirst&quot;,
      lint = {
        select = {&quot;ALL&quot;},
        ignore = {
          -- Prevent duplicates with basedpyright
          &quot;ANN&quot;,
          &quot;B018&quot;,
          &quot;F821&quot;,
          &quot;F401&quot;,
          &quot;PLC0414&quot;,
          &quot;RUF013&quot;,
          &quot;RUF016&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Tried also disabling <code>configurationPreference</code>.</p>
<p>And tried with the following <code>/home/user/.config/nvim/lua/user/lspsettings/ruff.toml</code>:</p>
<p><code>indent-width = 2</code></p>
<p>But it does not work. I tried with a python file related to an existing pyproject.toml file and also with a test file without any pyproject.toml file. Indent is still set to 4.</p>
<p>Any idea? Thank you!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From further tests it looks that:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>configurationPreference = &quot;filesystemFirst&quot;</code> the <code>configuration</code> setting does not work with files related to an existing pyproject.toml. I&#x27;m fine with this, I think it works ok this way. So it&#x27;s just extending the client config, but that&#x27;s ignored if there is some other config file in the workspace.</li>
<li>Tried setting another option in my <code>/home/user/.config/nvim/lua/user/lspsettings/ruff.toml</code> and it works, so the problem is with <code>indent-width</code>?</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>indent-width = 2
line-length = 5 #This works.
</code></pre>
<p>Tested with another random option and it does not work:</p>
<pre><code>indent-width = 2
line-length = 5 #Only this works.
[format]
quote-style = &quot;single&quot;

<p>Yes, those are server settings which works on all editors. Can you tell me why you thought that it only works on VS Code? Could we improve the documentation to make it clear? The example usage provides one for Neovim as well.</p>

<li>Create a <code>/tmp/ruff.toml</code> with <code>indent-width = 2</code></li>

      configurationPreference = &#x27;filesystemFirst&#x27;,
    },
  },

<ol>
<li>Open a file in any directory other than <code>/tmp/</code> and run the formatter via the language server</li>

<p>Can you tell me how you verified this?</p>
<p>Do you have any configuration file that&#x27;s existing in the project that you&#x27;ve opened in Neovim?</p>

<p>Yes it is just the docs to be a little misleading, stating</p>

<p>Ok, I only tried using <code>:=vim.lsp.buf.format()</code> as your example and it works as inteded.</p>
<p>But it does not work when using https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim that I use with the following config:</p>
<pre><code>local M = {
  &#x27;stevearc/conform.nvim&#x27;
}

function M.config()
  require(&quot;conform&quot;).setup({
    formatters_by_ft = {
      python = {&#x27;ruff_organize_imports&#x27;, &#x27;ruff_format&#x27;},
    },
    format_after_save = {
      lsp_fallback = true,
    },
    notify_on_error = true,
  })
end

return M

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s because the <code>ruff_format</code> as specified in your <code>conform.nvim</code> setup uses the <code>ruff</code> executable.

<p>Thank you, this means that actually using Conform the Ruff language server formatter will not work at all? Do you know of any way this can be fixed or should be requested upstream to Conform?</p>
<p>Also, for the import sorting, it looks like Conform still works, so for that I can continue to use it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, you can still use <code>conform.nvim</code> but you need to explicitly tell it to use the language server to format the buffer instead of the CLI. So, I think you&#x27;d need to remove all the formatters for the Python language from the list (<code>ruff_organize_imports</code>, <code>ruff_format</code>) so that it falls back to using the language server. But, then you loose the functionality to organize imports. My recommendation would be to use either the language server or the CLI for everything. It&#x27;s fine to use either of them at the same time but then the settings which are specific to the one cannot be used with the other, for example, using the <code>ruff</code> CLI won&#x27;t see the server settings set in your Neovim config.</p>

<p>Thank you, indeed I can format disabling the formatters. Any hint on how I could also use the language server for the import sorting?</p>
<p>Maybe I could also implement the following (that I had commented out because I was using Conform for everything):</p>
<pre><code>vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ &quot;BufWritePost&quot; }, {
  pattern = { &quot;*.py&quot; },
  callback = function()
    vim.lsp.buf.code_action {
      context = {
        only = { &#x27;source.organizeImports.ruff&#x27; },
      },
      apply = true,
    }
  end,
})

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that should work. The benefit of plugins like <code>conform.nvim</code> is that it would run multiple formatters sequentially which is what you want.</p>

<p>I see, maybe there is a way to run the autocommand from Conform, in order with the other formatter.</p>
<p>Anyway, which should run first? The formatter or the import sorter?</p>
