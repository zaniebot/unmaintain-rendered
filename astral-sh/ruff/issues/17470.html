            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the mouseover tooltips for rules in the comments of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># noqa: B011
</code></pre>
<p>If I put my mouse over the <code>B011</code>, I get a tooltip with details about the rule.</p>
<p>Can we also have this feature for rules in <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>ruff.toml</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = [&quot;B011&quot;,
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to be able to put my mouse over the <code>B011</code> in this pyproject.toml and see the same information.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ooh, that does sound cool. I don't think the ruff server/extension currently runs at all in TOML files, but I also don't know how difficult it would be to change that!</p>
