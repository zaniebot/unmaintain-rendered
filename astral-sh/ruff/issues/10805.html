<p>Hello :blush:</p>
<p>While adding the <code>SLOT</code> rules to Home Assistant, I found that the <code>SLOT002</code> doesn&#x27;t take subclasses of <code>typing.NamedTuple</code> in account, although they are the typed version of <code>collections.namedtuple</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thanks for opening the issue! Can you give a minimal code snippet as an example of where you think this rule should be emitting an error but isn&#x27;t currently?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, do you mean something like this?</p>
<pre><code>from typing import NamedTuple

class Foo(NamedTuple(&quot;Foo&quot;, [(&quot;x&quot;, int)])):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>It&#x27;s unusual to inherit from a call-based <code>typing.NamedTuple</code> rather than to do something like</p>
<pre><code>from typing import NamedTuple

class Foo(NamedTuple):
    x: int
</code></pre>
<p>And if you create a class-based <code>typing.NamedTuple</code> (the second way), it will create the <code>__slots__</code> for you. But I suppose if you <em>do</em> inherit from a call-based <code>typing.NamedTuple</code>, we probably <em>should</em> emit the diagnostic the same as if it were a <code>collections.namedtuple</code> (and we currently don&#x27;t).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I didn&#x27;t know that this example:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import NamedTuple

class Foo(NamedTuple):
    x: int
</code></pre>
<p>will have the <code>__slots__</code> automatically created, then it is not needed of course, thanks.</p>
<p>And I didn&#x27;t know about the call-based NamedTuple as well :sweat_smile: (it is not used in the Home Assistant codebase), but that would be a good idea to add.</p>
