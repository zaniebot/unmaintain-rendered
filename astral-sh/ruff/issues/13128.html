<p>Fair enough.  It came up when I was working on my own code.  I had accidentally added some parameter defaults, and then I though to check what happens.</p>
<p>That said, if this pattern is that rare, then I agree that there are more important issues to be added to Ruff and we can close this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree this is a reasonable thing to have a rule for. There's no chance of false positives, and I think I remember hitting this footgun myself at one point in a previous project. The <code>RUF</code> category sounds good to me.</p>
