Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Saw this in code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = sorted(l)[0]
a = sorted(l, reverse=True)[-1] # not sure about this one....
</code></pre>
<p>should be</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = min(l)
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, the following code pattern can also be simplified</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = sorted(l, reverse=True)[0] 
a = sorted(l)[-1] # not sure about this, sort stability could make it output a different value, right?
</code></pre>
<p>should be</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = max(l)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there already a pylint rule for this? I wouldn't be surprised. If not, let's add it as a RUFF rule.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the <code>[-1]</code> variants, as there may be some subtlety there with sort stability?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems nice for my first rule contribution. It occurs way more than I was expecting from <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%2Fsorted%5C%28.*%5C%29%5C%5B0%5C%5D%2F+language%3APython&amp;type=code&amp;p=2">this GitHub search</a>, though some of these are not actual cases of this violation.</p>
<p><code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> support a <code>key</code> argument as well, so the fix would forward that to these functions.</p>

<p>Not from a quick search in their docs.</p>
<p>@charliermarsh do you think this is something I could tackle? Any guidance would be nice but not necessary until I hit roadblocks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Python <code>sort</code> and <code>sorted</code> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts">guaranteed to be stable</a>, so it could have problem like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from operator import itemgetter
data = [('red', 1), ('blue', 1), ('red', 2), ('blue', 2)]

min(data, key=itemgetter(0))  # ('blue', 1)
sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0))[0]  # ('blue', 1)
sorted(data, key=itemgetter(0), reverse=True)[-1]  # ('blue, 2')
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the order of <code>('red', 1), ('red', 2)</code> and <code>('blue', 1), ('blue', 2)</code> is retained for both <code>sorted</code> call, which cause the result of the two to become different.
So we need to be careful when adding the rule for <code>[-1]</code>, though I think it is not very frequent to intentionally use <code>sorted</code> function that way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually to clarify, all these sorts are stable, but reverse=True reverse the order unstable elements apparently. (And reverse=True, '[-1]'). So only the first proposed fix using min (and it's reversed version) will always be guaranteed to be the same. I suppose. Maybe that warrants its own rule in that case or a rule toggle not flag it when it could change the returned value on ties.</p>
