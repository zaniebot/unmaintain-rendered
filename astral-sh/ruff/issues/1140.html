            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm trying out ruff on a greenfield project (loving it so far! Thank you for it!) where I get to use all the latest python goodies, and I've discovered that it doesn't seem like ruff (v0.0.169) likes <code>match</code>/<code>case</code>:</p>
<p>Simple example:</p>
<pre><code>ruff - &lt;&lt;EOF
name = &quot;abc&quot;
match name:
    case &quot;def&quot;:
        print(&quot;def&quot;)
    case _:
        print(&quot;default&quot;)

EOF
Found 1 error(s).
-:2:8: E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Got unexpected token 'name'
</code></pre>
<p>(Replace <code>ruff</code> with <code>python</code> and it'll run fine, of course.)</p>
<p>This syntax was added via https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/ in Python 3.10</p>
<p>I'll won't be able to get around to attempting a PR for this before the New Year, if someone beats me to it I owe you a drink of your choice!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Close as duplicate of #282 - sorry I clearly massively failed in searching (I think I was looking for case match and not &quot;pattern matching&quot;. I wasn't aware that is what it was called in python until I went to find the PEP for it)</p>
