# new rule - useles if expression / useless comprehension

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-06-23 00:03_

### Summary

if expressions and comprehensions are notoriously more difficult to read than regular if statements and for loops  (related: #13703), so in cases where there's no benefit to writing it as an expression (ie. the result is not used), there should be a rule to suggest rewriting it as a statement instead:

before:
```py
print(1) if bool() else print(2) # error: useless if expression, rewrite as an if statement
```

after:
```py
if bool():
    print(1)
else:
    print(2)
```
