Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I would like to achieve the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the ruff linter on my code</li>
<li>Use the ruff formatter on my code</li>
<li>Enable rule COM812 for the linter</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the linter, I like the formatter, and I like rule COM812. However, when I have COM812 as an allowed rule I get a warning when I run the formatter that rule COM812 may cause conflicts and that it should be disabled to avoid unexpected behavior. Is there, then, a recommended way to achieve my three goals?</p>
<p>I see a number of issues discussing rule COM812 but I don't see any addressing this exact question.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think it's currently possible based on our definition of &quot;incompatible&quot;. In short, we want to avoid cases in which running the formatter introduces <em>new</em> lint rule violations. In the case of COM812, you could have a function like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def args(aaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccccc, ddddddddd, eeeeeeee, ffffff, gggggggggggg, hhhh):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Which the formatter may reformat as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def args(
    aaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccccc, ddddddddd, eeeeeeee, ffffff, gggggggggggg, hhhh
):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>Which would violate COM812. After adding the trailing comma to fix COM812, the formatter would then reformat again as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def args(
    aaaaaaaa,
    bbbbbbbbb,
    cccccccccc,
    ddddddddd,
    eeeeeeee,
    ffffff,
    gggggggggggg,
    hhhh,
):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>We would need a new trailing-comma setting in the formatter, like <code>&quot;force&quot;</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the response! I would be interested in any sort of solution to get compatibility, something like the <code>&quot;force&quot;</code> flag you mention seems fine to me. I would be curious to know if it's decided that this is something <code>ruff</code> will support at some point.</p>
<p>I think I've already experienced the two step process you described I think for now, for my codebase, I will bear the annoyance of the incompatibility message and implement the <code>format - lint (fix) - format</code> routine to make the formatting stable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm refactoring large code bases, and the case you quote above is particularly common as an outcome of reformatting.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def args(
    aaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccccc, ddddddddd, eeeeeeee, ffffff, gggggggggggg, hhhh
):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>What the formatter does is indeed very natural and intuitive: When the line gets too long it first tries to put everything inside braces onto a line of its own.  Shouldn't COM812 accept this as a good case, in general? Kind of, &quot;there are several arguments on a single line&quot;, that's a signal that it's okay not to have a trailing comma.</p>
<p>The <code>trailing-comma = &quot;force&quot;</code> is probably just that. - Maybe <code>&quot;strict&quot;</code> vs. <code>&quot;forgiving&quot;</code> would reflect the intention even better, with <code>&quot;forgiving&quot;</code> as the default, probably.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand that having <code>COM812</code> and the formatter not agreeing on the formatting here is annoying.</p>
<p>What's the motivation for using both the formatter and <code>COM812</code>. Wouldn't it be sufficient to only rely on the formatter that also fixes the issue automatically rather than having the lint rule enabled too? Or do you need <code>COM812</code> enabled because you dislike the &quot;all on one line&quot; formatting that the formatter produces?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are a few things I want to satisfy. The motivation for <code>COM812</code> from <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-trailing-comma/">the docs</a> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The presence of a trailing comma can reduce diff size when parameters or elements are added or removed from function calls, function definitions, literals, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true in cases where there is one argument per line. So in those cases (one argument per line) I do want <code>COM812</code> enforced.</p>
<p>Another constraint is I want arguments to be wrapped in some way when a single line like</p>
<pre><code>def args(aaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccccc, ddddddddd, eeeeeeee, ffffff, gggggggggggg, hhhh):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>is too long.
But I would be happy with</p>
<pre><code>def args(
    aaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccccc, ddddddddd, eeeeeeee, ffffff, gggggggggggg, hhhh
):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>As a resolution to a line too long in the case that the arguments are too long to stand on one like with the function definition (<code>def args( ... )</code>) but short enough to stand on their own line. That is, I don't think this case needs a trailing comma because I don't think it shortens the diff.</p>
<p>So yes, I think I agree with @bittner that I don't understand why this form violates <code>COM812</code>. Maybe <code>COM812</code> should only be enforced when there is one argument per line. That way the trailing comma won't be added by the linter after the re-formatting, thus inducing the formatter to again want to do more.</p>
<p>This wouldn't even require a new option I don't think. BUT if a new option is the way to go: Is it possible for LINTING rules to have optional configuration (other than inclusion or exclusion)? Or can only formatting rules be controlled by optional configuration?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm currently looking into what it takes to make <code>COM812</code> compatible with the formatter. It sounds like a simple change, but it's a very expensive token-based rule. I need to figure out how to test if all arguments (or list elements etc) are on their own line without having to track too much state.</p>
<p>I don't intend to add a configuration option that gives users the old behavior because I don't see the formatter's behavior to be in contradiction to the rule's goals.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, the existing rule isn't able to catch all cases where I would suspect a trailing comma to be required because it only tests if there's a newline between the last token and the closing parentheses:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting. As for my desired behavior independent of any existing functionality: Assuming all arguments are simple parameter names, the three types of formats I would ever want (in this preference) are</p>
<ul>
<li>One line, params/args appear on the same line as <code>def foo(...)</code></li>
<li>Three lines. One line for the function definition, one line for params and args and one line for the closing parentheses, colon, and return type annotation.</li>
<li>n lines. One line for the function definition, one line for each param/arg pair, and one line for the closing parentheses, colon, and return type annotation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would prefer no trailing comma for the first two but not be upset by the existence of a trailing comma. The third one must have a trailing comma.</p>
<p>Anything other than these three options, like what was in the last post, would not be acceptable to me.</p>
<p>I don't have a simple way to say what rules I expect if there is nesting of complex expressions</p>
<pre><code>def foo(
    param_1=3
    param_2=[
        first_element,
        bar(
            &quot;a deeply nested input&quot;,        
        ),
    ],
    param_3=&quot;top_layer_input&quot;,                  
) -&gt; None:
</code></pre>
<p>I think my preference would be for the above three rules to be applied in every scope. I have no idea about the feasibility of this. Thank you for looking into it!</p>

<p>I realize it's conflicting with the formatter, and compat with the formatter is probably more important. But if a solution can be found which keeps preventing the code above, when not using the formatter, or even when <em>are</em> using the formatter, that would be nice.</p>

<p>Can you explain how you add the parameter that it changes two lines? The formatting I'm thinking of either change one line or all parameter lines.</p>

<p>Curious, in my mental model token-based rules were supposed to be faster than AST based rules, but I guess I need to update :)</p>
<p>BTW, while flake8-commas (on which the ruff implementation is based) is token-based, there is also https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma which IIRC is AST based, maybe it's a better base for this rule.</p>

<p>It always depends. AST based rule have a high upfront cost because it requires parsing and building the AST. But that's something done once for all rules, so it then becomes &quot;cheaper&quot; for a single rule.</p>
<p>Token based rules can be very fast and they tend to be faster than string based rules. However, they can be slow if they require a lot of context tracking.</p>

<p>Many of these &quot;break&quot; some rule amongst &quot;don't allow line too long&quot; and &quot;don't cause two line-diffs when a trailing comma would make the diff only be one line&quot;. Also, convention seems to dictate that formats like people don't like formats like B), C) and J) (sharing a line with <code>def</code> even when multiple lines are present), so I'll forbid those also. If we want all those constraints to be followed then what remains are</p>
<pre><code># A) SINGLE LINE, SHARE WITH DEF
# Only valid for short enough line
def args(aaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb, cccccccccc, ddddddddd, eeeeeeee, ffffff, gggggggggggg, hhhh, iiii):
    pass
    
# D) SINGLE LINE, DON'T SHARE WITH DEF

<p>I brought A and D back, only valid for short enough lines. I think D is valid so long as you are going to roll over to I instead of G if the line gets too long. If D is going to roll over to G when the line is too long then you should consider that a &quot;single line case of G&quot;.</p>
<p>So I think it boils down to three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to allow rolling around to D) as a stop-gap in cases where A) fails? (I don't like this one very much because it's kind of a goldilocks situation, there are only a small ranges of cases where A) can fail, but D) can succeed without needing to fully roll over to G) or I))</li>
<li>Do you want multi-line signatures to wrap to G) or I)?</li>
<li>Do you want to use trailing commas in cases where they can reduce diff sizes in the event a line gets rolled over to a new line when a param/arg is added?</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, to summarize, I think the simplest thing (and what people who use both <code>COM812</code> and the formatter get right now) is to use A) when the line isn't too long, but to immediately roll over to I) when the line gets too long.</p>
<p>But perhaps this is overly restrictive and there should be a way to choose some of the intermediate formats in addition?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, I recommend that we leave this as is for now. I documented it in more detail on the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10111">PR</a>. But in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The formatter's formatting is widely supported in the community (proven by Black) and I don't want to make the formatter's behavior dependent on whether a certain lint rule is enabled or not</li>
<li>We recommend disabling <code>COM812</code> if you use the formatter: The formatter takes care of the formatting for you</li>
<li>You can use <code>COM812</code> and the formatter to catch the &quot;all arguments on one line&quot; formatting and add the trailing comma, but this is an unsupported feature, and the warning expresses that.</li>
<li>You can use <code>COM812</code> without the formatter</li>
<li>I don't consider adding a new option as a solution because it doesn't solve the issue that the rule isn't compatible with the formatter. It simply makes the rule incompatible when using a certain set of options, leaving the situation unchanged.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser really appreciate your detailed consideration of this issue.</p>
<p>Though I admit to being a bit confused at the outcome (and in my previous comments I was confused myself):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The current situation is that COM812 and formatter are officially incompatible, possibly this even becomes a hard error in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This issue asks them to not be incompatible. If I understand the reasoning from @jagerber48 and @bittner (and myself) correctly, the reason why we want COM812 + formatter is to avoid the &quot;SINGLE LINE, DON'T SHARE WITH DEF&quot; case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The PR makes COM812 + formatter compatible, by making COM812 not complain about the &quot;SINGLE LINE, DON'T SHARE WITH DEF&quot; case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It therefore seems to that the PR wouldn't actually satisfy what's being requested in this issue, and actually make the situation worse than the current situation for people <em>not</em> using the formatter (because they want a comma there).</p>
<p>Really sorry if I'm misunderstanding something and just wasting your time...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@bluetech I understand that this is confusing.  I'm sorry in the change of direction, but the conversation with you made me realize that what I'm proposing isn't as good an option as I thought because it impacts users that use <code>ruff</code> without the formatter maybe exactly because they disagree with how it formats arguments, and these users are not represented in this thread.</p>
<p>It also seems that you prefer to format the arguments differently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>though realistically when this happens I prefer to explode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which won't be supported after changing <code>COM812</code>.</p>
<p>The part I struggle to understand is the use case for using <code>COM812</code> and using the formatter. Why not just use the formatter and disable <code>COM812</code>? It makes ruff faster and the incompatibility is solved.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser ok, I think the suggestion to disable <code>COM812</code> and just use the formatter will indeed give me outputs that are satisfactory. I think the expected behaviors are a bit confusing though and the documentation wasn't very clarifying for me.  Actually I generally don't see much documentation about what changes I should expect from the formatter? Maybe I should check documentation for <code>black</code>?</p>
<p>In any case, it seems like the formatter will:</p>
<p>(1) If the line is too long to have params/args share with def then it will
(2) try to put all parameters on a single line after <code>def(</code> and before <code>):</code> on a third line. It does this WITHOUT a trailing comma
(3) If the line is still too long then it breaks out each param/arg onto its own line WITH a trailing comma</p>
<p>Under my current workflow I will never get output formatted like (2) because of the lack of trailing comma. But if I were to disable the lint rule <code>COM812</code> I would sometimes get output like (2). That's ok with me, I don't have anything against (2).</p>
<p>So for me I would be happy to disable <code>COM812</code>. The reason I didn't want to do that was I thought it would allow output like</p>
<pre><code>def args(
    aaaaaaaa, 
    bbbbbbbbb, 
    cccccccccc, 
    ddddddddd, 
    eeeeeeee, 
    ffffff, 
    gggggggggggg, 
    hhhh, 
    iiii
):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>without a trailing comma. That is, since <code>COM812</code> was disabled I didn't expect anything to be there to enforce the presence of the trailing comma. But, it seems the formatter on its own already enforces the trailing comma in this case.</p>
<p>I would be helped by more clear documentation pointing out that running the formatter will already enforce trailing commas in the single param/arg per line format. Though the gotcha edge case here, as @bluetech highlights, is that the formatter will NOT enforce the trailing comma in the multiple params on one line not shared with <code>def</code> case. This is ok from a VCS perspective since if parameters are added the signature would be totally reformatted to the single param per line style. This is ok if you're totally relying on the formatter though because you'll never be outside one of the three possible cases.</p>
<p>@bluetech indicates that they want the trailing comma so that they can extend multi-params not shared with <code>def</code> onto more than one line. But in this case they are operating outside the rules of the formatter so they should not use the formatter. In this case I think <code>COM812</code> alone would suffice.</p>
<hr />
<p>To summarize, I think status quo is ok for me, but better documentation would be helpful. Especially in light of the fact that the multi-parameters per line not shared with <code>def</code> is kind of a funny edge case in my view.</p>

<p>To solve the contradiction, <code>COM812</code> should accept case &quot;D&quot; from above (for short enough lines, obviously). Isn't that all there is to do?</p>
<p>(Or don't I get the point of all the numerous cases from above? Frankly, I've never seen the other cases caused by the formatter.)</p>
<p>I use both the linter <em>and</em> the formatter, because they serve different jobs. I have all linter rules enabled, I try to make exceptions rare and file-based. Ruff is great for this, giving actionable feedback collected from years of investment of a significant number of people in the Python community.</p>
<p>A note aside, I try to stay away from <code>--fix</code> and also review changes made by the formatter. It makes sense more often than expected to take your time and come up with &quot;creative solutions&quot; that are easier to read and more intuitive from a Clean Code point of view. When those also make the formatter and linter happy, you're done.</p>

<p>to keep their diffs shorter. Such a user might NOT use the formatter, since they're preferring a format not allowed by it, but they WOULD want <code>COM812</code> to flag no trailing comma. This is the current behavior. Letting <code>COM812</code> accept no trailing comma on this style would let these kinds of users down.</p>

<p>Yeah, we might have to write up the rules eventually.

<p>That makes sense to me. It may also be worth improving the warning message with a clearer recommendation to disable <code>COM812</code> when using the formatter because it is superfluous (except you disagree with the formatter's style but want to use the formatter regardless, which is unlikely a case we want to support).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think there's a case where someone who DOESN'T use the formatter might want something like G) above.</p>

<p>Agree and thanks for the detailed explanation. Changing <code>COM812</code> to make the trailing comma optional makes it less useful for users who don't use the formatter.</p>
<p>The next steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve deprecation warning</li>
<li>Improve the rule's documentation related to formatter compatibility</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can only reiterate that using both the formatter and the linter is not a strange idea. This issue/question is all about using both in a way that wouldn't contradict each other.</p>
<p>The multi-line multi-parameter per line case is unusual. Black would never accept it. The single-line multi-parameter case is generated by the formatter, which is a behavior we have seen by Black.</p>
<p>We should get the linter not complain about the generated formatting. With or without a linter rule setting. The current state is not satisfactory. And suggesting to stop using both the formatter and the linter together is not satisfactory either.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, using the formatter and the linter together is great and very much intended. As you say, they solve different problems! I don't have a solution here, but adding some more color from my perspective... The issue in this case is that this rule pre-dated the formatter -- if the rule didn't exist today, we likely wouldn't add it to Ruff, since these kinds of linter-formatter conflicts create a lot of problems for users.</p>
<p>One answer would be to deprecate and remove the rule. But we've shied away from doing that, and instead we've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documented the rules that conflict, and warned against them.</li>
<li>Held back from adding <em>new</em> rules that cause linter-formatter conflicts.</li>
<li>In some cases, modified rules to make them non-conflicting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modifying the rule to allow Case (D) above would be a reasonable compromise, and would make it non-conflicting, but it'd <em>probably</em> also make it redundant, and my guess is that users of this rule actually <em>like</em> that it enforces that style.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As explained in flake8-commas and ruff doc, COM812 was created to reduce diff size and it's working well.
It's approach is more aggressive than the current formatting style of ruff's formatter which allow to group all arguments on a single line before exploding all arguments line by line.</p>
<p>In real world use cases, you might start with a few number of arguments and then add more afterwards.
With COM812, you have two possible states:</p>
<ul>
<li>the compact with everything on a single line</li>
<li>the diff friendly one, with everything on a separate line</li>
</ul>
<p>Without COM812 and with ruff formatter, you get one more state in between:</p>
<ul>
<li>a less compact state with the function name on the first line, all the arguments on the second line and the return annotation on the third</li>
</ul>
<p>Each state transition is painful during code review because you need to read again everything to figure out what changed so COM812 really helps by reducing the number of states.
I'm not trying to convince anyone to actually adopt this rule, but I simply emphasise why it's important to keep it untouched because there are users who rely on it, as @charliermarsh mentioned.</p>
<p>As @MichaReiser pointed, this opinion is not compatible with the current formatter style.
As a long time (convinced) user of COM812, this bothers me but I had the same problem with Black and the numerous benefits of ruff replacing black / isort / flake8 + having an uncompromising formatting style are worth it 🙂
For this reason, I'm going disable the rule on my projects.</p>
<p>Regarding what comes next, I have some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>while I see the clear benefits of having an uncompromising formatter, would it be acceptable in the future to have an option in the formatter to remove the &quot;the less compact&quot; in mention earlier ?</li>
<li>as of today, ruff's formatting style seems deeply linked to Black style. Would it be possible in the future to suggest formatter style changes, similar to PEP ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for all your explanations and for your time working on ruff, you keep saving us more and more time every day coding ❤️</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @kozlek's point of the cognitive overhead when code is reformatted. &quot;The less compact&quot; variant has its value, though, just for the same reason. Let me explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an intermediate step, &quot;the less compact&quot; variant makes a less intrusive change than splitting all argument up into separate lines, immediately.<ul>
<li>The number of lines doesn't change significantly with this change.</li>
<li>The change is limited to what's necessary at that moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When &quot;the less compact&quot; variant gets too long on the line and the formatter starts to split up the arguments, then the leading and trailing parentheses are already in the right position.<ul>
<li>The position of the parentheses doesn't change, which limits the transition to just the arguments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The formatter's approach <strong>minimizes the disruptive nature</strong> of the changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>have an option in the formatter to remove the &quot;the less compact&quot; in mention earlier</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a certain sense, this is already possible today.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply run <code>ruff format</code> and <code>ruff lint</code> afterwards, with COM812 activated.</li>
<li>When the formatter generates &quot;the less compact&quot; variant, you'll get a linter complaint about a missing trailing comma.</li>
<li>Add the comma and run the <code>ruff format</code> again; it will reformat the code using the &quot;diff friendly&quot; variant.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I'm not totally wrong this two-stage formatting is exactly the behavior of Black, too.</p>
<p>My take is, the formatter does a decent job, also for people who really don't want to compromise with COM812. If we had a <strong>configuration switch</strong> for the <em>linter</em> that would allow a <strong>less strict interpretation</strong> of COM812 (for accepting &quot;the less compact&quot; variant) wouldn't we fix today's situation, which would allow us to remove the conflict warning?</p>

<p>It would solve the conflict, but I don't see the difference to disabling the lint and only use the formatter (except that the warning doesn't show up by default when using <code>--select ALL</code>).</p>
<p>@AlexWaygood's currently figuring out how we want to <a href="#1774">categorize Ruff's rules</a> in the future. This work also touches on if Ruff should support rules that are incompatible with the formatter (probably?) and, if so, how the user experience looks like.</p>

<p>It just seems inconsistent formatting to different styles:

<ul>
<li>Consistent formatting result (regardless of any typed line break or (trailing) comma).</li>
<li>Minimal diff - as already mentioned earlier, from <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-trailing-comma/">missing-trailing-comma</a>:</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't care. I want formatter, linter and COM812 live together. And I want this:</p>
<pre><code>def func(

<p>formatted into this:</p>
<pre><code>def func(

<p>I understand that there are programming languages that don't support the trailing comma hence it's not that common to have it when the arguments on one line, however, it looks incomplete and feels inconsistent with, let's say,</p>
<pre><code>def func(
    foo,
    bar,
    baz,
):
</code></pre>
<p>I understand that every programmer has their own style preferences that don't necessarily adhere with mine and none of them is really the &quot;correct&quot; way to do stuff, however, I'd like the formatter to do stuff the way I like. If black style is not necessarily compatible with popular (like flake8-comma or some popular pylint defaults), then it's wrong and it has to be configurable. People choose between black style and their own flake8 (or pylint) preferences, but in this case both the linter and the formatter are bundled with ruff.</p>
<p>For now, my Makefile has to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>lint: $(VENV)
	$(PYTHON) -m ruff check src tests

format: $(VENV)
	$(PYTHON) -m ruff format src tests
	$(PYTHON) -m ruff check --fix src tests

<p>This feels reasonable to me. Another option here might be to break COM812 (and flake8-commas' C812) into separate errors by context -- so have one for calls, one for function defs, one for class defs, one for collection literals, etc. This would avoid introducing a new setting while also providing users with more granularity.</p>
<p>I'm personally in the camp of wanting to enable both C812/COM812 and the formatter, so I'd love to see an option which let me do that <em>and then silence the warning</em>. Even better if there's a way to not need to run the fixer &amp; the formatter again, but I'm less worried about that (as it's easily automated).
Something I've considered for that is whether including <code>&quot;COM812&quot;</code> explicitly in the list of selected lints (rather than just a result of its prefix matching) should at least silence the warning? (If I've missed an existing way to silence the warning I'm all ears!)</p>
