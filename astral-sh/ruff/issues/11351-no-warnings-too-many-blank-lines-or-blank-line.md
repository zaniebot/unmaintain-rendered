Thank you for the project!

There are no wornings about blank lines (missing, present). Am I missing something?

Are there any tests for that?
```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install ruff
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.4.3
$ cat <<EOF > test.py
> from enum import Enum
from itertools import dau



def a():
    pass
def b():
    pass
class Failure(Enum):
    pass
EOF
$ ruff check test.py
test.py:2:23: F401 [*] `itertools.dau` imported but unused
Found 1 error.
[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

search keywords: no blank lines

The blank line rules are preview only rules and not enabled by default. You need to run `ruff check --extend-select E3 --preview test.py`

@MichaReiser I have a question that seems related to this. What I'm seeing is that the formatter wants to remove blank lines but the checker doesn't inform about the same lines. So in pre-commit/CI `ruff check` isn't noticing changes that `ruff format` would do automatically.

When Django creates migrations it inserts a blank line after the `class` header before the `dependencies`:

```python3
# Generated by Django 4.2.11 on 2024-05-15 08:56

from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ...
    ]

    operations = [
        ...
    ]

```

If I run `ruff check path/to/migration_file.py` (I have `preview = true` and `E3` in `pyproject.toml`) it just tells me `All checks passed!`. But if I run `ruff format ruff check path/to/migration_file.py` I get `1 file reformatted` and it has removed the blank line.

Isn't `ruff check` supposed to tell me about all changes `ruff format` would do? Is there some other rule I need to enable?

It's our long-term goal that `ruff check` performs all necessary checks, that includes linting, formatting, type checking etc. However, we aren't there yet and `ruff check` only runs the lint rules today. 

You have to run `ruff format --check` to verify if all files are correctly formatted (it also has a `--diff` option if you want to get a diagnostic for differences)
