            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Or does this lead to AST dependence and over-invalidation if a typevar is imported and the source module has unrelated changes?</p>
<p>We only use <code>TypeVarInstance::definition</code> to support goto-type-definition on typevars.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was added in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16901">astral-sh/ruff#16901</a> but I don&#x27;t think there was discussion there specifically about the AST-dependence consequences.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using a <code>Definition</code> is fine because its identity is defined by all fields except <code>kind</code>. That means, the <code>Definition</code>&#x27;s ID remains unchanged for as long as its file, scope, symbol, and re-export remain the same.</p>
<p>A single change in the AST file won&#x27;t invalidate the <code>Definition</code> but the following changes could:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new scope is introduced before the definition&#x27;s scope</li>
<li>A new symbol is introduced in the definition&#x27;s scope and comes before the definition&#x27;s symbol</li>
<li>The definition&#x27;s re-export convention is changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there&#x27;s a possible issue related to persistent caching where deserializing a <code>TypeVarInstance</code> now requires deserializing its <code>Definition</code> which, in turn, requires eager deserialization of the AST node.</p>
<p>Now, whether this is a problem long-term depends on if we&#x27;re going to change our <code>AstNodeRef</code> representation to something that hold a a weak pointer that can be deserialized lazily to reduce red knot&#x27;s memory footprint.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Makes sense. Closing this issue for now until/unless we see problems from this that we need to fix.</p>
