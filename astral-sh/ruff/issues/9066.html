Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Almost all the trivial pycodestyle e autofixes https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#error-e are implemented, but there are few that are missing that seem quite trivial to implement. The first of which is <code>E251</code>. I first brought his up in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8312, and @charliermarsh mentioned it as fixed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8623, but that does not seem to be case as indicated by the both rule webpage https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unexpected-spaces-around-keyword-parameter-equals/ , and trying to apply an autofix to the example in the documentation.</p>
