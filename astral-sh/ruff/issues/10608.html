            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I've had a good look through all the available rules and found nothing that quite matches this.</p>
<p>I could have an aliased import in this style:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import pyarrow.parquet as pq
</code></pre>
<p>Or in this style:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyarrow import parquet as pq
</code></pre>
<p>It would be nice to select one form or the other. I imagine a setting would be a good idea as people have differing preferences. I think this should stay away from having per-package/module configuration to allow going both ways in different cases - it'll just over-complicate things.</p>
<p>This would probably fit nicely under the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-import-conventions-icn"><code>ICN</code></a> set of rules?</p>
<p>FWIW, this is also quite close to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/manual-from-import/"><code>PLR0402</code></a>, but that's only aimed at avoiding <code>import x.y as y</code> cases.</p>
