            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For what it's worth, this is the default behavior for <code>elm-review --fix</code>, which I think is the best approach to gain the user's trust: by showing that you're fixing each issue in the correct way. I talk about this in <a href="https://youtu.be/XjwJeHRa53A?t=1222">this video</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3869412/227010991-a19a6003-2faf-4504-b819-6bad8c7c486e.png" alt="FaHfMbbX0AA_Sba" /></p>
<p>It does however look a lot less impressive if you're trying to impress the user with the speed of the tool though, which I guess is pretty important for Ruff's adoption at this point.</p>
<p><code>elm-review</code> also has a <code>--fix-all</code> command which accumulates all errors and then prompts the user on whether to accept the larger diff. And there is a <code>--fix-all-without-prompt</code> flag (which is not very much documented on purpose) where the behavior is the same as what Ruff has today.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If any contributor gets excited about implementing this, I do think it's something we'd like to support. Though there are some details to work out before diving in.</p>
<p>As a straw proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invoke via <code>ruff --fix --review</code>.</li>
<li>Render a <code>cargo insta review</code>-like experience: a diff, with &quot;accept&quot; or &quot;skip&quot; actions (might be some things we can reuse from <code>cargo insta</code>, I like their UI a lot).</li>
<li>On completion: should we print out all remaining lint errors? Unclear, need to look at how other tools behave here.</li>
<li>Once you've cycled through all the fixable errors: should we re-run Ruff, and show you the remaining fixable errors? Probably, that's how <code>--fix</code> works internally today (we iteratively fix until there's nothing left to fix).</li>
</ul>

<p>That's what <code>elm-review</code> does. I'd say you don't want to let the user re-run the tool to know whether they're done with linting (and can move on to other things) or not.</p>

<p>We do this as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you want to try out how <code>elm-review</code> does it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-spa-example</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code></li>
<li>Play with<ul>
<li><code>npx elm-review --fix</code></li>
<li><code>npx elm-review --fix-all</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(There are a lot of errors in that example, so maybe you want to use <code>--rules</code> to limit which rules to run, like <code>--rules NoUnused.Patterns</code>)</p>
