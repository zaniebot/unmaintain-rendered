# Fails to parse type aliases after semicolon

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-11-29 05:44_

```python
type One = int; type Another = str
```

Ruff fails to parse `Another`. Probably because the `SoftKeywordTokenizer` doesn't expect the contextual keyword `type` at that position.

This prevents us from importing Black's `type_aliases` test case.

Depending on the urgency, I can try to take a look at this one.

I don't think its super urgent. I'm ignoring that black test for now.

(Coordinated with @zanieb, I'm gonna take this and the related parser error.)
