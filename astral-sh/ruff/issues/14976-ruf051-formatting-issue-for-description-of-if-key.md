# [RUF051] Formatting issue for description of `if-key-in-dict-del` (RUF051) in docs

In the new rule [if-key-in-dict-del (RUF051)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/if-key-in-dict-del/#if-key-in-dict-del-ruf051), there seems to be a formatting issue, as shown in the following screenshot.

I don't see the problem in the PR that seems to have added that text: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14553/files#diff-b0fd57331d4ce41cac2a70091108b4053b5514a06d5d75da3b6bb0e880fbaeb0R11-R16

What is different from other rules that don't show up like this?

Good catch! My guess is that `mkdocs` does not like the backticks that it's pulling out for the description? (That description/tag is auto-generated by a script based on the doc-comment).
