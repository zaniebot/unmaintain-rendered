```py
class A:
    def __among_us__(self):  # PLW3201: Bad or misspelled dunder method name `__among_us__`. (bad-dunder-name)
        ...
```
but in the docs it's called `bad-dunder-method-name`

We use `bad-dunder-method-name` and I believe it's intentional -- I think Pylint uses `bad-dunder-name`, but we made the name more specific.

Ohh I didn't realize we were including this in the rule message. Yes, that's a bug, thanks!
