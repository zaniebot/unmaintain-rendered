            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, these are intended, because the rules are legitimately in conflict. Ideally, we will resolve this when do recategorize the rules in the future. At present, the only other option I see is to straight-up omit those two specific rules (<code>D203</code> and <code>D213</code>) from <code>ALL</code>, which could also cause confusion in the other direction (though would be much more rare).</p>

<p>What&#x27;s your motivation for waiting until after recatogorization? I&#x27;m only proposing to remove it from the help text to promote it less. It may also be the case that we won&#x27;t have a way to run all rules after recategorization (without listing all categories)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I see the presence of sensible categories as essential to replace <code>ALL</code>. Until then, I worry we&#x27;ll just get more questions if we remove the hint.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have over a million lines of code and currently use <code>ALL</code>  and disable about 40 rules (0.1.5 without preview). Without the <code>ALL</code> would we need to explicitly enable all 700 something rules? Enable all the categories, then specify individual ones we want disabled? That seems like it would get awkward? Or maybe I&#x27;m just selecting them wrong as it is?</p>
<p>I think many of the formatters and linters (maybe to a lesser extent) are going to be somewhat opinionated. I&#x27;m ok with that provided there is a reasonable amount of flexibility to alter the behavior to suit my projects. Maybe in addition to <code>ALL</code> add a <code>DEFAULT</code> which is a curated selection and chooses or disables rules with conflicts. Or possibly something like a <code>--select-conflict-defaults</code> which allows to specify which rules are enabled in case of conflicts.</p>

<p>You would have to enable all categories that aren&#x27;t enabled by default, which should only be a few (&lt;10). The categories we&#x27;re thinking about are similar to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/">clippy&#x27;s</a> but with a few additional ones (e.g. <code>format</code> for formatting related lints)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Without enabling <code>ALL</code>, these still come in conflict if you enable the <code>D</code> category. I&#x27;d rather fully opposite rules like these be configurable instead. (combine the codes and use a config option to decide on the behaviour).</p>

<p>In a codebase I work on we have this configuration (partial), however I still get the warning even when I ignore all documentation:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wish that Ruff would include some default all-covering family of rules without the conflicting rules.
I do like to take advantage of all the advice that the rules give me and only explicitly disable the ones which don&#x27;t work for me.</p>
<p>However, right now if I <code>select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]</code>, I need to exclude quite many individual conflicting rules and repeat this in all our projects.</p>
<p>Please add something like <code>select = [&quot;ALL_COMPAT&quot;]</code> or <code>select = [&quot;STRICT&quot;]</code> to easily enable all rules without any conflicts. If there is something to pick (like <code>D203</code> <em>xor</em> <code>D211</code>, or <code>D212</code> <em>xor</em> <code>D213</code>), just pick one! Let us have a default default to follow.</p>

<p>I totally support this.
I usually use <code>select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]</code> and then ignore some rules, and those warnings are annoying.
I know I can disable them by ignoring D203 and D212 rules, but it adds mental load as every time I see them in my config I ask to myself why I wanted them in the first place.</p>
