            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! I was wondering if there are any plans to create autofix for (G) rules? We have a lot of violations that prevents enabling the rule. Having autofix capabilities (even if unsafe) would greatly help with adoption of the (G) rules in our codebase.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you looking for a specific rule or is it really all rules? The format fixes tend to be rather difficult to implement because of all the edge cases and adding more fixes isn't a priority for us right now (not saying that it wouldn't be great to have them, it's just there are so many other improvements)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will second really only needing an autofix for G004.</p>
<p>~~G001 looks trivial as both logging methods and <code>str.format</code> use <code>string.Formatter</code>.
G002 could involve transforming to <code>str.format</code> first, then trivially converting to the logging call.~~
EDIT: actually it's slightly different. And of course keyword arguments.</p>

<p>If we're just talking about G004, it seems like it should be pretty easy to copy the fix for EM102 with small changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought the same thing when I looked into this a few weeks ago, but the point of G004 is not simply to move the f-string out of the <code>logging</code> call, it's to avoid formatting the string at all when the log level is set high enough. See this part of the rule docs in particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using f-strings to format a logging message requires that Python eagerly format the string, even if the logging statement is never executed (e.g., if the log level is above the level of the logging statement), whereas using the extra keyword argument defers formatting until required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving the f-string out of the <code>logging</code> call like in EM102 just eagerly formats the string a little earlier.</p>
<p>Properly fixing G004 requires inspecting the contents of the f-string and converting them to the appropriate <code>logging</code> method call with printf-style arguments and placeholders, at least as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Now, if you simply want to defeat the rule, moving the f-string out of the <code>logging</code> call <em>does</em> help because the rule doesn't do any type inference on its argument. It only checks for literal f-strings and other formatting calls. But at that point you might as well <code>noqa</code> or ignore the rule entirely.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, that's a good point. The logging module eventually just calls <code>format_string % args</code> <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/ab11c097052757b79060c75dd4835c2431e752b7/Lib/logging/__init__.py#L468">here</a>, and without format specifiers, the f-string and <code>format</code> docs say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same result as if you had called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str">str()</a> on the value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That also sounds equivalent to the entry in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting">old string formatting</a> table:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>| Conversion | Meaning |Notes |
| --|--|--|
| 's'  | String (converts any Python object using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str">str()</a>). | (5) |</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, based on my reading of those docs, <code>&quot;%s other contents&quot;, arg</code> should be a suitable (unsafe) fix for <code>f&quot;{arg} other contents&quot;</code>, which might be the most common case anyway?</p>
<p>Maybe I will take another look at this! I'd really like to offer a fix here, at least for simple cases.</p>
<p>Contributions would be welcome here too, of course. I'm not sure how soon I could work on it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And <code>f&quot;{thing!r}</code> is equivalent to calling <code>repr()</code> and <code>f&quot;{thing=}&quot;</code> is equivalent to <code>&quot;thing=%s&quot;, thing</code>. There's a bunch of low hanging fruit, it's just when it gets into things like left justification, pad character, etc. does the whole string formatting thing get hairy. But starting with the default formatting and <code>!r</code> specifier would hit 95+% of the 5k+ errors I have.</p>

<p>Yes, we often use <code>!r</code> for logging user input.
I did a workaround, we actually have everything as <code>%</code>-formatter (so we actually need <code>G002</code> more than <code>G004</code>).  So I used the pyupgrade UP rules, to convert them to f-strings and <code>.format()</code>-strings. And then applied the G004 fixer / that ast-rewrite-workaround-with-many-bugs.</p>
