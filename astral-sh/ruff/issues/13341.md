# Add a rule-specific equivalent of the `--ignore-noqa` flag

_Issue opened by @Zac-HD on 2024-09-12 23:38_

Some linter rules are advisory: they warn about a code pattern which is _usually_ bad, but sometimes it's better for the code (or at least the project) if you slap on a `# noqa` and keep going.

And some _other_ linter rules are there to warn you against introducing subtle, non-local correctness issues which can lead whole teams to lose their sleep debugging something that should never have happened.  (e.g. [`ASYNC101`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8451) warning against [PEP-789](https://peps.python.org/pep-0789/))

--------------

Currently, the only way to ensure that nobody unknowingly suppresses a warning in the latter category is to maintain an entire second configuration, select the subset of rules you want, and then execute a whole independent process to check all your code again.  Credit to `ruff` that it's fast enough to do that, but I still feel it'd be a lot more elegant to accept an `ignore-noqa-rules` config option and do it in one run!

If this does get implemented, I promise I'll use this new power for good and not evil 😉

This is interesting. Do I understand it correctly that what you want is that devs can't suppress certain rules? 

I'm not sure if an `--ignore-noqa` flag is the ideal solution for that. I'm thinking of something along the lines of `fixable`/`unfixable` (I'm currently thinking about a new configuration structure where this would even be easier), where you could select the rules that can't be suppressed.

Yeah, `unsuppressable` would also be a decent name for it.

👋  I have the exact same need for [S608 - hardcoded sql expression](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/hardcoded-sql-expression/#hardcoded-sql-expression-s608) 

Is this feature somewhere in your roadmap?
