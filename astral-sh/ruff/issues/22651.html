            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ruff-ecosystem</code> should report unsafe fixes as well as regular fixes.</p>
<p>A fix was changed from safe to unsafe in a recent <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22650">PR</a>. <code>ruff-ecosystem</code> reported a reduction of hundreds of fixes across the ecosystem but did not report the corresponding increase in unsafe fixes, which was misleading to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ ecosystem check detected linter changes. (+0 -0 violations, +0 -858 fixes in 5 projects; 50 projects unchanged)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/22650#issuecomment-3763744372</p>
<p>I believe the report should either be neutral (no change in number of fixes) or explicit (-858 fixes, +858 unsafe-fixes).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds like a good idea to me! It may help to use the JSON output from Ruff and reconstruct the concise diagnostic only in the output, but that's just an idea.</p>
