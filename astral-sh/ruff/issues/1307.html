            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, I'm trying out using ruff on https://github.com/pyca/cryptography</p>
<p>If I use <code>flake8-to-rust setup.cfg</code> and then copy that into <code>pyproject.toml</code> and then I run <code>ruff .</code> it complains about many things. So I run <code>ruff --fix .</code> and it is happy, but then running <code>black src/ tests/</code> reformats things back.</p>
<p>It's my understanding that ruff is supposed to play nicely with black, but I'm not positive which side is at fault here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, hi, thanks for trying Ruff!</p>
<p>I believe that the source of disagreement comes from a difference in <code>line-length</code> settings. So Ruff is formatting imports based on a line length of 88 (its default, the same as Black's default), but Black is formatting based on <code>line-length = 79</code> from the <code>pyproject.toml</code>, and the difference is causing them to repeatedly correct each others' line breaks.</p>
<p>If you add this to the <code>pyproject.toml</code>, it should stabilize them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
line-length = 79
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that it's normal for a <code>black</code> invocation after a <code>ruff --fix .</code> to result in changes, but that running <code>ruff --fix .</code> over the changed files should <em>not</em> cause any further changes.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ahhhhhh. indeed, that was the magic piece. thank you! I'm mortified I missed that and therefore totally misdiagnosed this!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, all good! (It looks like we do preserve Flake8's <code>max-line-length</code> setting, but not the Black variant from <code>pyproject.toml</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>with that squared away, adoption was trivial: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/7920</p>
<p>Great job!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Woah, that's awesome! Thanks tons for trying it out. (I'm glad <code>flake8-to-ruff</code> worked for you too, I've been wondering whether that was worth maintaining :))</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It was a big time saver. The two bits i had to manually translate were the line-lengths, and <code>application-import-names</code> (which is from <code>flake8-import-order</code>).</p>
