            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is with ruff 0.7.4.</p>
<p><code>a</code> is recognized correctly as unused here (<code>F841 Local variable 'a' is assigned to but never used</code>):</p>
<pre><code>def foo(x):
    if x:
        a = &quot;hello&quot;
        return
</code></pre>
<p>But if you add lines below, ruff stops recognizing it as unused (<code>All checks passed!</code>):</p>
<pre><code>def foo(x):
    if x:
        a = &quot;hello&quot;
        return

    a = &quot;goodbye&quot;
    print(a)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff's &quot;is used&quot; detection isn't branch sensitive. This means, Ruff isn't aware that <code>a = &quot;hello&quot;</code> is only specific to the <code>if x:</code> branch.  All it sees is that there's a definition of <code>a</code> and that it is used somewhere inside <code>foo</code>. Thus, the variable is marked as unused.</p>
<p>This is similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14355 and other linked issues. We're working on a new analysis engine that allows us to dedect unused assignments in individual branches, but it will be a while before we can use that in F841.</p>
