<p>Hello! Thank you for the great tool.</p>
<p>I am cross-compiling ruff 0.5.3 on Ubuntu 20.04 against <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code> target using cargo-zigbuild. Other targets are fine, but for this one I got an error like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">  = note: error: duplicate symbol definition: _malloc_printf
              note: defined by /opt/zig/lib/libc/darwin/libSystem.tbd
              note: defined by /tmp/rustcmNzciC/libtikv_jemalloc_sys-d0b27344258bf71e.rlib(malloc_io.pic.o)
          

error: could not compile `ruff` (bin &quot;ruff&quot;) due to 1 previous error
</code></pre>
<p>Full trace here https://gist.github.com/serjflint/2e67f06207383c3fbddf97798dd103f8</p>
<p>Last time I was building ruff 0.3.4 (with <code>tikv-jemallocator = { version = &quot;0.5.0&quot; }</code>) about 4 months ago and it was working.My Mac OS SDK is about 1 year old.
The issue is probably related to the recent bump of tikv-jemallocator to &quot;0.6.0&quot;</p>
<p>It is not issue with ruff per se, just heads up.
I've filed issues https://github.com/tikv/jemallocator/issues/97 and https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20694</p>
