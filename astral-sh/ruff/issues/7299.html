            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PEP 701 in the lexer and parser is complete, and it's time to move on to make the necessary changes in the linter. This will mainly involve token-based rules or anything which uses the lexer in some way. The work items section contains a list of issues which needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>The lexer and parser changes cannot be merged without making the necessary changes across the linter. This is the reason that any pull requests which is made to fix any of the following issues needs to be based on the latest parser changes which as of this writing is https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7263 (branch <code>dhruv/fstring-parser-3</code>). The risk here for any external contributor are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contributor will have to base their branch on the latest parser branch (<code>dhruv/fstring-parser-3</code>)</li>
<li>If there are any changes made to the base branch, which is unlikely as of now, the downstream branches needs to be rebased as well</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above points in mind, an external contributor may choose to work on any of the mentioned issues. If so, please comment on the respective issue to be assigned. Feel free to reach out for any kind of queries either here on GitHub or on Discord.</p>
