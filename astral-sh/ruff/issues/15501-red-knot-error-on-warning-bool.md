# [red-knot]: `--error-on-warning=<bool>`

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2025-01-15 14:27_

Exit with an error code if there are any warning diagnostics. Not compatible with `--exit-zero`, defaults to `false`

We should also double check that red knot exits with 0 if there are only warning but no error diagnostics.
