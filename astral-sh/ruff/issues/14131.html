<p>B018 (useless-expression) does not detect function calls with bare tuples:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(): ...

foo(),
</code></pre>
<p>COM818 (trailing-comma-on-bare-tuple) detects this as it should, but I feel like B018 should flag this as well?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Flagging this as <code>B018</code> is only correct if <code>foo</code> has no side effects. For example, you could have</p>
<pre><code>print(&quot;test&quot;),
</code></pre>
<p>Removing the <code>print</code> would change the program behavior, which is why it&#x27;s not useless.</p>
<p>Reasoning whether a function is only be possible in the most trivial cases because standard library functions in typeshed don&#x27;t annotate if they have side effects.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why Ruff&#x27;s current behavior is correct because it would be unsafe to assume the function has no side effects.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, and a <code>print(),</code> is originally how I found this behaviour.</p>
<p>Maybe the answer is just to enable flake8-commas linting...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, hmm. It&#x27;s definitely still a useless expression (unassigned tuple), just a weirdly formatted one where the &quot;fix&quot; is to remove the <code>,</code> rather than the entire expression</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah. I think detecting unnecessary tuples could be in the spirit of the rule, but it could also be its own rule, similar to <code>useless-comparison.</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To me this seems to be working as I&#x27;d expect (but I&#x27;m happy to be overruled by the community).</p>
<p>On the one hand we have a lint rule detecting whether an expression is <em>useless</em>. I would think that if removing something useless affected the behavior of the program, then it must not have been useless to begin with. In other words, &quot;useless&quot; seems, to me, to be synonymous with &quot;can be removed with no effect&quot;. The expression in question is a tuple expression, and removing it would necessarily remove all of its members.</p>
<p>There is no expression in the AST that&#x27;s pointing to the &quot;nonexistent second member&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>~ echo &quot;f(),&quot; | python -m ast
Module(
   body=[
      Expr(
         value=Tuple(
            elts=[
               Call(
                  func=Name(id=&#x27;f&#x27;, ctx=Load()),
                  args=[],
                  keywords=[])],
            ctx=Load()))],
   type_ignores=[])
</code></pre>
<p>So there&#x27;s not really an expression you could point to and call &quot;useless&quot;, right?</p>
<p>On the other hand, as you point out, we have a lint rule detecting trailing commas on bare tuples. So I&#x27;d think it would be the job of that lint rule to fix this expression.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the idea here is that <code>print(&quot;hello&quot;),</code> would be fixed to just <code>print(&quot;hello&quot;)</code>, because the tuple expression is useless, not its content. But that might be difficult to convey in a diagnostic.</p>

<p>I should have taken a closer look at that rule. I agree, we already have a rule that covers what you want.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, ok, I&#x27;ve properly understood what I want: <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/messages/warning/expression-not-assigned.html">pylint W0106</a> which <em>does</em> warn about such things</p>
<pre><code>def foo(): ...
[1, 2, foo()]
print(&quot;foo&quot;),
</code></pre>
<pre><code>test.py:1:0: W0106: Expression &quot;[1, 2, foo()]&quot; is assigned to nothing (expression-not-assigned)
test.py:2:0: W0106: Expression &quot;(print(&#x27;foo&#x27;), )&quot; is assigned to nothing (expression-not-assigned)
</code></pre>
<p>obviously the fix is not to remove it entirely (as functions may have side effects) - it&#x27;s one of</p>
<pre><code>_ = [1, 2, foo()]  # a
foo()  # b
</code></pre>
<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need a type checker to do that (though pyright does detect the unused expression)</p>
<pre><code>  /foo/test.py:1:1 - error: Expression value is unused (reportUnusedExpression)
  /foo/test.py:2:1 - error: Expression value is unused (reportUnusedExpression)
</code></pre>
<p>in #970 this lint is listed as implemented via B018, so...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok thanks this helps me understand better!</p>
<p>My takeaway is that <code>W0106</code> is a slightly different rule that should just be implemented on its own, and would maybe suggest the fix &quot;a&quot;.</p>
<p>I still feel like &quot;useless&quot; indicates &quot;can be removed&quot; not &quot;should be modified&quot;, so I would vote to keep B018 from emitting a diagnostic for this case, but then you have <code>COM818</code> and a newly implemented <code>W0106</code> to fall back on. Does that seem ok? I&#x27;m still open to being convinced out of my pedantic interpretation of the word &quot;useless&quot;!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actual flake8-bugbear flags up this specific example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>B018: Found useless expression. Either assign it to a variable or remove it. Note that dangling commas will cause things to be interpreted as useless tuples. For example, in the statement <code>print(&quot;..&quot;),</code> is the same as <code>(print(&quot;..&quot;),)</code> which is an unassigned tuple. Simply remove the comma to clear the error.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>$ flake8 --select B test.py
test.py:1:1: B018 Found useless List expression. Consider either assigning it to a variable or removing it.
test.py:2:1: B018 Found useless Tuple expression. Consider either assigning it to a variable or removing it.
