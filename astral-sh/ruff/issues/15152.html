            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since ruff <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/invalid-pyproject-toml/">can lint pyproject.toml</a>, it could also be able to format toml files.</p>
<p>Specially with <code>uv</code> already editing/generating these files, there is likely lots of in-house knowledge to make it happen.</p>

<p>Seems right. I did try searching but github search sucks (or skill issue on my side).</p>
<p>The problem with I see with these other Issues is they ask for the moon and stars: extensible or plugin support, several languages. I am here advocating for a file format that is very relevant for the python ecosystem and possibly not much effort to implement.</p>

<p>My GitHub search is a mystery to me. I often have to click through pages even if I know that there's another issue that is exactly what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>That's fair. But I think #10738 still captures the feature you're asking for, and I see it as very likely that TOML will be one of the first languages we'll support because I agree on its importance.</p>
