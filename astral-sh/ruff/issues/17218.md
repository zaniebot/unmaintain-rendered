# Add support for flake8-datetime-import

_Issue opened by @DmytroLitvinov on 2025-04-05 08:24_

### Summary

HI there,

I like the idea of flake8 plugin called [flake8-datetime-import](https://github.com/marcgibbons/flake8-datetime-import). It is always a mess kinda in projects how its imported. The motivation and other notable links mentioned at README of repository.

One of the link is mentioned to [Adam Johnson post](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/09/12/how-i-import-pythons-datetime-module/ ) - well-known Python/Django guy who do a lot for community and he write and create a lot of useful stuff in his [blog](https://adamj.eu/) and at [GitHub](https://github.com/adamchainz)

I don't think it makes sense, because there's - [banned-import-from (ICN003)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/banned-import-from/#banned-import-from-icn003) and [unconventional-import-alias (ICN001)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unconventional-import-alias/#unconventional-import-alias-icn001)

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-import-conventions.extend-aliases]
"datetime" = "dt"
"time" = "tm"

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-import-conventions]
banned-from = ["datetime", "time"]
```

I prefer importing the needed objects from datetime explicitly (from import), because I find it easier to read:

```diff
- datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC) + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)
+ datetime.now(UTC) + timedelta(hours=1)
```

Although I hadn't considered the collisions between objects in the `time` module 🤔.

Is there a way to ban `import datetime` and instead suggest `from datetime import datetime`? I think that's the opposite of [banned-import-from (ICN003)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/banned-import-from/#banned-import-from-icn003). This could be used to shorten the reference to other effectively standard imports (eg. `Path` almost certainly refers to `pathlib.Path` and might be preferred).

After searching through our rules page for `import`, I don't think this exists, so it might be a separate rule request.
