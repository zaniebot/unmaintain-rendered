_Issue opened by @cclauss on 2023-04-17 06:18_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L26 says `Alpha`
but the URL https://beta.ruff.rs would imply `Beta`.

People are often reluctant to use pre-release (especially Alpha) software.
