# Apparent duplicate rule (`S307` and `PGH001`)

---

_Issue opened by @tjkuson on 2023-09-11 20:10_

Rules [`suspicious-eval-usage` (`S307`)](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/suspicious-eval-usage/) and [`eval` (`PGH001`)](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/eval/) seem to do the same thing. If they are, in fact, distinct, then the difference between them should probably be explained in the documentation.

I can confirm these look duplicated and have separate implementations. I'm not sure what we should do about it though.

We should remove PGH001, and add a redirect to S307 (IMO).
