            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, this rule only flags <code>int | float</code> unions as redundant. Coming from other languages, I didn&#x27;t even realize <code>int</code> was a subtype of <code>float</code>, but I learned about it because of this rule. However, I found a bug in my code where I was converting <code>False</code> to <code>0.0</code> - this was because in Python, <code>bool</code> is actually an <code>int</code>. I found that the tests for this rule very explicitly consider <code>int | bool</code> to not be a violation, however this would have prevented me from writing the bug as I did.</p>

<p>The <code>bool</code> to <code>int</code> relation is in some ways stronger than <code>int</code> to <code>float</code> since <code>isinstance()</code> only recognizes the former:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think this makes sense to me, they seem more distinct than <code>int</code> / <code>float</code> regardless of the <code>isinstance</code> behavior. I&#x27;m curious to hear more opinions though!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To me, they&#x27;re very different in <em>intended</em> usage, but surprisingly related in <em>actual</em> effect, which threw me off, especially since the rule warned about the other scenario and not this one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just stumbled into this rule, and I think the rule is wrong.</p>
<p>The PEP mentioned in the rule documentation ( <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3141/">PEP 3141</a> ) is talking about the numbers ABCs, these are, numbers.Complex, numbers.Real and numbers.Integral.</p>
<p>float is a particular class that implements numbers.Real, int is a particular class that implements. But they don&#x27;t have a relationship between them.</p>
<p>Afaik, the numerical hierarchy defined in the pep-3141 can be seen/tested using:</p>
<pre><code>import numbers

i = 1
f = 1.0

isinstance(i, int) # True
isinstance(i, float) # False

isinstance(f, int) # False
isinstance(f, float) # True

isinstance(i, numbers.Complex) # True
isinstance(i, numbers.Real) # True
isinstance(i, numbers.Integral) # True

isinstance(f, numbers.Complex) # True
isinstance(f, numbers.Real) # True
isinstance(f, numbers.Integral) # False
</code></pre>

<p>The rule isn&#x27;t wrong @maxyz, but you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s quite misleading for the docs to mention PEP 3141. The rule is premised on the fact that type checkers do not support PEP 3141 (and never will) -- the ABCs introduced by that PEP are wholly incompatible with Python&#x27;s static-typing system and impossible to annotate in a desirable way in typeshed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I never addressed @tylerlaprade&#x27;s original question here!</p>
<p>This rule is specifically targeting the very special case that the typing spec carves out for <code>int</code>, <code>float</code> and <code>complex</code> in Python&#x27;s typing system. Namely, <code>int</code> is not a subtype of <code>float</code> and <code>float</code> is not a subtype of <code>complex</code> (because <code>int</code> is not a subclass of <code>float</code> at runtime, and <code>float</code> is not a subclass of <code>complex</code>). But because the duck-type compatibility between the different classes is so strong, type checkers have a special case for these types such that when a user annotates something as <code>float</code>, <code>int</code>s should also be allwoed for that symbol. For more details, see the in-depth discussion we recently had at <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14932">astral-sh/ruff#14932</a>.</p>
<p>So we could summarise the <code>int</code>/<code>float</code>/<code>complex</code> special case as &quot;even though they&#x27;re not subclasses of each other at runtime, they should be treated as if they are in type annotations&quot;. The <code>int</code>/<code>bool</code> situation is sort-of the opposite of this, though. <code>bool</code> <em>is</em> a subclass of <code>int</code>, but this is often seen as a wart in the language that would be implemented differently if it were being designed from scratch in 2025. Even though <code>bool</code> is a subclass and subtype of <code>int</code>, many people would prefer to leave the union <code>int | bool</code> in their annotations, as <code>bool</code> <em>means</em> something quite different to <code>int</code> to a human reader.</p>
<p>Another reason why we shouldn&#x27;t extend the rule to <code>bool</code>/<code>int</code> is because it&#x27;s hard to say where we should draw the line. There are lots of classes in Python that you might not realise are subclasses of each other; there are lots of opportunities for people to accidentally write redundant unions in type annotations. For example, some beginners in the language aren&#x27;t aware that <code>types.NoneType</code> (the type of <code>None</code>) is a subclass of <code>object</code>, and therefore that <code>object | None</code> is a redundant union, since <code>None</code> is a subtype of <code>object</code>. Detecting redundant unions exhaustively without sophisticated type inference is impossible; but if we keep the rule narrowly targeted towards the <code>int</code>/<code>float</code>/<code>complex</code> special case, it&#x27;s easy to see where the line should be drawn.</p>
