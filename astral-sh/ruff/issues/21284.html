            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Zed shows code actions inline in the buffer. As Ruff provides global &quot;Fix all auto-fixable problems&quot; and &quot;Organize imports&quot; code actions, this makes the code actions button appear on every single line of code (not all at once, but whenever a line is focused, the button appears).</p>
<p>The way Zed surfaces code actions makes it necessary for them to be context-aware, and global code actions don't really fit that pattern. As I use format/autofix-on-save, these code actions are also no-ops most of the time.</p>
<p>I see that https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/settings/#codeaction provides knobs to toggle the context-aware code actions, but not the global ones. It would be good to get a knob for those, because I think the global code actions don't mesh well with format/autofix-on-save.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I replied on the issue that you opened in the zed repository.</p>
<p>With my current understanding, I'm inclined to say that this is an issue specific to Zed and should be fixed in Zed instead of requiring every LSP to special case Zed</p>
