            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As seen in the test plan of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12253, I'm creating a new <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in a nested folder and the diagnostics are being refreshed accordingly. At the end, I delete the file and it's refreshed as per the root <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p>
