            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Once we have more of the feature set completed and want to stabilize support, there are a few paths we could take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Require users who want markdown formatting on-by-default to set <code>extend-include = [&quot;**/*.md&quot;]</code> in their project config (opt-in).</li>
<li>Add a new <code>format.markdown-code-blocks = true</code> config option, similar to docstring formatting, that would automatically include <code>.md</code> files in the global default search path (opt-in). What do do if the user explicitly passes a <code>.md</code> file while the feature is disabled is tbd.</li>
<li>Turn it on by default, including <code>.md</code> in the global default search path, and allow users to set <code>exclude = [&quot;**/*.md&quot;]</code> or similar in their project config if they don&#x27;t want the feature (opt-out).</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thinking about this some more (as I was adding a new option in #22750) should the &quot;opt-in&quot; for now simply be something like recommending <code>extend-include = [&quot;**/*.md&quot;]</code> and let <code>ruff format foo.md</code> just work even without needing <code>--preview</code> or a dedicated config option?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah sorry. I didn&#x27;t see your comment here before posting on the PR.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. But using <code>include</code>/<code>exclude</code> is definitely the first thing that comes to mind when it&#x27;s about defining on which files Ruff should run. I don&#x27;t have the answer here but we should explore the different options and then decide on a design</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also don&#x27;t know, but it makes some sense to me to reuse <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code>. It does seem a bit annoying to have to <code>extend-include = [&quot;**/*.md&quot;]</code> to enable the feature though. Are we planning to make markdown formatting off by default?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main question to me was whether we add <code>*.md</code> to the global/default <code>INCLUDE</code> or <code>INCLUDE_PREVIEW</code> and use a feature flag similar to <code>docstring-code-format</code> to turn on/off actually <em>formatting</em> (or linting?) those files, or if we just support the ability to format/lint markdown files with no feature flags, and just leave it to users to add <code>*.md</code> to their <code>include</code>/<code>extend-include</code> lists themselves in order to &quot;turn it on&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since opinions were requested: I would enable this feature. Formatting code blocks is really neat and I believe something the <code>dprint</code> formatter Markdown plugin also does by offloading to its other plugins (similarly with the html/css/ts plugins).</p>
<p>Since I&#x27;m using shared configs I don&#x27;t really care if it&#x27;s opt-in/out by default. But I&#x27;d lean to say opt in until stable/confident enough, then switch in a breaking version.</p>
