            <div class="timeline-body">Issue Description
Problem
<p>The Ruff Linter documentation provides URLs for specific rules, such as <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/collapsible-if/">https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/collapsible-if/</a>. While these URLs are useful for referencing rules, they can be cumbersome to include in code comments or documentation. It would be more convenient if we could have simplified and consistent URLs for each rule, making them easier to reference.</p>
Expected Behavior
<p>It would be beneficial to have URL redirects in place, so that each rule can be referenced with a simplified URL structure, such as <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/SIM102/">https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/SIM102/</a>, where &#x27;SIM102&#x27; represents the specific rule. This would improve the usability of the documentation and streamline the process of linking to individual rules.</p>
Additional Context
<p>Developers frequently include references to specific rules in their code comments or documentation. Simplifying the URLs for these rules would enhance the overall experience of using the Ruff Linter and referring to its documentation.</p>

<p>If I&#x27;m understanding you correctly, can you expand on why is having https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/collapsible-if/ in the comment cumbersome than https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/SIM102/?</p>
<p>Additionally, we&#x27;d want to hold off until <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1774">astral-sh/ruff#1774</a> is finalized.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In fact, it&#x27;s much more of a comfort thing. It is very convenient when you know exactly how to form a reference to any rule. This is something similar to the links in Jira. At any time you put the appropriate code in the link part and you get the page you want.</p>
<p>In my project, I use something like this.</p>
<pre><code>...
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
...
ignore = [
    &quot;A003&quot;,  # https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-attribute-shadowing/
    &quot;B010&quot;,  # https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/set-attr-with-constant/
    &quot;B012&quot;,  # https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/jump-statement-in-finally/
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>With one click in IDE, I can go to the well-described page. But to get these URLs I should find each in the rule first and copy-paste it.
At the same time, simple redirection would make my life a little easier.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;A003&quot;,  # https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/A003/
</code></pre>
<p>At the same time, the main URL might be still <code>https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/builtin-attribute-shadowing/</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Rules already point to document in IDEs, for example in VSCode you can either click on it or drag-and-drop it to where you want to put the link.</p>

<p>Also, another approach could document all rules in schema with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/64233370">description</a>, so you can hover on the rule to read info and go to online docs if you want.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s because this feature is part of <code>ruff-lsp</code> but the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff">PyCharm Ruff plugin</a> (which is what I assume you&#x27;re using?) is implemented in a separate way. They&#x27;re adding support for the Language Server Protocol (LSP) which you can try using:</p>
<blockquote>
Support ruff-lsp for only PyCharm Pro/IDEA Ultimate
<p>You can enable it in <code>Preferences/Settings</code> -&gt; <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Ruff</code> -&gt; <code>Use ruff-lsp (Experimental) for PyCharm Pro/IDEA Ultimate</code></p>
<p>The lsp integration applies only below features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Errors/warnings highlighting (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_publishDiagnostics">textDocument/publishDiagnostics</a>)</li>
<li>Quick-fixes for these errors/warnings (<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction">textDocument/codeAction</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>This is experimental feature.</em></p>
