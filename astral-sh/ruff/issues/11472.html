            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is out of scope for <code>ruff</code>, but it would be awesome to have a means to auto-fix links that now redirect.
Like many repos, we at Astropy use <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#options-for-the-linkcheck-builder">Sphinx&#x27;s link checker</a> to ensure links are working. They are, but our logs are chock full of warning about link redirects. No one has the bandwidth to manually fix them all, so it would be great if a CI tool could do this automatically! Even if a ruff-based fix was implemented only for Python docstrings, it would be immensely useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Probably out of scope, since the only way to check it would be to actually lookup the link, which would be timely.</p>

<p>I think you should check out <a href="https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee">lychee</a>. It can integrate with CI as well, but I am not sure if it auto-fixes links.</p>
