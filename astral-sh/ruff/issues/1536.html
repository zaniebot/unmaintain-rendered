            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be cool to add codespell to our CI. Let me know if you want this done. (Also its a fairly simple python linter, so we could add it to ruff itself eventually, but that is probably out of scope for now).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is a linter written in python that has a mapping of common misspellings, and maps it to correct spellings of words. So it pretty much checks your code for spelling errors.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Codespell apparently doesn't support CamelCase (https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell/issues/196), so I don't think using it on a Rust codebase makes much sense given how prevalent CamelCase is in Rust.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The real benefits here are for messages to users, so that we avoid embarrassing misspellings. This means that this is a pretty small negative. However, if you have a better library to use I am all for it.</p>
