<p><code>FBT003</code> complains about a positional boolean passed to a function, but the only alternative to initialize this tuple it <code>Foo(is_bar=True, baz_count=3)</code>, which defeats the purpose of using a <code>NamedTuple</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure... To me it&#x27;s within the scope and intent of the rule. For example, <code>Foo(True, False, True, 3)</code> <em>is</em> confusing, and you should be using keyword arguments in calls like that. I personally wouldn&#x27;t activate this rule, since it&#x27;s quite strict, but if it&#x27;s enabled, I don&#x27;t know that these constructors should be special-cased.</p>

<p>Why do you say it defeats the purpose of a namedtuple? I think I might have a different idea to you about what the purpose of a namedtuple is 😃</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My team was previously using unnamed tuples, so I suggested <code>NamedTuple</code> as an upgrade that would still be compatible with all legacy code, but it created friction for them since they had to modify every place one was created rather than just find-and-replace <code>(a, b, c)</code> -&gt; <code>Foo(a, b, c)</code>.</p>
<p>That being said, I do see both points of view. It&#x27;s nice to see what each argument represents, although it can feel verbose for tiny tuples that only have one boolean. I encouraged them to do the extra step of adding <code>a=</code>, <code>b=</code>, and <code>c=</code> to their tuples, which they begrudgingly did since I was blocking the PR with raw tuples, and Ruff was blocking it with named tuples with positional arguments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I agree it could smooth things over during an upgrade, I don&#x27;t think this makes sense for the spirit of the rule.</p>
