<p>After updating my pre-commit hook from 0.0.272 to 0.0.273, running <code>ruff</code> via pre-commit fails with a panic.  Running ruff manually at the same version works without issue.  There&#x27;s no pyproject, and my .ruff.toml was unchanged. Running just the ruff hook also works find. I&#x27;ve removed <code>~/.cache/pre-commit</code> to get a fresh copy, which still fails.</p>
<p>After setting RUST_BACKTRACE=1, the log is as below:</p>
<pre><code>ruff.....................................................................Failed
- hook id: ruff
- exit code: 101
