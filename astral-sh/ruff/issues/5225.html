Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>After updating my pre-commit hook from 0.0.272 to 0.0.273, running <code>ruff</code> via pre-commit fails with a panic.  Running ruff manually at the same version works without issue.  There's no pyproject, and my .ruff.toml was unchanged. Running just the ruff hook also works find. I've removed <code>~/.cache/pre-commit</code> to get a fresh copy, which still fails.</p>
<p>After setting RUST_BACKTRACE=1, the log is as below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-log">ruff.....................................................................Failed
