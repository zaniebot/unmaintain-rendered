# Disable ruff for block of code

---

_Issue opened by @mitasov-ra on 2025-05-29 09:51_

What I want:

```python
def my_function():
    # ruff.format-disable

    # some non-standard lines of code

    # ruff.format-enable

    # back to formatted code
```

Every linter should have this feature.

The formatter supports this. You can use `fmt: off` and `fmt: on` (see https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#format-suppression)

For the linter, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3711

Thanks!

But my request not only about formatter, but for all ruff modules.

For example:

```
# ruff.flake8 off / disable flake8 checks
# E501 off / disable this particular check

# and so on
```

Sorry for unclear fist message

Here I see ruff supports disabling rules per file, but lacks disabling per block of code.
