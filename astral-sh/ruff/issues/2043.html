            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to be able to add human-readable error messages as well as error codes when running <code>ruff</code> with <code>--add-noqa</code>.</p>
<p>For example, instead of appending <code># noqa: E722</code> to the end of offending lines, append <code># noqa: E722 Do not use bare `except`</code> (or <code># noqa - E722 Do not use bare `except`</code> to ensure compatibility with <a href="https://github.com/plinss/flake8-noqa">flake8-noqa</a> and #850).</p>
<p>Perhaps this could be a separate flag? (e.g., <code>--add-noqa-verbose</code>) This would have the added benefit of making it easy to remove error messages by simply running <code>--add-noqa</code> again.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding so quickly! I saw that issue, and I guess I should&#x27;ve addressed it explicitly. I&#x27;m not sure the kebab-cased naming scheme is sufficient for what I had in mind. I&#x27;d really appreciate something more in line with the descriptive error messages that are normally printed to the terminal, particularly so that other contributors unfamiliar with even the kebab-cased names immediately know what they need to do to fix the issue without running to Google.</p>
<p>I have some free time tonight so I&#x27;d be happy to take a swing at implementing this feature myself if you agree that it&#x27;s worth including.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah sorry, I didn&#x27;t read the issue nearly closely enough, that&#x27;s my fault.</p>
<p>I see what you&#x27;re saying. How would it work in cases like <code># noqa: E501, F841, ...</code>?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Good question! Off the top of my head, I suppose such cases could be handled by providing explanations on separate lines:</p>
<pre><code>unused_string = &quot;This line is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long!&quot; # noqa: E501, F841, ...
# E501 - Line too long (81 &gt; 79 characters)
# F841 - Local variable `unused_string` is assigned to but never used
# ... - ...
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, as far as default behavior goes, this might even make more sense given that it ensures compatibility with <a href="https://github.com/plinss/flake8-noqa">flake8-noqa</a> and <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/850">charliermarsh/ruff#850</a>.</p>

<p>I honestly think that this is not a good idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>improvements to the messages of ruff will not make it into your comments</li>
<li>the comments will get out of date when the code changes e.g. <code>Local variable `unused_string`</code> is no longer accurate when the name of the variable changes</li>
</ul>

<p>I think you should rather instruct your contributors to use <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-lsp">ruff-lsp</a>, which since <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-lsp/pull/7">charliermarsh/ruff-lsp#7</a> shows the error message when hovering over a rule code in a noqa comment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do appreciate the intent here, and I understand why this would be useful. But I think this is probably difficult to implement and maintain. Not impossible, but my gut is that the complexity wouldn&#x27;t outweigh the benefit.</p>
<p>For example: we&#x27;d need to have the ability to recognize those explanations, parse them, and replace them when running with <code>--add-noqa</code>, otherwise they&#x27;d risk getting out of sync (and/or being added multiple times -- the command has to be idempotent). We may also need a way to flag that they&#x27;re out-of-sync outside of <code>--add-noqa</code>.</p>
