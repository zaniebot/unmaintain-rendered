            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,
could you please support addressing warnings by rule names instead of rule codes?
That would make my code more readable for humans.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> For example I would like to use</p>
<p><code># noqa: some-rule-name</code></p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p><code># noqa: XY123</code></p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Similarly, in the configuration file, I would prefer names over codes, too:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
target-version = &quot;py312&quot;
select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
ignore = [
    &quot;some-rule-name&quot;,  
]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Please also include rule names in the output of ruff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. This is something we will consider supporting in the future, but it's not yet decided if as part of <code>now</code> or as a ruff-specific suppression comment, e.g., <code>ruff: ignore[name].</code></p>
<p>We plan on tackling this as part of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1773</p>
