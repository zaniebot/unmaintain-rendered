            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just thought about a potential rule that would be triggered when a function inside a function doesn't have a specific (configurable) prefix, eg:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_outer_func():
    # maybe some code maybe not
    def idk():  # error: function inside function should have the `inner_` prefix
        pass
    # maybe some code again maybe not
    idk()
    # maybe some code again again maybe not
</code></pre>
<p>Would make it more identifiable that the called <code>idk</code> is (re)defined inside the function and avoid having to look for it elsewhere.</p>
<p>What do you think ?</p>
