            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's pretty rare for people to <em>actually intend</em> to do bitwise-or with constants; making this a lint error when the &quot;base&quot; is either 2 or 10 would likely save quite a few people some frustrating debugging (or silent errors)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this rule proposal.</p>
<p>I think we have to wait before #1774 is complete to add this rule because it is a &quot;restriction&quot; lint and somewhat opinionated.</p>
