# Expand Ruff's default exclusions

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-07-04 18:57_

Like Black, I'd like to add:

- `.vscode`
- `.ipynb_checkpoints`
- `.pytest_cache`

Unlike Black, I'd also like to add `.pyenv`.

Anyone for or against this?

What's the motivation behind `.pyenv`? Isn't that probably always going to be in the home directory unlike others which could be in a project directory?

It's relevant in the context of VS Code: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/5509

Makes sense then! No objections from my side 👍
