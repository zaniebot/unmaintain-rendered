<p>You&#x27;re right, we need to consider the control flow in this case. Marking as a bug, sorry for the disruption.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, heh, I oversimplified 😉 . The exact code in question is <a href="https://github.com/hail-is/hail/blob/main/hail/python/hailtop/aiotools/fs/copier.py#L504-L530">this</a>.</p>
<p>The code is a bit opaque and could probably be written better but I think I see the issue. Ruff cannot prove that we always <code>asyncio.wait</code> or <code>await</code> the task because of a correlated if. To simplify, the following code always awaits the task but ruff can&#x27;t prove that to itself. It even fails if the second if is <code>if x:</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import asyncio

async def foo(x: bool):
    if x:
        t = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(1))
    else:
        t = None
    try:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # in reality: do some concurrent work
    finally:
        if t:
            await t

</code></pre>
<p>OK! So, I now do not believe this is a bug in ruff. It&#x27;s just inherent to ruff&#x27;s incompleteness.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> think there is a bug in the error message. Can we change it to:</p>
<pre><code>RUF006 Cannot prove result of `asyncio.create_task` is awaited in all program traces.
</code></pre>
<p>That message would&#x27;ve given me enough clew to solve this on my own without bothering you :).</p>
<p>If you like the message: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9144">astral-sh/ruff#9144</a>; but I realize it violates the imperative phrasing you prefer in these messages.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm. Getting sucked into your codebase a bit! It seems like this is not the intention of <code>bindings.is_used()</code>, right? That ought to return true (i.e. references is non-empty) because the <em>binding</em> is, syntactically, referenced.</p>
<p>I can imagine a more sophisticated notion of &quot;usage&quot; that ties an allocation site to a use-site , but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the intention of Binding.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the thorough follow-up :)</p>
<p>Ahh I see. So, it works if you remove the <code>else</code>: https://play.ruff.rs/00a2d9af-223c-4934-8be5-02860e66898e. The issue is that we don&#x27;t do any sophisticated branch analysis yet, so when we see <code>t = None</code>, it shadows the <code>t = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(1))</code> binding, and so the <code>t = asyncio.create_task(asyncio.sleep(1))</code> binding appears to have no usages. We can solve this by looking ahead to see if any <em>shadowed</em> bindings are used, since those are very likely to be fine usages.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting! Hmm. I’ve not studied Python semantics closely but my instinct is that assignment in both branches of an if isn’t shadowing a la:</p>
<pre><code>x = asyncio.create_task(…)
x = 5
</code></pre>
<p>I think of assignment in an if as suggesting that a “binding” can have multiple definition sites just as it can have multiple references. If you accept that, then this lint rule needs to evaluate: if at least one definition site is a task, does there exist at least one reference.</p>
<p>That seems to me different from the above example. I can imagine a very similar lint that ensures objects with a close method have their close method called. I can definitely imagine myself inadvertently shadowing it in the manner above and wanting that to be linted!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s correct -- it&#x27;s not <em>actually</em> shadowing, but our semantic model doesn&#x27;t take branching into account in a meaningful way, so it treats the code <em>as if</em> the <code>else</code> is shadowing the assignment in the <code>if</code>.</p>
