            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The documentation for Ruff rules should mention the required minimal python version to be enabled, if there is one.</p>
<p>I was scratching my head for a bit about why suddenly after adding <code>uv</code> to my project I started getting <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/zip-without-explicit-strict/">B905</a> warnings which weren't there before, until i found the answer in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4102#issuecomment-1851048379">this comment</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This could still be good to document explicitly, but we're also working on better default Python version handling (#16418). I was coincidentally working on a draft of it today! (#17529)</p>
<p>The current approach should suppress these version-dependent errors if you haven't set your <code>target-version</code> (or <code>requires-python</code>) explicitly.</p>
