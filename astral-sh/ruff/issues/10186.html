            <div class="timeline-body"><p>while I do appreciate ruff following black's lead, and I do think that this default not the biggest annoyance in the world,  there are many eyes that are used to seeing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Foo:
   ...
</code></pre>
<p>rather than:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Foo: ...
</code></pre>
<p>The latter seems somehow broken to me.  I would like a configuration setting for this and all things that inline code, which at least in much of the code I've seen isn't commonly done.</p>
<p>Hopefully we can use this issue to gauge sentiment on this new formatting style as introduced in:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8357</p>
