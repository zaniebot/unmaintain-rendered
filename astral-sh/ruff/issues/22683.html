<p>Playground link: https://play.ruff.rs/e8e979ae-a4d2-49a1-b883-7242fc0a2a6c</p>
<pre><code>from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class TextEdit:
    start_line: int
    start_line: int
</code></pre>
<p>I have Python dataclass with duplicated class field. It didn't trigger any ruff rule. The closes rule I have found is PIE794 which reports duplicate class fields (with values assigned).</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ruff v0.14.13</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I took a look at PIE794 and I'm getting the impression that skipping annotated assignments without a value is unintentional. The rule tries to filter out self-referential assignments but that logic also filters out any annotated assignments without a value.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes - and like I mentioned, the rule description would suggest that it shouldn't be skipped in this case.
Potentially we could catch it before _ =&gt; continue:</p>
<pre><code>    Stmt::AnnAssign(ast::StmtAnnAssign { value: None, .. }) =&gt; {
    }
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't know Rust.</p>
