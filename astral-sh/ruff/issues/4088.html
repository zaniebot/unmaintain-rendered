Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I am not sure which release introduced <code>RUF009</code>, but since <code>ruff==0.0.262</code> it triggers additional detections in my codebase. I believe the rule is currently undocumented, i.e. is not listed on https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#ruff-specific-rules-ruf, which makes it hard to determine whether the detections are false positives or not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I build docs locally and there is a description of rules in such docs. So it looks like a bug in the docs deployment process. Same like in #4089</p>
