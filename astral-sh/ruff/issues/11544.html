            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! Unfortunately we no longer support <code>flake8-to-ruff</code> -- we removed references to it from our own docs and removed it from Ruff itself. I&#x27;ll try to add a note to <code>flake8-to-ruff</code> itself; that may require me to release, in which case, we&#x27;ll try to fix it too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, that makes sense. I was wondering where it was in the code.</p>
<p>The warning is really minor and probably isn&#x27;t worth making a code change over, since you&#x27;re a busy guy and resurfacing old code is annoying. My $0.02 is, a more important change to the package, if you want to update the README would just be a note at the top of the README something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; **⚠️ Warning: `flake8-to-ruff` is no longer supported.** The last Ruff version supported by flake8-to-ruff was v0.0.233. You may experience warnings or breakage using this tool for later versions of Ruff.
</code></pre>
<p>And this captures not only the aforementioned warning but all other warnings.</p>
<p>v0.0.233 was released Jan 24, 2023: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.233 which is the release of the PyPI project https://pypi.org/project/flake8-to-ruff/, hence why I am using that version. Although you may have a better idea of what version is better to say is supported.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Appreciate it! 👍 Yeah I think I need to do a release to add that warning anyway, so was considering just fixing it while I was going through the effort.</p>
