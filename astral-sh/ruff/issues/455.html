            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could already support <code>ruff format</code> or <code>ruff fmt</code> or <code>ruff rtrip</code> (in Astor parlance). Soon there will be more tools and sub-commands, e.g., #423.</p>
<p>A few open questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we want to move the core linting functionality to <code>ruff check</code>? Or leave it as a &quot;default&quot; sub-command? (I think the latter can cause a variety of ambiguities but it'd be nice to do something backwards compatible here.)</li>
<li>Do we want to expose a dedicated <code>ruff fix</code> command in lieu of or in addition to <code>--fix</code>? Perhaps <code>ruff fix</code> applies fixes recursively.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Taking this a smidge further: one distinction I introduced to <a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants">Pants</a> is the distinction between <code>fmt</code> and <code>fix</code>. The former is safe to do on save, the latter isn't. The razor is something like removing imports. Not safe to do on save (as I'm still typing code and I save very often) but is safe to do in <code>fix</code>, which I'll issue manually.</p>
<p>We also have <code>fix</code> imply <code>fmt</code>, so users could decide which behavior they care about.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@thejcannon Thanks, that's a very interesting idea! I think the relevant issue is <em>rule applicability</em> (#1997).</p>
