You can trigger the command pallete using either right click &rarr; <i>Command Palette</i> or <kbd>F1</kbd>. From there, search for <i>Change Tab Display Size</i>.

If you want to change the line width used by the formatter, click on the gear icon to the left, and then change the JSON setting file.
