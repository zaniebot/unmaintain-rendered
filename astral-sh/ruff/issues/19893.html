            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>PEP8 quite clearly states <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names">here</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.</p>
<p>Variable names follow the same convention as function names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It also states that these same conventions should be followed for <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#global-variable-names">global variables</a> and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#method-names-and-instance-variables">instance variables</a>. In other words, variable names should be <code>snake_case</code> in all contexts.</p>
<p>However, even with <code>ALL</code> rules enabled, Ruff does not complain about the use of <code>CapWords</code> in global variable names, or <code>CapWords</code> or <code>mixedCase</code> in instance variable names. See <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/c45e5b1d-ad7f-4c60-b731-b4ddc9fa838d">this playground</a> for a demonstration of this.</p>
<p><strong>Ruff should have a rule to enforce variable names to be in <code>snake_case</code> in all contexts.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As an aside, I believe the relevant section of PEP8 may have been misunderstood only to enforce <code>snake_case</code> for variables defined inside function scopes, hence rule <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-lowercase-variable-in-function/">N806</a>. As noted in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71340765/logic-behind-why-python-variables-should-be-lowercase-in-functions-but-outside-f">this StackOverflow post</a>, PEP8 in fact makes no distinction between variables defined inside function scopes or elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>ruff 0.12.2 (9bee8376a 2025-07-03)
Also ruff 0.12.8 in the playground.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! This seems to be consistent with the upstream <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pep8-naming">pep8-naming</a>, which also doesn't flag anything in the playground example, but I didn't find any reasoning there for why the global variables and instance attributes are excluded.</p>
<p>I think the global exclusion <em>might</em> be to avoid false positives if it happens to be a class. Changing <code>ThisShouldBeFlagged</code> to <code>thisShouldBeFlagged</code> does get flagged by N816. Not sure about the attributes, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>#2964 only seems to be for constants, as far as I can tell in the discussion. I have had a reasonably good rummage and can't find anything covering variables.</p>
