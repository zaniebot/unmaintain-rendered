# Invalid JSON schema on ruff isort settings

---

_Issue opened by @ddahan on 2023-05-04 09:42_

Is there any reason I get this warning in my `pyproject.toml` file, using VS Code?
It seems it's related to the corresponding JSON Schema.

*Here are below the textual code and error (for SEO, accessibility, copy pasting, etc.)*

Code:
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 90
target-version = "py311"
exclude = ["migrations", "__pycache__"]
per-file-ignores = {}

[tool.ruff.mccabe]
max-complexity = 10 # Unlike Flake8, default to a complexity level of 10

[tool.ruff.isort]
known-first-party = ["common", "boilerplate", "simplevent"]
section-order = [
    "future",
    "standard-library",
    "third-party",
    "django",
    "first-party",
    "local-folder",
]
[tool.ruff.isort.sections]
"django" = ["django"]
```

Error:
```
{"known-first-party":["common","boilerplate","simplevent"],"section-order":["future","standard-library","third-party","django","first-party","local-folder"],"sections":{"django":["django"]}} is not valid under any of the given schemas
```

Ruff settings: default
Ruff version: 0.0.264

I think the issue here is that we need to update the JSON schema manually in the Schema Store, which is a separate GitHub repo, so from time to time the VS Code validation gets out-of-sync with the true settings schema. I can update it today.
