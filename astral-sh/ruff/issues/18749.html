            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>currently, the error messages for a report don't show, or link to the documentation at all, and can end up being extremely mysterious:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you mean something like this? Here, the <code>T201</code> at the end of the diagnostic message is a link to the documentation page of <code>T201</code>. This is sent in the diagnostic payload to the client.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting to display the link to the documentation in the hover of <code>noqa</code> code instead or in addition to the documentation itself?</p>

<p>I don't think we should do that. It would make the diagnostic very verbose and users will strugle to see what the error is. Especially because the rule documentation uses headers and such that will be more prominent than the rror itself. It's very important to keep diagnostics concise.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I understand that. I still think it's distracting from what's most important, the diagnostic message (in the hover) if you end up with this large blob of documentation next it</p>
