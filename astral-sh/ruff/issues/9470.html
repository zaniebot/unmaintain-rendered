            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had difficulty deciding on a suitable name when opening a pull request recently. I couldn't find any guidance on naming PRs in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> despite seeing some of them be renamed before merging (e.g., #9166, #9174, #8995, #8036).</p>
<p>I think adding some naming guidelines could be helpful for both contributors and maintainers. Just to share my experience, I spent around 10 minutes going through recently merged PRs trying to perfect the name of mine. 😄</p>
