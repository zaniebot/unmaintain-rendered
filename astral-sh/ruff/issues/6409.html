Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, author of <code>flake8-tkinter</code> here!</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't help implementing this, but I would love to see it in Ruff 😍
I have a few projects where we use both Ruff for its speed and flake8 because I need the extra tkinter-related checks. It may come in handy for other projects as well.</p>
<p>To help prevent false-positives, <code>flake8-tkinter</code> checks for tkinter imports and only runs if there are any. There are currently no known false positives, however there are important checks missing for well-known but common mistakes and best practices.</p>
