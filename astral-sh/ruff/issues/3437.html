            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a feature request to implement the following lint from the <code>flake8-tidy-imports</code> package:
https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-tidy-imports#i250-unnecessary-import-alias</p>
<p>Apparently, it is also an <code>isort</code> rule:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh great, that was indeed what I was looking for! Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Still, I think this raises another question, which is: what to do about rules that are implemented by multiple sources? I'd argue that by enabling the <code>TID</code> lints, I should expect these rules to be enabled.</p>
<p>In any case, I have what I need for now. I'll close this issue - the point I raised above could get its own separate issue if you feel it's merited.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Attaching this to #2186, where we're tracking these kinds of known aliases. I agree that enabling <code>TID</code> should give you this rule, and internally we actually <em>do</em> support rule aliasing, we just haven't figured out all of the details -- there are some tricky cases which make the &quot;right&quot; behavior unclear.</p>
