This is interesting. 

The reason Ruff expands this is because of the trailing `pyright` comment that expands the outer group, in this case the comprehension. Currently, the only way to keep the comprehension on one line is to move the comment after the `]`

```python
def f():
    return [ tuple(to_translation(blender_drone)) for blender_drone in blender_drones ]  # pyright: ignore
```

We're considering this consistent with our rules for comment placement. Will try to make this clearer in the docs when we outline our comment handling scheme.
