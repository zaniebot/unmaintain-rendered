Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi! 👋</p>
<p>The UP007 rule is not catching the scenarios where a type alias is defined without the <code>TypeAlias</code> annotation, which is likely to happen when upgrading from py39 to py310.</p>
<h4>test.py</h4>
<p>Minimal code snipped that reproduces the bug:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Literal, Optional, TypeAlias, Union

YesNo = Literal[&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;]
OptionalYesNo = Optional[YesNo]
OptionalBlankYesNo = Union[OptionalYesNo, Literal[&quot;&quot;]]
OptionalYesNoAlias: TypeAlias = Optional[YesNo]
OptionalBlankYesNoAlias: TypeAlias = Union[OptionalYesNo, Literal[&quot;&quot;]]
</code></pre>
<h4>Ruff output</h4>
<p>The command I've invoked: <code>ruff --isolated --select UP --target-version py310 test.py</code></p>
<pre><code>test.py:6:33: UP007 [*] Use `X | Y` for type annotations
test.py:7:38: UP007 [*] Use `X | Y` for type annotations
Found 2 errors.
[*] 2 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
</code></pre>
<p>I was expecting UP007 to have reported lines 4 and 5 too. When using <code>--fix</code> I was expecting the fixed code to be:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Literal, TypeAlias

YesNo = Literal[&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;]
OptionalYesNo = YesNo | None
OptionalBlankYesNo = OptionalYesNo | Literal[&quot;&quot;]
OptionalYesNoAlias: TypeAlias = YesNo | None
OptionalBlankYesNoAlias: TypeAlias = OptionalYesNo | Literal[&quot;&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h4>ruff --version</h4>
<pre><code>ruff 0.0.262
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm yeah, I was confused too here, but looking back at the code, I think this is by design... We have to be somewhat careful about transforming runtime unions as those transformations can lead to subtle bugs. This was one example: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/3215. It also came up here: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/2981.</p>
<p>I need to see whether this is safe to do in more contexts. We could also consider flagging those usages even if we don't autofix them.</p>
<p>(We explicitly special-case the RHS of an assignment annotated with <code>TypeAlias</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fair enough. I cannot even start to wonder all the possible edge cases were transforming type aliases can lead to bugs after looking at the issues you've mentioned.</p>
<p>Sorry, I should have researched more on past issues before opening this one.</p>
<p>Unless you still want to consider researching on possible safe scenarios, this issue can be closed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI I didn't check pyupgrade's behavior before opening this issue and doing <code>pyupgrade --py310-plus test.py</code> actually does not affect the file, not even lines 6 and 7. (which is kind of plot twist to the original issue I've reported)  :- )</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Haha yeah, I think we take slightly more liberties when <code>TypeAlias</code> is added explicitly. I'm going to close for now, though I would like to revisit this at some point.</p>
