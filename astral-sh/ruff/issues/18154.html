            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Introduce a new linting rule in Ruff that warns when floating point numbers are compared using equality (==) or inequality (!=) operators. This aligns with <a href="https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/RSPEC-1244/">SonarSource Rule RSPEC-1244</a>, which highlights the unreliability of such comparisons due to the imprecision inherent in floating point arithmetic.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong></p>
<p>Comparing floating point numbers directly for equality can lead to unexpected behavior because of rounding errors and representation issues. This is particularly problematic in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning applications where floating point operations are prevalent. Implementing this rule in Ruff would help developers identify and rectify potential bugs early in the development process.</p>
