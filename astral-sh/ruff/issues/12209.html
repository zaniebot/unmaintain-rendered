            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given these files:</p>
<pre><code># main.py
from typing import override
from base import B

foo = override

class C(B):
    @foo
    def method(self): pass

# base.py
class B: pass

# typing.py
def override(func):
    return func
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>cargo run --bin red_knot path/to/that/dir/main.py</code> correctly gives a bad-override diagnostic.</p>
<p>If we remove the <code>@foo</code> line in <code>main.py</code> and re-run the CLI from start, it correctly does not give a diagnostic.</p>
<p>But in either case if we add or remove the <code>@foo</code> line while the CLI is still running, it appears to re-execute some queries, but it fails to correctly account for the change (the diagnostic remains present or absent as it was on the first run, disregarding the change.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From the traces after the file change, it looks like it's just not recognizing the file has been modified at all; there are some <code>file_system</code> queries but no semantic index of <code>main.py</code> or anything else.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like this is a path normalization issue. Invalidation works correctly if I run <code>cargo run --bin red_knot /absolute/path/to/the/dir/main.py</code>, but fails if I run <code>cargo run --bin red_knot ../path/to/the/dir/main.py</code>.</p>
