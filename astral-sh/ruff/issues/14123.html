            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like <code>PYI021</code> to provide an autofix (even an &quot;unsafe&quot; one is fine by me) to easily remove docstrings that may be generated by other tools. For example, https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/tree/main/stubs/sympy-stubs#remove-doc-comments has a custom script to remove docstrings that could be replaced by Ruff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm leaning towards making this fix unsafe by default, just because it's fairly destructive and the docstring could have contained meaningful text.</p>
