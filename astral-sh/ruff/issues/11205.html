            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PLR0912 is not equivalent to pylint. The following function is accepted by pylint but rejected by ruff:</p>
<pre><code>def capital(country):
    if country == &quot;Australia&quot;:
        return &quot;Canberra&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Brazil&quot;:
        return &quot;Brasilia&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Canada&quot;:
        return &quot;Ottawa&quot;
    elif country == &quot;England&quot;:
        return &quot;London&quot;
    elif country == &quot;France&quot;:
        return &quot;Paris&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Germany&quot;:
        return &quot;Berlin&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Poland&quot;:
        return &quot;Warsaw&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Romania&quot;:
        return &quot;Bucharest&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Spain&quot;:
        return &quot;Madrid&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Thailand&quot;:
        return &quot;Bangkok&quot;
    elif country == &quot;Turkey&quot;:
        return &quot;Ankara&quot;
    try:
        return None
    except:
        return &quot;Some&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Pylint only detects 12 branches, while ruff counts 13. Is this a bug or a feature? If the latter, it should probably be documented. I can also imagine a setting, enabling/disabling this behavior</p>

<p>To me, counting <code>except</code> as its own branch does make sense. Because the except might or might not be executed. So the try block has two possible exit branches.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t believe that this divergence was intentional, pylint does some odd things, I&#x27;d be inclined to agree with @MichaReiser that is <em>is</em> its own branch or brances, but I guess the question to me is whether we should remain faithful to pylint&#x27;s implementation which looks like:</p>
<pre><code>    def visit_try(self, node: nodes.Try) -&gt; None:
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Increments the branches counter.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        branches = len(node.handlers)
        if node.orelse:
            branches += 1
        if node.finalbody:
            branches += 1
        self._inc_branch(node, branches)
        self._inc_all_stmts(branches)
</code></pre>
<p>or if we should go with our own interpretation. Looking at the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.Try">AST</a> I can&#x27;t tell if this was oversight or if the intention was to consider exceptions differently?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like the difference is whether the try <em>body</em> counts as a branch? I&#x27;d say it should, probably. Although it&#x27;s perhaps strange that <code>finally</code> counts as a branch, since it always runs? Ultimately, though, the rule is trying to capture some measure of complexity, and both the <code>try</code> body and the <code>finally</code> contribute to complexity in a way...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d be fine to remove the body from the count though. It&#x27;s a bit more consistent with Pylint and is pretty marginal either way.</p>
