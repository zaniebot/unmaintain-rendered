Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p><code>flake8</code> has two rules <a href="https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html"><code>W503</code></a> and <a href="https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W504.html"><code>W504</code></a> that don't seem to be in <code>ruff==0.0.263</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/494 mentions that <code>W503</code> shouldn't exist</li>
<li>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73568036/flake8-line-break-before-binary-operator-how-to-fix-it discusses <code>W503</code> and <code>W504</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts on <code>ruff</code> implementing <code>W504</code> with autofix?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we're unlikely to implement W503 and W504, since we're likely not going to implement the pycodestyle rules that are ignored-by-default (due to being non-unanimously accepted, and non-violations of PEP8, per the <a href="https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes">pycodestyle docs</a>).</p>
<p>W503 is a little more problematic, since it conflicts with Black. W504 <em>might not</em> conflict with Black, but I'm still hesitant to support it given that it's disabled-by-default in pycodestyle and Flake8.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh sure, this conclusion is fine with me, thanks!  I realize I have been making a lot of issues here, but it's okay to close them.</p>
<p>For me to remove <code>flake8</code>, I want to make sure the rule coverage is the same.  With <code>W504</code> dispatched (per this issue), the last outstanding items are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>doctests = True</code>: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/3542</li>
<li><code>flake8-requirements</code>: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/4100</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh I'd like to propose this be re-opened. Black does take the stance of W504 against line breaks after binary operators, which also aligns with the PEP-8 recommendation.</p>
<p>To keep my code in check with PEP-8, I have to use ruff with <code>flake8 --select=W504</code>. It would certainly be nice to have this encapsulated in ruff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, this would also bring Ruff autofixes closer to parity with autopep8, even if ignored/disabled by default https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9057#discussioncomment-7850584</p>

<p><code>W503</code>/<code>W504</code> would not be the only opinionated option in Ruff. E.g. we have <code>D203</code>/<code>D212</code> and their counterparts, we have some <code>B9</code> options (which are disabled by default in the original flake8-bugbear), entire flake8-bandit is highly opinionated, we have <code>tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes.inline-quotes</code> at the end:))</p>
<p>Of course, running <code>flake8 --select=W504</code> is easy (I use flake8 because of <code>pydoclint</code> anyway), but, frankly, I was surprised.</p>
