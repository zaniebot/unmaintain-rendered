Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p><code>RUF017</code> is great at preventing you from shooting yourself in the foot by excessively and unnecessarily concatting elements in a list. However, one other very common pattern that would benefit from a similar treatment are the following code snippits.</p>
<h2>set union</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_union = functools.reduce(operator.or, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<p>should probably become</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_union = functools.reduce(operator.ior, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<h2>dict extension</h2>
<p>This also hold in python <code>&gt;= 3.9</code> with dictionaries</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dict_extended = functools.reduce(operator.or, seq_of_dicts, {})
</code></pre>
<p>should become</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dict_extended = functools.reduce(operator.ior, seq_of_dicts, {})
</code></pre>
<h1>set and</h1>
<p>One final useful case that should be covered is intersection operators for sets as well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_intersect = functools.reduce(operator.and, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<p>should become</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_intersect = functools.reduce(operator.iand, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<h1>set difference</h1>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_difference = functools.reduce(operator.sub, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<p>should become</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_difference = functools.reduce(operator.isub, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<h1>symmetric difference</h1>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_symmetric_difference = functools.reduce(operator.xor, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<p>should become</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">set_symmetric_difference = functools.reduce(operator.ixor, seq_of_sets, set())
</code></pre>
<p>it's unclear if you want to keep the functools reduce syntax in general. Other alternatives are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># update versions are faster, but not really necessary when doing it on an empty set.
set().union(*seq_sets) 
set().update(*seq_sets) # faster than above
set().intersection(*seq_sets) 
set().intersection_update(*seq_sets) # faster than above
set().difference(*seq_sets) 
set().difference_update(*seq_sets) # faster than above
# set().symmetric_difference_update(*seq_sets) # does not exist surprisingly according to python docs...
</code></pre>
<p>Regardless, operator.or, operator.and etc is wasteful as it copies the set quite a bit during its reduction. It's not quite as bad as the quadratic, but it is leaving performance on the table.</p>
