# Parser drops the `not` token during comparison expression parsing

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-04-21 14:51_

For example:
```python
not a in b not c
```

Here, the second `not` token is being dropped during the comparison expression parsing.

The reason is that the current token in the loop is being bumped without checking if the next token is `in` (making it `not in`).
