# Add PR title guidelines to `CONTRIBUTING.md`

---

_Issue opened by @trag1c on 2024-01-11 15:37_

I had difficulty deciding on a suitable name when opening a pull request recently. I couldn't find any guidance on naming PRs in `CONTRIBUTING.md` despite seeing some of them be renamed before merging (e.g., #9166, #9174, #8995, #8036).

I think adding some naming guidelines could be helpful for both contributors and maintainers. Just to share my experience, I spent around 10 minutes going through recently merged PRs trying to perfect the name of mine. 😄

Hah, yeah, this would be great. I end up doing the names either before merging or when creating the changelog.
