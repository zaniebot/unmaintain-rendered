# Add auto-fix for ARG

---

_Issue opened by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-03-15 12:40_

```python
def a(b):
    pass
```
could be auto-fixed like this
```python
def a(_b):
   pass
```
This is similar to the `B007` auto-fix.

Not sure this is safe unless the argument is positional only. This could be called as `a(b=1)`, so autofixing as above, even if unused in the definition, could break at the call sites.

Yeah I think this is too risky. It also may "mask" the error in some cases where the correct fix is too remove the argument entirely.
