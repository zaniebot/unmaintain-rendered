            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, I find this behavior strange in the formatter, and I think this should be fixed.</p>
<p>Tested on <strong>ruff 0.5.1</strong>.</p>
<h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Activate any environment where ruff is installed</li>
<li>Create a new python file and paste this content into it:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-py">def test_1():
    return do_stuff(100, &quot;some quite long string&quot;)


def test_2():
    return do_stuff(
        100,
        &quot;some quite long string&quot;,
    )


def test_3():
    raise SomeCustomError(100, &quot;some quite long string&quot;)


def test_4():
    raise SomeCustomError(
        100,
        &quot;some quite long string&quot;,
    )

</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>run <code>ruff format test_formatter.py --no-cache</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Observed behavior</h3>
<p>File is valid for the ruff formatter.
The command output is <code>1 file left unchanged</code></p>
<h3>Expected behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>test_2</code> function is reformatted so it is identical to<code>test_1</code></li>
<li><code>test_4</code> function is reformatted so it is identical to <code>test_3</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Why I think this should be fixed</h3>
<p>A line-spitting occurs if the code exceeds the line-length. So it seems logical to me that a rule for the opposite behavior would be in place. Since the line-length is not exceeded, the calls should not be split into separate lines.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The formatter, by default, keeps lines separated if the last item in a sequence has a trailing comma. You can enable the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#format_skip-magic-trailing-comma"><code>skip-magic-trailing-comma</code> </a> to disable this behavior (in which case <code>test_2</code> and <code>test_4</code> should be collapsed)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for your answer @MichaReiser, maybe this was all I needed. But shouldn't <code>true</code> be the default?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's great to hear.</p>
<p>People like to have some control over when lines break; that's why <code>false</code> is the default. It also ensures that Black and Ruff have the same default.</p>
