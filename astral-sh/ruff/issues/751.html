            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When using Ruff in other tools, it'd be nice if one could turn off the &quot;new version available&quot; notice. It clutters the output badly, if Ruff is being invoked for every individual file (which is done by the IDE, or another embedding tool).</p>
<p>A simple console argument switch should do the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks for this great tool btw! :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The --quiet flag might do what you want? It omits the version check and only logs errors (nothing else).</p>
<p>I do think the version check is too spammy. I was under the impression that it would only log once a day, so need to revisit it. (It’s also possible that it deserves its own flag and config option.)</p>
