# Editor integrations link in README redirects to 404 page.

---

_@niranjan-kurhade_

The Editor integrations link in README is broken, it redirects to a 404 page.
To reproduce-
1. Go to README.md
2. Scroll to First Party editor integrations
3. Click on editor integrations
4. See 404 page

Expected Behavior-
It should redirect to the correct link.
