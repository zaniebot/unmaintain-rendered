Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Almost all the trivial pycodestyle e autofixes https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#error-e are implemented, but there are few that are missing that seem quite trivial to implement.</p>
<p>Another trivial (and quite common one to encounter after adding manual noqas) is https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/no-space-after-inline-comment/ , ie <code>E262</code>. The fix looks rather trivial to make and we should consider adding an autofix before it leaves preview.  May be a good first issue.</p>
