# Feature request: support flake8-unused-arguments

---

_Issue opened by @tekumara on 2022-11-22 05:21_

[flake8-unused-arguments](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-unused-arguments/) has warnings for:

>U100 - An unused argument.
>U101 - An unused argument starting with an underscore

This would also close a gap with VS Code's Pylance which has a U100 equivalent ("x is not accessed") built in.
