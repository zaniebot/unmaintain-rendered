            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a question for the developers of this wonderful tool more than an actual issue:</p>
<p>What&#x27;s your stance on providing ruff in additional packaging formats?</p>
<p>I ask this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would be convenient for me to have ruff packages that don&#x27;t require me to install it in each virtual environment or manage a per-user pip install.</li>
<li>While right now that&#x27;s completely feasible, I don&#x27;t know whether future plans for ruff include doing things that would tie it to a virtual environment at install time.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the stance is something along the lines of &quot;additional packaging formats are fine,&quot; I have a couple of follow-up questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I were to volunteer to maintain one of these formats, would the team prefer I keep it packaged separately, or would a PR to maintain the release within this repository (additional release-related files, a GitHub workflow to release this package alongside the others, etc.) be accepted? (This changes the best way to do the release.)</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What kinds of packaging formats are you looking for?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m probably going to start including pre-built binaries as part of the GitHub release (which will be installable without going through <code>pip</code>) -- would that help?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I&#x27;ve been looking at doing is building a snap package of ruff (not unlike the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/pyright">pyright snap package</a>), since that&#x27;d get me automatic updates and a system-wide install for my own machines. I <a href="https://github.com/lengau/ruff/">made a fork</a> for that. I&#x27;ll happily PR it upstream once it&#x27;s ready if you&#x27;re willing to accept it (the github workflow still needs work), but if you don&#x27;t want it included, I&#x27;m happy to keep it separate.</p>
<p>If you do want it kept separate, having binaries attached to the GitHub release would be great, as I could remodel the repository like the snap package for the <a href="https://github.com/lengau/gh-snap">Github CLI</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could we publish it as a separate GitHub repo, with a job that&#x27;s triggered whenever we create a new release here? That&#x27;s how the <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit">pre-commit hook</a> is structured. (A little awkward but in that case I&#x27;d likely want it to be under my account for permissioning purposes.)</p>

<p>Would <a href="https://pypa.github.io/pipx/"><code>pipx</code></a> help? I understand there may be a broader need for other packaging formats, but <code>pipx</code> does make it easy to run PyPI-shipped binaries out of venvs...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@akx not in this particular case - right now I have <code>ruff</code> installed through pip outside of a virtual environment, and I frequently use <a href="https://github.com/PyAr/fades"><code>fades</code></a> and pipx, but having this as yet another package manager to manage for my use case is not ideal, whereas having it integrated into my other updates won&#x27;t have me accidentally using older versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! I&#x27;ve just finished putting together the snap package. It&#x27;s got the last two versions of ruff release both <a href="https://github.com/lengau/ruff-snap">on GitHub</a> and in the <code>candidate</code> channel on the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/ruff">Snap store</a>. If you&#x27;d like to take ownership I&#x27;ll happily pass it over, and I&#x27;ll happily help you get setup with what&#x27;s needed to make the CI work from your repo. I&#x27;m happy to continue maintaining it either on my own or under the official umbrella :smiley:</p>
