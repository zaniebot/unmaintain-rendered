# Selecting RUF100 for autofix removes all `noqa:` comments

---

_Issue opened by @smurfix on 2025-09-28 20:49_

### Summary

```
$ ruff check --select RUF100 --fix  src/
Found 2903 errors (2903 fixed, 0 remaining).
```
The above command removed **all** `noqa:` comments from my codebase.

It'd be nice if ruff had magically fixed up my code so that ruff had nothing to complain about, but that's kindof not how it works …

### Version

0.13.2

You can use `--extend-select` to enable `RUF100` in addition to your normal rules. Using `--fix` should then add the necessary noqa codes.

Umm, I don't want to add any noqa codes. I want those that are no longer needed to go away.
Running `ruff --check src` yields 2903 errors. Ten of those are RUF100, which is already included in my normal ruleset.

Sorry, I got confused by your other issue that was about `add-noqa`. You can run `ruff check --fix src` and it should remove unused noqa comments. You don't need to select any additional rules if RUF100 is already part of your normal rule set. 

You can use `fixable` and `unfixable` if you only want to apply the `RUF100` fixes:

```
ruff check --fixable RUF100 --unfixable ALL
```
