            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>FormatStringContinuation</code> implementation uses the full lexer for comment handling. It expects only a limited set of tokens (<code>String</code>, <code>Newline</code>, <code>NonLogicalNewline</code>, <code>Comment</code>, <code>Indent</code>, <code>Dedent</code>) which is expected given that the lexing is performed only on the string literals.</p>
<p>Now, with PEP 701, the f-string literal will instead emit <code>FStringStart</code>, <code>FStringMiddle</code>, and <code>FStringEnd</code>. Not only that, it'll also emit other tokens for the expression part of the f-string. This poses a challenge as currently it panics for any unexpected token encountered:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's one of the failing test in the CI: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/6236001637/job/16926357093?pr=7376#step:7:2341</p>
<p>It shouldn't block Ruff in general but the formatter will panic when a f-string is encountered in implicit string concatenation with comments in it. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">foo = (
    f&quot;bar&quot;
    # comment
    &quot;foo&quot;
)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've started looking into it. A basic implementation of using the outermost f-string range and ignoring all tokens within a f-string works but I'll look at if there are any other cases which may break this.</p>
