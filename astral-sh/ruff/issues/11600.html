<p>I don't see a lint warning for this method
checked in the ruff playground
I'd expect <code>N805: First argument of a method should be named &quot;self&quot;</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I gave this a try in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11605#issuecomment-2138575064 but decided against changing it after reviewing the ecosystem results. There are a ton of cases of folks omitting arguments from methods (especially in test suites) that seem valid. The rule is really about naming, and if you omitted the argument entirely, that's actually a correctness issue which requires different logic.</p>
