            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now, <code>ruff server</code> only uses pull diagnostics to send diagnostics to the client - they aren't pro-actively sent. This means that any LSP client that doesn't send a pull diagnostics request <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11022">will not have visible diagnostics</a>. This includes Neovim, Helix, and potentially others at the time of this writing, though Neovim will support pull diagnostics in the upcoming <code>0.10.0</code> release.</p>
<p>We should still support pull diagnostics going forward, but if they aren't supported (which the server will check using the client capabilities passed in) we should fall back to a publish diagnostics mode as an alternative.</p>
