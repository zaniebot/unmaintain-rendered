* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.

* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I am using <code>ruff check --show-files</code> to check which files would be checked and since linting and formatting has it's own <code>exclude</code> settings and so on in the config it would be useful to have <code>ruff format --show-files</code> to check which files would be checked for formatting.</p>
<p>I am using the output to control which files should be checked in a dynamic setting and cannot do the same for formatting check since the <code>include</code> and <code>exclude</code> setting for linting and formatting might be different.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">user ~ ➜  ruff --version
ruff 0.6.1
