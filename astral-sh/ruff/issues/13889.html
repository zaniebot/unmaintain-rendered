            <div class="timeline-body"><p>An automatic fix would be great if symbols are imported from <code>typing</code> that are not available at the lowest required python version but are available in <code>typing_extensions</code>,  if  <code>typing_extensions</code> is a dependency.
This would fix the opposite issues of #7285 UP035.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a neat idea although it'll require Ruff to know whether <code>typing_extensions</code> is a dependency of the project.</p>

But https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2501 is also due to the much larger scope of transforming syntax a lot more complex and thus stuck...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can keep it open but there remains the question where the rule should belong to. Naturally, it would fit into the pydowngrade category but we could consider adding it to Ruff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Coupled with TCH rules I'd take this without needing a check to see if it's in the dependencies.</p>
<p>If you want a safe fix you can even automatically add <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> and <code>if TYPE_CHECKING</code> (both of which Ruff already has codemods for) when the type was used in an annotation.</p>
<p>At least editor suggestions/unsafe fixes could go a long way.</p>
