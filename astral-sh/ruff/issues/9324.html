            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://pep8.org/#module-level-dunder-names it says that <code>__all__</code> &quot;should be placed after the module docstring but before any import statements except from <code>__future__</code> imports&quot;.
It would be great to have an isort-style rule that implements the PEP8 suggestion.
There are definitely cases when <code>__all__</code> shouldn't be moved to above the imports, e.g. when it is dynamically defined from the imports, but if <code>__all__</code> contains only strings then it should be safe to move.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import x, y, z

__all__ = [&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;]  # safe to move
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">from x import *
from . import x

__all__ = x.__all__  # not safe to move
</code></pre>

<p>That is a different rule that is tracked by #1198. The title of this issue is a bit confusing. <code>--srx</code> sorts the strings inside of <code>__all__</code>, while this request is about moving the <code>__all__</code> (and <code>__version__</code>, <code>__author__</code>, etc.) <em>assignment statements</em> to the top of the file, e.g.</p>
<p>Bad:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&quot;&quot;&quot;Dummy module&quot;&quot;&quot;

from __future__ import annotations

import os

__all__ = [&quot;foo&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Good:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&quot;&quot;&quot;Dummy module&quot;&quot;&quot;

from __future__ import annotations

__all__ = [&quot;foo&quot;]

import os
</code></pre>
<p>@nstarman , I think the title of this issue should be changed to something like &quot;Add option to move module level dunders to top of file&quot;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The former.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's worth noting that before 2016 the PEP8 mandated the opposite,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put any relevant <code>__all__</code> specification after the imports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was changed to the current text in
https://bugs.python.org/issue27187 (<a href="https://bugs.python.org/file43132/issue-27187-patch1.txt">patch</a>)
https://github.com/python/peps/commit/0aa70aebf102d352b8476f04509a369bf3db276c</p>
<p>but the style checkers only relaxed the previous rule instead of implementing the new one https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/pull/523 https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/615 , so there's been no pressure to change it in existing codebases. It seems like most Python code follows the older convention still, since people tend to go by whatever their style checker / formatter says instead of reading PEP8 themselves.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's any other PEP8 suggestion that so wildly differs from what's done in practice.</p>
