            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From what I read in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9728">the original PR</a>, the rule is meant to ignore string literals that have an immediate method call on them to avoid false positives, but from what I'm seeing, every line with a method call is completely ignored, even if the method is not invoked on the string itself. Is this intended behavior?</p>
<p>Sample code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import logging


class Test:
    def method(self, arg):
        pass


name = &quot;john&quot;

print(&quot;hello {name}&quot;)  # correctly fails
logging.info(&quot;hello {name}&quot;)  # should fail but doesn't
Test().method(&quot;hello {name}&quot;)  # also should fail but doesn't
</code></pre>
<p>Invoked with:</p>
<pre><code>ruff --isolated --select RUF027 --preview thing.py
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff version:</p>
<pre><code>ruff 0.2.1
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems intentional. This is from the documentation explaining when the rule doesn't trigger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/// 3. The literal (or a parent expression of the literal) has a direct method call on it (for example: <code>&quot;{value}&quot;.format(...)</code>)</p>

<p>@snowsignal can you help us understand the motivation behind it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What does a &quot;parent expresssion of the literal&quot; mean exactly? If it means it won't trigger on things like <code>logging.info(&quot;{var}&quot;)</code>, then the value of this rule decreases significantly IMO.</p>
<p>Shouldn't it only count if a method is called on the string itself?</p>

<p>You're right, this rule only applies to the string itself, plus any parent expressions that the string is in. The example you gave is definitely something we should catch. Luckily, I think I have a good idea of why this is happening, and I'll try to make a fix for this soon.</p>
<p>A parent expression of the literal would be something like <code>func(&quot;{name}&quot;)</code> - something like <code>logging.info(&quot;{var}&quot;)</code> shouldn't be excluded by this rule, because we aren't calling a method on <code>info(&quot;{var}&quot;)</code> - rather, it <em>is</em> the method that is being called.</p>
