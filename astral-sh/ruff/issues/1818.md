# Support `balanced_wrapping` isort option

---

_Issue opened by @alex-way on 2023-01-12 15:34_

Hey!

Firstly thanks for creating & mantaining this project, really impressed so far.

One thing I'd personally really like to see is the `balanced_wrapping` isort feature which turns the following imports:

```python
from pkg import (
    mod1,
    mod2,
)
```

to:
```python
from pkg import mod1, mod2
```


Link to isort [documentation](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#balanced-wrapping)

I inevitably have to read through the source to really understand these options :joy:

What can I do to help you? My rust is absolutely horrendous so I won't be able to pull together a PR unfortunately but I'm keep to help out in other ways if I'm able to

I think a few more examples would be helpful. I'm also kind of wondering if you'll get the behavior you're looking for with:

```toml
[tool.ruff.isort]
split-on-trailing-comma = false
```

Because we _do_ try to fit the import on a single line if it fits, but by default, we _don't_ remove "magic" trailing commas, which would prevent us from squeezing the import in the first case.

Ah that actually does seem to do what I need it to! In that case, happy to close, thank you for the _blazingly_ fast reply :smile:

Awesome, it's my pleasure :)

Given that: I don't _think_ we need to implement `balanced_wrapping` specifically because we only really support `--profile=black`, and so we don't preserve formats like this (from the [docs](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort#intelligently-balanced-multi-line-imports)) anyway:
