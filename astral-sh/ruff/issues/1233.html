            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some minimal example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
    bar = 4
    x()
    return bar
</code></pre>
<p><code>x()</code> arbitrary function call can have side-effects. This is a dirt simple example, but it's not hard to imagine sequences of statements which would mutate <code>bar</code>'s value between the assignment and the return, even if there aren't direct references to <code>bar</code> itself (which seems to be the current heuristic).</p>
<p>Thus, it seems to me to be too eager to flag this, so long as there are potentially side-effectful operations between the assignment and the <code>return</code>. and given that most operations can be side-effectful, really i guess this just means, I'm suggesting it should mostly be checking for sequential statements like so:</p>
<pre><code>x = 4
return x
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm torn on this! Almost any statement can be side-effectful -- even something like <code>a = b + c</code> could actually involve operator overloading under-the-hood and thus make use of <code>bar</code>. So, I guess the suggestion is that we make this check much more conservative, and only flag when there are no expressions between the assignment and the return?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That was the suggestion yes. I can't decide i agree with myself</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>def bad(a={&quot;a&quot;: 1}):
    a['a'] += 1
    return a

def foo():
    bar = bad()
    bad()
    return bar
</code></pre>
<p>you can't really reorder the statements without changing the behavior.</p>
<p>And while this example seems contrived, the real code that triggered this was SQLAlchemy models being &quot;hydrated&quot; through some associated function call equivalent to <code>bad</code>, without referencing the equivalent of <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>With that being said, this is perhaps edge-casey enough that one just puts a noqa on it and calls it a day (which is what i did).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@DanCardin - FYI, I ended up changing this in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/1294 since it got filed again, which I took as a sign that it was too aggressive :)</p>
