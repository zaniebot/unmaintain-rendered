Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Coming from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8153 with <code>ruff==0.1.1</code>, there is the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#external"><code>external</code> setting</a> for third party tools using <code>noqa</code> comments. It currently works solely on exact matching of the codes inside the list.</p>
<p>For tools like <a href="https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint">pydoclint</a>, which has <code>DOC</code> error codes: <a href="https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint#3-style-violation-codes">jsh9/pydoclint#3-style-violation-codes</a>, it would be useful if <code>external</code> worked using prefixes as well.  That way, one could just have <code>external = [&quot;DOC&quot;]</code>.</p>
<p>So the request is to have <code>external</code> also work using prefix matching (not just exact matching).</p>
