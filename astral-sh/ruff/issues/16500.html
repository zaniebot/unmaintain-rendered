            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Ruff triggers bad preview behavior of C409. This behavior we chose not to enable because of issue: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12912">astral-sh/ruff#12912</a> . This is definitely a false positive in this case and should not be reported here as it does lead to a significant performance regression. See this issue for discussion: <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/148412">pytorch/pytorch#148412</a></p>
<p>Ruff playground for the rule here</p>

<p>cc @jansel for finding and flagging this issue</p>
<p>At worst, it should simplify to tuple(range(10)) instead of a useless x for x in range generator</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, without preview and accepting autofixes in the playground the code goes through these iterations:</p>
<pre><code>tuple([x for x in range(10)])  # initial case, C416
</code></pre>
<pre><code>tuple(list(range(10)))  # after one fix, C414
</code></pre>
<pre><code>tuple(range(10))  # after two fixes, no error
</code></pre>
<p>but with <code>preview = true</code>, C409 is also flagged and accepting that autofix leads to the problematic generator version.</p>
<p>Based on the name <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-literal-within-tuple-call/#unnecessary-literal-within-tuple-call-c409"><code>unnecessary-literal-within-tuple-call</code></a>, I think it might make sense if C409 were restricted to actual literals, not to comprehensions, which are covered by C416.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh I see that&#x27;s the preview part of the rule now. I think I&#x27;m confused here. Is this different from #12912? I think you just want the non-preview behavior (or a way to turn it off on preview), and that seems to be the topic of discussion there. But I could be missing something.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ntbre this works for the case where the generator is trivial and come from ranges, but it&#x27;s still actually slower when a list comprehension is transformed to a generator that cannot be further simplified. See the PyTorch issue and relevant playground for more complicated examples that won&#x27;t be simplified.</p>
<p>The range thing I provided was just an example, but it still breaks down if the range if filtered at all or chained etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I&#x27;m struggling to follow this issue.</p>
<p>Checking the following file with flake8 (<code>uvx --with flake8-comprehensions flake8 comprehension.py</code>)</p>
<pre><code>tuple([x for x in range(10)])
</code></pre>
<p>gives me</p>
<pre><code>comprehension.py:2:7: C416 Unnecessary list comprehension - rewrite using list().
</code></pre>
<p>Which is the same as what you get with Ruff.</p>
<p>I do understand that C416 and C409 overlap and that the fix suggested by C409 is suboptimal, but that&#x27;s covered in its own issue.</p>
<p>So is the question to change the C416 rule or is it only about that C416 and C409 don&#x27;t play nicely together right now but that would be fixed by reverting the preview behavior changes in C409 (or making it its own rule)</p>
