            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There recently have been a whole bunch of contributions to flake8-type-checking made by yours truly which greatly decreased the rate of false positives/negatives and added new rules, as well as better support for SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>Ruff independently added one of the rules which is slated to be added to <code>flake8-type-checking</code> in the next release as TC010 (string union syntax), whereas in Ruff the rule is TCH006.</p>
<p>Considering there's no longer a naming conflict in the <code>TC*</code> range (tryceratops kindly changed its code to match ruff's) I would suggest deprecating the <code>TCH*</code> rules and keep aliases around for backwards compatibility. At the same time we can reharmonize the rule numbering and make <code>TCH006</code> alias to <code>TC010</code>.</p>
<p>I can take a stab at porting some of the improvements from <code>flake8-type-checking</code> to Ruff, although I'm still a Rust novice, so I can't guarantee I will be able to contribute in a meaningful manner any time soon.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@AlexWaygood Could we fit this into the 0.8.0 release (i.e. renaming <code>TCH</code> to <code>TC</code> while leaving redirects)?</p>
<p>Otherwise I will need to wait until the <code>TCH006</code> -&gt; <code>TCH010</code> redirect gets removed before I can implement <code>TC006</code>.</p>
<p>I'm happy to open a PR myself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Daverball unfortunately I'm already somewhat behind on my tasks for this release, so I won't be able to work on this myself. I'd be very happy to review a PR targeting the <code>ruff-0.8</code> branch, however.</p>
<p>I can't immediately find the PRs in the past where we've remapped rules, but there have been some -- if you can find them, they should be a good template to use</p>
