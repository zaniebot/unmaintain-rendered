            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO nested comprehensions are very difficult to read:</p>
<p>specifically, i always read them in the wrong order, i guess because when converting a regular nested for loop to a comprehension the inner-most nested part gets moved to the top, my brain subconsciously assumes the control flow is inverted and that the expression should be read bottom-up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># normal for loops:
value = []
for a in range(0, 5):        # 1
    for b in range(5, 10):   # 2
        value.append([a, b]) # 3
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py"># in my head i always misread them in this order:
value = [
    [a, b]                 # 3
    for a in range(0, 5)   # 2
    for b in range(5, 10)  # 1
]

# instead of the correct order which is:
value = [
    [a, b]                 # 3
    for a in range(0, 5)   # 1
    for b in range(5, 10)  # 2
]
</code></pre>
<p>i guess if a rule to ban them was introduced, it would conflict with <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/manual-list-comprehension/"><code>PERF401</code></a>. is it possible to have that rule change its behavior to not report on cases that would result in a nested comprehension only if this new rule is enabled?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed with both. If the rule could suggest replacing nested comprehensions with comprehensions using <code>itertools.product</code> that would be ideal!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>this example was just the first thing that came to mind for an example of a nested for loop, <code>itertools.product</code> would work in this case but there are other cases where a nested for loop is used for other purposes</p>
