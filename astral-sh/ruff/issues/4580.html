Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

PYI009 seems like a rule that would have a really easy autofix and would be a good first issue for new contributors (just replace <code>pass</code> with <code>...</code>). This is also a low risk fix since they should be essentially semantically equivalent in this context. Many of the other PYI rules might also have low risk fixes as well that could be added.</p>
