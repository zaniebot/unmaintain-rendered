# Support for pylint format

---

_Issue opened by @damienallen on 2023-01-18 13:07_

I like that ruff, for the most part, is drop-in replacement for flake8. In terms of local development, I have found this to be true and usability is fantastic.

The problem I've run into is that, it lacks support for `pylint` format, one of the two formatters included in flake8:
https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/internal/formatters.html

We use Jenkins for CI and a lot of useful mappings for pylint format are missing for the standard PEP8 text format.

Anyone else in the same boat? Is this worthwhile to build?

Also, is it in line with what this project is trying to do?

Thanks for the kind words, it means a lot, truly!

I haven't used Pylint format before so bear with me as I confirm: the requirement here is just that we tweak the output message format, right? (E.g., today we support `ruff /path/to/file.py --format junit` to output XML; so the request here is to support `--format pylint`, and use the format specified in the Flake8 docs?)

If so: we can definitely support that, and it should be very easy to do.

That's exactly what I am requesting!

I can try to fork and play around with this first.

For the most part, what you want is in `printer.rs`. We'd want to add a new case there for `SerializationFormat::Pylint` (and to the enum itself in `src/settings/types.rs`).
