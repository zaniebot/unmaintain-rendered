<p>There are a number of cases where you have a choice between class based syntax and functional syntax. The specific case I&#x27;m considering is Enum - though I do vaguely recall that there are other cases.</p>
<p>For example, you defined an enum using either of these methods:</p>
<pre><code>class Color(Enum):
    RED = auto()
    YELLOW = auto()
    GREEN = auto()
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Color = Enum(
    &quot;Color&quot;,
    [
        &quot;RED&quot;,
        &quot;YELLOW&quot;,
        &quot;GREEN&quot;,
    ],
)
</code></pre>
<p>What you prefer is a matter of taste (though honestly, if you prefer functional style, you&#x27;re a little crazy) - however, I&#x27;d like to make sure we prefer the former throughout our codebase at work. This lint could obviously warn in either direction.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised this suggestion didn&#x27;t exist before tbh, so feel free to point me to the old ticket if it exists. I did search for &quot;enums&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; to try to find this issue, but I couldn&#x27;t find it (I also tried a few others queries, but you get the idea).</p>
