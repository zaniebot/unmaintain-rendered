            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven't verified this but I'm 99% sure that our <code>Type::Display</code> implementation stack overflows if there's a recursive type.</p>
<p>We should verify that <code>Type::Display</code> can handle recursive types.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven't been able to come up with cases where a user can construct a recursive type that then results in an infinite expansion during display. E.g. it would have to be a <code>Union</code> that contains itself as an element. I don't think it's possible for a user to define such a type and we should never infer such a type (fixpoint should give up after a few iterations).</p>
