            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's a good point, the issue is that the <code>suppressible_exception</code> rule adds an import for <code>contextlib.suppress</code> but our get_or_import_symbol import doesn't enforce that the import is added before the use, resulting in Ruff emitting broken code.</p>
<p>That's why the proper fix for this is to instead make our whole import handling location aware so that it only respects imports before a certain location or adds new imports to the last import block before the specific location.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser - Ah yeah, interesting. We do use the &quot;last visited top-level import block&quot;, but I'm guessing that for code within functions or that's otherwise evaluated in a deferred block, that will always end up being the &quot;last top-level import block <em>in the file</em>&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I never fully understood when we delay visiting functions to the <code>deferred</code> block but could it be that the &quot;last visited top-level&quot; potentially points to the last statement in the file when visiting deferred functions?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser - Yeah that's right. We <em>always</em> delay visiting function bodies, so if there's an import at the top-level after a function definition, we'll end up putting the import after the function definition. (Which, in some cases, is fine, but not always.)</p>
