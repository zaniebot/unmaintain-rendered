Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<h2>Current behavior</h2>
<p>When setting force-sort-within-sections to <code>true</code> and lines-between-types to 1, Ruff adds a blank line before the first from import that appears after a straight import.</p>
<h2>(Presumably) desired behavior</h2>
<p>isort does not add blank lines in this situation, which I think makes sense, so I propose to stick to that behavior. I guess the force-sort-within-sections setting should simply override the lines-between-types setting.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>I tested isort with <code>force_sort_within_sections</code> and <code>lines_between_types = 1</code> against the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from a import x
import b
from c import y
import d
</code></pre>
<p>and it doesn't do anything. Here is the command I ran (isort version 5.12.0):</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">isort --fss --lbt 1 --stdout example.py
</code></pre>
<p>However, running <code>cargo r -p ruff_cli -- check example.py --no-cache --diff</code>  adds a blank line after <code>import b</code> with the following config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">select = [&quot;I001&quot;]

[isort]
force-sort-within-sections = true
lines-between-types = 1
</code></pre>
