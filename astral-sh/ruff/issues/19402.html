            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>In a py3.9 context with <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>, we are using <code>keep-runtime-typing = true</code>
to avoid application of rules like UP007 and UP045 that suggest use of X | None or X | Y syntax instead of Optional[X] and Union{X|Y].
This is to avoid issues with Pydantic while nevertheless permitting us to address forward referencing issues.</p>
<p>It would be valuable to actually have reciprocal rules that flag the use of non-native py3.9 type annotation syntax with <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>. That is, not only would X | None not be suggested, it would get flagged as an issue if observed.  This would presumably be non-default behavior, but something that could be opted into.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds like a &quot;pydowngrade&quot; rule set tracked in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2501">astral-sh/ruff#2501</a>. I&#x27;m not sure this is quite a duplicate, though. Wanting this behavior even in the presence of <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> seems a bit different but makes sense in this context I think.</p>
