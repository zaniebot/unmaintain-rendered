            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe if it is gated to pull requests with the <code>rule</code> label? I'm a little hesitant for automation that changes the pull request titles but it would be nice to have automation in general. Maybe it'd be better implemented in our changelog generation code? That is also complicated though.</p>
