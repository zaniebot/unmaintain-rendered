<p>Keywords: RSPEC-1244, float, sonar</p>
<p><code>RSPEC-1244</code> from <a href="https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/RSPEC-1244/">sonar rules</a> checks whether equality checks are made on floating point numbers, which often leads to non-deterministic results in tests.</p>
<p>This rule forms part of Sonar's Python scanner checks, which I've seen is <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4935">open as a feature request</a>.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to add this individual rule either as a one-off or as a starting point in porting sonar's rules over?</p>
