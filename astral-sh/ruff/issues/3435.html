            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So ruff is a python linter. Are there any lints requiring access to correct <code>site-package</code> stuff or other things only available when executing in the same python context as the python code should be executed? (like for example pyright, which needs to check dependencies)</p>
<p>I’m mainly asking in the context of GitHub actions. I saw <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/editor-integrations/#github-actions">the example action</a> in your documentation (thx for that!) which does not detail this point (maybe it’s irrelevant?).</p>
<p>In particular, if using <a href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch"><code>hatch</code></a>, is there ever a need to run ruff with <code>hatch run ruff ...</code> or does ruff not care at all about the environment it’s run in?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good question! No, it&#x27;s not necessary. Ruff has no dependency on the current environment.</p>
<p>You might <em>want</em> to manage Ruff alongside the rest of your environment if you care about keeping the dependency versions in-sync (i.e., if you have different projects that need to use different versions of Ruff). But Ruff doesn&#x27;t behave differently when run inside or outside of a Python environment.</p>
