Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I have drafted a <a href="https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/private-calls-pre-commit">pre-commit hook</a> to make sure there isn't a private function being called outside of the module it was defined. Would it make sense as an optional linting rule? If so I'd be happy to contribute with code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps it could be an extension to that rule, @charliermarsh. My code doesn't check for class private member access. It checks for module private member access. Here's an example of something that should raise an exception:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># a.py
def _foo(*args, **kwargs):
    return &quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># b.py
import a

print(a._foo())  # Raises an exception
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># c.py
from a import _foo

print(_foo())  # Also raises an exception
</code></pre>
<p>Have I misunderstood the rule you've mentioned, or am I really onto something here?</p>
