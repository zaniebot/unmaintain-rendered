<p>I have drafted a <a href="https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/private-calls-pre-commit">pre-commit hook</a> to make sure there isn&#x27;t a private function being called outside of the module it was defined. Would it make sense as an optional linting rule? If so I&#x27;d be happy to contribute with code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps it could be an extension to that rule, @charliermarsh. My code doesn&#x27;t check for class private member access. It checks for module private member access. Here&#x27;s an example of something that should raise an exception:</p>
<pre><code># a.py
def _foo(*args, **kwargs):
    return &quot;Hello World&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code># b.py
import a

print(a._foo())  # Raises an exception
</code></pre>
<pre><code># c.py
from a import _foo

print(_foo())  # Also raises an exception
</code></pre>
<p>Have I misunderstood the rule you&#x27;ve mentioned, or am I really onto something here?</p>
