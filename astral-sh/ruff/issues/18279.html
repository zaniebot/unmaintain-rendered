            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It would be helpful for consistency in function signatures to have sorted literals. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Okay because `sorted([&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]) == ['a', 'b', 'c']`
def f(x: Literal[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]) -&gt; None:
  print(x)

# Warning because `sorted([&quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;]) != [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;]`
def g(x: Literal[&quot;c&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;]) -&gt; int:
  return [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;].index(x)
</code></pre>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unsorted-dunder-all/">RUF022</a>, but in a different context. I think there are conceptual complications with literals of mixed types (i.e. <code>Literal[0, 1, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]</code>) that I don't have great thoughts on how to handle. Maybe skip for now or only apply the rule to strings? As far as I know this is not implemented by any other formatters/linters.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for this rule suggestion.</p>
<p>This is a very opinionated rule in the sense that the only motivation is consistency/I like it better this way. We're currently not adding any such new rules until we complete https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1774 which will give us a dedicated category for such rules.</p>
