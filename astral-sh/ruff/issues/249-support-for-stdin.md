# Support for stdin?

---

_Issue opened by @fsouza on 2022-09-21 21:00_

Hey there, thanks for working on this project. I'm curious if you'd be open to support stdin, similar to how flake8 does it? (i.e. support `-` as the file name and a flag to identify the filename for error messages -- `--stdin-display-name`)

I can send a PR if that's acceptable!

Yeah that sounds reasonable to me!
