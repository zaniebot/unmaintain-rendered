<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>Checks if a logger isn't used in the module it's instantiated.</p>
<h2>Why is it bad</h2>
<p>Although you could instantiate a logger in one file and use it in another, this is not recommended. Therefore, if a logger isn't used in the module, it's instantiated; it should be considered unused and removed.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>If I have a simple <code>module.py</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&quot;&quot;&quot;A simple module.&quot;&quot;&quot;
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def foo() -&gt; None:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>The logger isn't used, which adds 2 unnecessary lines. The linter should fix the file so that it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">&quot;&quot;&quot;A simple module.&quot;&quot;&quot;


def foo() -&gt; None:
    ...

</code></pre>
<h2>When not to use it</h2>
<p>If you don't care about the additional lines.</p>

<p>It is common, but not recommended by the official docs. They're clear that they recommend a new logger per module with <code>__name__</code>.</p>

<p>This is what I'm trying to enforce basically. It's an edge case specifically for any variable at the top of the module that is assigned the value <code>logging.getLogger(__name__)</code>.</p>
<p>I think it could be this specific as <code>ruff</code> already has other rules to enforce how to instantiate a logger (i.e., LOG0XX rules)</p>
