# D101 does not consider __all__

---

_Issue opened by @onerandomusername on 2022-12-02 05:17_

A class without a `_` preceeding its name is not public unless included in `__all__` when `__all__` is defined.

For example, the following file should not raise a D101.

```py
__all__ = ()


class Hello:
    ...

```

"Publicity" is the case for all in the D1xx group, not just D101. If there is an `__all__` in the module, only the items listed as part of it should receive these checks.  [See here for details.](https://www.pydocstyle.org/en/2.1.1/error_codes.html#publicity)

I'm working on this, but it requires some refactoring, since we can no longer track visibility as we iterate over the AST (since we might visit nodes before we see `__all__`).

@charliermarsh  BTW, I heard you on Talk Python. We need more people like you.
