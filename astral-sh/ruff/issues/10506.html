<p>Ruff formatter is awesome, and I have completely migrated my project from Black.</p>
<p>In addition, I am very eager for it to support the configuration to not format certain matching lines, rather than manually specifying in the code. Because I have some DSLs implemented in Python, I don&#x27;t want Ruff to format those related codes. It would be great if Ruff had a related configuration to set this globally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>for example, I have a pytest BDD <a href="https://github.com/zen-xu/spock">plugin</a> (It hasn&#x27;t been maintained for a long time 😅), its DSL is similar to a table.</p>

@pytest.mark.spock(&quot;maximum of {first} and {second} is {ret}&quot;)
def test_maximum():
    def expect(first, second, ret):
        assert max(first, second) == ret

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I can see the need for a configuration option to exclude certain code patterns from linting and formatting, and AST Grep (or GritIo) patterns could be a nice way of specifying that. I would rather not do a string-based search because that is error-prone and imposes the challenge that Ruff would need to map string offsets back to AST nodes (it&#x27;s unclear what should happen if the start doesn&#x27;t match the node offsets directly).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m afraid that this is probably a more distant feature because it requires building some infrastructure to support this and a very stable AST representation (changes to the AST would become breaking changes)</p>
