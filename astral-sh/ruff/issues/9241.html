            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We&#x27;re getting close to finishing the formatter changes for Ruff&#x27;s 2024 preview style (see #8678).</p>
<p>A way for us to get feedback is to reach out to maintainers using Ruff&#x27;s formatter by creating a PR with the formatting changes when running <code>ruff format</code> with <code>--preview</code>.  The goal is not to get the PR merged (we should make this clear in the PR summary), but to review the changes ourselves and ask them if they see any changes they dislike or find questionable.</p>
<p>I recommend waiting for the next release or building Ruff from the source before submitting any PRs.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in PRing the changes to a repository, please comment on this issue so that we can track the PRs and the feedback.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I won&#x27;t be doing this anymore because I received feedback that the primary value of Ruff/Black is that they don&#x27;t need to think about formatting at all and me asking for feedback takes that value proposition for them.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll manually review the changes to some larger projects and make the call myself.</p>
