            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/mixed-case-variable-in-class-scope/">N815</a> which says:</p>

<p>Good:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyClass:
    my_variable = &quot;hello&quot;

<p>At first glance, it's surprising that it doesn't exclude PascalCase, but maybe there is a reason?</p>

<p>Technically, I can't disagree, that it is class attribute (and I am not sure about explicit PEP-8 opinion on that).</p>
<p>But <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/mixed-case-variable-in-class-scope/">N815 </a> would complain on <code>mixedCase</code> in the absolutely same case, as mentioned above. Such behavior looks inconsistent and surprising to me.</p>
<p>For popular case like <code>pydantic</code> class attributes are more like <em>instance variables</em>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These are just my own notes from looking into this issue:</p>
<p>The difference here doesn't come from whether the variable is attributed. It correctly flags <code>myVariable</code> but it doesn't flag <code>MyVariable</code>. See <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/0b9709d7-90e8-491a-87c2-cac1e144e779">playground</a></p>
<p>This sounds very familiar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14905</p>
<p>Ruff's behavior is consistent with pep8-namiang</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did search the pep8-naming repository for an explanation but couldn't find any.</p>
<p>My best guess is that CapNames are allowed because flagging them would be in conflict with the PEP8 recommendation for <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#type-variable-names">type variables</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Another code pattern that could explain this are nested classes, where the nested class is swapped out using an assignment to a different class by a subclass. I've seen this pattern used in a few places over the years.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>webob.request.Request.ResponseClass</code> or <code>wtforms.Form.Config</code> come to mind, although in the latter case you're generally expected to always define a new nested class, rather than assign one. Although you can think of those as type variables too, since they're referring to a type.</p>
<p>I think we could come up with some heuristics for the given example with <code>AnnAssign</code> though. If the annotation doesn't refer to a <code>type</code>-like, then using PascalCase is wrong. If it's a regular <code>Assignment</code>, then we don't know, without performing type inference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also sometimes use this pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from enum import Enum, auto

class LoggerOption(Enum):

class Logger:
    Option: TypeAlias = LoggerOption

    def __init__(self, option: Option):  # using the alias
        self.option = option

logger = Logger(Logger.Option.INFO)
