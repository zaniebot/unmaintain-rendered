### Description

See my comment here https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15856/files#r1938233453

We should probably only highlight the module name when resolving a `from ...` import` fails

I'd like to take a crack at this one. I think it would be a good exercise for me to go through the process of an actual improvement here by dipping my toes into it. I'll time box this to an hour or two, so if it proves too challenging, I'll back off of it.
