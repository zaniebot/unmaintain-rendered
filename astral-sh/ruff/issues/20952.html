            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have a suggestion to extend the <code>__all__</code> sorting a bit and allow sorting by the <em>definition</em> order of names (functions/classes/variables) that are put in <code>__all__</code>.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from .submodule import reexported_name
from .submodule_b import different_reexported_name

__all__ = (
    &quot;reexported_name&quot;,
    &quot;different_reexported_name&quot;,
    &quot;function_b&quot;,
    &quot;X&quot;,
    &quot;function_a&quot;,
    &quot;function_c&quot;,
    &quot;Y&quot;,
)


def function_b():
    ...


class X:
   ...


def function_a():
    ...


def function_c():
    ...


class Y:
   ...
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for such a suggestion is that I think it makes it easier to find out what names of public APIs are missing in <code>__all__</code> and what names shouldn't be in it (especially the latter one) since it allows one to just go through the file and look through the names in <code>__all__</code> in the same order.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've based this enhancement request on my original request for this rule: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1198#issuecomment-1509734136. I was configuring Ruff for a new project today and realised that this part never became a thing.</p>
