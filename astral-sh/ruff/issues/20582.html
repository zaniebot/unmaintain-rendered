            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>See https://play.ruff.rs/50b9289d-e9dc-4a5a-afeb-c2fa14b6cf53</p>
<p>The code is nearly identical, the only difference is that the first version uses a <code>match</code> statement to <em>lower</em> complexity (fewer nested if statements than the second one)</p>
<p>But Ruff seems to think that the first copy is somehow much more complex than the second.</p>
<p>Looks to me like <code>match</code> statements get unfairly penalized by your McCabe implementation.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.13.2</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm actually it looks like they’re just apart by a count of 1 and Ruff can’t identify the last <code>case</code> as exhaustive. Which I guess is fair, would be asking a bit much to analyze the code to find exhautive patterns like this.</p>
