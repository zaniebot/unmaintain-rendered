# `TC001`, `TC002`, `TC003` - documentation mentions import cycles which is misleading

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-01-17 14:41_

the documentation for these three rules all mention import cycles:

- https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/typing-only-first-party-import/
- https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/typing-only-third-party-import/
- https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/typing-only-standard-library-import/

> Unused imports add a performance overhead at runtime, and risk creating import cycles. If an import is only used in typing-only contexts, it can instead be imported conditionally under an `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block to minimize runtime overhead.

for `TC002` and `TC003`, mentioning import cycles isn't relevant because standard library or third party modules will never import from the source code that imported it, so i think the mention of import cycles should be removed from the documentation for these two rules.

for `TC001`, import cycles are a relevant concern because the imported module is part of your source code and therefore could have a circular dependency on the current file. however it's a common (and dangerous) misconception that import cycles are only an issue at runtime. it almost always means there's a problem with how your project is structured regardless of whether the import is `TYPE_CHECKING` only so it's misleading to suggest that a `TYPE_CHECKING` import is a suitable solution. [see this discussion for an example](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/issues/960#issuecomment-2552777922).

perhaps the `TC001` documentation can include a warning mentioning that `TYPE_CHECKING` imports are not the best solution to import cycles
