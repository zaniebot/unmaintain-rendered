            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be very nice if the watch mode would also watch for changes to configuration files.</p>
<p>Such a feature would make iterating on enabling new rulesets a lot easier.</p>

Proposal: detect changes in pyproject.toml and ruff.toml config files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mikeleppane - Definitely! I haven't thought too hard about what's required, but feel free to ask questions here as they come up. My guess is that, in the <code>match rx.recv()</code> loop in <code>crates/ruff_cli/src/lib.rs</code>, we can check if the file ends in <code>.toml</code>, then re-run the code to generate the <code>pyproject_strategy</code> and other variables that make it into the <code>commands::run::run</code> call.</p>
