Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>While running <code>ruff 0.0.243</code> on some code, I had a confusing linting output, which can be reproduced with the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from abc import ABCMeta


class MetaClass(ABCMeta):
    @staticmethod
    def i_dont_get_cls_param(not_cls) -&gt; bool:
        return False
</code></pre>
<p>Despite the method being noted as static, <code>ruff</code> is complaining that it should take a <code>cls</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff ruff.py
ruff.py:6:30: N804 First argument of a class method should be named `cls`
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the usage of this function in other code, it is indeed static, so this seems like it's some sort of precedence issue between treating all methods of <code>ABCMeta</code> as classmethods and the <code>@staticmethod</code> decorator.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for such a blazingly fast linter and sorter!</p>
