<p>Hi,</p>
<p>currently this is allowed in BLE001:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    ...
except Exception:
    raise
</code></pre>
<p>But it may be a good idea to allow this format as well (as pylint <code>broad-exception-caught</code> does):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    ...
except Exception as ex:
     raise ValueError from ex
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I would say that should be allowed. (There are other rules in Ruff that would then suggest you remove the redundant alias, but on its own it's within the bounds of <code>BLE001</code> to allow this IMO.)</p>

<p>The variable is only redundant when it is used in <code>raise ex</code> (TRY201) or in <code>logging.exception()</code> (TRY401), but in <code>raise ... from ex</code> it is needed.</p>
