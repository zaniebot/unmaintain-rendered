            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure we should make this change. <code>F541</code> is a stylistic rule. It's not a correctness rule.</p>
<p>Given that the rule doesn't judge the code's correctness and is only enforcing a specific style, applying that stylistic change doesn't make the code any more or less correct. But it does make the code more consistent with the style that the project wants to enforce. In that sense, it's very clear what the users' intentions are; strings without placeholders should not use f-strings. Making the fix unsafe also makes it less useful overall, since it now requires explicit opt-in, which many users are unlikely to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm @MichaReiser I don't agree that F541 is a stylistic rule. The original pyflakes linter had very strict criteria for adding rules: rules could only be added if they were almost certain to indicate a likely bug in the code. Sometimes it might be the case that you really did just mean to write a regular string and you didn't need the <code>f</code> prefix, but I agree with OP that it seems just as likely that you <em>meant</em> to put placeholders somewhere in the f-string and forgot to do so. In that way, the rule is effective at finding subtle bugs in your code where you're not creating the strings that you meant to at all.</p>
<p>I'm sympathetic to OP's argument here that this autofix can be counterproductive -- it can just hide the underlying bug, if there is one, which often isn't what you'd want -- and that therefore it should be explicitly opt-in. Though this doesn't really correspond to our usual understanding of &quot;fix safety&quot; -- the fix is certainly <em>safe</em>, as it doesn't change runtime behaviour.</p>

<p>This very much depends on how you intend to use f-strings. I could totally see myself using f-strings everywhere, and there's nothing wrong with that. That's why I'd consider <code>F541</code> either a stylistic or a restriction lint. It may occasionally catch bugs, but I still think it's more about consistency, e.g., forgetting to remove a <code>f</code> prefix after I removed some placeholders.</p>
<p>I agree that there will be instances where the fix is undesired. But I don't think always making the fix as unsafe is the right approach here. Instead, we could consider to be clever about when the fix is likely unsafe. E.g, can we split the string by whitespace and are there any symbols in scope that match a word in the string? If so, mark the fix as unsafe.</p>

<p>Hmm, maybe. I don't think that's how most Python users conventionally use f-strings, however</p>

<p>Yeah, that would indeed be very cool, and probably a better solution to just marking the fix as unsafe -- agreed!</p>

<p>I understand this argument as well.</p>
<p>Your proposed solution would also be better than using ARG001 / ARG002 as those generate way too many false positives during inherited methods. In the aftermath of this issue, I enabled them and realized quickly where they aren't recommended. So your proposed is the ideal version, even if it would not catch:</p>
<pre><code>class Greeter:
    def hello(self, name: str) -&gt; str:
        return f&quot;Hello naem!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Yet of course, one can have only so much tooling help.</p>
<p>Basically, there is a strong disagreement what risky should mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>does not change the code as is =&gt; this fix is save</li>
<li>does not apply fixes that may be potential bugs =&gt; this fix really isn't save at all</li>
</ul>
<p>I use this tooling esp. for catching bugs. I don't really care about a developer using f-strings where they aren't needed. Though it is nice side-effect for me that this tool ensures that code is written in way that reduces as much diffing noise as possible. Yet that is a nice to have for me, though for other that is the entire point.</p>
<p>Maybe one could have two rules for this so the developer can pick and chose? (Basically, either treating this as a potential bug or as a plain formatting issue and if the bug-rule is choosen, it should take precedence if --fix is applied)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, I didn't expect this to be so controversial! The reasoning above makes sense to me, but I was also thinking of this as a correctness rule. The <code>f</code> prefix is unused at best, and my impression was that it's very uncommon to use it intentionally without placeholders, so I assumed this was almost always a likely mistake. I also thought the problem here was analogous to #22318 and its linked issues. For what it's worth, clippy's <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html?search=format#useless_format"><code>useless_format</code></a> is a complexity lint.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't feel strongly that the fix should be unsafe, and it sounds good to try being more clever.</p>

<p>I don't agree, they could use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_extend-safe-fixes">extend-safe-fixes</a> to cerry-pick <code>&quot;F541&quot;</code> just as I use <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_extend-unsafe-fixes">extend-unsafe-fixes</a> now.</p>
<p>If a developer defaults to <code>--unsafe-fixes</code> for all, that is on them.</p>
<p>Though again, this relates if one wants to prioritize finding potential bugs or allowing formats to be forced to remain consistent.</p>
