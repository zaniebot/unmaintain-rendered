# Allow linking to individual rules on https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules

---

_Issue opened by @michaeloliverx on 2023-03-09 16:04_

Currently you can link to rulesets e.g. `https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#ruff-specific-rules-ruf` but it would be nice to link to a specific rule e.g. `https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#RUF100`
