            <div class="timeline-body"><p>continuation of #3604 #3603
https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml doesn&#x27;t contain an action to run pre-commit, so it only happens locally, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be validated in ci.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s two options for this, adding a job which runs pre-commit in ci, or installing https://pre-commit.ci on the repo (and perhaps adding configuration to change autoupdate)</p>
<p>Config will have to be added to skip the local hooks unless they aren&#x27;t part of ci already.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m interested in adding the ci or pre-commit.ci config, for whichever route is chosen.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we&#x27;re in kind of a weird state right now. Some people want pre-commit, so it exists, and there&#x27;s a set of checks that <em>only</em> run on pre-commit right now, but candidly I don&#x27;t use it at all, it&#x27;s not part of the contributor guidelines or getting started, and I&#x27;m hesitant to make it something contributors <em>have</em> to install and run.</p>
<p>As long as it exists, though, we should at least validate it on CI, i.e., incorporate it into <code>ci.yaml</code>. We&#x27;ll want to skip the steps that are already captured by our established CI workloads (I believe they&#x27;re enumerated at the bottom already) -- I think those are all the local hooks anyway.</p>
