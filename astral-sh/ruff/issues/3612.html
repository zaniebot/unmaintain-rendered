            <div class="timeline-body"><p>continuation of #3604 #3603
https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml doesn't contain an action to run pre-commit, so it only happens locally, and doesn't seem to be validated in ci.</p>
<p>There's two options for this, adding a job which runs pre-commit in ci, or installing https://pre-commit.ci on the repo (and perhaps adding configuration to change autoupdate)</p>
<p>Config will have to be added to skip the local hooks unless they aren't part of ci already.</p>
<p>I'm interested in adding the ci or pre-commit.ci config, for whichever route is chosen.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we're in kind of a weird state right now. Some people want pre-commit, so it exists, and there's a set of checks that <em>only</em> run on pre-commit right now, but candidly I don't use it at all, it's not part of the contributor guidelines or getting started, and I'm hesitant to make it something contributors <em>have</em> to install and run.</p>
<p>As long as it exists, though, we should at least validate it on CI, i.e., incorporate it into <code>ci.yaml</code>. We'll want to skip the steps that are already captured by our established CI workloads (I believe they're enumerated at the bottom already) -- I think those are all the local hooks anyway.</p>
