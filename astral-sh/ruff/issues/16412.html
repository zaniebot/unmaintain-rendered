            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Given something like:</p>
<p>https://play.ruff.rs/da4c76c4-92d0-4083-99c1-022152398a50</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from __future__ import annotations

from sqlalchemy.orm import BaseModel, Mapped, relationship
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .bar import Bar

class Foo(BaseModel):
    id: Mapped[int]
    bar_id: Mapped[int | None]
    bar: Mapped[Bar | None] = relationship()
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff will flag the import inside the <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> block, which very well may be required, due to circular dependencies between the two models.</p>
<p>Additionally <code>runtime-required-base-classes</code> is technically too strict for <code>sqlalchemy.orm.BaseModel</code>, since only the annotations that use a <code>Mapped</code> class are runtime required and furthermore only non-model types are runtime required, any forward references to other models can be resolved during mapping.</p>
<p>We could handle the latter using an additional setting <code>runtime-required-generic-subscripts</code>. But the former would still be a problem.</p>
<p>To handle the former we would need something like <code>runtime-ambiguous</code> instead of <code>runtime-required</code>, so we emit neither <code>TC001-003</code> nor <code>TC004</code> for uses in that context, since the use will have to be considered neither runtime-only nor typing-only.</p>
<p>But turning two settings, into six settings doesn't seem particularly elegant either. Maybe someone can think of a more elegant way to structure these settings.</p>
<p>I think this is the final major hurdle for covering all the use-cases the flake8 plugin currently covers (beyond implementing the currently still missing <code>TC009</code> rule).</p>
<p>Eventually type inference could let us do something more targeted for SQLAlchemy that knows exactly which symbols aren't runtime-required, but that's still a long way off and not as flexible for other libraries that may do something similar.</p>
