# Create a test corpus with invalid programs

Invalid programs are the default-state in editors. We should add extensive tests on how red knot handles invalid programs.

I don't think we have very extensive tests right now but we do run red knot over all parser tests of which many cover invalid syntax. That seems good enough to me for now. We'll want to add more tests in the future that assert how red knot infers types for invalid programs but this isn't a goal for now.
