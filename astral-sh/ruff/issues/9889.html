            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The following snippet shows no errors in non-preview mode and one F841 error in preview mode:</p>
<pre><code>def first(t):
    a, b = t
    return a
</code></pre>
<p>In my case, the CI runs ruff in non-preview mode. Locally, I want to run ruff in preview mode and fix the errors one-by-one. Assume that for the above example, I decided to silence the error with the <code>noqa</code> directive. In non-preview mode, this adds the RUF100 error because the <code>noqa</code> directive is unused in non-preview mode.</p>
<p>The optimal solution for this problem would be to make it possible to configure ruff to only add the RUF100 error if it would have happened in preview mode as well but without actually enabling preview mode.</p>

<p>This sounds like a reasonable behavior, but it also sounds hard to implement :/</p>
