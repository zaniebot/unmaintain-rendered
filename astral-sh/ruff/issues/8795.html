Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I am running Ruff 0.1.4 and trying to extend from a set of common ruff settings in a ruff.toml file.
The complete ruff.toml looks like:</p>

<p>In here I am trying to disable a couple of checks for test files.
The pyrpoject.toml looks like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
extend = &quot;./extern/ruff.toml&quot;

# Allow imports relative to the &quot;src&quot; and &quot;tests&quot; directories.
src = [&quot;src&quot;, &quot;tests&quot;]

extend-select = [

[tool.ruff.extend-per-file-ignores]
&quot;tests/**/*.py&quot; = [
    &quot;PT019&quot;,   # pytest-fixture-without-paramvalue - Flags fixtures that don't return values
]
</code></pre>
<p>This is successfully suppressing the PT019 check, but the other per-file-ignore checks are still getting flagged (such as D100).
If I remove the extend-per-file-ignores from the pyproject.toml, the PT019 start getting flagged in addition to the per-file-ignores from ruff.toml
As far as I can tell, none of the per-file-ignores from ruff.toml are getting passed through.
I've also tried switching ruff.toml's per-file-ignores to be extend-per-file-ignores (and removing those from my pyproject.toml), but those weren't honored either.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually, if I move <code>foo.py</code> into a subdirectory and use <code>subdir/foo.py</code> as my per-file-ignore this fails as you've described.</p>
<p>I believe the issue here is that the paths are relevant to the pyproject file they are defined in. So.. your imported pyproject file is defining per-file-ignores relative to its directory which do not match the files you are checking elsewhere. I'm not sure this should be changed.</p>
<p>The bigger question here is then: Should extending a config file (via <code>extend = ...</code>) make the settings pulled from it relative to the new config file?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Both choices can be problematic in different contexts. Using the <em>extended</em> file's directory as the base makes it useless if the extended file is, e.g., a global file that's shared between many projects (like in <code>~/ruff.toml</code>) -- but in that case, relative paths seem unusual? Using the directory of the file with the <code>extend</code> in it causes issues when you're extending a configuration in a parent directory from the project, as above.</p>
<p>The former seems a lot more common to me, so I’d say our current behavior is preferable to making any changes here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(The other thing to note is that we match against both the absolute file path and its basename. So the “foo.py” exclusion works in Zanie’s example regardless of whether it’s defined in the parent or child configuration file — since it’ll match any file with the basename “foo.py”. The relative pathing stuff only applies to patterns that match multiple segments.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For what it's worth, the only way I could fully ignore a setting in both test files and in their accompanying <code>__init__.py</code> was to split my checks into two parts:</p>
<pre><code>[per-file-ignores]
&quot;**/test_*.py&quot; = [
    &quot;B018&quot;,    # B018 - Found useless expression - necessary for testing exceptions are raised.
    &quot;D100&quot;,    # D100 - Module docstrings not required in test files.
    &quot;ARG&quot;,     # ARG - Unused args are common in tests with mock patches and mock functions.
]
&quot;../**/test_*/__init__.py&quot; = [
    &quot;D104&quot;,    # D104 - Package docstrings not required in test packages.
]
</code></pre>
<p>The only pattern for the <code>__init__.py </code> part that worked for me was to make it relative.
I had tried variations on <code>**/test_*/__init__.py</code> that weren't relative, but I couldn't get any to work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just ran into this issue so bumping it lightly. I have a global global config file located at <code>~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml</code>, and within a repo there is a specific <code>ruff.toml</code> that overrides some config</p>
<pre><code>extend = &quot;~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml&quot;
&lt;extra-config-here&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the docs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any relative paths in that configuration file (like <code>exclude</code> globs or <code>src</code> paths) are resolved relative to the <em>current working directory</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had expected my globs in the <code>per-file-ignores</code> section of my global config file to be respected relative to CWD when I import it via the <code>extend</code> flag, but that was not the case. When I run <code>ruff check</code> I get errors which were specifically ignored from the global config. However, if I run <code>ruff check</code> with the <code>--config-file ruff.toml</code> pointing to the <em>local</em> config file, then the global paths become relative for some reason, even though <em>both invocations use the same local <code>ruff.toml</code> file</em>, and I no longer get any errors.</p>
<p>I think the expected behaviour from me would be for there to be no difference between the two invocations, and both times the globs in the <code>per-file-ignores</code> should be matched relative to the CWD.</p>
