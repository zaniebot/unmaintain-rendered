<pre><code>test.py:5:5: PLR0913 Too many arguments to function call (6 &gt; 5)

<p>If this is to be expected then I think it would be good to specify this rule is posargs only :)</p>

<p>Oh ok, my bad :)</p>

<p>Do you mean to split the rule into positional-only and keyword-only or include both types in the same rule?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, I was suggesting that we retain a single rule, and just change the logic to include positional-only and keyword-only arguments in the &quot;argument count&quot; total.</p>
<p>I would probably err on the side of retaining the default, as long as its the same as Pylint's default, since <em>most</em> functions don't have keyword- or positional-only arguments, and so in most cases we'll retain compatibility. What do you think?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you're going for compatibility, then yes the total count should be good to maintain it in most cases. But, in a few rules we've diverged from the default implementation in terms of avoiding false positive/negative.</p>
<p>We could also open this issue in Pylint to make them aware, it might be that this was unintended from their side as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I much preferred the old implementation.</p>
<p>5 arguments seems unrealistically low.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should have a rule that implements the old behavior? :-)</p>
