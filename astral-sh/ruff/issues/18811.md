# [`Pylint`] `PLC1802` fix can cause syntax errors from lack of padding

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-06-20 05:35_

### Summary

The fix for [len-test (PLC1802)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/len-test/#len-test-plc1802) can cause a syntax error if the `len` is wrapped in parenthesis so it is next to the `if`. This should be fixable by adding padding. [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/e78f03d1-6817-499d-834d-0f99273cd015)
```

```py
fruits = []
if(len)(fruits):
    ...
```
```
PS D:\python_projects> uvx ruff check issue.py --select PLC --fix
```
```snap

error: Fix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.
