            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The current pre-commit hooks require cargo and may fail. As ruff provides wheels on pypi it should be easy to create a separate repository with a dummy package that will only have <code>ruff</code> in dependencies and simplify adoptation of this hook (as currently, all project contributors need to have cargo setup in the system).</p>
<p>I would like to propose adding this hook (maybe even replacing existing flake8 calls) in a few projects, but this is blocking me.</p>
