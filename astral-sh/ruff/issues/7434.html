            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My ruff configuration is structured as a deny list where I've enabled all rules and then disable the rules that I don't want.</p>
<p>In 0.0.289, this looked something like:</p>
<pre><code>preview = true  # added in 0.0.289
select = [
    &quot;ALL&quot;,
    # other specific preview codes
]
ignore = [
    &quot;PREVIEW&quot;,  # added in 0.0.289
    # other selectors I don't want
]
</code></pre>
<p>With the removal of the &quot;PREVIEW&quot; selector in 0.0.290, it doesn't look like there's an easy way to disable all the preview checks that I don't want without either:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing my config to be an allow list rather than a deny list, or</li>
<li>explicitly ignoring every preview check that I'm not selecting with it's fully qualified code.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would love to have some mechanism to select specific preview rules without doing either of these.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this -- we actually discussed this internally last week and have something proposed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7390 that would enable this kind of workflow (although we haven't yet decided to merge it). I'll \cc @zanieb who is owning preview behavior and thinking about these kinds of configuration issues.</p>
<p>(Zanie is out next week so might be a few days before a reply.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah we thought the <code>PREVIEW</code> selector was generally useless for ignores because of it's precedence but I missed that it was usable with <code>ALL</code>.</p>
<p>I'm happy with the approach in #7390 but wanted to wait for some user feedback regarding the current experience to ensure it resolves your needs. Please let us know if it'd work for you!</p>
