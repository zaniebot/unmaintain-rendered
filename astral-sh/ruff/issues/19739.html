            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I ran into the following in my code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">return not (a or b or c,)
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the <code>,</code> before the closing parens, the expression was a non-empty tuple and therefore always returned <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>Since we have the <code>not</code> there, I doubt there will be many false-positives for that (honestly, I can't think of any).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I could have sworn we had a rule for this, but the two I found only apply in certain contexts, which is probably what I was thinking of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/if-tuple/#if-tuple-f634">if-tuple (F634)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/assert-tuple/#assert-tuple-f631">assert-tuple (F631)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess along this theme we could call the rule something like <code>negated-tuple</code>, but these all seem like special cases of a hypothetical <code>tuple-in-boolean-context</code> rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>or even a rule that detects values that are always truthy or falsy values in boolean context</p>
