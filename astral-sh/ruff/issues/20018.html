            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>readline</code> is a funny module in the stdlib that, if you import it, has side effects on <code>input</code>. It shouldn't raise F401.</p>
<p>See https://play.ruff.rs/67cbd733-7f37-4318-abc9-1c7e67bf5ea9</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>v0.12.9</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's cool, I didn't realize just importing <code>readline</code> would change how <code>input</code> works.</p>
<p>Is this common? It makes some sense to special-case this since it's in the standard library, but it could also be a good use-case for noqa or <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pyflakes_allowed-unused-imports">allowed-unused-imports</a> if it's uncommon. I'm not sure if we'd always want to allow <code>readline</code> to be unused or only if <code>input</code> is also used. In other cases the import may still be unused.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, pyflakes also flags this example, so we're at least in line with upstream.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure it's common. I was thinking about some related code and then was hit with &quot;I bet ruff doesn't support <em>this</em>&quot; :^)</p>
<p>It might be better to wait and see if anyone actually needs this (i.e. makes an issue about this).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This also relates to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8149 about analysing side-effect imports.</p>
<p>Since stdlib has a limited number of known modules, it could be hardcoded to avoid unnecessary analysis.</p>

<p>All Python standrad modules are considered as imports without side effects except (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">this</a>, <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/import-antigravity.html">antigravity</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/rlcompleter.html">rlcompleter</a>).</p>

<p>I guess you'd add readline to this.</p>
