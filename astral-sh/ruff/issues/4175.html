            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would allow for enforcing uniformity between function and class docstrings so they both look like this:</p>
<pre><code>class definition or function signature
    docstring

    body
</code></pre>
<p>Note the blank line between the docstring and body.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is probably a result of the conventions defined in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/#multi-line-docstrings">PEP 257</a>, which recommends a blank line after the class docstring to mirror the blank line between methods in a class, but doesn't make any explicit recommendation for function docstrings. It looks like Black lets you do either.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'm gonna close in the interest of minimizing configuration complexity. There isn't really a good home for this right now, since ideally it'd be part of the <code>pydocstyle</code> rule set, but then we'd be adding rules that don't exist upstream, and users with <code>D</code> enabled would have to explicitly ignore it. That <em>can</em> be fine, but there are tradeoffs involved, and here, I'm not sure that the upside is worth it.</p>

<p>The option I'm proposing would conflict with <code>D202</code> and I see <code>ruff</code> can already emit warnings for conflicts and automatically choose one, so that might be a possible migration path for this particular case.</p>
