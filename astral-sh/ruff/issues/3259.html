            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, it looks like these <em>used</em> to be covered by <code>flake8-comprehensions</code> rule C407, which included these eight built-ins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>all</code></li>
<li><code>any</code></li>
<li><code>frozenset</code></li>
<li><code>max</code></li>
<li><code>min</code></li>
<li><code>sorted</code></li>
<li><code>sum</code></li>
<li><code>tuple</code></li>
</ul>
<p>C407 was dropped in its entirety in 2021, mostly due to bugs introduced by the subtle behavior changes: https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-comprehensions/issues/247</p>
<p>There was a proposal in 2022 to add it back for <code>any</code> and <code>all</code>, which have the potential for more significant performance gains due to the possibility of short-circuiting the rest of the generator: https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-comprehensions/issues/426</p>
<p>The proposal did not get implemented because <code>flake8-pie</code> added PIE802 to cover <code>any</code> and <code>all</code>. Of course, these two are the most likely to cause a change in behavior, due to short-circuiting of side effects where the others are guaranteed to consume the entire generator.</p>
<p>Short-circuiting aside, they all reduce memory consumption.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The rationale for this lint in the case of <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> is strong, because <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> can short-circuit and the generator version can potentially avoid many loops in the case of a large iterable; the comprehension prevents short-circuiting.</p>
<p>For cases like <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>sum</code> where the input iterable will always be fully exhausted, in Python 3.12 the comprehension version is generally a bit faster than the generator version. (I'm using https://gist.github.com/carljm/39ccaaddf3ef7a4cb018264b7282f05f to benchmark, derived from https://gist.github.com/smithdc1/7825842972afe05ad2f457e8b9fbc890). Results for all of <code>sum</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>min</code> are pretty much the same:</p>
<pre><code>.....................
list_comprehension small: Mean +- std dev: 1.39 us +- 0.01 us
.....................
generator small: Mean +- std dev: 2.04 us +- 0.01 us
.....................
list_comprehension large: Mean +- std dev: 17.5 ms +- 0.5 ms
.....................
generator large: Mean +- std dev: 23.6 ms +- 0.5 ms
</code></pre>
<p>The current <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-comprehension-any-all/">documentation</a> for the any/all version of the lint is a bit misleading, IMO. It says the performance benefit is from avoiding overhead of list creation, but it uses an example case that (accidentally?) maximizes the short-circuiting benefits (the first item in <code>range(1000)</code> in <code>0</code>, so <code>all</code> will short-circuit immediately); the actual benefit here is entirely from the short-circuiting. If we modify that benchmark ever so slightly to use the numbers from 1 to 1000 instead of 0 to 1000, the claimed 40x performance benefit vanishes, and again the comprehension version is a bit faster:</p>
<pre><code>➜ python -m timeit &quot;all([i for i in range(1, 1000)])&quot;
20000 loops, best of 5: 12.1 usec per loop

➜ python -m timeit &quot;all(i for i in range(1, 1000))&quot;
20000 loops, best of 5: 18 usec per loop
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this is that while the comprehension does have overhead to create a list, generators also have quite a bit of interpreter overhead, as they have to yield on each iteration; in particular, a function like the <code>sum</code>/<code>min</code>/<code>max</code> builtins that is written in C and can use the underlying C-level <code>tp_next</code> directly on a list is quite efficient at iterating a list, and is much less efficient with a generator that has to yield through the interpreter on every iteration; this more than cancels out the list allocation overhead.</p>
<p>I don't think we should over-pivot here based on current CPython performance, as performance characteristics change over time, and there's a reasonable possibility that faster-cpython may be able to improve the performance of generators in future versions. And even today, the generator version will be much more memory-efficient for large data than the comprehension one.</p>
<p>But I do want to double-check: given the above performance context, do we still think it makes sense to extend this autofix to <code>sum</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code>? The fix is semantically unsafe, it will probably make performance a bit worse, and it will improve memory usage.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm convinced of the &quot;unsafety&quot; from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3259#issuecomment-1454335988 — I feel like we might have other safe fixes that can be broken by operator overloads and global state. Is there more that makes it semantically unsafe?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wow, learned a lot from your comment -- thank you!</p>
<p>I think the &quot;unsafety&quot; is okay given that we already have the same problem (in theory) with <code>any</code> and <code>all</code>, unless I'm mistaken. I care more about whether we should recommend a pattern that fares worse on the microbenchmarks. I'm leaning towards saying &quot;yes, we should still add <code>sum</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code>&quot;, since (1) it <em>does</em> improve memory usage (so it's not totally negative), (2) the performance hit is likely non-critical (though, on that note, we should improve the existing docs), and (3) it is a &quot;simplification&quot; of the user's code to pass the generator directly.</p>
<p>Perhaps we leave this as an open question for a day or so, though, to give others on the issue time to chime in.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think there's more than that; the unsafety is due to laziness. With the comprehension version, the value expression (i.e. <code>expr</code> in <code>sum([expr for x in y])</code>) is evaluated eagerly for all elements in the inner iterable first, and then the resulting values are processed one by one by the outer fold function (<code>sum</code> or <code>min</code> or <code>max</code>). With the generator version, the value expression is lazily evaluated one item at a time and then immediately processed by the fold function. This ordering difference can be seen in @matthewlloyd's example. For this difference to be observable, there does need to be some kind of shared (not necessarily global) state between the elements, and folding of an element needs to have a side effect on that state, which I think does imply an override of some magic method (either addition or comparison.)</p>
<p>The existing autofix for <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> is much more unsafe, for the same reason it can provide a perf win: short-circuiting. This unsafety doesn't require any magic methods with shared state, it just requires any kind of externally visible side effect of iteration at all, because with the short-circuiting generator version, that side effect may just not happen for a bunch of items in the iterable.</p>
<p>My feeling is that unsafety is unsafety, even if you have to use advanced features of the language to trigger it -- people stretch Python in all kinds of ways! So I would consider this autofix unsafe in all variants. But I'm not opposed to extending it anyway! It makes sense to me that lots of code might not really care about the perf either way and may as well just be simpler.</p>
<p>I'll push a docs-only PR for now to clarify the current docs, and wait a day or so on the actual autofix extension.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agree with @carljm's insightful and well presented analysis. Thanks for fixing the original docs - yes, the <code>range(0, 1000)</code> was accidental - good catch, in hindsight, 40x was too good to be true.</p>
<p>Also agree with @charliermarsh's comment &quot;yes, we should still add sum, min, and max&quot; and the reasoning. The performance penalty is small and may change as CPython evolves, and I wonder to what extent it's offset by time savings at the next GC due to the reduced memory consumption. I also like the simpler code.</p>
<p>I think they should all be marked unsafe, as the &quot;all&quot; and &quot;any&quot; fixes can change both execution extent and order, and the others at least the order. If there are other autofixes currently marked as safe which could similarly change execution semantics in the context of dunder overload magic (with or without side effects on shared state), given how widespread that is, my vote would be to mark them unsafe too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Attached PR adds <code>sum</code>, <code>min</code>, and <code>max</code> as requested in the initial issue here.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to call that complete for this issue, and defer itertools and more_itertools funcs. One thought there (thanks @AlexWaygood) is that in the future if ruff gains type support, we could do this generally for any function typed as taking an iterable, which would naturally adapt to future additions to itertools. That seems a lot nicer than hardcoding lists of functions for modules that may change over time.</p>
