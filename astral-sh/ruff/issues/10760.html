<p>Using the latest Ruff version (0.3.5), my configuration to ignore rule Q000 (&quot;Single quotes found but double quotes preferred&quot;) is no longer respected.</p>
<p>Here's an example file <code>test.py</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">test = 'hello, world'
</code></pre>
<p>And configuration <code>ruff.toml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[lint]

select = [
   &quot;Q&quot;, # flake8-quotes
]

ignore = [
    &quot;Q000&quot;,  # Single quotes found but double quotes preferred
]
</code></pre>
<p>Using version 0.3.5 I get output:</p>
<pre><code>(main) C:\Users\VA\test&gt;ruff version
ruff 0.3.5 (200ebeebd 2024-04-01)

(main) C:\Users\VA\test&gt;ruff check
test.py:1:8: Q000 Single quotes found but double quotes preferred
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>This only occurs on version 0.3.5, and is not present in 0.3.4</p>
<pre><code>(main) C:\Users\VA\test&gt;ruff version
ruff 0.3.4 (5062572ac 2024-03-21)

(main) C:\Users\VA\test&gt;ruff check
All checks passed!
