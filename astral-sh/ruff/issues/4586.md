# Request: `RET504` autofix

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-05-22 17:33_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

It seems like `RET504` should be autofixable, but as of `ruff==0.0.269`, it's not autofixable.

```python
def foo() -> int:
    ret = 5
    return ret
```

```bash
> ruff --select=RET504 a.py
a.py:3:12: RET504 Unnecessary variable assignment before `return` statement
```

```python
def foo() -> int:
    return 5
```

The request is simple: adding an autofix rule for `RET504` to `ruff`

**Motivation**

I want to enable `RET504` in a monorepo, but it requires 200+ manual fixes 🥲

I actually searched for a prior request for this, I must have been blind 😄
