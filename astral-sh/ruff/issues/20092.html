            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sometimes my editor's autocomplete will import items from test code even though the original definition is in the application code. I would like a rule that would flag these sort of imports. Almost like marking specific modules(like tests) as private.</p>
<p>Are there any existing rules that would cover this situation?</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-python"># src/my_app/utils.py
def foo():
    ...
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># src/my_app/__main__.py
from tests.test_utils import foo  # Lint rule would flag this
...
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python"># tests/test_utils.py
from my_app.utils import foo
...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds familiar but I couldn't find the related issue. This makes some sense to me, requiring a specific path to a given import, but I don't think we could really implement this at the moment since Ruff only analyzes single files at a time. It might be a better fit once we have access to ty's module resolver.</p>
