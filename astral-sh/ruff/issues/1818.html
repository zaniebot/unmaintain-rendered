            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey!</p>
<p>Firstly thanks for creating &amp; mantaining this project, really impressed so far.</p>
<p>One thing I'd personally really like to see is the <code>balanced_wrapping</code> isort feature which turns the following imports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pkg import (
    mod1,
    mod2,
)
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pkg import mod1, mod2
</code></pre>
<p>Link to isort <a href="https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#balanced-wrapping">documentation</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think a few more examples would be helpful. I'm also kind of wondering if you'll get the behavior you're looking for with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.isort]
split-on-trailing-comma = false
</code></pre>
<p>Because we <em>do</em> try to fit the import on a single line if it fits, but by default, we <em>don't</em> remove &quot;magic&quot; trailing commas, which would prevent us from squeezing the import in the first case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome, it's my pleasure :)</p>
<p>Given that: I don't <em>think</em> we need to implement <code>balanced_wrapping</code> specifically because we only really support <code>--profile=black</code>, and so we don't preserve formats like this (from the <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/isort#intelligently-balanced-multi-line-imports">docs</a>) anyway:</p>
