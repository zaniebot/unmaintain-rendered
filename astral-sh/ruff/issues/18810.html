            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Existing rule justification: &quot;Enum values should be unique. Non-unique values are redundant and likely a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>The existing rule only checks for classes that subclass <code>enum.Enum</code>. Python 3.11 added <code>StrEnum</code>, which should adhere to the same behavior as regular Enums.</p>
<p>This issue's proposal is to flag non-unique <code>StrEnum</code> values the same way that is done for <code>Enum</code>.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Could also consider <code>IntEnum</code>, but that may have been intentionally omitted when this rule was first created.</li>
<li>Could make this a setting, but that feels overkill.</li>
<li>Happy to put up a pull request for this if the suggestion is well received.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this makes sense and should (hopefully) be straightforward to implement, but I'd be interested in any other thoughts.</p>
<p>I think this would also need to be a preview change since it's an expansion of a stable rule.</p>
