<p>This code (in a much more complex form, specifically as a factory method for a class) works fine in production code, and I see no reason the linter shouldn't just see the name from right above.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe the above syntax is only valid when importing <code>annotations</code> from <code>__future__</code> (https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/). See https://play.ruff.rs/89d2b517-496d-473d-8208-25afdf2ac177</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with Micha - you could also surround the annotation with quotation marks (<a href="https://play.ruff.rs/bfd71d97-6d9a-4385-b945-6c571d3d8d65">playground</a>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But it sounds like you're seeing an undesired lint with your production code (which presumably can't have a syntax error in it!) Would it be possible to find a version of the more complex code that produces the undesired lint?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Huh, I was literally just going to comment that pandas does literally this here https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v2.2.3/pandas/core/frame.py#L1805-L1931</p>
<p>but it doesn't trigger the same error, and you're right, they import annotations from <strong>future</strong></p>
<p>Is that the intended way to do this? Python allows this as-is, right?</p>
<p>@dylwil3 Indeed, I realised now that quoting the annotation is exactly what <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> does lol
I'm not entirely understanding why this makes a difference,</p>
<p>As for the production code, it's really very similar in structure, just with more arguments &amp; other irrelevant things.
It gets the underline in vscode from ruff, but just runs fine with actual python.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Huh, I think something is being weird here, you're right, running this example is indeed failing.
I'm afraid I accidentally found a hole in our tests :fearful:
And I was mistaken, it's not yet production code, it's a refactor in progress pulling a function like this</p>

class Myclass:
    def __init__(self, params):
        ...

def create_myclass(params) -&gt; Myclass:

<p>into the class as a factory method, my bad.</p>
<p>All right, TIL about how annotations (don't) work in python, sorry for the confusion and thanks!</p>
