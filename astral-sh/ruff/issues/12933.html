            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The docs for rule linting rule D203 fell afoul of last week's black upgrade.</p>
<p>In this commit black was run: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/597c5f912411725e17970fe9d34de4b0c33a8e85</p>
<p>Which formatted the example code for the lint, and removed the blank line that the example is supposed to be showcasing: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/597c5f912411725e17970fe9d34de4b0c33a8e85#diff-2f8b0cca706f79d3614697888a3fb04bad222bb0f5849b08c2411ad112ea3351L121</p>
<p>The two examples now appear equal:</p>

<p>https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/one-blank-line-before-class/</p>
<p>This was released yesterday in 0.6.0 and the website was updated, making the examples on the website now invalid</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did a quick scan of the black reformat and I think these might be the only two rules affected.
All the others are just changing the location of the <code>...</code> filler</p>
<pre><code>/// def foo(*args: int):
///     ...
/// def foo(*args: int): ...
</code></pre>
<p>which, to be honest, I kinda prefer it on the next line down to indicate &quot;here is the function&quot; rather than being on the same line, even if they are semantically equal</p>
