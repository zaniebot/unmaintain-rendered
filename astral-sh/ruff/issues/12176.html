            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To quote Micha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's say you have a very long document and the syntax error is outside the visible area. It might now be unclear to users why the manually triggered action does <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>RustRover does show an error when running <code>rustfmt</code> failed because of a syntax error and I find this useful information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also think this is a useful indicator but might be difficult to achieve for a language server. This can be achieved at least for code actions using the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#codeActionTriggerKind"><code>CodeActionTriggerKind</code></a> but for other requests like formatting and workspace command it's difficult without having full control over both the client and the server.</p>

<p>Yeah, good point. There's also the fact that most editors have a way to signal the users that there are errors in this document in a toolbar like UI even though the visible part of the document doesn't contain it.</p>
<p>This kinda of changes my opinion about this which is I'm not sure if it's possible or worth adding this. (marking it as &quot;wish&quot; for now)</p>
