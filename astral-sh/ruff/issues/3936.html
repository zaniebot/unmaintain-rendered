            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff catches all of these as <code>UP035</code> violations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import (
    Container,
    Callable,
    AsyncIterable,
    Mapping,
    Coroutine,
    OrderedDict,
)
</code></pre>
<p>However, none of these trigger that rule:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import typing

a: typing.Container
b: typing.Callable
c: typing.AsyncIterable
d: typing.Mapping
e: typing.Coroutine
f: typing.OrderedDict

</code></pre>
<p>This isn't something supported by pyupgrade (as the autofix would be quite complicated), but it seems like it would be worth a warning. <code>flake8-pep585</code> catches these.</p>
<p>On ruff playground:
https://play.ruff.rs/#N4KABGBEDOCmA2sDGAXSAuMBtSBVACpALoA04UKAhgE4DmsKAtAG6zXQCWA9gHYZQAHAJ4BmAIxjIIAL4ASeRwC2ArtRRgUQgRx60QISpk3bdAOgDCvKjrYgARka07aFyvHiU7iEEkcmXAILQQjxIAJIobJ7eACZ+zqYAspQC-iCw8WaW1FwArig2IABmmS4A8tQxbLAxACIcqPpFOYoaTrpgSipqYAAU5BCWPNY8bGQQg24eXrDjE0Eh4ZHU0bMDYMmpznODqnkFoztgFVXUNfWoZACUQA</p>
<p>Note that the names I listed are just examples, there are probably more pep 585 names with the same issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that we should flag these. They can probably go under the existing <code>pyupgrade</code> rules (even if we can't fix them right now). We do have most of the machinery we'd need to fix these, but that can be a separate effort.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have something similar with the latest version - I used a library which has moved some modules into different sections and ruff did not catch it while my editor (vim with pyright) explicitly showed an error.</p>
