            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The D205 rule, which is certainly a useful one to have, doesn't have an especially helpful message from Ruff.</p>
<p>Minimum example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def foo() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A placeholder docstring
    that will trigger D205
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The error that ruff will generate from this is</p>
<pre><code>D205 1 blank line required between summary line and description
  --&gt; utils.py:18:5
   |
17 |   def foo() -&gt; None:
18 | /     &quot;&quot;&quot;
19 | |     A placeholder docstring
20 | |     that will trigger D205
21 | |     &quot;&quot;&quot;
   | |_______^
   |
help: Insert single blank line

</code></pre>
<p>However, this isn't really a helpful message, and doesn't really let the user know what needed to be changed. Should the blank line be inserted like this?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def foo() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    A placeholder docstring
    that will trigger D205
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>or like this?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def foo() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A placeholder docstring
    that will trigger D205

    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>or like this? (This fixes D205, but the docstring is now totally mangled!)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def foo() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A placeholder docstring

    that will trigger D205
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The correct fix would have been</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def foo() -&gt; None:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A placeholder docstring that will trigger D205
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>but the error message doesn't provide the necessary hints. The ruff documentation for D205, however, does have the necessary information:</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/">PEP 257</a> recommends that multi-line docstrings consist of &quot;a summary line just like a one-line docstring, followed by a blank line, followed by a more elaborate description.&quot;</p>
<p>Suggestion: Have the error description just repeat the above verbatim, since it clearly indicates what needs to be done.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the whole excerpt from the docs might be a bit long, but making the <code>help</code> message something like <code>Insert a single blank line after the first line of the docstring</code> might help.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem is that inserting a single blank line isn't the fix! In this case, the problem is that the docstring should have become a single line docstring, since it's just the one-line summary split across multiple lines. My guess is that some code looks like this to try to respect terminal line limits. How about <code>Multi-line docstrings should be a one-line summary, a blank line, and a detailed description.</code></p>
