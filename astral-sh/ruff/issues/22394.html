            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>Path.write_text</code> (and other functions that use <code>io.TextIOWrapper</code>) is completely broken by default on windows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from pathlib import Path

path = Path(&quot;foo.txt&quot;)
path.write_text(&quot;foo\r\nbar&quot;)
print(path.read_bytes())  # b'foo\r\r\nbar'
</code></pre>
<p>python tries to be clever by &quot;fixing&quot; <code>\n</code> on windows (which <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/git/comments/7mg1q1/gits_crlf_handling_is_the_source_of_all_modern/">hasn't even been necessary for many years now</a>), but it doesn't even check whether the <code>\n</code> is already preceded by a <code>\r</code>, which causes it to write <code>\r\r\n</code> to the file.</p>
<p>i opened an issue for this at https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/143428, but it seems unlikely that it will be fixed because it could be considered a breaking change. it would be nice if ruff had a rule to warn about this behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This does feel like a footgun but forcing <code>newline=''</code> on every <code>write_text</code> call also feels annoying, especially because the newline conversionts between reading and writing files must stay in sync.</p>
<p>So I think this really comes down to finding a good heuristics, but I suspect that this might require very extensive data flow analysis if done properly (without too many false negatives)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>alternatively it could recommend using <code>write_bytes</code> instead. i get that people might find it annoying but the rule can easily be disabled. personally i find this to be such an egregious bug that i'd definitely prefer <em>all</em> usages to be reported.</p>

<p>I think this is only the case if it is known that the text doesn't come from a <code>read_text</code> call or they end up with converted newlines.</p>
