# Unexpected jemalloc output messages

---

_Issue opened by @pamelafox on 2023-02-21 17:55_

I'm running:

```
ruff 0.0.249
```

With these settings:

```
[tool.ruff]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "UP"]
target-version = "py311"
line-length = 120
```

Inside a Dev Container in VS Code using the Dev Containers Remote extension.

When I run ruff commands, I see some additional output:

```
vscode ➜ /workspace (sayings) $ ruff --fix src/routes.py 
<jemalloc>: MADV_DONTNEED does not work (memset will be used instead)
<jemalloc>: (This is the expected behaviour if you are running under QEMU)
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).
```

Is it expected for me to see that jemalloc output? It feels more like a detail for ruff maintainers. I do realize I'm running under qemu due to the Dev Container, but the rest of the message sounds rust-specific. It does not mean much of anything to me, the unknowing ruff user. :D

Oh yeah, it would be nice not to show that :) I'll look into it!
