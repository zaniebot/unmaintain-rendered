# `S113` for requests.Session

---

_Issue opened by @osauldmy on 2025-03-11 09:07_

### Summary

When using `requests.get()` or similar without `timeout` specified, `S113` `request-without-timeout` gets triggered.

If one uses `requests.Session` and does not specify timeout, rule is not triggered. Is it by design? Or is it better to place this functionality into new rule specifically for `requests.Session`? Thanks

It looks like this is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14102. In short, this is a bug, but we need improved type inference to solve it.

Thanks for the report!
