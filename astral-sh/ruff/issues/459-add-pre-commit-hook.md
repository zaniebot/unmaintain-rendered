# Add pre commit hook

---

_@lusmoura_

In order to use Ruff as a hook in other projects, the repo needs to contain a pre-commit-hooks.yaml file configuring the new hook.

Documentation [here](https://pre-commit.com/#new-hooks)

Pre-commit hook is available in a separate repository to avoid the need for project compilation:

@lusmoura - if you have any issues using the pre-commit hook, don’t hesitate to ask!
