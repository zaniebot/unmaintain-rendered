Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>After some refactoring, several imports were removed and this was left:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from foo import (
    bar,
    baz,
)

bar()
baz()
</code></pre>
<p>With isort this is nicely formatted as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from foo import bar, baz

bar()
baz()
</code></pre>
<p>But ruff does no formatting here and keeps the file as is.</p>
<p>Ruff 0.0.284 was executed as <code>ruff check --fix --select I test.py</code> with no config, isort as <code>isort test.py</code> with not config.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think you’re looking for this setting: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort-split-on-trailing-comma. Ruff defaults it to true while isort does not. (It’s a point of confusion as the isort docs state it defaults to true for their Black configuration, but doesn’t seem to do so in practice.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, that's it. While reading through the doc, I didn't realize that something called <code>split</code> will actually toggle folding.</p>
<p>And isort documentation is indeed wrong on this, I've created https://github.com/PyCQA/isort/pull/2163 for that.</p>
