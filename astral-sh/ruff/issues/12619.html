  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.

<p>In https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/9842, they renamed <code>too-many-positional</code> to <code>too-many-positional-arguments</code> and implemented it.</p>
<p>If we at some point implement support for full names in addition to the codes we support already, this will affect us too.</p>
<p>PS: What’s the schedule for this rule coming out of preview?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Annoyingly, these are strictly-speaking <em>parameters</em> rather than <em>arguments</em>... but the new name seems strictly better than the old one, and it's useful to have the same name as pylint. PR welcome!</p>
