# [red-knot] Set right durability for inputs

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-07-14 20:34_

Salsa doesn't support setting the durability when creating input ingredients yet. We should PR support for this (there has been talk for adding a builder for creating ingredients).

We should then review File (non workspace files should have a high durability), Program, Workspace, and Package
