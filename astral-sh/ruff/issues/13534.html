<p>This looks like an explicit string concatenation, but it's actually an enumeration of strings.
I wish ruff would detect this</p>
<p>It seems it should work when there is the following configuration</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-implicit-str-concat]
allow-multiline = false
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's probably something a type checker can find very easily because the &quot;+&quot; operator isn't defined for string. Overall, I would prefer to implement this as a more generic rule where <code>+</code> is used on an operand that doesn't support it rather than special casing it to strings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @MichaReiser. This is something that is already implemented by existing Python type checkers and will be supported by red-knot when it's ready. I think it's best for us to leave it for now in Ruff. But thanks for the suggestion!</p>
