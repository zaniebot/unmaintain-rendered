# [red-knot] Compare expression inference - BytesLiteral

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-10-09 07:34_

Same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13634 but for bytes literal.

There might be a way to unify some of the implementation by making use of Rust's `Eq` ane `PartialOrd` traits.
