<p>I noticed that the rule <a href="https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify#SIM120">SIM120</a> from <code>flake8-simplify</code> is not yet implemented. While this particular rule might become less relevant over time, I just today dealt with a legacy project which still had that issue.</p>
<p>I think this particular rule would lend itself to be automatically fixable too.</p>
<p>It would be great if it could be considered to implement this rule.</p>

Thanks for your report.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s right -- we support it under <code>pyupgrade</code>, rather than under <code>flake8-simplify</code>.</p>
