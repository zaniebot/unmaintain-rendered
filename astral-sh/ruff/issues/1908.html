            <div class="timeline-body"><p>People would have different opinions on this and probably worth a discussion.</p>
<p>With the rapid development happening in Ruff, occasionally I come back and enable the newly supported rules for my project because they all seem to be very useful. Some of them have caught actual bugs that I was not aware of previously.</p>
<p>I would argue that if a rule is supported by Ruff, then there's probably a good reason for it to be added in the first place and thus should be enforced by default.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's the other side of the argument where this can easily break people's CI/CD etc. That's why I was hoping there's an option as an alternative to specify for Ruff to enable all supported rules. But people should still be able to ignore/exclude rules with this option, if that makes sense.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It’s buried in there 😂 Maybe deserves a question in the FAQ. (Eventually we will completely rework the docs.)</p>
<p>Thank you, and thanks for using Ruff!</p>
