            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Today, I (mostly) wrote the following code:</p>
<pre><code>class BaseConverter:
    def to_html(self):
        return HTMLConverter()

    def _loads(self, string):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __call__(self):
        ...

def HTMLConverter(BaseConverter):
    def to_html(self):
        return self
    
    def _loads(self, string):
        return lxml.html.fromstring(string)
</code></pre>
<p>Did you spot the error? Obviously, the title of this issue is a big hint, but for the other ones, here is how to fix the code:</p>
<pre><code>- def HTMLConverter(BaseConverter):
+ class HTMLConverter(BaseConverter):
</code></pre>
<p>I think this kind of error can be detected by ruff, as the body of the <code>HTMLConverter</code> <em>function</em> only contains other functions and its sole argument is the name of a defined class.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s funny. We could probably support functions that only contain definitions. What do you think, @AlexWaygood?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think this is a reasonable request. I agree that a function that only contains other functions is almost certainly not what was intended, so I think it&#x27;s safe to flag it 😄</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, functions that only contain class definitions aren&#x27;t quite so clear cut, since they can still have side effects when they&#x27;re executed:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...   class Bar:
...     print(&#x27;yo&#x27;)
...     
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
yo
</code></pre>
<p>Though I suppose even for a function that only contains function definitions (and doesn&#x27;t return any of them), it&#x27;s hard to say <em>for sure</em> that it didn&#x27;t have any side effects, because of decorators:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; REGISTRY = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...   @REGISTRY.append
...   def bar(): pass
...     
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; REGISTRY
[&lt;function foo.&lt;locals&gt;.bar at 0x11b6a3370&gt;]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think exactly what the decision should be here depends on how many false positives we&#x27;d be willing to tolerate from this rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want it to have a &quot;pyflakes level of accuracy&quot;, where the rule has close to zero false positives, then we should <em>only</em> emit a diagnostic if we see a function where the only items in the function body are function definitions, and none of the inner functions have any decorators</li>
<li>If we&#x27;re prepared to accept more false positives from the rule -- because we want it to catch more errors -- then we could also emit the diagnostic even if some of the inner functions are decorated, or if some of the inner definitions are class definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while I&#x27;m supportive of adding a rule like this, I&#x27;m not 100% sure what exactly the rule should look like. @charliermarsh / @dhruvmanila -- any thoughts from you on that?</p>
