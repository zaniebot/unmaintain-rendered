            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Consider the following ruff config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
fix = true
unfixable = [&quot;F401&quot;, &quot;F841&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>F401 and F841 are added as unfixable so that ruff doesn't automatically remove violating lines on file save (it's set up in the editor for autoformat). I do want to enable them in my pre-commit config though. So what I have done is configure the ruff hook like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">      - id: ruff
        name: ruff
        entry: ruff
        args: [&quot;--fixable=F401,F841&quot;]
        require_serial: true
        language: system
        types: [python]
</code></pre>
<p>However, this makes ruff consider <strong>only</strong> those two codes as fixable. So I thought I could fix it by passing --unfixable=E501, for example, assuming that would override the value set in the ruff config. The doesn't seem to be the case though, ruff still does not fix the errors.</p>
<p>This does not depend on pre-commit btw, the same can be reproduced by just running ruff from CLI. Essentially, I'm looking for a way to overwrite unfixable, without using --isolated, because there is more config than the minimal example above.</p>
<p>Is there a generally recommended way to do this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would've expected <code>--unfixable=E501</code> to work. As a hacky workaround, could you try <code>--fixable=ALL,F401,F841</code>? If we add <code>--extend-fixable</code>, as requested today (hah) in https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/discussions/4272, then <code>--extend-fixable=F401,F841</code> would also work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the quick answer. It's not a coincidence, #4272 was opened by a colleague of mine, but I didn't know about it until now :smile:</p>
<p>Your suggested workaround works, it's even sufficient to pass <code>--fixable=ALL</code>. An <code>extend-fixable</code> would be great though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, hah, that's funny :)</p>
<p>I'll keep this open to track <code>--extend-fixable</code>, it really should exist to mirror the <code>--extend-select</code> variants.</p>
