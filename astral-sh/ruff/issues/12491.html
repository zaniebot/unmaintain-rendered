<p>I'd like to see a rule that allows for the banning of &quot;autouse&quot; pytest fixtures.</p>
<p>https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/fixtures.html#autouse-fixtures-fixtures-you-don-t-have-to-request</p>
<p>In a large codebase, the overuse of auto-use fixtures can make reasoning about tests very difficult and cause a lot of unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for <code>autouse</code> fixtures in <code>conftest.py</code> files as they just become automatically applied to any tests in scope of the <code>conftest.py</code> file.</p>
<p>It would make sense as a <code>PT</code> rule.
