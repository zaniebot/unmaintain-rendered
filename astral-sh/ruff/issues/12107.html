<p>I was looking at ruff and rustc for inspo for lexing and the cursor files are pretty similar:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👋 I went on quite the hunt trying to see if there was context about this. As far as I can tell nobody talked about the rustc lexer and they probably would have if they based the design on it? I'm curious to hear from @MichaReiser though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, we absolutely should.</p>
<p>I was fairly certain that I mentioned in some comment that the implementation is derived from Rust in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4922 (inline comment or at least on the PR), but I didn't!</p>
