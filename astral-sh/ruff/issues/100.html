            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not critical but this could be somewhat useful for autofixing. Similar to <a href="https://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor/blob/a9c5f8d119d617c891b7ba0aa8bc046b8af01e84/astor/code_gen.py">astor</a>. The main issue with AST-to-code generation is that it's impossible to preserve formatting, including comments and docstrings, since those aren't captured in the AST. That's a big limitation, and means that you can really only use this for reconstructing small subtrees.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(The solution to the 'formatting and comments' problem is to use a CST like in LibCST or an FST like in <a href="https://redbaron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">RedBaron</a>.)</p>
