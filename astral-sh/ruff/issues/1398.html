            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Woo, that is amazing. But I worry that as more and more instructions are added to the README file, it will become difficult to maintain, although it is easy to generate a book.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I notice that <code>ruff</code> intends to use <code>mkdocs</code> to build the documentation, but it looks like it just moves the entire README file to the <code>docs</code> folder. For a better reading experience, it would be nice to have a script that splits the README into multiple chapter files (or a one-off, with subsequent updates made directly under docs). If possible I would create a pull request for this purpose.</p>
