            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice if the flake8-todo rules affecting TODO formatting (TD002-7) supported the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_task-tags"><code>lint.task-tags</code> setting</a> rather than just the hard-coded &quot;directives&quot; supported by the original rules in flake8-todo. As it stands, there's no way to add enforcement for custom tags, which would be helpful for teams which use them and want to make sure they're used consistently. It also &quot;incorrectly&quot; flags my maybe-todo comments (e.g. <code># TODO?: switch to using fooble instead</code>) as missing a colon. 🙂</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you mean that TD001 should flag tags other than <code>FIXME</code> and <code>XXX</code>? (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/invalid-todo-tag/)</p>
<p>Or that rules like TD002 should <em>allow</em> anything in <code>task-tags</code> (e.g., <code>FIXME(foo)</code> should be ok?), and enforce authorship on them? (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-todo-author/)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah! You're right, TD001 doesn't make sense that way; my mistake, I'll fix the description.</p>
<p>No, I was indeed referring to e.g. being able to require <code># TECHDEBT(author)</code> instead of just <code># TECHDEBT</code> if TD002 is selected or, in my case, <code># TODO?: some rationale</code> instead of just <code># TODO?</code> with TD004, TD005, and TD007.</p>
<p>I think being able to keep track of when task tags are being used inconsistently would be a &quot;nice to have&quot; feature for projects which use multiple tags with different meanings.</p>
