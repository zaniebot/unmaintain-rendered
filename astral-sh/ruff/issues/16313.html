<p>Please consider renaming settings to make their names as easy to read as possible.  I recognize that historically, the &quot;flake8-bandit&quot; plugin&#x27;s rules are provided by Ruff.  But contemporary users may not have ever even used or configured flake8-bandit.</p>
<p>Consider settings like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-errmsg]
max-string-length = 40

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-bandit]
check-typed-exception = true
</code></pre>
<p>Would this be better?</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint.exceptions]  # These both have to do with exceptions, so why not group them?
max-string-length = 40
disallow-try-except = true  # Name is closer to meaning.
</code></pre>
<p>In general, is it really important to keep the &quot;flake8&quot;, &quot;pylint&quot;, &quot;pyflakes&quot; prefixes anywhere, or are they an anachronism?</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s an hard to decipher option:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-gettext]
extend-function-names = [&quot;ugettetxt&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>How about</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint.internationalization]  # or i18n or just gettext?
extend-function-names = [&quot;ugettetxt&quot;]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense to me and I completely agree that Ruff&#x27;s settings should be semantically grouped longterm. However, I do think that Ruff&#x27;s current setting structure is the right fit today because the rules are also grouped by upstream linters. It makes it easier to discover the right setting given a specific rule.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll close this because it&#x27;s something we should tackle as part of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1774">astral-sh/ruff#1774</a> because, IMO, it&#x27;s important that settings and the rule structure align.</p>

<p>Makes sense, thanks for the thoughtful reply.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the rule categorization as well, and I recognize that you want to do the work of reorganizing the rules with the settings.</p>
<p>I guess I thought that the settings could be done independently since in my codebases, I just include every rule, but only have a handful of settings.  But I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter since your end goal is perfect for me.</p>
