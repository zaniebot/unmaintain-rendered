<p>Like much of the community I'm pushing for everyone to upgrade to versions of Python supported by the Python team. Like some of the community, though, I'm <em>also</em> sometimes stuck running my code in an environment running an older version of Python supported by the OS distribution. I'd much appreciate Ruff's help maintaining such code.</p>
<p>If you'll indulge me slightly missing the point of the most obvious Python sketch…</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would need to go through and do a proper accounting of the things we might break if you were to run with <code>--target-version py37</code> over code that needs to be Python 3.6 compatible.</p>
<p>My initial reaction is that if your code is intended to run in Python 3.6 and all later versions, Ruff <em>should</em> be able to parse it, and there are no immediate autofix behaviors that come to mind as problematic for your code.</p>
<p>(If you were writing code that had to be Python 3.6 compatible, but didn't need to be Python 3.7 compatible, that'd be different, since 3.7 introduced backwards-incompatible syntax changes.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That is to say: it might be totally fine to run with <code>--target-version py37</code> for code that's intended to be Python 3.6+ compatible, but I'm not 100% certain right now. (If you do so, it'd be safest not to enable the Pyupgrade rules which are the most prominent user of the target version.)</p>
