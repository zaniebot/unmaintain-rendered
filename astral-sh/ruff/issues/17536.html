            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The LSP protocol defines an optional <code>tag</code> field on <code>Diagnostic</code> that stores a list of <code>DiagnosticTag</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">/**
 * The diagnostic tags.
 *
 * @since 3.15.0
 */
export namespace DiagnosticTag {
	/**
	 * Unused or unnecessary code.
	 *
	 * Clients are allowed to render diagnostics with this tag faded out
	 * instead of having an error squiggle.
	 */
	export const Unnecessary: 1 = 1;
	/**
	 * Deprecated or obsolete code.
	 *
	 * Clients are allowed to rendered diagnostics with this tag strike through.
	 */
	export const Deprecated: 2 = 2;

export type DiagnosticTag = 1 | 2;
</code></pre>
<p>We should extend our diagnostic system to support diagnostic tags (we can name them differently if we want) and funnel them all the way through to the LSP generated diagnostic. I don't think we have any use cases for it today (except maybe <code>REDUNDANT_CAST</code> but rendering the entire cast as faded out seems incorrect) but there are at least a few use cases in Ruff where this will be useful.</p>
<p>@BurntSushi / @ntBre This is something we could open for external contributors if we have a clear idea of the design (a <code>tags</code> field on <code>Annotation</code> with the two variants)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/">LSP specification</a>, it looks like <code>DiagnosticTag</code> is coupled with a single <code>Range</code>, so I think I agree that the right place for this in <em>our</em> diagnostic model is on <code>Annotation</code>.</p>
<p>So probably defining our own <code>DiagnosticTag</code> enum and then <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/83d5ad8983466786aca7f66a1c25dfc1891ff1c3/crates/ruff_db/src/diagnostic/mod.rs#L342">adding a method on <code>Annotation</code></a> seems like the right way to go here.</p>
<p>With that said, I don't believe we have any code that converts our &quot;new&quot; diagnostic model to LSP diagnostics. It might make sense to hold off on this until we have an MVP there.</p>

<p>We do here (except that it uses <code>concise_message</code> but that should prevent us from making this change)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>Unnecessary</code> tag is usually used for unused parameters, unreachable code, etc. The <code>Deprecated</code> would be used for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warnings.deprecated"><code>@deprecated</code> decorator</a>.</p>
