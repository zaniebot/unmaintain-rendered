<p>I tried it in Black's playground and Ruff's behavior matches Black's.</p>
<p>Pasting the different strings into the REPL produces the following output</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(r&quot;\&quot;&quot;)
\&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(r'\&quot;')
\&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(r'&quot;')
&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>What's important to note is that the <code>\</code> is necessary to escape the <code>&quot;</code>, but it also changes the string's value (the backslash is preserved, unlike in regular strings). Ruff can't remove the <code>\</code> because of that, even when the string uses single quotes.</p>
<p>Based on this, I think Ruff's/Black's quote choice is consistent: They use the preferred quote style (most commonly <code>&quot;</code> unless configured otherwise) except when using the preferred quote style requires more escapes. In this case, the <code>\</code> isn't just an escape, it's semantically important. Because of that, using <code>'</code> or <code>&quot;</code>requires the exact same amount of quotes, in which case both formatters use the preferred quote style.</p>

<p>Correct. Actually, if we're being technical the <code>\</code> <strong>doesn't</strong> escape the <code>&quot;</code>, because there are no escapes in raw strings. While in a non-raw string, <code>\&quot;</code> is an escaped double quote, in a raw string it's simply a backslash followed by a double quote. The non-raw equivalent of that string is <code>'\\&quot;'</code> or <code>&quot;\\\&quot;&quot;</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on this, I think Ruff's/Black's quote choice is consistent:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't entirely <em>disagree</em>, but it's consistent in the context of what I would argue are an incomplete set of criteria.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>See, the way I look at it, the reason to use single quotes around a string containing double quotes <strong>isn't</strong> primarily to avoid extra escapes...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, the <code>\</code> isn't just an escape,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not an escape at all.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The main reason to use different quote styles around a string containing quotes, to me, is because it makes it easier to differentiate the outer quotes from the internal ones. It's the same reason we switch from double to single quotes in English, &quot;When we're embedding 'quotations inside quotations'.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is why I think Ruff (and probably Black) is also wrong to want to turn this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print('&quot;He\'s in \'ere.&quot;')
</code></pre>
<p>into this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;\&quot;He's in 'ere.\&quot;&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Exact same <strong>number</strong> of escapes either way, but having escaped double quotes immediately adjacent to outer double quotes is much less easily parseable (for humans) than having escaped single quotes deep inside the string, but unescaped double quotes directly adjacent to unescaped single quotes at the outer extremes.</p>

<p>Actually, I take that back. It <em>is</em> an escape, but only because the raw string rules make a special exception for escaped quotes. From the STRINGS help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even in a raw literal, quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the result; for example, <code>r&quot;\&quot;&quot;</code> is a valid string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; <code>r&quot;\&quot;</code> is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes).  Specifically, <em>a raw literal cannot end in a single backslash</em> (since the backslash would escape the following quote character).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that, unlike in non-raw strings, <code>r'\&quot;'</code> and <code>r&quot;\&quot;&quot;</code> happen to be equivalent, is something they don't address.</p>

<p>I can see the reasoning behind this. I worry that it's too complicated for an auto-formatter.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's important for auto-formatter that the result isn't surprising for users. Users should understand the heuristics. Too clever heuristics and users won't understand why the formatter formats their code in a specific way, which can be frustrating</li>
<li>Implementing your proposal would require coming up with a heuristic to a) match quotes: There's no formal grammar in strings that require that quotes are balanced and b) decide what are outer and what are inner quotes.</li>
<li>The style applied by Ruff/Black aligns with auto formatter in other ecosystems (e.g. Prettier). Consistent cross-ecosystem behavior has the advantage that the formatter output is less surprising to users and matches the code that most users read, making it easier for them to read the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why I'd like to keep the formatting as is for now.</p>
