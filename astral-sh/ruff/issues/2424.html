            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a custom flake8 plugin that's specific for a project (it wouldn't make sense to port it to Ruff ;) ). I've moved everything else to Ruff, and this still is much faster than flake8 used to be running everything! But I'm unable to enable RUF100 since this is an unknown directive.</p>
<p>Would it make sense to have a user-settable &quot;known-noqa&quot; or &quot;ignore-noqa&quot; setting that could tell RUF100 to ignore these noqa statements? Or should I just add RUF100 to the noqa? Another idea that would help in some cases (including this one) would be to split unknown and unused noqa cleanup.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a setting for this! You should be able to mark codes that Ruff doesn't know about, but should respect, via <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#external"><code>external</code></a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's exactly what I was looking for, thanks! Sorry for not finding it, I assumed it would be mentioned in RUF 100's description, I guess.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What about support for globs/regex in <code>external</code>? Right now if I'm using dlint in my project I'd need to add 38 separate rules to the list and update it each time dlint changes something.</p>
