# RUF001: exclude `×` by default

---

_Issue opened by @bersbersbers on 2023-09-10 06:35_

From https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4859#issuecomment-1576776381, I see that you seem to consider VS Code as (one) reference to determine which characters should be reported in `RUF001`. VS Code does not flag `×`, so maybe ruff should allow it by default, too.

Otherwise, I am fine with adding `allowed-confusables = ["×"]`.

Yeah our behavior should match VS Code. Will take a look.

It looks like VS Code does flag it... But we may be enforcing this in places VS Code does not. Is there any other context you can provide on this one?

Yes, I think I can! I am using this setting, which seems to be the reason why VS Code does not report the use of `×`:

```json
"editor.unicodeHighlight.allowedLocales": {
    "de": true,
},
```

Once I remove this setting, `×` are reported again, just as they are by `ruff`.

In fact,

- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/base/common/strings.ts#L1081C15524-L1081C15527 has ` 215,` (only) in `_default, es, fr, it, ja, ko, pl, pt-BR, qps-ploc, ru, tr, zh-hans, zh-hant`, but not in `de`.
- https://github.com/hediet/vscode-unicode-data/blob/main/out/ambiguous-formatted.json looks similar.

I have no idea on what basis these are filled, but that explains why I did not see the highlight. I think this can be closed.
