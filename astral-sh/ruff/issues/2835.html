            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <code>.pyi</code> files, everything is stubbed out like:</p>
<pre><code>def foo() -&gt; int: ...

class MyClass: ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is how black formats them, but ruff is upset with them.</p>
<p>Example here: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/actions/runs/4158646856/jobs/7194009425</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
