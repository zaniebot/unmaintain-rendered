* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<pre><code class="language-python">my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
for a in my_set:
    if a == &quot;2&quot;:
        my_set.remove(a)
        break
</code></pre>
<p>runs fine, but is flagged by PLE4703. If the break statement was not here, it would indeed be an error. However, since it is added after the remove statement before the iterator is accessed again, it is valid.</p>
<p>Still an issue on <code>ruff 0.4.7</code></p>
