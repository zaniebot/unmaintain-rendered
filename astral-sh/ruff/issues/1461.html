<ul>
<li>[ ] [error code TBD] implicitly concatenated string literals on one line</li>
<li>[ ] [error code TBD] implicitly concatenated string literals over continuation line</li>
<li>[ ] [error code TBD] explicitly concatenated string should be implicitly concatenated</li>
</ul>
<p>I was looking at integrating <code>ruff</code> into pip's linting pipeline, and noticed that the specific flake8 plugins that we use aren't implemented already. This specific one is useful to flag when black reformats strings to implicitly concat by reflowing lines.</p>

<p>Happy to implement this, looks relatively straightforward assuming there are no relevant / subtle differences in the tokenization.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I used the same codes as the originating plugin (<code>ISC001</code>, <code>ISC002</code>, and <code>ISC003</code>). That plugin doesn't seem to have any tests, so I wrote a small suite, but would appreciate any feedback on bugs or incompatibilities.</p>

<p>No kidding, I really appreciate your quick response here!</p>

<p>Hey, really cool to see you interested in Ruff!</p>

<p>You've built a really cool thing, standing on the shoulders of really cool projects (am thinking of Rust <em>and</em> RustPython here). :)</p>
<p>I'm excited to see the slowest linter in our setup get replaced with something that nearly finishes in the time Python takes to startup!</p>

<p>Definitely! Taking a look at the PR, that looks about right. I'll give it a drive after my work day, and let you know how that goes! :)</p>
