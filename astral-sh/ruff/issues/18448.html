            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Requesting the ability for <code>ruff format</code> to preserve blank lines within multi-line lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, function arguments, and any other list-like syntax. Collapsing multiple blank lines into a single blank line would make sense here and would be consistent with blank lines being collapsed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Currently, it strips out all blank lines in these cases:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">### INPUT

func(
    &quot;first&quot;,

    # This could be a long comment
    # documenting something important
    &quot;arg&quot;,
    &quot;arg&quot;,

    # This could be a long comment
    # for which the blank line implies it's not talking about the last argument
    &quot;arg&quot;,
    &quot;arg&quot;,

    &quot;last&quot;,
)

items = [
    &quot;first&quot;,

    # Apples
    &quot;item&quot;,
    &quot;item&quot;,

    # Oranges
    &quot;item&quot;,

    &quot;last&quot;,
]

@params(
    ('case'),

    # Really long list of test cases that might be documented
    ('case'),

    # Comment
    ('case'),

def test_func(value):
    pass

<p>Similar to why we would add blank lines anywhere else, blank lines can improve the readability of long lists. Especially if there are comments within the list; a blank line should be allowed around comment lines for readability.</p>
<p>For comparison, YAPF and Prettier do not strip blank lines here.</p>

<p>100% agreed! So much so, that I had forked Black to make this change because it was very disruptive for a project and just inconsistent when used alongside Prettier:</p>
