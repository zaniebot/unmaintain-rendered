# Gitlab code quality report must use forward slash in paths

---

_Issue opened by @mathieugouin on 2025-09-08 14:27_

### Summary

(issue was originally discussed in #14732 )

If the gitlab report is ran on a windows host, the generated paths in the json file have backslashes (`\`).

However, gitlab does not accept backslashes in path for the report to work, they have to be forward slashes (`/`).

The command to reproduce the problem (must run on a windows host):

```ps1
ruff check --exit-zero --no-cache --output-format gitlab --output-file python-gl-codequality.json
```


### Version

```
ruff 0.12.11 (c2bc15bc1 2025-08-28)
```

Thanks for the report! I can look into this since I've been working on the GitLab output format recently, unless someone beats me to it :)
