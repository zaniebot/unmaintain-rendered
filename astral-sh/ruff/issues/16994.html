            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16538 currently adds a bunch of new <code>NamedTuple</code>-related false positives.</p>
<p><code>NamedTuple</code> can be used either as a base class or as a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class A(NamedTuple):
    x: int
    y: str

A = NamedTuple(&quot;A&quot;, [(&quot;x&quot;, int), (&quot;y&quot;, str)])
</code></pre>
<p>typeshed supports the latter by adding some <code>__init__</code> overloads to <code>NamedTuple</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">@overload
def __init__(self, typename: str, fields: Iterable[tuple[str, Any]], /) -&gt; None: ...

@overload
def __init__(self, typename: str, fields: None = None, /, **kwargs: Any) -&gt; None: ...
</code></pre>
<p>For the former, we'll probably need to reuse some of the <code>dataclass</code> machinery to create a custom <code>__init__</code> method for each <code>NamedTuple</code> subclass.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We can also temporarily eliminate all these false positives with a simple special-case handling for instantiating a named tuple that accepts any arguments; we had a similar special-case in place for dataclass before we handled its constructor properly. (Though probably doing this correctly for NamedTuple by emulating our existing dataclass support wouldn't be too hard?)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Marking this for alpha simply due to the quantity of false positives it causes in the ecosystem; the alpha &quot;fix&quot; can be simply the special case to silence all the false positives for now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know this isn't forced by standard, but I'm also advocating for <a href="https://github.com/bswck/make-typed-namedtuples-final">namedtuples to be final</a>. You may or may not want to check that. Or disrecommend that with a linter, if that makes sense. I'm planning to make it into a PEP someday.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Initial support for <code>NamedTuple</code> was merged in #17738. I'm closing this for now. There are some open TODOs in the test suite and some ideas in the issue here, but I'm unsure if it's worth opening a new ticket just yet. I think we'll automatically be forced to implement more functionality eventually, either by bug reports, ecosystem false positives or when we add support for running the typing conformance checks.</p>
