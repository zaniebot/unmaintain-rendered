# False positive for B031 with generator used in method

_Issue opened by @153957 on 2023-04-05 07:47_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Used command:
`ruff --select B031 test.py`

Used ruff:
`ruff 0.0.261`

Code snippet:
```python
z = []
for _, x in groupby([]):
    z.append([1 for _ in x])  # B031
```

Error:
```Using the generator returned from `itertools.groupby()` more than once will do nothing on the second usage```

Can change the code like this to prevent the error:
```python
z = []
for _, x in groupby([]):
    y = [1 for _ in x]
    z.append(y)
```

Oh, right. Actually, there's another bug due to which the updated code doesn't raise a warning. I'll fix both of them today.
