# Diagnostic documentation links in the playground

---

_Issue opened by @opk12 on 2025-06-12 07:09_

I sometimes paste a snippet in the [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/), get a diagnostic I did not know about, and switch tab to search the docs. It would be convenient if the diagnostics in the playground's list had direct links to the respective documentation articles.
