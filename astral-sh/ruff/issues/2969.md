# Any way to use Ruff programmatically?

That is to be able to import ruff in Python and use it to lint the content of a string?

Not right now. The issue to watch is #659, but it will probably not happen in the immediate future as we want to make some changes to the API before it's ready to be versioned etc. and released publicly.
