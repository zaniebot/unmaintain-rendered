            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey!</p>
<p>I found what I believe is a little bug with regards to isorts <code>combine-as-imports</code>, as it seems to act contrary to its definition in some cases.</p>
<h4>Sample reproduction code:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-py">from json import detect_encoding
from json import dump
from json import dumps as json_dumps
from json import load
from json import loads as json_loads

</code></pre>
<p><em>Quite a bad example of &quot;real world code&quot;, but there is a genuine use case behind this. The random imports are for the sake of showing the problem. Note that running isort with <code>profile = &quot;black&quot;</code> and <code>force-single-line = true</code> doesnt change this file</em></p>
<h4><code>--fix</code> while using <code>combine-as-imports = true</code></h4>
<pre><code>$ ruff ruff_test.py --select I001 --fix
&lt;no output&gt;

$ cat ruff_test.py
from json import detect_encoding
from json import dump
from json import dumps as json_dumps
from json import load
from json import loads as json_loads
</code></pre>
<h4><code>--fix</code> while using <code>combine-as-imports = false</code></h4>
<pre><code>$ ruff ruff_test.py --select I001 --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ cat ruff_test.py
from json import detect_encoding
from json import dump
from json import load
from json import dumps as json_dumps
from json import loads as json_loads
</code></pre>
<h4>Ruff settings:</h4>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
line-length = 125
target-version = &quot;py38&quot;
select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;I&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]

[tool.ruff.isort]
force-single-line = true
combine-as-imports = true  # This line config will be added/removed according to the steps above
</code></pre>
<h4>Ruff version:</h4>
<p>ruff 0.0.255</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the issue is that you have <code>force-single-line = true</code>. <code>combine-as-imports</code> refers to grouping the imports, like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from json import (
    detect_encoding,
    dump,
    dumps as json_dumps,
    load,
    loads as json_loads,
)
</code></pre>
<p>But if you have <code>force-single-line = true</code>, it's <em>always</em> going to split into one import per line, so <code>combine-as-imports</code> has no effect.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the quick reply!</p>
<p>As you pointed out, the behaviour of the configurations I expected is exactly that, which is why it was weird to me when they differed from isort to ruff.</p>
<p>The code sample I provided with the profile set to black and <code>force_single_line=true</code> in isort, it doesn't change the file, but ruff reports that it should.</p>
<p>This was confusing to me and I looked through the documentation and tried out several different configurations and ended up finding that setting <code>combine-as-imports</code> seemed to be actig opposite to what is documented, as setting it to true keeps the <code>as</code> imports deperated, but setting it to false (the default) reports that they should be joint.</p>
<p>Sorry if my initial bug report wasn't clear enough, hope this comment improves it!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries! I think I understand what you're saying now. For simplicity, lets <em>ignore</em> <code>combine-as-imports</code> entirely. The issue is that with <code>force-single-line = true</code>, you're seeing a different ordering between Ruff and isort.</p>
