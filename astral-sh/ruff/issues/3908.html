            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>isort</code> version 5.12.0, <code>ruff</code> version 0.0.261</p>
<p>Relevant fragments from <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.isort]
profile = &quot;black&quot;
known_first_party = [&quot;redacted&quot;, &quot;redacted&quot;,]
lines_after_imports = 2

[tool.ruff]
select = [&quot;I&quot;, &quot;ICN&quot;, &quot;YTT&quot;]
target-version = &quot;py310&quot;

[tool.ruff.isort]
known-first-party = [&quot;redacted&quot;, &quot;redacted&quot;,]
lines-after-imports = 2
</code></pre>
<p><code>isort</code> and <code>ruff</code> seem to aggregate these imports differently. This may be an <code>isort</code> issue (as I think <code>ruff</code>'s way is correct), but raising it here as it's a behavior difference:</p>
<p>After running <code>isort</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from tenacity import before_sleep_log
from tenacity import retry as retry_decorator
from tenacity import stop_after_attempt, wait_fixed
</code></pre>
<p>After running <code>ruff --fix</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from tenacity import before_sleep_log, stop_after_attempt, wait_fixed
from tenacity import retry as retry_decorator
</code></pre>
<p><code>tenacity</code> is https://github.com/jd/tenacity</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, this is one of the two &quot;known deviations&quot; that we have with <code>isort</code> -- there's some discussion on it here: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1381. (And I'll just link to the &quot;known deviations&quot; in the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#how-does-ruffs-import-sorting-compare-to-isort">FAQ</a> for completeness.) I also prefer our behavior, and there aren't currently plans to change it, though I know it's annoying that it causes larger-than-expected diffs during migration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, got it, thanks. I was hoping to have both <code>isort</code> and <code>ruff</code> running for a bit just to ensure that everything was good between them, but I guess I'll just switch over.</p>
<p>I actually saw the FAQ entry before filing this, but it wasn't obvious to me (w/o clicking through to the actual issues) that &quot;a few known, minor differences in how Ruff and isort break ties between similar imports, and in how Ruff and isort treat inline comments in some cases&quot; was talking about this issue - I didn't think these were similar imports that would be tied and it's definitely not inline comments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that's a good point. I don't think I really internalized the scope of this deviation when I wrote that. Will fix.</p>
