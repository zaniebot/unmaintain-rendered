Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Rules <code>B904</code> and <code>TRY200</code> appear to be looking for the exact same construct (not using from within an exception block), but are separate rules. These should be deduplicated to a common implementation with an alias. We should also probably try to find duplicate rules with an automated mechanism in the future.</p>
