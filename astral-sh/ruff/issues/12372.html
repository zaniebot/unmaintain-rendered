            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you don't use <code>--document-private-items</code>, then <code>cargo doc</code> won't do anything with doc comments in private modules or on private items; they can have all kinds of issues (e.g. link to nonexistent things) and CI won't catch it.</p>
<p>Given that our public docs use mkdocs, and our rustdoc comments are for our own internal maintenance use, not for documenting a public API, it might make more sense to have our CI use <code>--document-private-items</code>?</p>
<p>This will require a bit of work to clean up a bunch of existing problems in non-public doc comments that were never caught because we don't use <code>--document-private-items</code>.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting: even with <code>--document-private-items</code>, it's still a warning (which for our CI run means an error, since we set <code>RUSTDOCFLAGS='-D warnings'</code>) for a public item's docs to link to a private item. I think this is a good thing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to make sure I understand here, this is just about a CI run that does a check that <code>cargo doc --document-private-items</code> actually works? I don't think I have a strong opinion on that personally, and your reasoning seems good to me. I very rarely use that flag though, so I don't have a ton of experience with it.</p>
