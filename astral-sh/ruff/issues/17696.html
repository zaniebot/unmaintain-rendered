            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This was originally opened as a Discussion, I'm opening an issue for visibility and to make it a proper Feature Request: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/10106</p>
<p>Original post by @jamesbraza :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-return-type-undocumented-public-function/">ANN201</a>'s autofix because it adds <code>-&gt; None</code> to functions where possible. However, in general, I don't like enforcing a requirement to specify return types.</p>
<p>From my <code>pyproject.toml</code> config file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
unsafe-fixes = true

[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = [
    &quot;ANN&quot;,
]
select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]

[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-annotations]
mypy-init-return = true
</code></pre>
<p>This enables the autofixes for ANN201, but also makes it a requirement to always pass.</p>
<p>In general, I am looking for something like <code>--fix-only</code>, but instead of being global, it is scoped to specific rules. Is there some way to have <code>--fix-only</code> for specific rule codes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional info I added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>ANN</code> is a good example where I'd use this.</li>
<li>Another is <code>UP031</code>/<code>UP032</code>: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11332#issuecomment-2836795627"><code>printf-string-formatting</code> (<code>UP031</code>) - fix should f-string instead of <code>str.format</code> #11332 (comment)</a></li>
<li>Typeshed has a few more examples where we'd only want to trigger autofixes w/o failing when there's nothing to fix (namely for <code>PTH</code> and <code>PYI</code>): <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/232c31c5c42cd5f2a6d9d1b2ec01c38dbd550f42/pyproject.toml#L88-L92">python/typeshed@<code>232c31c</code>/pyproject.toml#L88-L92</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>I think this should only apply to safe fixes, because the goal here is to <em>not</em> warn/fail for something that would require manual intervention. And there's already https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_extend-safe-fixes which can be used in conjunction if you wanna apply unsafe fixes here.</p>
