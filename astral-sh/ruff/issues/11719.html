<p>Does ruff sever support hover now?
Or, Will it support?</p>
<p>Now I cannot move from pyright because ruff-lsp does not support hover feature in vim-lsp.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp">vim-lsp</a> does not support changing hoverProvider to false like neovim's example in README in ruff-lsp.<br />
Hence I want ruff server to support  hover correctly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The server does support the hover feature but not in the same way as other language servers like Pyright. Ruff only detects <code>noqa</code> comments and it'll provide the rule documentation. Refer https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10595 for a screenshot on what it looks like.</p>
<p>In the future, we'd like to expand it's capability to support providing information for symbols like variables, functions, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know if it's possible to change the server capability in <code>vim-lsp</code> similar to how it's done in Neovim. I would suggest to open an issue in <code>vim-lsp</code> to check if it's possible as of today or as a feature request.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ruff server is intended to be used alongside Pyright since it's primary purpose is enabling formatting and lint fixes in the editor -- it's not a replacement for Pyright right now.</p>
