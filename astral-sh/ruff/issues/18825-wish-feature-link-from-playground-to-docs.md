# [wish/feature] Link from playground to docs

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-06-20 17:05_

It's very nice when there is a quick link from the playground to the docs, as I often open the playground first to test something, and then want to visit the docs to confirm the behavior. 

For example, in the [black playground](https://black.vercel.app/) clicking on the "Black" in the top left takes you directly to the docs. 
In the [basedpyright playground](https://basedpyright.com/) there is a clickable element in the top left to take you directly to the docs. 

It would be nice if clicking on the RUFF in the top left took you to the docs/there was a docs link somewhere on the page.
Currently the way I often do it is clicking on the github link, then the docs link from there, but this is inconvenient since github can often be slow to load.
