            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This was mentioned in #14179, so I won't go into too much of the same detail again, but I see the issue was closed without anything being implemented.</p>
<p>We use a wrapped version of the FastAPI router, with the same semantics but different implementation, and it would be nice for these rules to apply to our custom router.</p>
<p>An option to specify additional class paths to custom router classes would be sufficient.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for re-opening the discussion! I think it would be reasonable to add a configuration option here, analogous to <code>logger-objects</code> as Micha said.</p>
