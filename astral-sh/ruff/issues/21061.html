            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p><code>match</code> and <code>case</code> are keywords that exist for some time already and we don&#x27;t have any rule to prevent using them as variables. Some static token highlighters are highlighting it as a keyword because of it (including Bitbucket&#x27;s diff view). I think it should exist as an optional rule to Ruff.</p>
<p>The only issue I see is that soft keywords also include <code>type</code> keyword, which is already covered by rule <code>A001</code>, so we would have overlapping rules, but it could be justified that it&#x27;s not the same thing as it&#x27;s used in two completely different contexts - it&#x27;s just the token that&#x27;s the same.</p>
