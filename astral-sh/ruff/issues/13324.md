Hi, I don't know if it's one of the deviated behavior from flake8 or a bug.

It seem that RUFF flag F811 when it's a duplicate import, but weirdly, it don't work well with function. Here is a sample file.

```python
"""test."""


def _get_rejection_causes_for_image(image: str) -> set:
    causes = set()
    del image
    return causes


def _get_rejection_causes_for_image(image: str) -> set:
    causes = set()
    del image
    return causes


_get_rejection_causes_for_image("foo")

```

**Current behavior :**

Well `ruff check .` pass, flake8 flag F811

**Excpected Behavior :**

Ruff mark this as F811

**Ruff version :**

```sh
root@e0723ae7ba6c:/repo# ruff --version
ruff 0.6.4
```

Yeah, this is because the rule would ignore names like `_foo` (prefixed with one or more underscores) and others as per the [`dummy-variable-rgx`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx) config value. I'll close this as it's working as expected, but feel free to ask any follow up questions that you might have.

Okay, thank you. I've used to use underscore to mark a function/method as private.
