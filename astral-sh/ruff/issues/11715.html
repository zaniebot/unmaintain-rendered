            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe ruff extension could provide a command to show current server info? This will be helpful to debugging.</p>
<p><em>Originally posted by @yanyongyu in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11674#issuecomment-2144207242</em></p>
<p>Goal: Add a LSP command to collect debugging relevant information (platform, architecture, server, number of open files, number of open workspaces, the values of the most important settings, ...)</p>

<p>In vsc's extension, the binary that use for ruff finds from different places until fallback(use bundled), but the information is missing in the output message, is it possible to add the path and version number of the binary that is currently using ruff in the output message?</p>

<p>Which output message are you referring to? The goal for this issue is to implement that &quot;output message&quot; functionality. But to answer your question, yes we will be including that information in the message.</p>
