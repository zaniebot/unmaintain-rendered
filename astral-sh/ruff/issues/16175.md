# (🎁) new rule: when a non-final value is imported

---

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2025-02-15 08:34_

### Description

```py
# test1
a = 1
```
```py
# test2
from test1 import a  # i expect an error here
```

the reasoning is that if `test1.a` is not a final object (`class`, `def`, `type` `Final`), then the value that is import within `test2` would never be updated to that new value

This isn't currently possible in Ruff because it requires multifile analysis. I'm inclined to close this issue because it is too far out to be added. I'm happy to reconsider the rule once we've implemented Red Knot and ported Ruff to its infrastructure.
