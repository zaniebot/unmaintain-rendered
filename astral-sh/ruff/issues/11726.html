            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, when bumping from <code>0.4.4</code> to <code>0.4.5</code> in <code>pylint</code> we saw that I001 is no longer compatible with <code>isort</code>. See: https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/9679</p>
<p>I also noticed at my day job and other repositories.</p>
<p>You've probably improved here since <code>_string</code> is indeed a builtin and should be in the builtins block. However, this makes <code>ruff</code> incompatible with <code>isort</code> and by extension <code>pylint</code> which uses <code>isort</code> under the hood.
I didn't see this in the release notes and think such a breaking change should at least be acknowledged.</p>
<p>I'll leave it up to you whether this needs to be reverted</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, and sorry for the trouble. We moved to <code>stdlibs</code> (#11347) which has better coverage of the standard library, and this led to a few new modules being added. I agree that we should document it (so I'll use this issue to do so) and, in hindsight, probably should've sent this out in a minor release -- that's my fault.</p>
