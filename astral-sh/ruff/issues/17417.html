            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i just noticed that <code>ruff format</code> was not formatting a codeblock in my docstring despite <code>docstring-code-format</code> being enabled.</p>
<p>it turns out it was because the code had a syntax error in it, so i guess the formatter just assumed that meant it wasn't python code (even though the codeblock was prefixed with &quot;```py&quot;)</p>
<p>it would be nice if ruff's linter could check codeblocks in docstrings as well, which would have detected that syntax error (among other possible issues)</p>
