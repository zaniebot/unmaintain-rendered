            <div class="timeline-body"><p><em>ruff</em> seems to bundle quite a lot of external dependencies/packages in its binary distributions (looking at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/network/dependencies and the <code>Cargo.lock</code> entries, over 200?) There is no clear overview of all corresponding inclusions and their licenses.</p>
<p>While linting tools like <em>ruff</em> tend to usually not be shipped with any closed source product, they might require license compliance scanning as well in some situations.</p>
<p>It would be great if <em>ruff</em> would provide this information inside its wheel files as well (in a similar manner to directly included code).</p>
