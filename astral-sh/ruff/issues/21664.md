# Support Debian 13 "Trixie" as docker container base

---

_Issue opened by @MatthijsKok on 2025-11-27 16:24_

Currently the ruff docker container is based on Debian 12 "Bookworm".
See published tags: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pkgs/container/ruff/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged

Would be nice to also have a more modern option like `0.14.6-trixie` and `0.14.6-trixie-slim`!

Thanks for building ruff (and uv and ty), we use them every day :)

We haven't released the new images yet because we consider it a breaking change but we'll update the container when we do our next minor early next year.
