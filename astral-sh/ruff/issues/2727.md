# S112 underline whole source code

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-02-10 18:23_

`S112` underlines only the continue, which doesn't help me when using `--show-source`:
```
332 |                             continue
    |                             ^^^^^^^^ S112

```
it should show the whole try-except block.
