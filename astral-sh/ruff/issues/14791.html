            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did a pass on all flake8-bugbear rules upstream to check for <code>except*</code> handling (https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/pull/500), and then also checked ruff.. which already handles all of them 🥳 But a bunch of them assume <code>except</code> in their message, which could perhaps be confusing to users - but tbh it's mostly a nitpick.</p>
<p>I have not checked any rules other than flake8-bugbear, so I suggest you do a pass checking for any other rules that might be referring to <code>except</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">try:
    a = 1
except* ValueError:
    a = 2
except* ValueError:
    a = 2

try:
    pass
except* ():
    pass

try:
    pass
except* 1:  # error
    pass

try:
    raise ValueError
except* ValueError:
    raise UserWarning
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ruff check --select=B foo.py
foo.py:6:9: B025 try-except block with duplicate exception `ValueError`
foo.py:11:1: B029 Using `except ():` with an empty tuple does not catch anything; add exceptions to handle
foo.py:16:9: B030 `except` handlers should only be exception classes or tuples of exception classes
foo.py:22:5: B904 Within an `except` clause, raise exceptions with `raise ... from err` or `raise ... from None` to distinguish them from errors in exception handling
Found 4 errors.
