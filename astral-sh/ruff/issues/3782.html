            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is more a feature request or maybe I missed something in the docs to enable it.</p>
<p>From what I see, currently, I have <code>--exit-zero</code> in our <code>pre-commit</code> file, but we would like it to output all linting errors that we have included. Then only error on certain ones in the <code>pre-commit</code>. I know something similar is possible using <code>fixable</code> and <code>unfixable</code>, but not for which codes to error on or not.</p>
<p>Does this feature seem useful and possibly will be implemented in the future?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think this could in theory be tackled by adding &quot;severities&quot; (so that users can differentiate errors from warnings), so I'm gonna close in favor of https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1256.</p>
