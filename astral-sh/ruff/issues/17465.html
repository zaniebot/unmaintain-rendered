            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In this code sample (provided by @skshetry in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/17457#issuecomment-2815848955), we enter divergent fixpoint iteration and end up panicking with &quot;too many iterations&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">class Klass:
    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:
        self.attr = 1

    def copy(self, other: &quot;Klass&quot;):
        self.attr = other.attr or self.attr
</code></pre>
<p>The issue is that we infer a type of <code>Unknown &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy</code>, which we then union with itself on each subsequent iteration, but we fail to simplify this union, so it just grows on each iteration.</p>
<p>There should be multiple parts to the fix here. One is that we should be able to simplify <code>(Unknown &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy) | (Unknown &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy)</code> to just <code>Unknown &amp; ~AlwaysFalsy</code>.</p>
<p>The other is that we should have a reliable backstop, since our union and intersection simplification will never be perfect. If any union or intersection grows over a certain size limit, we need to just best-effort reduce it to the nearest enclosing &quot;join&quot; type, or just <code>object</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17467 will fix this case.</p>
<p>I'm inclined to not add the generalized backstop yet, because it will paper over cases of this and turn them from &quot;panic&quot; to &quot;slow and imprecise but doesn't panic&quot;. The latter is harder to detect and may cause us to miss problems. We probably want it eventually, but I'd rather not have it yet.</p>
