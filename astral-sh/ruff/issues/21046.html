<p>Dear ruff format,</p>
<p>many users are unsatisfied with the strong opinions of black/ruff format. While I agree with 90% of the opinions, I have some, which i would like to avoid.
So my imagination would be that I could select specific format &quot;rules&quot; of the existing ones.
I saw that they are even already (partly?) named:
https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/docs/the_black_code_style/future_style.md
e.g. <code>wrap_comprehension_in</code>.</p>
<p>So maybe you could expose a <code>--select</code> option for (at least some of) the names, (which would be easy to implement) that the AST normalizes only according to these rules?</p>
<p>It&#x27;s nice that I can already prevent string-normalization, which helps me to separate these into single git-commits. (via <code>ruff format --config &#x27;format.quote-style = &quot;preserve&quot;&#x27; .</code>).</p>
Version
<p>ruff 0.14.1</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this issue.</p>
<p>We understand that some users want more flexibility in formatting. We also hear that other users deliberately don&#x27;t want more options because they result in discussions on the team how those options should be configured.</p>
<p>I think Ruff ideally finds itself somewhere in between, allowing some configurability but intentionally keeping the options minimal (also just because we need to test every possible combination of options).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to introducing e.g. an option that changes how Ruff picks nested quotes in f-strings (there&#x27;s an issue for this somewhere). I don&#x27;t want to introduce a new option for every style change as that wouldn&#x27;t take into account the actual demand from users in comparison to the maintenance burden it creates.</p>
<p>To get a specific option added, I recommend opening an issue that asks for an option that changes a specific formatting behavior and we can see if there&#x27;s interest from other users.</p>
