            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Commonly with notebooks the <code>result</code> of a calculation is often implicitly printed, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>x = 1 + 2
x
</code></pre>
<p>I believe x.__repl__() is called.</p>
<p><code>ruff</code> reports <code>B018: useless-expression</code>. I&#x27;m not sure this is easy to detect as it doesn&#x27;t have to be the last statement of a cell - i.e. the output of the following is to print x and ignore y.</p>
<pre><code>x = 1 + 2
x
y = x + 2
y
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is a case where I&#x27;d likely recommend disabling the rule for notebooks. @dhruvmanila, any idea if we could detect whether the expression is the last line in a cell? I know we have the splits for import sorting, but not sure how accessible they are...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would recommend disabling as well. Otherwise, what could be done is using the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/81b1176f9928ca146f4f6a3ab32804e5fcc00c75/crates/ruff/src/jupyter/notebook.rs#L403-L406"><code>cell_offsets</code></a> (aka the cell boundaries) which can be used to detect the last non-empty line of the cell. This would be limited as pointed out by @david-waterworth in the second example where these expressions are present in the middle of the cell.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Given:</p>
<pre><code>x = 1 + 2
x
y = x + 2
y
</code></pre>
<p>I would assume we want to flag <code>x</code> (second line) as useless but not <code>y</code> (fourth line), but it sounds like neither should be flagged. Why is that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh yes, you&#x27;re correct. I just verified that the value of <code>x</code> won&#x27;t be printed. So, I think it&#x27;s safe to avoid checking for unused expressions for the last non-empty line i.e., basically if there&#x27;s an expression before the cell boundary avoid flagging <code>B018</code> for it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@david-waterworth - Does that make sense to you? Your initial message said &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have to be the last statement of a cell&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh yes you&#x27;re correct - I thought it printed the first statement but I checked and it prints the last.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<pre><code>x = 1
x

for i in range(10):
    i
</code></pre>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t print anything so not really sure how exactly it works and I&#x27;ve not been able to find a definitive description. But it seems to print the value of the last statement but only if it&#x27;s not indented.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think it&#x27;s because the entire <code>for</code> loop is a single statement in the AST. The <code>i</code> expression is part of the top level <code>for</code> loop (child node):</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    i
</code></pre>
<p>while in the previous example, the last node is an expression:</p>
<pre><code>x
</code></pre>
<p>Expressions evaluate to a value while statements do not and that&#x27;s why the second example prints the value of <code>x</code> while the first example (<code>for</code> loop) doesn&#x27;t.</p>
