            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff is not packaged in Debian stable repo and I'm unable to install it without creating a virtual environment, which I don't want to do, because - I suppose - in such env, I'll lose access to all other system-wide packages I use.
So: how can I use it in Debian?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; pip3 install --user ruff
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─&gt; To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.</code></pre>
<p>It is the same with and without <code>--user</code> switch</p>

<p>I see... Not sure if it is going to work when I want to run it inside sublime-text plugin pylsp</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you share more on why this wouldn't work? In either case, Ruff will end up in your <code>PATH</code>, right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, you need to run with <code>--break-system-packages</code> if you want to install into the system Python without a virtual environment on Debian.</p>
