Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/ mentions that <code>ruff</code> reimplements <code>autoflake</code>.</p>
<p>However, in the Rules sidebar (where relevant codes are listed), <code>autoflake</code> is not mentioned.</p>
<p>Can we document what codes pertain to <code>autoflake</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, it doesn't quite fit into our documentation paradigm, because <code>autoflake</code> is just a tool that adds autofix behavior for a small subset of the Pyflakes violations -- it doesn't define any violations of its own. I'm not sure that it's important that users know which rules that includes. What's the use motivation? Is this answer here sufficient? :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am trying to migrate much of my full <code>pre-commit</code> config to <code>ruff</code>, one of them is <code>autoflake</code>.  I see it's mentioned in the <code>README</code> as being replace-able, but I am not sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>What codes are relevant</li>
<li>Any configuration necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>I run <code>autoflake</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/autoflake
    rev: v2.1.1
    hooks:
      - id: autoflake
        args:
          - --remove-all-unused-imports
          - --remove-rhs-for-unused-variables
          - --remove-unused-variables
          - --exclude=somelocaldir
</code></pre>
<p>I made this docs request mainly because an <code>autoflake-to-ruff</code> (inspired by <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8-to-ruff/"><code>flake8-to-ruff</code></a>) conversion is not clear to me</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No configuration is necessary, it's effectively just &quot;autofix enabled for the F rule set&quot;, which is enabled by default (namely <code>F401</code>, unused imports, and <code>F841</code>, unused local variable).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay gotchu.  I see <code>F401</code> and <code>F841</code> codes are mentioned under Pyflakes (F): https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#pyflakes-f</p>
<p>So I guess <code>autoflake</code> and <code>pyflakes</code> were redundant/have some overlap.  I would say from the current docs, one cannot discern that the autofixes for <code>F401</code> and <code>F841</code> are equivalent to <code>autoflake</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Just to explain my process:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each tool I have in <code>pre-commit</code></li>
<li>I search <code>ruff</code> docs if it's there and can be removed</li>
</ol>
<p>I saw <code>autoflake</code> in the <code>README</code>, but I didn't really see anywhere in <code>ruff</code> docs how it's replaced.  I still think it's useful to put in the docs what rules (or codes or autofixes) pertain to the tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And I really appreciate <code>ruff</code> and what you're doing here!  At PyCon 2023 (last weekend), I heard it mentioned quite a lot, hence why I am making the jump now 👌</p>
