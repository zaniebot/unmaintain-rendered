            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Question</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this.</p>
<p>I recently setup Ruff in Sublime via LSP. And this has mostly been a very positive experience.</p>
<p>But there's one thing I can't work out how to do. I have got it set to auto fix on save. Which means highlights / actions for stuff that's going to be autofixed is just distracting visual noise that I'd rather not have.</p>
<p>Is it possible to disable the check highlights for anything that can be autofixed?</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.11.10</p>

<p>Would you expect that the errors are still listed under diagnostics? Do you only want autofixable squiggles to be hidden?</p>

It'd be most consistent with my intent for them to not show there either.
Because they will be fixed on save I do not care about those warnings.
But them being there distracts from the ones I do need to care about.</p>
