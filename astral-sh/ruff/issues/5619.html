<p>I think it should be documented:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, thanks for opening an issue. It&#x27;s present in the documentation in this section: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/#using-pyprojecttoml:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a special-case, Ruff also supports the <code>ALL</code> code, which enables all rules. Note that some pydocstyle rules conflict (e.g., <code>D203</code> and <code>D211</code>) as they represent alternative docstring formats. Ruff will automatically disable any conflicting rules when <code>ALL</code> is enabled.</p>

<p>Do you think it would be useful to add it elsewhere?</p>

<p>As a special-case, Ruff also supports the ALL code, which enables all rules. Note that some pydocstyle rules conflict (e.g., D203 and D211) as they represent alternative docstring formats. Ruff will automatically disable any conflicting rules when ALL is enabled.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re wondering how to configure Ruff, here are some recommended guidelines:</p>
<p>Prefer select and ignore over extend-select and extend-ignore, to make your rule set explicit.
Use ALL with discretion. Enabling ALL will implicitly enable new rules whenever you upgrade.
Start with a small set of rules (select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;]) and add a category at-a-time. For example, you might consider expanding to select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;B&quot;] to enable the popular flake8-bugbear extension.
By default, Ruff&#x27;s autofix is aggressive. If you find that it&#x27;s too aggressive for your liking, consider turning off autofix for specific rules or categories (see <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#ruff-tried-to-fix-something--but-it-broke-my-code">FAQ</a>).</p>

<p>section should be much higher up, possibly at the top or even in it&#x27;s own section.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We use <code>ALL</code> in combination with a pinned version of ruff. This works great because on upgrade we can always ignore new rules if we don&#x27;t want them (or don&#x27;t want to fix them yet).</p>

<p>Counter argument. I&#x27;m a beginner programmer and using <code>ALL</code> as a teaching aid to write better code! Just the other day it taught me about the built-in function <code>all</code> via <code>SIM110</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We&#x27;d like to resolve this by re-categorizing the rules and having sensible defaults as noted by Charlie — then Ruff will still teach you to write better code and you won&#x27;t get a bunch of pedantic or rules without common consensus like you do when you turn on ALL. I worry that learning with ALL is too noisy of an experience.</p>
