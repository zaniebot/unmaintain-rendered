            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I was looking for a rule which checks for a blank line at the start of a file – the first character of the file is a newline.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t find one... (I assume I just haven&#x27;t failed to notice it.) it seems like it would be an easy thing to provide?</p>
<p>In a certain sense, the mirror image of <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-newlines-at-end-of-file/#too-many-newlines-at-end-of-file-w391">too-many-newlines-at-end-of-file</a> – except it would be triggered by any non-zero number of initial newlines, not by just one. (I guess you could also have it match whitespace followed by a newline.)</p>
<p>I realise the formatter will get rid of this, but I work on a code base where we are slowly introducing new ruff check rules, and we aren&#x27;t yet at the point we want to enforce running ruff format on every file. But I just deleted every initial newline out of the code base, and I&#x27;d like a ruff check to ensure we don&#x27;t get any coming back, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m surprised that this isn&#x27;t a pycodestyle rule. The rule itself would be compatible with the formatter and shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to implement. However, I don&#x27;t think we should add it before we decided on what to do with the already existing <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402">astral-sh/ruff#2402</a> rules</p>
