            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For it&#x27;s <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/invalid-name.html"><code>invalid-name</code>/C0103 rule</a>, pylint allows <a href="https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/invalid-name.html#custom-regular-expressions">freely configuring what a legal name for an identifier is using regular expressions</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, for a project, I&#x27;d like certain identifiers to use CapWords/PascalCase. (In case the actual use case is relevant: In django, sometimes <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/forms/formsets/#formsets">&quot;Formset&quot; classes are created by factory-methods</a>, and we want to use CapWords naming for them to match the official documentation)</p>
<p>In #970, pylint&#x27;s <code>invalid-name</code> is checked as &quot;done&quot; and references N815. For me, the following code triggers N806 and I do not find any configuration option that would allow the CamelCase variable. <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-lowercase-variable-in-function/">The docs on N806</a> only list a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#pep8-naming-ignore-names"><code>pep8-naming.ignore-names</code></a> option, which in turn doesn&#x27;t seem to support regular expressions.</p>
<pre><code>from some_module import get_some_class

def test():
    my_var = 123
    MyVarSpecial = get_some_class()
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ ruff --version

$ ruff check --isolated --select=N test.py

<p>where I can do this with pylint:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, the option <code>ignore-names</code> supports <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/#syntax">glob patterns</a> (not regular expressions though). I think the documentation needs to be updated to be more clear on that. Also, I would suggest to use the <code>extend-ignore-names</code> to keep the default ones as it is. I hope this helps.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, thanks for your work on ruff!</p>
<p>(Disclaimer, @richardebeling and I both work on the project mentioned in the initial comment)</p>
<p>I feel that globs are not really a satisfying solution in this case. Although #2787 initially asked for glob support, the arguments for it were &quot;only fixed strings currently supported&quot; and &quot;want to allow <code>assert*</code>&quot;, both of which would not only be fixed by regex too, but regex would also make an arguably better fix: For <code>assert*</code>, you would probably want something like <code>assert[A-Z][A-Za-z]*</code> to not only allow camel case naming, but also forbid snake case naming for these assert functions.</p>
<p>In general, globs are really meant for matching file paths and their only advantage over regex is the <code>**</code> feature - other than that, regex appears to be superior in every aspect. So I would suggest to reconsider the decision for ruff to use globs as <code>IdentifierPattern</code> in favor of replacing them with regexes.</p>
<hr>
<p>We thought about this for some time and also wanted to bring another point up: Maybe the current architecture of the <code>pep8-naming</code> folder in the source code is not the best fit for ruff. As we perceive it, pep8-naming is a checker for pep8 in particular, while ruff is growing to be a full-fledged configurable linter. Therefore, ruff itself shouldn&#x27;t really care <em>what kind of naming scheme</em> it is enforcing, it&#x27;s role is just to enforce it. Ruff can even keep a preference towards the pep8 scheme by designing the default configuration to match it.</p>
<p>A symptom of this &quot;problem&quot; is that the current file structure,</p>
<pre><code>camelcase_imported_as_acronym.rs
camelcase_imported_as_constant.rs
camelcase_imported_as_lowercase.rs
constant_imported_as_non_constant.rs
dunder_function_name.rs
error_suffix_on_exception_name.rs
invalid_argument_name.rs
invalid_class_name.rs
invalid_first_argument_name_for_class_method.rs
invalid_first_argument_name_for_method.rs
invalid_function_name.rs
invalid_module_name.rs
lowercase_imported_as_non_lowercase.rs
mixed_case_variable_in_class_scope.rs
mixed_case_variable_in_global_scope.rs
non_lowercase_variable_in_function.rs
</code></pre>
<p>already encodes too specialized knowledge of pep8 standards and makes it difficult to introduce features like &quot;check that it matches a regex&quot; (Currently, I think there isn&#x27;t really a way to enforce that, for example, no snake case <code>assert_something</code> functions are defined, because we can only add ignores, but not tighten the check for not-ignored names). We both think that the current mental model by pylint &quot;check if variable names are valid&quot;, &quot;check if class names are valid&quot; is more appropriate and easier to work with than &quot;check that variables are lowercase&quot;.</p>
<p>I would really like to hear your thoughts on this :)</p>
