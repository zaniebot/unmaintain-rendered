<p>I want to know if ruff allows multiple elements to be on the same line at the same time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, this is something we&#x27;re aware of but I haven&#x27;t had time yet to work on an improved heuristic for array formatting.</p>
<p>For example, Prettier uses a &quot;fill&quot; layout where it tries to fit as many items as possible on each line if the values are simple (small numbers, constant string literals, etc).</p>
<pre><code>const a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 223, 34, 34, 44, 444]

// Formatted
const a = [
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
  223, 34, 34, 44, 444,
];

<p>I&#x27;d like to have something like this for Ruff. There&#x27;s also a related discussion around <code>np.array</code> formatting, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/8452</p>
<p>For now, your best option is to either accept the formatting or use <code>fmt: skip</code> to disable formatting for that entire statement</p>
<pre><code>idx = [
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
    20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39
