Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi! I'm getting a B002 error on https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/6.1.0/ibis/tests/expr/test_table.py#L1243. I believe (without actually understanding how the Ruff implementation works) this is because the AST for <code>-(-(x))</code> is equivalent for <code>--x</code>, but:</p>
<ol>
<li>the parentheses make it such that it's not actually an attempt at using non-existent unary prefix decrement operator</li>
<li>the error message is therefore misleading</li>
</ol>
<p>I understand that this is an edge case, because most code doesn't define/test the unary <code>-</code>/<code>+</code> operator, and will therefore just stick <code>noqa</code>'s on the code, but thought it still worth reporting in case there's an opportunity to make the error a bit less confusing.</p>
<p>Ruff version: 0.0.284</p>

<p>Hi! Yes, I also think it's producing the same AST, hence getting flagged (as I wrote in the original issue). However, since the unary prefix decrement operator isn't actually a thing in Python (which is the reason why the B002 rule exists), I'll be pedantic and say that <code>--((t1.key1 == t2.key1).any())</code> would technically be equivalent to what's more clearly written in the code I'm touching, <code>-(-(t1.key1 == t2.key1).any())</code>. <code>-(-(t1.key1 == t2.key1).any())</code> fairly indicates what the code is doing--it's testing negation of negation.</p>
<p>I think this is all a roundabout way of saying</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since the above reply is a bit convoluted, maybe I can try to re-explain with a simpler example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If my code reads <code>--x</code>, it seems fair to raise B002, because it's very possible I'm coming from another language and will get behavior I don't expect (that it will return <code>x</code>, instead of decrementing <code>x</code>).</li>
<li>If my code reads <code>-(-(x))</code>, on the other hand, it's pretty clear that I didn't just come from C++ and am trying to pre-decrement; it's something else. If I did want to pre-decrement, why the parentheses? So, it's a bit misleading to say, &quot;Python does not support the unary prefix decrement operator&quot; IMO; as the user, I never had any intention of pre-decrementing, and (if I didn't have prior experience outside of Python) I wouldn't even recognize <code>-(-(x))</code> as pre-decrementing.</li>
<li>If it's not possible to provide distinguished error messages because the ASTs for <code>--x</code> and <code>-(-(x))</code> are equivalent (I'm not familiar with the Ruff codebase, so I wouldn't know whether it's possible or not), I understand. Like I said, I can get around it in my specific case with some <code>noqa</code>s, and I use cases for writing <code>-(-(x))</code> are probably few and far between (e.g. testing library code, which is the use case I saw).</li>
</ul>
