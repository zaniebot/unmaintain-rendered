<p>Interested in F821 but with certain names allowed. For example, <code>spark</code> or <code>dbutils</code> are auto injected into Databrick notebooks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn&#x27;t find anything on that page about the automatic injection, but I did see in one of the <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/dataframes#step-3-load-data-into-a-dataframe-from-csv-file">tutorials</a> that they use <code>spark</code> without importing it.</p>
<p>I think this could make sense as a configuration option. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any other workaround besides ignoring the rule for the whole notebook file. Unless you can import them anyway, but I&#x27;m guessing that could fail depending on how they inject them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Sorry, may be a bad Databricks reference. I personally find their docs a bit confusing. I think they auto inject a bunch of stuff into locals. Most users (and their notebooks) just reflect that convention so getting users to change that behavior is tough.</p>
<p>Yes, the work around of ignoring on the whole file is fine but removes the functionality</p>
