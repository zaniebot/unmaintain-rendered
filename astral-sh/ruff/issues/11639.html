            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11457 added the ability to do speculative parsing via checkpoint - rewind infrastructure and is currently being used for <code>match</code> statement via <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11443">astral-sh/ruff#11443</a>.</p>
<p>To give a brief background, <strong>speculative parsing</strong> means that the parser tries to parse a syntax node as one kind and determines at the end if the assumption was right by testing if the parser is at a specific token (or has no errors). This is useful if a syntax is ambiguous and no amount of lookahead (except parsing the whole syntax) is sufficient to determine what syntax it is.</p>
<p>The idea here is to update the current parsing logic for with-items to use the checkpoint - rewind infrastructure. The current logic performs a manual and a bit complex speculative parsing to disambiguate between a parenthesized with-items and parenthesized with-item expression i.e., whether the parenthesis belongs to with-items or the expression of the first with-item. For example,</p>
<pre><code>with (item1, item2): ...       # Parenthesized with-items
with (item1, item2) as f: ...  # Parenthesized expression
</code></pre>
