            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, the <code>ruff server</code> subcommand includes the global options:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ ruff server --help       
Run the language server

Usage: ruff server [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --preview  Enable preview mode; required for regular operation
  -h, --help     Print help

Log levels:
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging
  -q, --quiet    Print diagnostics, but nothing else
  -s, --silent   Disable all logging (but still exit with status code &quot;1&quot; upon detecting diagnostics)

Global options:
      --config &lt;CONFIG_OPTION&gt;  Either a path to a TOML configuration file (`pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml`), or a TOML `&lt;KEY&gt; = &lt;VALUE&gt;` pair (such
                                as you might find in a `ruff.toml` configuration file) overriding a specific configuration option. Overrides of
                                individual settings using this option always take precedence over all configuration files, including configuration
                                files that were also specified using `--config`
      --isolated                Ignore all configuration files
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;Log levels&quot; and &quot;Global options&quot; aren't required for the server as it's never used internally and is actually provided via the server initialization options.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't possible today (https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/5578). It would require doing some major changes like moving the <code>GlobalConfigVars</code> to each subcommand struct, flattening it, and then updating all of the references to use the values from the subcommand struct. I don't think it's worth the effort right now to do this change.</p>
