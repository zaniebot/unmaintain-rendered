            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to disable/suppress ruff (or certain rules of ruff) on a block of code. I know that I can do this for single lines (by using # noqa: &lt;rule_code&gt; at the end of the line) or for entire files/folder (by specifying them in the settings file).</p>
<p>However, I would like to disable ruff on an entire function or on a multi-line block of code, but not an entire file. Is there a way to do this, without adding the noqa to the end of each line?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately we don't support block-level suppression right now. I believe this is similar to #3711 so I'm going to merge into that issue.</p>
