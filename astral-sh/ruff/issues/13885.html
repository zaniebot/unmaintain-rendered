            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When an exception handler re-raises or returns, it seems to me that it's better to put the &quot;else&quot; code as a follow-up to the try/except than in a &quot;else&quot;.</p>
<p>Eg for the code</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import logging


def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        rec = 1 / n
        print(f&quot;reciprocal of {n} is {rec}&quot;)
        return rec
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logging.exception(&quot;Exception occurred&quot;)
        raise
</code></pre>
<p>you get <code>TRY300 Consider moving this statement to an </code>else<code> block</code>
but the best for me would be to write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import logging


def reciprocal(n):
    try:
        rec = 1 / n
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        logging.exception(&quot;Exception occurred&quot;)
        raise
    print(f&quot;reciprocal of {n} is {rec}&quot;)
    return rec
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, the current example also seems incorrect as <code>reciprocal</code> returns an implicit <code>None</code> (See <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/implicit-return/">RET503</a> even though it doesn't detect it)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that makes sense. But we have to be careful only to do so if all except branches re-raise and there's no existing <code>else</code> branch.</p>
<p>Moving the code after the <code>try</code> would change the semantic in this case.</p>
