            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unlike with other rules which I can enable with the linter prefix, the CPY rules seems to require the specific error code.</p>
<pre><code>touch foo.py
ruff --select=CPY001 foo.py  # foo.py:1:1: CPY001 Missing copyright notice at top of file
ruff --select=CPY foo.py   # no output
# ruff --version
# ruff 0.0.277
</code></pre>
<p>Also, the docs still mention the old name of the checker before it was renamed to flake8-copyright in #5236

<p>Thanks for ruff!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @Hnasar — this is intentional because this rule is in the &quot;nursery&quot; group which requires explicit opt-in since the rules are still under development. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4407 for some more background.</p>
<p>The category name was also intentional, see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4701#issuecomment-1599695200 cc @charliermarsh</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did intend to change the category name, but I think I missed one reference.</p>
<p>That these rules are in the &quot;nursery&quot; group is supposed to be reflected in the docs which would make this a lot clearer, but we haven't finished that change yet :sob: (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5439)</p>
