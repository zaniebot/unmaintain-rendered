            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I just tried to sync dependencies for a package using <code>ruff</code>. When using 0.12.9, I receive the error below. This seems to be a problem specific to this release, as previous versions work as expected across Linux, MacOS, and Windows.</p>
<pre><code>Using CPython 3.13.6
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved 46 packages in 14ms
error: Distribution `ruff==0.12.9 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on Windows (`win_amd64`), but `ruff` (v0.12.9) only has wheels for the following platform: `linux_armv6l`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels
</code></pre>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.12.9</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for reporting. I did a quick check and I do see windows wheels on pypi (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/ruff/#files">source</a>), which matches your latest comment. You might have been unlucky to install Ruff right in the middle of us publishing the new release (wheels are uploaded one by one).</p>
<p>I'll close this based on your feedback but please let me know if you keep running into problems.</p>
