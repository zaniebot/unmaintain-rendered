            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it be possible to support <a href="https://validate-pyproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">validate-pyproject</a>? There already is a schema at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/ruff.schema.json. All that would be needed would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[project.entry-points]
&quot;validate_pyproject.tool_schema&quot;.ruff = &quot;ruff.schema:get_schema&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>And a <code>ruff.schema.get_schema</code> (name arbitrary) function something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def get_schema(tool_name: str = &quot;ruff&quot;) -&gt; dict[str, Any]:
    &quot;Get the stored complete schema for ruff settings.&quot;
    assert tool_name == &quot;ruff&quot;, &quot;Only ruff is supported.&quot;

    with resources.joinpath(&quot;ruff.schema.json&quot;).open(encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:
        return json.load(f)  # type: ignore[no-any-return]
</code></pre>
<p>(Assuming there's a way to ship the schema in the python package, currently it's at the root of the repo) That would allow validate-pyproject to validate Ruff's config if Ruff was installed in the same environment as validate-pyproject. Thoughts?</p>
<p>(I'm also hoping that validate-pyproject can use SchemaStore eventually, but that's notably usually out of date for Ruff)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>+1 on this one! I reckon this might be a topic for a separate issue, but tox devs are also working on <a href="https://pyproject-fmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pyproject-fmt</a></p>
