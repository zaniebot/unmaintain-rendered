            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When there are many arguments (3+) in a function/class call, using keyword arguments improves readability.
It would be nice to add an option to linter or formatter (min argument count) to change function/class calls to keywords (default <code>0</code> = disabled)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds interesting! I could be wrong, or too pedantic, but I think this sounds more like a stylistic lint rule than something for the formatter to handle. I think we&#x27;ll also need type inference/multi-file analysis to perform this kind of fix in the general case since it requires looking up the function definition to get the argument names.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also somewhat related to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-positional-arguments/#too-many-positional-arguments-plr0917">too-many-positional-arguments (PLR0917)</a>, which checks for too many positional parameters in the function definition rather than the call.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the info.
I also suspected formatter may not have access to function/class signature/declaration when it sees a call.</p>

<p>Fixing this (other than breaking the function up) requires adding default values to the arguments, and if the <code>None</code> is logical default, changing the type to <code>| None</code> and then checking in the body if they are None... Which adds extra complexity to already complex functions. I think &quot;cyclomatic complexity&quot; (C90 rule) is a much better way to spot complex functions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Marking this as &quot;needs-decision&quot; because it&#x27;s a very opinionated rule (restriction rule, intentionally disallowing a certain syntax only because of &quot;I prefer it this way&quot;)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using keyword arguments can prevent bugs and typos specially when adding or removing args, re-ordering args, breaking down functions etc. Plus the readability (to see what these args are without hovering over every call). I think that&#x27;s why Python started supporting keyword syntax for positional arguments.
It also allows you to <code>grep -r</code> a certain argument name with its value in a directory.</p>
<p>Also most lint rules are somewhat opinionated.</p>
