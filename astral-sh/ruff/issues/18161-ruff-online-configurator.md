# Ruff online configurator

### Question

Hey!
Looking to migrate to Ruff as my python code formatter.

I was wondering if there is an online configurator page like there is for [clang format](https://clang-format-configurator.site/)

Thank you.

### Version

_No response_

No, no such page exists to my knowledge. But ruff's formatter also has much fewer options. What you can do is play with the [formatting options](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#format) in the [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/)
