            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've created an integration for ruff, but I don't want to regen the rules every time ruff is updated, so I'm wondering if its possible for the the json file to be published online.</p>
<p>We already sorta talked about this and I'm kinda just making an issue so it doesn't get buried.</p>
<p>This would power one of the integrations within the official Discord that can view all of the rules for ruff.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm using a locally generated and vendored file, but that'll get out of sync pretty quick.
