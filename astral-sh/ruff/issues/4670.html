Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>~While I personally like <code>isort</code> better, my company uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/reorder-python-imports/">reorder-python-imports</a> so I am wondering if there is already support for this and I missed it in the docs, or if support could be added? I am loving this package and would love to have it auto-run the import sorting in the format I need.~</p>
<p>Actually I think it is better to just add <code>force-alphabetical-sort-within-sections</code> flag to isort settings</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>actually it turns out I can almost achieve the same functionality, but the isort arg that I need is <code>force-alphabetical-sort-within-sections</code> and ruff does not yet support this</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>well now I think what would actually be better than adding support for reorder-python-imports, would be to just add the <code>force-alphabetical-sort-within-sections</code> flag for available <code>isort</code> args. I think isort can do everything that reorder-python-imports can do, but not all the flags for isort are available to enable that functionality</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sanmai-NL unfortunately not. The sorting rules are slightly different. sort-within-sections prioritizes case over alphanumeric (e.g. <code>MY_CONSTANT</code> will be sorted on top of <code>alphabetical_method</code>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Update: Actually I don't think this is an issue anymore. Once I noticed the <em>case-sensitive</em> argument which I set to <em>false</em> and I fixed and tweaked some other ruff configuration I was able to exactly reproduce my old isort configuration sorting behaviour that had force_alphabetical_sort_within_sections set to true.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @Pierre-Sassoulas - this was my Ruff isort config taken from my pyproject.toml (note I excluded known-first-party and known-third-party modules which will be specific to your repo). This sorting was close to but not quite identical to isort. I think there were some minor differences with Ruff sorting on full relative import paths (which I personally liked) - I think the difference was something like that - I don't exactly remember but most of the time the import sort order came out identical to how we had isort configured.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.isort]
case-sensitive = false
combine-as-imports = true
force-sort-within-sections = true
known-first-party = []
known-third-party = []
lines-after-imports = 2
order-by-type = false
section-order = [
    &quot;future&quot;,
    &quot;standard-library&quot;,
    &quot;third-party&quot;,
    &quot;first-party&quot;,
    &quot;local-folder&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>This closely matched the behaviour of the old isort config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.isort]
profile = &quot;black&quot;
multi_line_output = 3
force_sort_within_sections = true
force_alphabetical_sort_within_sections = true
sections = [&quot;FUTURE&quot;, &quot;STDLIB&quot;, &quot;THIRDPARTY&quot;, &quot;FIRSTPARTY&quot;, &quot;LOCALFOLDER&quot;]
known_first_party = []
known_thirdparty = []
skip_gitignore=true
lines_after_imports=2
combine_as_imports=true

<p>The specific option that fix this is <code>order-by-type = false</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a similar problem that I cannot seem to solve with the current settings on v0.2.1 (although I cannot find anything in the changelogs that indicate this was solved in v0.2.2 or v0.3.0).</p>
<p>I have the following 5 imports:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyspark.sql import Column, DataFrame
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import types as T
</code></pre>
<p>These are sorted by isort with the following config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">[tool.isort]
line_length = 120
multi_line_output = 3
force_alphabetical_sort_within_sections = &quot;True&quot;
force_sort_within_sections = &quot;False&quot;
profile = &quot;black&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I cannot seem to get the same behaviour with ruff, as it always combines the first and third line into this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pyspark.sql import Column, DataFrame, SparkSession
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from pyspark.sql import types as T
</code></pre>
<p>with the following config:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">[tool.ruff.lint.isort]
force-sort-within-sections = false
order-by-type = false
case-sensitive = false
</code></pre>
<p>Am I misconfiguring anything? It seems like the alphabetical sort is sorting AFTER grouping, instead of before. And I cannot seem to turn this off.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@samdoran Thanks, that is a lot closer but still not fully compatible. isort (<code>isort==5.10.1</code>) instead puts <code>Column</code> and <code>DataFrame</code> on the same line.</p>
