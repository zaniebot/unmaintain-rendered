            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When a file is ignored in config, but then explicitly passed on the command line <code>ruff</code> checks it anyway.</p>
<p>Here's a reproducing <a href="https://gist.github.com/cpcloud/fcd285f87486a8bc712911ffc289310c">gist</a>.</p>
<p>This makes running <code>pre-commit run --all-files</code> (using the official <code>ruff</code> pre-commit hook) fail, because files are passed to <code>ruff</code> explicitly.</p>
<p>Ideally, the config is followed no matter what's passed on the command line in this case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, this is actually intentional and is the same strategy used by Black. In short, if you pass a file directly to <code>ruff</code>, we don't ignore it, which is almost always desirable, except in the case of <code>pre-commit</code>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.189">v0.0.189</a>, I added a <code>--force-exclude</code> boolean flag that disables that behavior, and causes Ruff to exclude files regardless of whether they're passed directly.</p>
<p>You should be able to either set that in your <code>pyproject.toml</code>, or better yet pass it as an arg to the pre-commit invocation.</p>
