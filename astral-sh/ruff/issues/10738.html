            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it would be nice if ruff could format <code>toml</code>, <code>yaml</code> and <code>md</code> files.</p>
<p>i get that this may be considered out of scope for ruff, however in the nodejs ecosystem, the prettier formatter works on these filetypes in addition to js &amp; ts files, which is useful because most projects contain files written in those languages.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s something I want to do eventually and we have the infrastructure for it (<code>ruff_formatter</code> is entirely language agnostic). But there are some things we have to figure out (what parsers to use or implement our own? How to integrate it into existing commands) and implementing additional language is a large commitment</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Integrating dprint as an optional formatter (that we call into when the project has installed it) is an option. But I&#x27;m unsure if that&#x27;s the experience users seek. We need to do some designing around this and decide if we want to build out support for new languages ourselves or delegate to other formatters (even Prettier)</p>

<p>I mean <em>technically</em> it has prettier as a process plugin. Which you can configure to run only on yaml.
As much as I dislike prettier for JS/TS, it does just fine for markup/static languages.</p>
<p>Edit: dprint now has a plugin that wraps Pretty YAML: https://dprint.dev/plugins/pretty_yaml/</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also pre-commit&#x27;s https://github.com/macisamuele/language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks which satisfies all my toml, yaml, ini, json (haven&#x27;t tried the others) needs.</p>
<p>dprint also still doesn&#x27;t work through pre-commit&#x27;s free version if you have an online shared config.</p>
<p>Not saying this to discourage the OP&#x27;s request. I too would like if Ruff handled common python config format (.ini for historical reasons for a bunch of tools, and toml). Just offering some options in the short term.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Again I failed my github search and here I am with a duplicate.</p>
<p>Addressing the post 1st comment, toml file for me is almost nobrainer. It is essential part of python ecosystem including heavy usage in uv and ruff as configuration. For the other you have many different tools in pre-commit, prettier and so on. Also JSON is such an universal format that you can build your formatter in a couple minutes or ask chatgpt for one.</p>
<p>I would pick a format for toml file that is really just a cleanup with not many opinions (remove blank lines, extra or missing spaces, lines too long). For example it should not try to convert an object into a block or vice versa. Nor it should try to reorganize blocks or sort arrays.</p>
<p>If any of those features ever become needed they should be their own separated issue.</p>
