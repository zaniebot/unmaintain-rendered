            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was already raised in #794 but closed for unclear reasons. It seemed to have positive support in that thread. When I do something like</p>
<pre><code>def make_test_foo(
    bar: Bar | None = None,
    create_bar=False,
    baz=None,
    create_baz=True,
    qux: Qux | None = None,
    create_qux=True,
):
</code></pre>
<p>in my test fixtures, I want my attention to be called to the missing type annotation on <code>baz</code>, not unnecessary warnings on <code>create_bar</code>, <code>create_baz</code>, and <code>create_qux</code>, because Pyright is already safely assuming them to be <code>bool</code> types.</p>
<p>This could be implemented as either breaking up <code>ANN001</code> into two separate rules, or as an additional config option as mentioned in #794.</p>
<p>I personally think the former option results in a cleaner settings file, but it would obviously be a somewhat breaking change unless the new rule was added as <code>ANN0011</code> so that people would have to opt out of it (I don't believe any such codes currently exist, though, so it would be a deviation from the norm). The best option is therefore likely to be a new config flag, although I am happy to see this implemented in any form possible!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I see. Given that Pyright (and, I assume, Pytype and Pyre, although I haven't used them) behave(s) differently, I'd like to keep the discussion open.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, it would apply to all non-<code>None</code> types. Pyright assumes a type for all of them.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I can go take a look, but I'm not sure why it would be relevant here. It's definitely not an unintentional feature of Pyright.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Per the discussion at https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3090#issuecomment-290691282 PEP-484 says the inferred type should be <code>Any</code> (https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#the-any-type)</p>
<p>It'd be great to get that amended on the language standard and have some consensus around inference. It seems like that's probably a ways off but perhaps we can start a discussion about that in the relevant forum. In the meantime, this does feel reasonable to implement although I'm not sure of the best way how.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know Rust (yet), otherwise I'd be happy to attempt it myself. There are other existing type-aware rules, right? Is there anything they do that can be reused?</p>
