# Docs: `extend-ignore` deprecated but not removed from all docs

---

_Issue opened by @thernstig on 2023-10-26 06:14_

For example https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#rule-selection says:

> along with the [extend-select](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#extend-select) and [extend-ignore](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#extend-ignore) modifiers.

It would be good to remove all mentions of `extend-ignore` so new users do not use it and then have to remove it.
