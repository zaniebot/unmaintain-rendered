input
<pre><code>from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from types import TracebackType

if sys.version_info &lt; (3, 11):
    from exceptiongroup import ExceptionGroup
</code></pre>
<code>ruff --fix</code>
<pre><code>from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
import sys

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    pass

if sys.version_info &lt; (3, 11):
    pass
</code></pre>
problem
<p>The latter is clearly awful code with fully redundant if statements, and the <code>sys</code> and <code>TYPE_CHECKING</code> imports are in fact unused. There seems to be some custom logic for inserting the <code>pass</code> statement, which I think should be removed and this case should not be treated as an auto-fix - since currently you need to manually fix it anyway (except currently you aren&#x27;t warned about it, and have to check the diff).
Other solutions include warning and/or autofixing* <code>if [...]: pass</code> statements. If they exist, they should be included by default.</p>
<p>This is running a new, clean, venv with no config. Version 0.1.11</p>
<ul>
<li>probably only autofix if the condition solely contains checks against <code>typing.TYPE_CHECKING</code>, <code>sys.platform</code>, <code>sys.version_info</code> and maybe a few more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ah you&#x27;re right, <code>TCH005</code>. So a partial fix would be enabling that by default.</p>
<p>Searching through the rules, I&#x27;m not seeing a rule for &quot;empty/unnecessary if-statement&quot; - even in cases where an if statement does have side-effects and removing it outright is dangerous, <code>if &lt;condition&gt;: pass</code> should probably have a rule.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there interest in a PR for an &quot;empty-if-statement&quot; rule (potentially with an unsafe autofix)? I&#x27;d really love a way to catch empty <code>if sys.version_info</code> statements when unused imports are removed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, RUF034 (#13218) could be expanded to check statements rather than just expressions to cover this case. This might also depend on if there should be an unsafe autofix (re: #13852).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@gpauloski I could see such a rule to be useful, but we should think about its scope. E.g what about empty <code>else</code> branches (in <code>for</code>, <code>try</code> etc statements)? And we have to be careful about typing stubs. It&#x27;s probably best to discuss such a rule in a new issue</p>
