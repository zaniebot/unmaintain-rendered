            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there, thank you for this awesome tool!!!</p>
<p>I just incurred in this issue: if I have multiple blank lines between google style docstring sections, no errors and no fixes are run.</p>
<pre><code>def test(variable: str) -&gt; str:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Perfoms a basic operation on variable.

    Args:
        variable: input string.





    References:
        test

    Returns:
        Validated dataframe of the Excel data.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
   return variable
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose this is  the exact interpretation of D410 and D411 (missing blank lines before/after section), but it seems to me that there should be only one line between them.</p>
<p>I see that there is #3827 already, but it seems a bit different (and I could not reproduce that issue with google style docstrings).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I checked how pydocstyle handles this situation and I couldn&#x27;t find anything. I like the idea of having the sections be separated by strictly 1 line. However, my interpretation of D410 and D411 do not necessarily encompass this behaviour. As such I&#x27;m curious what the team thinks about this.</p>
<p>Perhaps moving it to a new rule would make more sense?</p>
<p>If it hypothetically were moved to a new rule / separate check / separate fix it would make it easier to catch both this issue and #3827 in one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I forgot to mention that also pydocstyle doesn&#x27;t catch this issue, so you&#x27;re right it should be a new rule to keep the rule behaviour consistent.</p>
<p>This could be named &quot;exactly-one-line-between-sections&quot;</p>
