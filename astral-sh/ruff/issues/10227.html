<p>If I'm correct, there are not rules which target <code>.yaml</code> or <code>.toml</code> config files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Could be interesting to format also these types of files?</li>
<li>Is this already a things?</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am sure they have a lot of work with Python rules, 677 open issues at that moment.
But, yes, would be nice to have <code>yaml</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>toml</code>, <code>xml</code> formatters included.
For example, I tried many different tools for autoformating <code>xml</code> and almost all of them had some issues (or I had issues with configuring them), perhaps <a href="https://github.com/prettier">prettier</a> was ok, but still not started using it, partially because of <code>node.js</code> dependency.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that would be neat. It's not our primary focus for now. There's still a lot to do on the Python front.</p>

<p>I agree it would be nice if ruff could format/lint toml + yaml but it is possible to use <code>prettier</code> for this without requiring node to be a project dependency. Just use the <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit#option-2-pre-commithttpsgithubcompre-commitpre-commit">pre-commit hook</a> and the <a href="https://pre-commit.ci/">pre-commit-ci</a>.</p>
<p>Example

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Kilo59 yes, thanks, I know it't not a project dependency, in my case it was minor/temporary issue because of outdated node version in CI - upgrade was blocked by other stuff for some time. But still - less js is good )</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess this issue can be closed as duplicate, main discussion is going in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10738 and it's mostly about using <a href="https://dprint.dev/">dprint</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's different as it's about linting and not formatting (although it does mention formatting..)</p>
