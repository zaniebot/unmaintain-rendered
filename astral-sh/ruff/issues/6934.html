            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh i don't think this rule would require multi file analysis. all it needs to do is check whether the method exists on the current subtype, and if it doesn't, assume the <code>super()</code> call is not necessary. it could either only exist on the supertype or doesn't exist at all. either way the <code>super()</code> isn't needed, so it doesn't need to look at the supertype at all</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. What are the use-cases, though, for calling <code>super</code> on a method that isn't the current method? Should that itself be a lint error?</p>

<p>What are the use-cases, though</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in my use case i was looking at old code after enabling some new rules and noticed a bunch of methods that were triggering <code>R6301</code> (<code>no-self-use</code>) because they were calling <code>super</code> but not <code>self</code>. i've raised #6961</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>possibly. i can't remember a time where i've needed to call <code>super</code> for a different method so maybe a rule for that would be useful too</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It <em>does</em> matter if the class using the super is subclassed and it overwrites foo.</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    def foo(self):
        print('foo')


class Bar(Foo):
    def bar(self):
        super().foo()  # FooBar().bar() still calls foo on Foo instead of on FooBar


class FooBar(Bar):
    def foo(self):
        print('foobar')
</code></pre>
<p>So you would need the multifile analysis to check if any other class depends on it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>good point, maybe the rule can initially only look at classes decorated with <code>@final</code> until multi-file analysis is possible</p>
