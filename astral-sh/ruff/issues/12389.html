<p><em>This is a feature proposal</em></p>
<p>There are several checks that constrain some numerically-computed properties of the code: the ones from the top of my head are a limit for McCabe complexity (from C901), number of arguments of a function limit (PLR0903), and a number of lines in a single method (PLR0905).</p>
<p>While these constraints are pretty neat, and useful, I would prefer to have more control over them: for example, in machine learning research, it is common to have a lot of parameters in a function, so the 6 arguments constraint is quite annoying, while putting it to e.g. 10 seems to be a good idea.</p>
<p>Besides, I can imagine that when adopting ruff on a new, un-ruffed, codebase one would want to be able to set particular limits for these rules: like, if it is common in the codebase to have insanely long methods, one could just bump up the length to a required value.</p>
<p>I would love the configuration of these rules to be exposed similarly to how <code>line length</code> is exposed, just with a field in a configuration file. Then, I could put something like:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
max_function_arguments = 5
max_file_length = 500
</code></pre>
<p>into a <code>pyproject.toml</code> and be happy about myself.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#x27;m used to Java checkstyle configuration, which allows to specify an enormous number of different constraints, so I am certainly biased about the necessity of such a feature.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, true, I didn&#x27;t notice that!</p>
<p>Still, I think, my point stands: exposing these arguments more ergonomically and on the top-level of the configuration would be great.</p>
<p>Maybe ruff needs a list of &quot;prioritized rules&quot;, configurations of which are exposed through the top level config, with generic names that bear no relation to the original pylint-or-whatever rule ids? A human-readable alias of sorts.</p>
<p>While ruff does mostly position itself as simply a reimplementation of tons of linters, it seems interesting to have a nicer interface to configure/add rules, since all the people I know just use ruff as a generic linter, without targeting any particular underlying rule group.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think these settings should be exposed globally. They only apply to the linter and, therefore, should be under [<code>ruff.lint</code>]. However, for the setting to be under ruff lint, they would have to apply to multiple lint-groups which I don&#x27;t think they currently do.</p>
<p>I do agree that having them in linter specific sections doesn&#x27;t help with discoverability. This is something we have to solve as part of #1774</p>
