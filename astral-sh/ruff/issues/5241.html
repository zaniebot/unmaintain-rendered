            <div class="timeline-body"><p>discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5111#issuecomment-1593892209, which was closed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>imo having two separate types that do the exact same thing is just confusing and misleading. i've seen people misinterpret <code>NoReturn</code> to mean that the function returns <code>None</code>. having a separate <code>Never</code> type while not treating the old one as deprecated just makes that misinterpretation more likely. i feel like the name <code>NoReturn</code> was only picked because nobody considered the fact that there are other use cases for it, which is why i think it should be avoided altogether.</p>
<p>but i guess it comes down to personal preference, so perhaps a new rule could be created to ban all usages of <code>NoReturn</code>?</p>
