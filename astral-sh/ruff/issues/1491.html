            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not entirely sure why this is happening, but when I go to fix D211 in any class, D203 is thrown in its place. I checked to see if I had any white space causing the issue, but that does not appear to be the case. I also tried to remove white space from both ends, and D204 is added into the mix.  Is this conflict normal, or a problem with Ruff? First time opening an issue, thanks!</p>

<p>Are you using <code>--select ALL</code>? <code>D203</code> and <code>D211</code> are a special case in that they actually conflict. They're intended to support different docstring conventions. This is mentioned in the README but it's buried:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309177/210122933-45a1d82d-cc7e-4a4a-85a8-1b697d6ab7ef.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022-12-30 at 9 58 49 PM" /></p>
<p>I'd suggest turning off <code>D203</code> to resolve. But this is maybe confusing enough that I should special-case it in <code>ALL</code> to avoid this issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I appreciate your hasty response!</p>
<p>I am using pyproject.toml to configure my Python environment! I added <code>D</code> to <code>select</code>, without reading too deeply into the <code>README.md</code>. This would definitely explain the conflict. Thank you very much, I'll be sure to add an <code>ignore</code> parameter to get rid of the warning. I hope to see this linter become popular. Its configuration is way simpler than flake8's to me. Have a good day!</p>

<p>I'd recommend taking one of the <code>D</code> configurations from here: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#does-ruff-support-numpy--or-google-style-docstrings. The docstring configuration is admittedly one thing I'm not super happy with, but e.g., this will enforce &quot;Google-style&quot; docstrings:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
extend-select = [&quot;D&quot;]
extend-ignore = [
    &quot;D203&quot;,
    &quot;D204&quot;,
    &quot;D213&quot;,
    &quot;D215&quot;,
    &quot;D400&quot;,
    &quot;D404&quot;,
    &quot;D406&quot;,
    &quot;D407&quot;,
    &quot;D408&quot;,
    &quot;D409&quot;,
    &quot;D413&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
