_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-04 06:04_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select SIM105 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
def write_models(directory, Models):
        try:
            os.makedirs(model_dir);
        except OSError:
            pass;
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/9173.py:2:9: SIM105 Use `contextlib.suppress(OSError)` instead of `try`-`except`-`pass`
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/9173.py`, the rule codes SIM105, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!

As the node doesn't contain the semicolon, that's the only thing which is remaining after the fix which creates an invalid syntax error:
```python
import contextlib
def write_models(directory, Models):
        with contextlib.suppress(OSError):
            os.makedirs(model_dir);
;
```
