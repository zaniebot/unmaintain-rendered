            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By 'workspace', I mean a working directory that has a <code>pyproject.toml</code>/<code>ruff.toml</code> configuration file. When <code>hx</code> is used outside of a workspace, the server simply does not work with any opened files. None of the functions the server provides work as expected.</p>
<p>These are the associated error logs:</p>
<pre><code>2024-05-01T20:30:48.048 helix_lsp::transport [ERROR] ruff err &lt;- &quot;├─   0.003277s   0ms WARN ruff_server::session::workspace Workspace not found for file:///&lt;filepath&gt;. Global settings will be used for this document\n&quot;
2024-05-01T20:30:48.048 helix_lsp::transport [ERROR] ruff err &lt;- &quot;   0.003399s ERROR ruff_server::server::api An error occurred while running textDocument/didOpen: Unable to take snapshot for document with URL file:///&lt;filepath&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>My assumption is that we don't register a workspace on the server that can 'capture' the opened file, which means that the document is never registered as open (thus, we are unable to take a snapshot of it). We need a better way to handle documents outside of an existing workspace (the best solution may just be to instantiate a new workspace in the session when this happens).</p>
<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>To work around this issue, create an empty configuration file from the directory where you launch the editor, using <code>touch ruff.toml</code>.</p>
