<p>This is admittedly a bit of a weird case, but I saw it in the wild and was surprised that Ruff wasn&#x27;t flagging it as a lint error. With the <code>UP</code> ruleset enabled, Ruff isn&#x27;t detecting the case where the <code>%</code> formatting operator is used on an f-string. Here&#x27;s an example:</p>
<pre><code>def percent_formatting(x: str) -&gt; str:
    return &quot;%s&quot; % x


def percent_formatting_and_f_string(x: str, y: str) -&gt; str:
    return f&quot;{x} %s&quot; % y
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff will correctly flag the first function as having an issue, but the second one it silently ignores. I&#x27;ve created a playground link for this: https://play.ruff.rs/d0eec036-39bb-4db1-b55c-2dde7babaf7d</p>
<p>What I&#x27;d ideally expect is for Ruff to flag the second case as an issue and to suggest that the argument to the <code>%</code> be folded into the f-string, as <code>f&quot;{x} {y}&quot;</code>. Even if it can&#x27;t suggest that specific fix, I think it would good to at least report that there is an error and that the author shouldn&#x27;t be mixing formatting types like that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think I would consider this as a bug because we need to expand the scope of the rule to cover f-strings as currently it only checks for string literals.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not very opinionated whether it&#x27;s a bug or not. My take here is that, as a user, I would find it surprising that UP031 doesn&#x27;t flag f-strings. But I could also see an argument that this could be its own rule (although that&#x27;s another case where I think we&#x27;re leaning too much towards fine granular rules)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whether a different rule or an expansion of the existing one, I&#x27;m +1 on wanting this. There&#x27;s an argument to be made that splitting this off into its own rule allows for more granularity for the users. (<code>UP031</code> is already very hard to add to existing projects)</p>
<p>Regarding autofixes, I think the same as current <code>UP031</code> autofixes rules apply? Where Ruff needs to know the exact number of params to pass to the string (whether it&#x27;s a tuple, a literal tuple, a single item, ...)</p>
<p>In OP&#x27;s <code>percent_formatting_and_f_string</code> example, if  <code>x = &quot;%s&quot;</code> then it would already be failing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One additional wrinkle with this is that f-strings are evaluated before the <code>%</code> formatting, so you could have a situation where an f-string replacement is inserted to add percent formats, ie</p>
<pre><code>def example(insert, value):
    print(f&quot;{insert}&quot; % value)
example(&quot;%s&quot;, 1)
example(&quot;%s %s&quot;, (1, 2))
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure where you would run into this in normal code, but the fact it can happen makes it hard to say any f-string with a replacement isn&#x27;t going to add/remove formats. This sounds to me like it&#x27;s the same reason why <code>UP031</code> doesn&#x27;t lint on complex expressions like concatenations, ie <code>(&quot;%s&quot; + x) % y</code> https://play.ruff.rs/af9fdd40-679d-4844-b68a-21edd5562689</p>
