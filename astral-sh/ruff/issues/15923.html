            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I only noticed this <em>after</em> merging #15890 when I worked on some tests. This looks like a regression. In the following file, the code snippet will not be detected and never executed. In a larger file, this could easily lead to mistakes where someone writes a test that seems to succeed.</p>
<p>This &quot;succeeds&quot; on main, but failed with <em>&quot;unexpected error: [invalid-syntax]&quot;</em> before merging pre-#15890 (as it should):</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># My test

No newline between prose and code:
```py
# A syntax error:
;
```
</code></pre>
<p>While writing a MRE for this bug, I also found this weird behavior which definitely looks like a bug. When the <code>;</code> in the example above is replaced with <code>§</code>, I get:</p>
<pre><code>thread 'mdtest__binary_integers' panicked at crates/ruff_python_trivia/src/cursor.rs:138:41:
byte index 1 is not a char boundary; it is inside '§' (bytes 0..2) of `§
```
`
