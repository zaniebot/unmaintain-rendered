            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Consider this code. Here, <code>use_other1</code> does not cause a rule violation, as expected. I would expect type narrowing in <code>use_other2</code> to result in the same result of no warning, but ruff warns with SLF001.</p>
<p>ruff 0.12.0.</p>

        self._x = 0

    def use_other1(self, other: Child) -&gt; None:
        self._x = other._x  # ruff is OK with this

    def use_other2(self, other: Parent) -&gt; None:
        if not isinstance(other, Child):
            raise TypeError(&quot;Expected an instance of Child&quot;)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! I think this may need type inference, at least in the general case, to resolve the subclass relationship.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, you mean ruff doesn't already do type inference similar to mypy et al? :) I'm surprised, I always thought it does, because it works too well/is too useful for what I imagined is possible without :-).</p>
<p>If I may ask, what's the general case?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No it doesn't! That's great to hear that it's not too noticeable :) There's some limited local/single-file inference but not full type inference.</p>
<p>The &quot;general case&quot; is actually closely related. Ruff only does single-file analysis currently, so we could only resolve parent classes within a single file. We lump type inference and multi-file analysis together, at least in our GitHub labels, since our type checker will have both.</p>
