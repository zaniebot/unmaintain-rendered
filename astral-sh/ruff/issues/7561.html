            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, the NoQA directives are detected and added on the last line of a multi-line string / f-string. With PEP 701, we can add comments inside f-strings, so we should support NoQA directives inside f-strings.</p>
<p>Relevant discussion: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7291#issuecomment-1722839331</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>The tool creates <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/b685ee47499f22a9c1c21657d8a26fa414ee99de/crates/ruff_linter/src/noqa.rs#L731-L736">NoQA mapping</a> which is an offset from the line where the NoQA comment needs to be added and the line where the comment <em>can</em> be added. For the following code snippet, as no comment can go after a line continuation character, there's an offset created from byte offset at the start of line 1 to a byte offset at the start of line 2:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">  foo = x \
# ^
  	+ y
# ^
</code></pre>
<p>This way the NoQA directive will be added at the end of the second line instead of the first. There are some challenges around where to add the comment for f-string w.r.t. the curly brace which is mentioned in the linked discussion.</p>
