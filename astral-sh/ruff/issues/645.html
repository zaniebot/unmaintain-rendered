            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Out of curiosity, do you plan to mark every violation that results in a error to mark as &#x27;error&#x27; according to the LSP API? Especially for flake8, there are a few <code>F...</code> codes that don&#x27;t strictly result in an error in your code and should be declared as a Warning, such as e.g. <code>F401</code>, but then there are also codes like e.g. <code>F523</code> that would definitely result in an error.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should probably differentiate between errors and warnings, though I need to do some research on how linters typically differentiate between the two. (In ESLint, you can also declare each code to be an error, or a warning, or whatever.) Definitely open to feedback here on what a good system would look like!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried finding the severity rules for flake8 in the python extension for vscode (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python) but I was unsuccessful. I would say that everything resulting in a error in python should be marked as &quot;error&quot; (obviously), everything else should be considered a warning. I am not sure when Information is useful, and hint maybe wherever a fix is possible?</p>
<p>Maybe you have more luck deciphering the TS code, I never had any issues with the severity flags in vscode so they might be a good inspiration.</p>
