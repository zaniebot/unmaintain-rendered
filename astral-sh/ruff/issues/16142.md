# RUF009 Triggered on NewType wrapper around immutable type

---

_Issue opened by @adampauls on 2025-02-13 18:25_

### Description

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NewType

Int = NewType("Int", int)


@dataclass
class Foo:
    x: int = 5
    y: Int = Int(5)  # Do not perform function call `Int` in dataclass defaults
```

As of version 0.9.6. Possibly solved by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16048, not sure.

That PR has indeed resolved #15772, which I think this issue is a duplicate of.

```shell
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.9.6

$ ruff check --select RUF009 --isolated -
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NewType

Int = NewType("Int", int)


@dataclass
class Foo:
    x: int = 5
    y: Int = Int(5)

All checks passed!
```
