            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can confirm that Ruff formats this differently than Black.</p>
<p>Black's behavior is more consistent here in that it always tries to break the right first, before breaking the left. Ruff tries to do the same but I think it doesn't because of <code>BestFitParanthesize</code>'s semantic.</p>
<p>Ruff uses <code>BestFitParenthesize</code> for the right side, and the left uses regular groups. The default behavior of the <code>Printer</code> is to prefer breaking right over left, by only testing if what comes after a group contains a line break before exceeding the line width. The problem is, there is no line break according to our current implementation. There's an inline comment that I wrote... but I'm not sure I understand what I meant at that time.</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/5806bc915d9a6cd30ce78644b84ff884f26cf841/crates/ruff_formatter/src/printer/mod.rs#L1289-L1291</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my hope that this would be fixed by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8940 is unjustified. This only changes another small difference.</p>
<p>I'll need to take a closer look at this. Ultimately, I think we can only release this in a new minor version because it will break existing formatting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thank you for looking into this.  maybe it's worth adding it to the list of known deviations?  it is a quite common occurance...</p>
