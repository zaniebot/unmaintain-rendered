            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my code I have some lines which are too long. Perhaps it&#x27;s a long f string for output or a long expression. It would be nice if ruff did some smart things to deal with the too long lines in a way that looks good. For example turning the string into several concatenated strings or something. Is that possible?</p>
<p>I have tried various pyproject.toml settings but they don&#x27;t seem to have any effect. Maybe that&#x27;s my problem&gt;?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pitosalas are you using ruff&#x27;s formatter or is this feedback related to <code>E501</code> (line-too-long) rule?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser Honestly I am not sure. This is my first use of ruff. But my intent is that the formatter notices a line too long and does semi-intelligent things with indentation and even notational changes to make the line not be too long anymore.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pitosalas - Have you tried running <code>ruff format</code> instead of <code>ruff check</code>? That will attempt to wrap lines for you.</p>
