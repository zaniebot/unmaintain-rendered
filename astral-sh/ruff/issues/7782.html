Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>Apologies if this is a duplicate or already fixed; the closest issue I found to this one was #7231.  This issue is similar, but much smaller scoped.  When I run <code>black --check</code>, it gives me a list of filenames that would be reformatted, not just a count.  When I run <code>ruff format --check</code>, it only gives me statistics.  The list of filenames is much more useful when the format check is run during CI, and it'd be nice to add it to ruff.</p>
<p>I'm running ruff 0.0.291.  Here's a sample output from black and from ruff:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">~/my_code % ruff format --check .
warning: `ruff format` is a work-in-progress, subject to change at any time, and intended only for experimentation.
5 files would be reformatted, 264 files left unchanged
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">~/my_code % black --check .         
would reformat /path/to/my_code/my_file.py

Oh no! 💥 💔 💥
1 file would be reformatted, 268 files would be left unchanged.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh It would also be useful to have that when running it <strong>without</strong> <code>--check</code> (or at least allow to enable it with an option).
<strong>Usecase:</strong> I use the pre-commit config to run Ruff locally before each commit, but also on the CI (for all files).</p>
<ul>
<li>Locally, I want to automatically change the files with the formatter on a commit.</li>
<li>In the CI, I want to see what files are not correctly formatted.</li>
</ul>
<p>And thanks for the amazing tools (<code>Ruff</code> and <code>uv</code>) @charliermarsh! 😁</p>
