            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, guys!</p>
<p>I’d like to propose a new rule for Ruff formatter, that mirrors ESLint’s padding-line-between-statements rule. This rule would add blank lines between specific statements in Python code, making it easier to read and understand.</p>
<p>The rule could enforce adding a blank line after an if/while/for/etc statement block. This would help to visually separate different sections of code, improving clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def process_data(value: int, data: dict) -&gt; None:
    if data[&quot;some_key&quot;] and value != 0:
        print(&quot;blah-blah-blah&quot;)
        ...
        print(&quot;blah-blah-blah&quot;)
    key = data[&quot;key&quot;]
    ...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>After:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def process_data(value: int, data: dict) -&gt; None:
    if data[&quot;some_key&quot;] and value != 0:
        print(&quot;blah-blah-blah&quot;)
        ....
        print(&quot;blah-blah-blah&quot;)

    key = data[&quot;key&quot;]
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>In the second example, the blank line after the if block makes the code structure clearer.</p>
<p>Is it possible to implement such a rule in Ruff? I believe this could be a useful feature for enhancing code readability in Python projects.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this behavior should be enabled by default, but it would be great to have the option to configure these padding rules flexibly. For example, similar to how Ruff currently handles import groupings, it would be useful to allow developers to specify where these blank lines should or should not appear.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is similar to what has been asked for in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8632</p>
<p>I'm very hesitant about adding this behind a configuration flag. Doing so would require a more fundamental decision on how opinionated our formatter should be.</p>
<p>I could see this as a lint rule but formatter rules are very painful to implement in the formatter and it's challenging to keep them in sync with our formatter. We don't want the formatter and linter to disagree.  We hope to make a decision on if and which formatter rules  we want to support in Ruff as part of #1774.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the quick response!</p>
<p>I understand the challenges with deciding how the formatter should work. For me, it’s not important whether this feature ends up as a formatter rule or a lint rule. I’d just be happy to see it added in any form :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If it is chosen that the format we should not be configurable to allow this formatting style then an alternative approach could be to implement the &quot;CLB100&quot; rule from the <a href="https://github.com/cyyc1/flake8-clean-block">flake8 clean block</a> plugin.</p>
