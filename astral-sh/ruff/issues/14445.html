<p>This can be reproduced with a notebook that just consists of three empty cells. We are somehow counting empty cells as newlines and then erroring when we try to &quot;delete&quot; them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Actually this bug has a wider blast radius.</p>
<p>If you make a notebook with three cells like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = [1]
a.append(2)
# new cell
a.append(3)
# new cell
a.append(4)
</code></pre>
<p>and apply the unsafe fix for <code>FURB118</code> you also get a panic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The root cause is because the edit spans across the cell boundary which is an invariant we like to follow. In the case of <code>FURB113</code>, the diagnostics is between 3 cells and thus the edit is as well.</p>

    range: 8..43,
    content: Some(
        &quot;x.extend((2, 3, 4))&quot;,
    ),

// Source map created for the edit

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I think we need to consider replacement and deletion across cell boundaries. Insertion is fine because it's at an exact position which isn't going to affect this logic. There's some details on how the source markers are being used to update the cell offsets in the PR description: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4665.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh that's neat- and nice drawing! For deletions we could just delete the cell and adjust the cell offsets (so there will be fewer cell offsets than there used to be). What do you think?</p>
<p>For replacements it's a little less clear what to do, since folks separate things across cells in order to control what executes when.</p>

<p>The thing is we don't really know the kind of edit when trying to update the cell offsets. The main reason for adding the <code>SourceMap</code> abstraction is to avoid passing this information and it would also help in adding multi-language support in Ruff. So, in <code>update_cell_offsets</code> you only have access to the list of <code>SourceMarker</code> and we don't really know which two source markers makes up an edit.</p>
<p>I think we'll need a generic solution which just looks at source markers to determine that certain cell offsets needs to be removed. I'm not exactly sure what this looks like.</p>

<p>Can you say a bit more about this? It doesn't seem like the information of edit-kind is lost. If I understand correctly, the construction of the <code>SourceMap</code> maintains the invariant that there are an even number of markers. Each edit kind is recoverable by examining the pairs of markers: adjacent markers pointing to the same destination is a delation, adjacent markers pointing to different destinations is a replacement or insertion (the latter when the markers have the same source). Could we iterate through the cell offsets and determine whether they are between adjacent source markers, and, if so,  just not propagate them to the target?</p>
<p>Is there a use for <code>SourceMap</code> instances that don't maintain this invariant of evenness?</p>
<p>Finally - it's unclear to me how this relates to supporting other languages. Could you say more about that?</p>
<p>Apologies for my confusion!</p>
