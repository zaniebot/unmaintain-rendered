# Feature: implement eslint-plugin-perfectionist, for Python

---

_Issue opened by @Goldziher on 2025-06-12 17:01_

### Summary

Hi there,

A very useful Eslint plugin - perfectionist, really helps code hygiene by auto sorting alphabetically object keys, attributes, class methods, etc. 

In python it would also be required to sort kwargs.

While this is a stylistic set of rules, I personally find it almost essential for maintainability. 

I would absolutely love having this in python.
