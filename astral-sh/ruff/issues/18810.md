# PIE796 Check StrEnum

---

_Issue opened by @stephencsnow on 2025-06-20 02:44_

### Summary

Existing rule justification: "Enum values should be unique. Non-unique values are redundant and likely a mistake."

The existing rule only checks for classes that subclass `enum.Enum`. Python 3.11 added `StrEnum`, which should adhere to the same behavior as regular Enums.

This issue's proposal is to flag non-unique `StrEnum` values the same way that is done for `Enum`.

### Notes

* Could also consider `IntEnum`, but that may have been intentionally omitted when this rule was first created.
* Could make this a setting, but that feels overkill.
* Happy to put up a pull request for this if the suggestion is well received.

I think this makes sense and should (hopefully) be straightforward to implement, but I'd be interested in any other thoughts.

I think this would also need to be a preview change since it's an expansion of a stable rule.
