            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would be nice to not have to add all 14 (or 15 if you include <code>E501</code>) of the formatter-conflicting rules individually to the <code>ignore</code> list. Having them individually stated also means I have to check in the docs that the list of conflicting rules hasn't changed when I update Ruff. Could be a special keyword in the <code>ignore</code> list or maybe something like <code>ignore-formatter-conflicts</code> in the <code>lint</code> section.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this is something we should improve on and there's some discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8175</p>
<p>We now have a policy that we don't accept any new rules that conflict with the formatter. I hope that helps a bit :)</p>
