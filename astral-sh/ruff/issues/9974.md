<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Running `pipx run ruff test.py --select 'RUF006'` on the following `test.py` file, gives no errors:
```python
import asyncio


async def main():
    pass


loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
loop.create_task(main())
loop.run_forever()
```

I'm using ruff 0.2.1.
