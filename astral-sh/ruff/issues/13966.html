            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Type declarations via variable annotations in red-knot are control-flow sensitive. That is, if you have</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">if flag:
    x: str = &quot;foo&quot;
else:
    x: int = 1
</code></pre>
<p>We will allow that code. But we currently error if you try to assign to a variable at a point in control flow that is reachable by multiple conflicting declarations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">if flag:
    x: str = &quot;foo&quot;
else:
    x: int = 1

# Whether this assignment is valid or not is somewhat ambiguous,
# so we currently error on it with &quot;conflicting declared types, int vs str&quot;.
# The error can be fixed by making this `x: int = 3` instead, which
# explicitly overrides the conflicting prior declarations with a new one.
# We could also just choose to stop emitting that error entirely, and
# allow assignment of either ints or strings here (declared type
# implicitly becomes `int | str` at the control flow join point.)
x = 3
</code></pre>
<p>We also consider &quot;no declaration&quot; (which is implicitly a declaration of <code>Unknown</code>, allowing all assignments to that variable) as a conflict with &quot;some declaration&quot;, so this code is also currently an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">if flag:
    x: int = 1
x = 2  # conflicting declarations, `int` vs `Unknown`
</code></pre>
<p>Other options here would include just letting the declared type implicitly be <code>int | Unknown</code> after the end of the <code>if flag:</code> block, or ignoring undeclared paths and just having the post-if declared type be <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>The current behavior is particularly problematic with a <code>try</code> block. In this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">try:
    x: int = call_that_may_raise()
except:
    x = 2
</code></pre>
<p>Our understanding of control flow in <code>try</code> blocks accounts for the fact that we could enter the <code>except</code> block without having run some or any of the code in the <code>try</code> block (in case of an exception.) Since we reuse that same understanding of control flow for deciding where declarations reach, we end up seeing &quot;conflicting declarations <code>int</code> vs <code>Unknown</code>&quot; at the <code>x = 2</code> assignment, because we see that control flow can reach that point with or without having fully executed the line <code>x: int = call_that_may_raise()</code>.</p>
<p>This doesn't make intuitive sense, because type declarations are a static analysis concept, not a runtime concept, and control-flow jumps due to exceptions are implicit runtime behavior, not obvious in the code structure like other control-flow constructs. It would be better in this case if we considered the <code>x: int</code> declaration to be unconditional.</p>
<p>If we ignored undeclared paths (as discussed above), that would make the undeclared-path part of this problem disappear.</p>
<p>You could still get &quot;conflicting declarations&quot; with code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">try:
    x: int = 1
    x: str = &quot;foo&quot;
except:
    x = &quot;bar&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Where (due to exception control flow) we would see both the <code>x: int</code> and the <code>x: str</code> declarations as &quot;live&quot; at <code>x = &quot;bar&quot;</code>. But this seems much less likely in real code.</p>
<p>Another option here is to dis-regard exception control flow entirely when it comes to type declarations. (We would still consider it in type inference, just not for type <em>declarations</em>.) So in the previous two examples, when it comes to deciding what the live declarations of <code>x</code> are, we would ignore the possibility of jumping directly into <code>except</code> from partway through the <code>try</code>, and we would consider all declarations in the <code>try</code> block as unconditional.</p>
