            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I have python scripts I execute on a slurm cluster.</p>
<p>To give some configurations to the cluster the script starts with comments in a specific style. For example</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/python
#SBATCH -n 5
#SBATCH -N 1
</code></pre>
<p>When formatting this file the Shebang is left as is but the other comments get treated as regular comments and a space is inserted between <code>#</code> and <code>SBATCH</code>. Unfortunately this space prevents the slurm cluster from recognizing the comments.</p>
<p>My current solution is</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/python
# fmt: off
#SBATCH -n 5
#SBATCH -N 1
# fmt: on
</code></pre>
<p>I would like an option to ignore these comments when formatting a file.</p>

<p>I could see an option to specify comment patterns that should never be formatted.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would also be great to preserve vertical folding (or region) comments like <code>#+++</code> or <code># region</code>.</p>
