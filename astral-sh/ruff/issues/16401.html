            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have python scripts I execute on a slurm cluster.</p>
<p>To give some configurations to the cluster the script starts with comments in a specific style. For example</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/bin/python
#SBATCH -n 5
#SBATCH -N 1
</code></pre>
<p>When formatting this file the Shebang is left as is but the other comments get treated as regular comments and a space is inserted between <code>#</code> and <code>SBATCH</code>. Unfortunately this space prevents the slurm cluster from recognizing the comments.</p>
<p>My current solution is</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#!/bin/python
# fmt: off
#SBATCH -n 5
#SBATCH -N 1
# fmt: on
</code></pre>
<p>I would like an option to ignore these comments when formatting a file.</p>

<p>I could see an option to specify comment patterns that should never be formatted.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would also be great to preserve vertical folding (or region) comments like <code>#+++</code> or <code># region</code>.</p>
<p>@MichaReiser Perhaps you were thinking of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9805 ?</p>

<li>My issue https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9805 as Ali mentioned seems related.</li>
<li>There's https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11941 that's also very similar</li>
<li>There's also https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11789, but that's about formatting the comments, not ignoring them.</li>
