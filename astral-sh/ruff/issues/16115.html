            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>There's a known issue that the output from mdtest is not coloured if you simply run <code>cargo test</code> (https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/235). Until recently, however, you <em>would</em> get pretty colours from the mdtest framework if you simply ran <code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code> (which is what I usually do locally). I added the feature in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13725. It appears to have broken recently: whereas you used to get something like this when the tests failed:</p>

<p>You now get something like this, which is much harder to read:</p>

<p>I tried bisecting, and <code>git bisect</code> points to d47088c8f83f966f734c254a23073eeee123c347 as the first bad commit (from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/15976). I find this surprising -- I can't see any obvious changes in that PR that would have had any impact on this? But indeed, if I checkout that commit, no test failures are colourised when I run <code>cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic</code>; but if I checkout the previous commit, test failures are colourised as expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>sure... but why did that change in d47088c8f83f966f734c254a23073eeee123c347? I don't see any changes to the <code>red_knot_test</code> crate or any <code>Cargo.toml</code> files in that commit</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It introduced a <code>snapshot-diagnostics</code> test, which disables coloring for these tests, and all tests run after it.</p>
