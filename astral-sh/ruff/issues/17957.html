            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It is mentioned in the documentation of FBT001:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dunder methods that define operators are exempt from this rule, as are setters and <code>@override</code> definitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think other than property setters, functions with their name starting with <code>set_</code> and taking a single positional boolean should be exempted. Or at least functions starting with <code>set_is_</code>.</p>
<p>The value of FBT001 is in detecting when a boolean value is being used as a flag instead of an enum or similar patterns, it should be fine with booleans when they are being used as values.</p>
