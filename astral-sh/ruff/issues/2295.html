            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not particularly opposed (but neither am I anyone to listen to in this project), but this feels like more of a formatter than a linter problem. Apart from Q441 and Q442 the rules are somewhat easily replaced by something like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/format-sql/">format-sql</a> or formatting capabilities of <a href="https://sqlparse.readthedocs.io/">sqlparse</a>. The proper question is of course, how to make a generic SQL formatter format code inside a Python string, so maybe this is an example of a more generic problem -- how do we format structured formats inside Python strings? I think we are probably looking at a plugin for SQL, JSON, HTML etc. within the upcoming plugin system. But those are just my two cents.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I <em>am</em> interested in multi-language support eventually but I think extending to SQL right now would be challenging and I'd rather focus elsewhere. Will revisit in time!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For linting SQL, it's hard to beat https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/ at the moment. It's really comprehensive with support for multiple dialects and formatters, like jinja and dbt.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But it sure would be cool if ruff could hook into <code>sqlfluff</code> and use sqlfluff to format python strings it recognizes as sql</p>
