            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be cool if Ruff gave an explanation for <em>why</em> certain fixes are considered unsafe, either in the docs or (even better, but probably requiring much more work) in the CLI output.</p>
<p>E.g. in the case of the fix for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/non-pep604-annotation/">UP007</a>, one can guess that it's because some libraries read annotations at runtime and might behave differently for <code>Union[X | Y]</code> and <code>X | Y</code> (just a guess, maybe that's wrong), but AFAICT, nothing like that is mentioned anywhere in the docs nor in the CLI output.</p>
<p>Maybe there could be a mandatory section explaining the relevant fixes' safety status in the docs page of each rule that has any.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I agree. This is related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8482. Perhaps for the CLI, we could implement it using https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4361, which requires the reason to be mentioned in the code. Subsequently, the documentation could extract the message from there, as is currently done for the diagnostic message.</p>
