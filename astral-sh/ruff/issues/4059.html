            <div class="timeline-body"><p>i am not very sure how ruff worked, but since pylsp-ruff based on this/ruff,
per the discussion https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-ruff/issues/29 here,
would you mind consider adding a feature to make it work for auto-fix for auto-import?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking at the linked issue, do you mean to suggest that <code>ruff</code> offers a way to auto-import symbols which are missing in the current namespace / module?</p>
<p>Language servers do provide this ability on <em>selecting</em> a completion item i.e., to auto-import the symbol if not present.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yes.
make it work via code action, or TextadditionalEdit, or compl item, etc depended on lsp server preferred.
// normally i think better be auto import.
// then isort can tidy it.</p>
<p>but now wish ruff gave a way to Pylsp-ruff firstly to make it be possible to implement it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, we might support this eventually, but it's a little out-of-scope right now. I recommend using Ruff alongside another LSP to provide some of those more general language server features, since Ruff's LSP right now is mostly focused on enforcing and facilitating Ruff-related rules.</p>
