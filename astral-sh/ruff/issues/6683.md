From [flake8-pie](https://github.com/sbdchd/flake8-pie):

```
Check that values are passed in when collections are created rather than creating an empty collection and then inserting.

# error
bars = []
bar = bar()
bars.append(bar)

# ok
bar = bar()
bars = [bar]

# error
s = deque()
s.append(foo)

# ok
s = deque([foo])
```
