            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sometimes <code>re.escape</code> are needed in pytest for <code>match=...</code> arguments.
Then the string is modified and the regex escape is no longer needed.
It would be great if ruff could detect this and remove the unneeded <code>re.escape</code>.</p>
<p>M~WE:</p>
<pre><code>import pytest, re

with pytest.raises(Exception, match=re.escape(&quot;regexnotneeded&quot;)):
    ...
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@InSyncWithFoo was so kind to implement the rule and we looked through the ecosystem changes. After seeing the changes, I don&#x27;t think we should add this rule to ruff. While it&#x27;s true that the <code>re.escape</code> call is unnecessary, it does train people not to use <code>re.escape</code> and they might then forget using it in cases where they actually should.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder if we could create ar ule that warns about <code>match</code> parameters that would need escaping. Are there heuristics that would allow us to detect correctly escaped from incorrectly escaped strings?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Easier for escaped that don&#x27;t need to be, much harder for not-escaped that should to be. Pytest matches can work with regex, so it would be very hard to figure out if a string that looks like a regex isn&#x27;t and should be escaped.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you have a string passed to <code>pytest.raises()</code> that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not a raw string</li>
<li>Not surrounded by <code>re.escape()</code> and</li>
<li>contains a regex metacharacter</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that the string should <em>either</em> be a raw string (if it&#x27;s meant to be a regex) <em>or</em> should be surrounded by <code>re.escape()</code> (if it&#x27;s not meant to be a regex). That might possibly be a useful rule to add? What do we think?</p>

<p>Sounds good to me. This also goes well with <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unraw-re-pattern/"><code>unraw-re-pattern</code></a>.</p>

<p>We already considered and rejected that check in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/14746">astral-sh/ruff#14746</a>, as Micha stated above in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13705">astral-sh/ruff#13705</a>#issuecomment-2531517937 I agree with his rationale.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suppose I can go ahead and implement the new rule then? A PR should be ready sometime later this week.</p>
