            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have seen this a few times. It would be nice if <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-literal-set/">C405</a> would warn about this case as well. <code>{...}</code> is a literal set so seems reasonable to warn about <code>{}</code> in addition to <code>[]</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would have to be a new rule to keep it consistent with how we handle dicts: <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-literal-within-dict-call/"><code>unnecessary-literal-within-dict-call</code></a></p>
<p>Although it's not entirely clear into which upstream lint rule this would fit</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I realize I should have raised this in upstream flake8-comprehensions first for consistency and so everyone can benefit. Did it now: https://github.com/adamchainz/flake8-comprehensions/issues/619</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would prefer to not extend flake8-comprehensions, now that I only use Ruff. But if I were to add this feature there, I would make it a new rule. Perhaps you can use the next C4xx code for consistency?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That sounds good. The main reason we avoid adding rules that don't exist upstream is to avoid future overlaps but what I hear is that this is unlikely to happen here</p>
