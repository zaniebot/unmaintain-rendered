Testing locally it works fine on ruff 0.12.4 (ee2759b36 2025-07-17) (running <code>uvx ruff check --watch . --isolated</code>), so more details are needed. Info about your operating system may also be useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 . Sadly I can&#x27;t test it since I&#x27;m on windows, but hopefully someone else with a mac can. Can you send the output of <code>uvx ruff check --watch . --isolated -v</code>, since there might be something useful there?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I see, I misunderstood the problem. I assumed it was that the file paths weren&#x27;t appearing, instead of wanting the full output format.</p>
<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware, currently <code>--watch</code> only supports that singular output format, and trying to set other ones with <code>--output-format</code> has no effect.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh. My apologies for not being clearer in the original issue message - I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted your time like that and I shall do better next time. Yet, thank you for your responses.</p>
<p>For others here, my workaround is to use a file watcher like fswatch/watchman/watchexec to watch for file changes and then execute ruff.</p>
<p>To the ruff team, it would be good to have a flag to enable detailed output with code snippet even in --watch mode, like so:</p>

So, is this a fix needed in the docs? Or planned for a later release?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Glad to hear it! Yeah, I guess this was supposed to be stabilized in a release at some point, but I think it would still be nice to respect <code>--output-format</code> instead of just switching the default to <code>full</code>. If this preview behavior isn&#x27;t document anywhere, that could be nice to add in the meantime.</p>

<p>In preview the default is now <code>full</code>, so we still need to respect the flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mathieugouin, are you using <code>preview</code> mode (e.g., in your config?) because I can reproduce your behavior with <code>--preview</code>, and changing the output format isn&#x27;t possible. This seems at least inconsistent with non-preview behavior and is probably related to showing fixes by default (CC: @ntBre).</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be inclined to just support different output formats (at least in preview), or are there reasons why we can&#x27;t do that for watch mode?</p>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/ntBre">@ntBre</a> on 2025-10-27 13:09</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think this is related to showing fixes. I thought there was an even older issue about this, but <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/19552">astral-sh/ruff#19552</a> is the best I found. Non-preview watch mode uses concise output, and at some point we planned to switch to full output, but it has been in preview for quite a while. Neither stable nor preview currently support <code>--output-format</code>, but I agree that they should!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser You were right, I had <code>preview = true</code> in my <code>ruff.toml</code> and in fact this automatically &quot;force&quot; the output format to full.  In non-preview, the <code>--watch</code> output format reverts to concise.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing that!</p>
