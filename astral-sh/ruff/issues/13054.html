            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>We encountered an issue while using the --unsafe-fixes parameter with Ruff 0.6.1. Specifically, the removal of an unused variable containing a boolean expression caused a problem.</p>
<p>The problematic line is: <code>active = offer[&quot;status&quot;] == &quot;Active&quot;</code>.
After running the command ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes, Ruff only removed the <code>active =</code> portion, leaving the <code>offer[&quot;status&quot;] == &quot;Active&quot;</code> part intact in our code.</p>
<p>Firstly, if Ruff can&#x27;t delete the entire line, shouldn&#x27;t it consider the line unfixable and ignore it?
Secondly, given that the variable is unused, perhaps Ruff should delete the entire line to avoid this kind of error? (suggestion)</p>
<p>Could you please address this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @Liritt</p>
<p>I can see how removing the entire line is desired in this case. The reason why the rule&#x27;s auto fix doesn&#x27;t remove the entire line is because the right hand side could have a side effect in which case removing it would not be safe:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
	unused = sys.stdout.write(&quot;bla&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The good news is that you can use <code>B015</code> to detect and remove unused comparisons. Unfortunately, that rule has no auto fix today</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, can we hope to see a feature adding an auto fix for this case in the near future or not ? Like a setting that would allow the user to choose whether or not they want to remove the unused comparisons ? Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A future Ruff version may be able to remove the right-hand side if it can reason about whether the right-hand side has side effects or not.  I don&#x27;t think we should introduce an option that always removes the right hand side because that can very easily lead to bugs.</p>
