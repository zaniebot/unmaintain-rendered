            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hiya! The warning is telling you that you've enabled two rules that would tell you to do contradictory things. That's obviously going to cause some confusing output from Ruff :)</p>
<p>Do you have a <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>ruff.toml</code> or <code>.ruff.toml</code> file somewhere where you've listed the rules you wanted enabled? If so, maybe you could share that, and we might be able to see where the problem is.</p>
<p>The documentation pages for these rules can be found here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#pydocstyle-d</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The warning messages are written to <code>stderr</code>. To get the json output, redirect it e.g. to a file.</p>
