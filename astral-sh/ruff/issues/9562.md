# "from import as" formatting setting?

---

_Issue opened by @Modexus on 2024-01-17 12:04_

Is there a way to control formatting of "from import as" blocks" such as:
```python
from foo import (
    bar as baz,
    bar2 as baz2,
    bar3 as baz3,
    bar4 as baz4,
    bar5 as baz5,
    bar6 as baz6,
)
```

this currently formats to
```python
from foo import (
    bar as baz,
)
from foo import (
    bar2 as baz2,
)
from foo import (
    bar3 as baz3,
)
from foo import (
    bar4 as baz4,
)
from foo import (
    bar5 as baz5,
)
from foo import (
    bar6 as baz6,
)
```
As I have a bunch of these it makes it quite unreadable and there does not seem to be a way to ignore it without completely disabling I001.

Yup: [`combine-as-imports`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#isort-combine-as-imports).

```toml
[tool.ruff.isort]
combine-as-imports = true
```

Thanks a lot! I missed that isort is configurable in the settings, very useful.

No prob! I think at one point we defaulted this setting to true, but changed it to false to match isort’s defaults.
