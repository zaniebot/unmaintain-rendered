# Links in the PyPi documnetation are broken

---

_Issue opened by @Cjkjvfnby on 2023-09-10 11:45_

On PyPI page  https://pypi.org/project/ruff/0.0.287/ in the table of contents, headers in the document do not have anchors, so references to them are broken.

When you click a link nothing happens.
For example [Getting Started](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/#getting-started)

On the GitHub page links are ok.

Not sure what to do with it.  Maybe just replace it with links to new documentation.
