            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe Ruff supports several hundred rules and also has implemented rules from different linters/formatters like Pylint, Autoflake, Pycodestyle, Flake8, etc. As the project scope expands, it will be quite helpful to write a document outlining the design philosophy like the HF Transformers library to help beginners understand what rules Ruff supports, and which it does not support. Why HF Transformers? I see a correlation between the one of the goals of the project: Be as easy and fast to use as possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, there can be a two-scale categorization for the linting rules:</p>
<p>1)Rules from other linters that need to be ported or <strong>not to be ported</strong> to Ruff.
2)New Rules that need be written for ruff.</p>
<p>This could help sort out the categorization issues in #13897 , #1774 and help the existing rules to be ported in an easier method.</p>
