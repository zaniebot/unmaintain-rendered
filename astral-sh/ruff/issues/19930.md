# Not all fixable errors are resolved with fixAll (VSCode)

_Issue opened by @mrufsvold on 2025-08-15 16:49_

### Summary

I currently have a file with a TC004 error (move import out of TYPE_CHECKING block).

When I click "Quick Fix", ruff correctly moves the import. But when I run, `source.FixAll`, the problem remains. I can't figure out if this is considered a "safe" change or not, so maybe the issue is that this is considered an unsafe fix and that's why it isn't applied, but I would really like it to be an option.

### Version

vscode extension is v2025.24.0

Ah, I think you're right. TC004 has an unsafe fix, although it's not currently documented as such (it's listed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15584 though). I think you can use the [`lint.extend-safe-fixes`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_extend-safe-fixes) setting if you want to consider this specific fix safe.
