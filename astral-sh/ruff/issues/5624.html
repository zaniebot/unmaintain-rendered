            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/try-except-in-loop/">The documentation page for <code>PERF203</code></a> advises readers to &quot;... [u]se instead&quot; source which is not only fails to be stylish, but does not even compile (roughly, it has <code>break</code> where <code>pass</code> perhaps was intended).  Also, early experiments suggest that <strong>Ruff</strong> fires <code>PERF203</code> even for Py3.11 and 3.12, contrary to the text.</p>
<p>I have little sense of how <strong>Ruff</strong> documentation is maintained.  Perhaps someone's already planning corrections for this page.  If not, and if I learn the appropriate workflow, I'll happily submit my own suggestions for revisions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! Are you specifying a target-version? Ruff doesn’t rely on the currently-running Python version, it picks up the minimum-supported version either from your pyproject.toml or the target-version setting.</p>
<p>The example could definitely be improved — PR welcome, it would only require editing the Markdown around <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/38fa305f358df8420f94ce62d072908010a38ec4/crates/ruff/src/rules/perflint/rules/try_except_in_loop.rs#L30">here</a>.</p>
