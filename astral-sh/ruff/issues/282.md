# Support pattern matching

---

_Issue opened by @sobolevn on 2022-09-29 09:26_

As I am learning the source code, it seems to me that python's pattern matching is not supported at all.

We have a visitor ready: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/c7349b69c12b7511d48fc45390eac8d7282062a5/src/ast/visitor.rs#L527-L571

But, that's about it.

Things to support (feel free to update):
- [ ] Unused variables check
- [ ] Variable names check (`MatchAs` pattern)
- [ ] Custom rules, like do not match `float`s

Yeah it makes some appearances in the RustPython AST but it doesn't seem to be supported yet by the actual parser.

The parser in question is `rustpython-parser`, correct? No promises, but I can take a look at its current state and see whether I can contribute support for the `match` syntax.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-10 04:23_

Yeah that's the one! There's been a little bit of progress in that PR. There's also someone who's been looking to migrate the entire parser to `rust-peg` (https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/4423) which would be a much bigger change. Then @andersk had augmented the parser to support parenthesized context managers (https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/4352) and had mentioned perhaps looking into match statements next.

I'd love to sponsor someone (financially, that is) to work on this issue (in RustPython). If you're interested, shoot me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charliermarsh) or email me at charlie.r.marsh@gmail.com :)

_Comment by @jad-haddad on 2023-01-31 10:35_

Actually when there is a `match` expression in a python module, ruff fails silently?
I spent an hour debugging why ruff isn't sorting my imports even though the iSort rules are enabled, when I commented out the match expression ruff was able to sort again, is that expected?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-31 12:25_

@JadHADDAD92 - So sorry that you lost time to this. It _is_ the expected behavior, because syntax errors have their own error code (`E999`). So if you don't have that code enabled (e.g., if you do `ruff foo --select I`), you won't see those errors at all. It's consistent with how Ruff works, but I agree it's confusing. (Flake8 does have the same behavior.)

A few alternatives:

1. Always log an error (separate from a lint violation) if we fail to parse a file. It's hard to imagine this being unhelpful ever.
2. Always include `E999` even if it's not explicitly enabled. This is tricky and complicates the rule-selection semantics.


---

_Comment by @jad-haddad on 2023-01-31 12:45_

I find the first alternative to be the better behavior, because I presume all ruff rules depend on a successful parse of RustPython (right?) therefore if we lint a module which contains a syntax error (failed to parse), and ruff returns 0 as if the file is well linted, it brings no clarity of what happened.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-31 12:54_

Not all rules depend on a successful parse. Some can work off the token stream, or even partial stream. Some rules only look at raw lines (like the line-length violations). And some work off the filesystem (e.g., the rule to detect missing `__init__.py` files). The majority do, but some rules can complete without one.

We could: always log an `error` message if a file fails to parse + exit 1.

@charliermarsh is there an issue for this (logging an error when failing to parse) that I can subscribe to?

What direction are we going in order to support this?

---

I'm working on it here: https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/4519. There are a few problems to solve but that implementation already supports many of the variants.

I'm making good progress on this (I think?). If anyone wants to link to an OSS codebase that makes good use of match statements (for testing), it'd be appreciated.

---

_Comment by @phillipuniverse on 2023-02-19 21:34_

@charliermarsh there are good match examples in the 2nd edition Fluent Python book. [This snippet](https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e/blob/28d6d033156831a77b700064997c05a40a83805f/18-with-match/lispy/py3.10/lis.py#L145) looks like it would catch some edge cases. In fact, if you [search in that repo for the word “match”](https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e/search?q=match&type=) you’ll get examples of that word being used as a keyword as well as a normal variable.

---

_Comment by @SRv6d on 2023-02-19 21:36_

Pyright has some good examples.
https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/packages/pyright-internal/src/tests/samples/match1.py for example or any other `match*.py` file in that directory.

---

_Comment by @ofek on 2023-02-19 22:05_

Also test `if match := re.search(...):`

---

_Comment by @henribru on 2023-02-19 22:12_

Python's own test suite for pattern matching seems like a good litmus test: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/test/test_patma.py

https://github.com/brandtbucher/patmaperformance also has some examples.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-19 23:26_

Parser looking good so far. I got it to parse Black's fixtures which cover a lot of tricky cases.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-19 23:27_

(It also handles soft keywords as pointed out by @ofek. I've also run it over Hatch, Airflow, and Pandas, and confirmed that the output is unchanged, so it's not incorrectly detecting any `match` statements from e.g. variable assignments.)

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-19 23:28_

(Oh, I guess the Black test suite is a subet of `test_patma.py` :))

Thank you!

Heads up for anyone else using the VS code extension you will need to set your ruff path:
```
"ruff.path": ["./.venv/bin/ruff"]
```

Looks like the extension has it's own ruff executable, which [has already been updated](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-vscode/pull/137) to use the latest ruff but hasn't been released yet.

---

_Comment by @mikeroll on 2023-02-22 11:20_

@danstewart most likely you want this instead:
```
"ruff.importStrategy": "fromEnvironment"
```
which will find `ruff` in whatever the venv associated with the vscode workspace is, without having to hardcode the path.

---

_Comment by @danstewart on 2023-02-22 11:22_

Thanks, that's much better.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-22 14:28_

@danstewart - I cut a new pre-release last night that includes v0.0.251, so you can pull it in if you switch to the pre-release channel. I'll probably cut a main-channel release today or tomorrow.
