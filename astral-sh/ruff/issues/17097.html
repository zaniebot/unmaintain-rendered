            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_extend-aliases">lint.flake8-import-conventions.extend-aliases</a> can be used to &quot;undo&quot; default aliases one doesn't want from <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_aliases">lint.flake8-import-conventions.extend-aliases</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't initially think about this as it wasn't documented, until someone else brought the idea.
See how that improves configuration

<p>I think that also now forces to use the non-aliased version, so it's not truly &quot;removing&quot; it. But it still promotes consistency.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's an interesting trick! I'm not totally sure that's how it should be working 😆 maybe it would be better to add another option like <code>exclude-aliases</code> or something? That sounds more similar to the <code>exclude</code>/<code>extend-exclude</code> and <code>include</code>/<code>extend-include</code> naming used elsewhere.</p>
<p>I definitely agree that it would be nicer to have <em>some</em> way of only configuring <code>tkinter</code> here, though.</p>
