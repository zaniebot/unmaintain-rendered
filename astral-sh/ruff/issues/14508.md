# False positive PD011

_Issue opened by @Matt-Ord on 2024-11-21 08:51_

I don't have pandas installed, but it is triggering PD011 on .values property that I have defined in my own class.

code:

```python
class MyClass:
    @property
    def values(self):
        return None


a = MyClass()

vals = a.values  //Error

```

ruff 0.7.4


```

Thanks, this is similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6432. We are working on an overhaul of our analysis engine that will allow us to fix this false positive long-term, but that's still far out. For now, I suggest you to disable all `PD` rules if you aren't using pandas `ignore = ["PD"]`
