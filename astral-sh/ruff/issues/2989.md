# D403 not triggering when it should

---

_Issue opened by @cazador481 on 2023-02-17 16:29_

I am seeing D4-3 not hitting a number of cases where flake8 is.
To replicate `ruff test.py --select D403 -n --isolated`

Code:
```python
"""Contains tests for the configuration library."""
import unittest


class BasicConfigurationTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """Doc string."""

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        """runs just once when the class instance is setup."""
        pass
```

I expect the docstring for setUpClass to catch the lower case runs, which is a D403 error

Flake8 catches the error:
``` 
poetry run flake8 test.py
test.py:10:1: D403 First word of the first line should be properly capitalized
```

I am using ruff version
poetry run ruff --version
ruff 0.0.247

pyproject.toml setup
```toml
[tool.ruff.pycodestyle]
max-doc-length = 120

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
exclude = [".venv"]
ignore = [
    "D105",
    "D107",
    "D401",
    "E501",
    "W505",
]
select = [
    "B",
    # "C",
    "D",
    "D415",
    "E",
    "F",
    "N",
    "W",
]

[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]
convention = "google"

[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
"dejavu/__init__.py" = ["F401"]
```
