            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>Feature allows for inline file level ignores, without having to use <code>per-file-ignores</code> but it doesn&#x27;t work.</p>
<p>When I add <code># ruff: noqa: XXX</code> at top or bottom of the file it is not applied and its flag as an used rule (RUF100).</p>
<p>Was this feature actually rolled out? I&#x27;m using the vs code extension</p>
Version
<p>vscode extension version: Version 2025.30.0, The extension ships with ruff==0.14.6</p>

<p>Can you share an example that isn&#x27;t working for you?</p>

<p>Not the case. For example note below screenshot these classes raise <code>Missing docstring in public classRuff[D101](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-public-class)</code></p>
<p>I throw <code># noqa: D101</code> at the top of the file OR the bottom of the file and its flagged as unused and removed on save. Putting it inline is the only way to suppress the ruff warning.</p>
<p>This should be an easy reproducible example if this works for you then perhaps there is some mis-config in my editor.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This could probably be more prominent in our docs, but file-level suppressions have to start with <code>ruff:</code> or <code>flake8:</code>, not just <code>noqa</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A file-level exemption comment is given by a case-sensitive match for #ruff: or #flake8:, with optional whitespace after # and before :, followed by optional whitespace and a case-insensitive match for noqa. After this, the specification is as in the inline case.</p>

</ul>
<p>That wasn&#x27;t obvious to me until I checked the test cases in #2978.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could you try using <code># ruff: noqa: D101</code> instead of <code># noqa: D101</code>? The former is the format for file-level suppressions, while the latter only works for in-line suppressions.
