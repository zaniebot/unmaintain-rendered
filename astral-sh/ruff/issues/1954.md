# Possible overlap between SIM300 and PLC2201

---

_Issue opened by @rabelux on 2023-01-18 13:40_

From my understanding the rules [C2201](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/misplaced-comparison-constant.html) (PLC2201 in ruff) and [SIM300](https://github.com/MartinThoma/flake8-simplify#sim300) are pretty much the same.
If that's the case I'd suggest to drop one in favour of the other.

PLC2201 got introduced in #1023, SIM300 in #1539.

Yeah I agree with this. My gut reaction is to remove `PLC2201`. In the future, we should be able to map rules to multiple codes for compatibility purposes (see, e.g., #1941 which lays the foundation), although there are some questions to answer around how that works with `--select ALL`, `# noqa` , etc.

I'd also prefer to keep SIM300.

Regarding #1941:
I hope the README stays as concise as it is currently? I really love the fact that all error codes are listed in a single spot and I can just `ctrl+f` to look for codes or phrases (like "concatenation" for example) and can almost expect to not find duplicates.

Maybe introduce a column like "aliases" in the [suppurted rules](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#supported-rules) section and also *treat* these codes as aliases? Meaning `noqa` statements and config files may mention other codes but ruff tracks them down to its natively known and implemented error codes. Evaluating `--select ALL` would only look in implemented error codes, not in aliases.

These rules are actually _slightly_ different because the Pylint rule flags any comparison (e.g., `i >= 5`).

I'll probably extend SIM300 to flag those cases too.
