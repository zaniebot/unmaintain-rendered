            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there interest towards partial support for Python &lt; 3.7 target-versions?</p>
<p>Even though Python &lt; 3.7 is currently EoL as far as python.org is concerned, for example <a href="https://ubuntu.com/security/esm">Ubuntu ESM</a> has 14.04 with Python 3.4 supported until 2024, 16.04 with Python 3.5 supported until 2026, etc.</p>
<p>I have a small project that is currently intended to work down to Python &gt;= 3.3 for $reasons (soon &gt;= 3.5), and could look into contributing exclusions and adjustments to advise given by ruff that, if followed, would break the project on these old versions. This would certainly be far from exhaustive, covering just what I happen to come across, so I guess it's debatable whether doing something like this would be better than the current status, i.e. no support for such old versions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'd prefer not to extend official pre-3.7 support. If there were one or two adjustments that were really impactful, I'd consider including them, but frankly it's helpful to be able to draw a line at 3.7.</p>
