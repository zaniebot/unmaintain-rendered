# New rule - unnecessary-generator-tuple (C400 but for tuples)

_Issue opened by @Andrej730 on 2025-06-15 06:26_

### Summary

The reasoning is the same as for https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-generator-list/ - it's more direct and more performant.

```python
import timeit

def bench(repeats):
    def decorator(func):
        total = timeit.timeit(func, number=repeats)
        avg = total / repeats
        print(f"{func.__name__: <35} - {avg * 1e6:.2f} μs")
        return func
    return decorator

@bench(repeats=10000)
def test_list_generator():
    # C400 Unnecessary generator (rewrite using `list()`)
    list(i for i in range(5000))

@bench(repeats=10000)
def test_list():
    list(range(5000))

@bench(repeats=10000)
def test_tuple_generator():
    # Currently undetected by Ruff.
    tuple(i for i in range(5000))

@bench(repeats=10000)
def test_tuple():
    tuple(range(5000))

# test_list_generator                 - 135.23 μs
# test_list                           - 27.07 μs
# test_tuple_generator                - 138.78 μs
# test_tuple                          - 34.86 μs
```
