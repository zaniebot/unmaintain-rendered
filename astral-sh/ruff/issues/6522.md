<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

The minimum reproduction code is as follows:

```python
# ruff-PLE1300-repro.py
"{:^{}}".format("string", 10)
```

The second curly brackets is used to indicate the width of the formatting.

```bash
$ ruff --version     
ruff 0.0.284

$ ruff ruff-PLE1300-repro.py --select=PLE1300
ruff-PLE1300-repro.py:1:1: PLE1300 Unsupported format character '}'
Found 1 error.
