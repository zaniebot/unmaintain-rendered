# Missing config option for `extend_external`

---

_Issue opened by @jvacek on 2024-06-18 10:12_

I have two configs, `base.toml` that is shared for multiple projects, and my in-project `pyproject.toml` that extends the one above.

It would be nice if the `external` could also be extended, much like `select` and `ignore`.

I can see how this is useful. I'm personally hesitant to add new `extend-` settings because we ultimately would need to add a `extend` variant for any list setting. An alternative solution would be to make `external` a table.
```
[ruff.lint.external]
V = "Explanation where the rule comes from"
```

Going for a table would be quite a deviation from the way the other "rule-selector" options behave in my opinion.

IF the greater issue is that adding `extends` would be hard to apply across the board, An alternative might be to go for sections like `[ruff.extends]` and `[ruff.lint.extend]` etc., which would then just contain `select = []` etc. Might be easier to see what is being set/overwritten, and what is being extended.

I'm sure this opens up a whole other can of worms for making sure that all sections can extend and how to deal with non-list values, which might just mean that adding the variant to all list settings might make more sense.

I'm personally fine with supporting it, but somewhat low priority (PR welcome).
