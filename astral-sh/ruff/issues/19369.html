            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ntBre pointed out in #19362 that mkdocs-material was likely lagging behind the latest version. I tried to find out why this dependency wasn&#x27;t automatically updated and found that 2 dependencies used by the docs build are sha-pinned which renovate doesn&#x27;t seem to (know how to) update. As renovate seems to be used widely, there might be a false sense of &quot;everything is always kept up to date&quot; so I thought I make an issue to document the status quo which is likely not the ideal state.</p>
<p>These 2 dependencies aren&#x27;t updated by renovate:</p>
<p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/c0d04f2d56a7de8c7a6ef3f7976a7a59925d5acc/docs/requirements-insiders.txt#L4</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that astral-sh&#x27;s fork of <code>mkdocs-material-insiders</code> is not public/OSS ~(@ntBre is this on purpose? It makes it hard for outsiders to investigate docs related stuff but that might be a conscious decision)~ this seems to be due to sponsorship/licensing reasons as I learned in CONTRIBUTING.md:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/a0d4e1f85408942479d96a47443a7a9b7fc34ee3/CONTRIBUTING.md#L282-L287</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure why an ssh pin is used for the public dependency: https://github.com/PGijsbers/admonitions - there&#x27;s no comment in the requirements.txt. It could be pip-installed: <code>python -m pip install mkdocs-github-admonitions-plugin</code> and hence added to requirements.txt AFAICT</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually meant that the statement on that issue from 2020 could be out of date, not the dependency 😅</p>
<p>But nice sleuthing here! For the admonitions, I think the pin was added for a specific issue mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18163">astral-sh/ruff#18163</a>, which I think should be fixed now. We could probably remove that pin now at least.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah great find! I&#x27;ve made a PR for the admonitions unpin in #19375 so that just leaves the insiders pin which I&#x27;m also addressing as well as it can be I think in the same PR by adding a comment. Not much more that can be done other than maybe setting up some sort of periodic reminder to update the remaining pinned dep as renovate doesn&#x27;t handle that.</p>
