Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>#7146 introduces the ability to format code examples within docstrings in <code>.py</code> files. In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7146#issuecomment-1811115865">this message</a> outlining the proposed strategy it was specifically deemed out of scope to apply formatting to <code>.rst</code> or <code>.md</code> files</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Formatting Python code in other formats</strong>
This means you won't be able to run the formatter over a .rst or a .md file
and have it format any Python code blocks in it. This initial implementation
will only support reformatting Python snippets within docstrings inside Python
files. We can consider formatting Python code in other formats as a future
project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm opening up this issue to request such an ability be added to <code>ruff</code> it that is not already being considered. Or, if it has been considered, then to discuss the issue or hear why it wouldn't be possible.</p>
