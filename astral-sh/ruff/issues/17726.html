            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Related to these, but distinct I think:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6157</li>
<li>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8157</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it possible to have a rule that bans something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def my_function():
    # ruff: noqa: PLR0914
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>This is a valid noqa which ruff currently respects, but usually isn't what the author intended; they intended to ignore the rule for the function but not the whole file (which afaik is not a thing, I'm not asking to make it a thing, it should be a <code># noqa: PLR0914</code> on the function definition).  Something like &quot;only allow <code>ruff: noqa: </code> near the top of the file&quot; might make sense, but disallowing <code>ruff: noqa: </code> comments that aren't at the start of a line (including whitespace) seems maybe better defined?</p>
