            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast">cast()</a> gets around static type safety without ensuring dynamic type correctness. Sometimes you have to use it—you know how it is—but it's not ideal. (For instance, <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/type_narrowing.html#casts">mypy documentation</a> seems to imply the main use of cast is when the typechecker or type annotations aren't quite good enough.) That means, in my opinion, cast is a great candidate to have a rule disallowing its use, to ensure code quality in codebases where it is not needed, even if that rule is ultimately optional.</p>
