            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The playground release ran after <code>v0.0.292</code> and succeeded but the production version was not updated: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/6383308175</p>
<p>A manual run of the release workflow resolved this: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/6393703232/job/17353483270</p>
<p>It looks like this happened for <code>v0.0.291</code> as well. This looks similar to the bug we had with documentation deploys at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7276 and was reported by a user in #7776</p>
