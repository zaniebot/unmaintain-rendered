# allow BLE001 if traceback is generated?

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-26 18:20_

`BLE001` allows
```python
try:
        foo
except Exception:
        raise
```
but disallows:
```python
try:
        foo
except Exception:
        print(traceback.format_exc())
        logger.log(traceback.format_exc())
        logger.exception('something is broken')
```

I think generating a traceback is an indication of handling the exception properly.

This is also ok:

```py
try:
        foo
except Exception as e:
        raise e
```

Would it be appropriate to make this new logic optional so that ruff can be consistent with Pylint's [broad-exception-caught](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/warning/broad-exception-caught.html)? Or perhaps the specific "error"/"exception" allowed calls could be configurable?  Happy to submit a PR if others agree
