            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Theres a lot of awesome work in Ruff that I would love to reuse, notably Ruffs parser &amp; AST. I was wondering if there was interest in making some of the ruff internals available as <code>crates.io</code> crates?</p>
<p>Alternatively, I would be open to making a copy of some of those core crates into their own crate that I'll publish (with attribution + same license + your blessing), similar to what I did with https://github.com/twitchyliquid64/golang-asm.</p>
<p>Cheers
Tom</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/43 for previous discussions around publishing to crates.io.</p>
<p>I'm somewhat open to publishing the parser and AST crates to crates.io if someone puts the effort into setting it up as part of our release pipeline (with big disclaimers that the crates could change at any time)</p>

<p>I don't see any problems with this for as long as you use different names. CC: @zanieb @charliermarsh</p>
