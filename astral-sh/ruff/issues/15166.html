            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using the Ruff extension in VSCode to automatically format Python files. However, I have noticed that when I encounter a severe syntax error while writing code, Ruff is unable to properly format any part of this file.</p>
<p>I would like to ask if this behavior is expected: that a severe syntax error in one place prevents Ruff from formatting all other parts of the file correctly?</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, this is the expected behavior. We may explore formatting files with syntax errors in the future but it isn&#x27;t on our immediate roadmap.</p>
<p>Formatting files with syntax errors comes with its own challenges because the formatter should avoid changing your code to something you didn&#x27;t intend. But we could try to at least format blocks that contain no syntax errors.</p>
