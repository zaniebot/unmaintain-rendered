Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>The Pyupgrade rule set doesn't seem to be configurable to what minimally support Python version our project wants. For example, rule <code>UP007</code> is &quot;Use <code>X | Y</code> for type annotations&quot; which I don't want since I'm supporting 3.8+, which does not support the union syntax.</p>
<p>Sure, I can just ignore the rules that don't apply but I feel like being able to specify Python version is easier. But if you disagree, feel free to close this issue since this is more of an annoyance than a feature request or bug.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We do support this! Via <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#target-version"><code>target-version</code></a>, which you can specify on the command-line or in your <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the fast response! I was just looking at the docs when I realized that I missed that.</p>
<p>Another thought, perhaps it could be auto-detected via the package manager's configuration? For example, <code>[tool.poetry.dependencies.python]</code> in the <code>pyproject.toml</code> tells Poetry the Python version a project supports</p>
