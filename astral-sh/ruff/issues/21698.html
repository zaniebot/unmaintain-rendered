            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Consider the following pair of expressions:
(a) <code>issubclass(type(x), MyClass)</code>
(b) <code>isinstance(x, MyClass)</code></p>
<p>The expression <strong>(a)</strong> has the same truth conditions as <strong>(b)</strong>. But the equivalence is not obvious to mypy and other tools.</p>
<hr />
<p>Recently I saw this snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, d: dict):
        pass


def coerce_list(xs: list[MyClass | dict]) -&gt; list[MyClass]:
    result = []
    for x in xs:
        if issubclass(type(x), MyClass):
            result.append(x)
        else:
            result.append(MyClass(x))
    return result
</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>else</code> branch, <code>x</code> can only be a dict. But mypy does not <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/type_narrowing.html">infer</a> it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">❯ uvx mypy@1.19.0 .
error: Argument 1 to &quot;MyClass&quot; has incompatible type &quot;MyClass | dict[Any, Any]&quot;; expected &quot;dict[Any, Any]&quot;
error: Incompatible return value type (got &quot;list[MyClass | dict[Any, Any]]&quot;, expected &quot;list[MyClass]&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>But if I just change <strong>(a)</strong> to <strong>(b)</strong>, then <code>mypy</code> reports success.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this issue. I'm, unfortunately, not sure what you're asking for in this issue. Is this a request for a new rule? Is it an issue with an existing rule? Is it an issue with mypy? Would you mind explaining in more detail how the <code>issubclass</code>/<code>isinstance</code> distinction relates to Ruff, and what change you would like to see?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And the pattern that the rule would flag is any usage where the value passed to <code>issubclass</code> is <code>type(x)</code>.</p>
<p>It seems there are some wrinkles to it: the two are only equivalent as long as <code>__instancecheck__</code>, <code>__subclasscheck__</code>, and <code>__class__</code> are not overridden in an inconsistent way.</p>

/// Searches for expressions of the form `issubclass(type(x), Cls)`
/// and suggests replacing them with `isinstance(x, Cls)`.
/// Both forms have the same truth conditions.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Mypy and similar tools use type narrowing (https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/type_narrowing.html):
/// they can infer that after a statement or inside a branch the type of a variable
/// is more specific than before that statement or outside that branch.
/// 
/// But type narrowing only works with simple patterns. So under the condition `if isinstance(x, Cls)`
/// `x` is inferred to be an instance of `Cls`, but under the condition `issubclass(type(x), Cls)`
/// inference breaks.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def coerce_list(xs: list[MyClass | dict]) -&gt; list[MyClass]:
///     result = []
///     for x in xs:
///         if issubclass(type(x), MyClass):
///             result.append(x)
///         else:
///             result.append(MyClass(x))
///     return result
/// ```
///
/// In the else branch, `x` can only be a dict. But mypy does not infer it.
///
/// ```
/// $ uvx mypy@1.19.0 .
/// error: Argument 1 to &quot;MyClass&quot; has incompatible type &quot;MyClass | dict[Any, Any]&quot;; expected &quot;dict[Any, Any]&quot;
/// error: Incompatible return value type (got &quot;list[MyClass | dict[Any, Any]]&quot;, expected &quot;list[MyClass]&quot;)

<p>Only the fix. We can still flag it, but it's then up to the user to decide if making this change is &quot;okay&quot; in this specific instance (which it almost always should)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems like a reasonable rule. I was curious how prevalent this is in wider ecosystem to decide whether it's worth implementing. I did not expect github search to flag 40k+ occurrences... 😅</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The fix wouldn't always be safe. But the rule suggestion itself sounds reasonable to me given https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/type-comparison/ already exists.</p>
