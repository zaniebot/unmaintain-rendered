<p>I agree that this code per se is correct and we should, if possible, detect and support it. But this can also be a case where a slight restructuring of the code fixes the false-positive (by splitting the code into two assignments)</p>

<p>Yes, but then you drop the beauty of puthon and memory efficiency too... :)
(in the end all can be just C code :chipmunk:)</p>
