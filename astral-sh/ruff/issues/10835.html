            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should consider highlighting code frames and diffs.</p>
<p>I think a good first step would be to implement semantic highlighting into <code>ruff server</code> that, given a string, emits a description of the highlighting. The codeframe and diff rendering can then reuse the same infrastructure to implement.</p>
<p>This is related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp/issues/237</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd very much like to see that.</p>
<p>Currently when using VSCode, you must use the Python extension for syntax highlighting so ruff can't completely replace it and they be used together (which kind-of misses the point of being fast when you must use another extension that's slow).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While this feature is also important to me, I believe a linter shouldn't be concerned with it. Ruff should focus on &quot;making every kind of linter work within its scope,&quot; rather than &quot;trying to solve everything.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think ruff's leap into automatic formatting - and doing a damn good job of it - kinda broke that seal already. I think the desire to see this feature stems from that. Completing the &quot;triad&quot; of core tools that would allow for ruff to be a complete replacement for the multiple plugins we currently need, would be a Godsend.</p>
<p>I'd very much enjoy having centralized configuration if these elements in ruff so I can fully replace the Intelligence stuff (it can be very slow).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Syntax highlighting in diagnostics isn't something on our current roadmap but would certainly be nice to have. <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty">ty</a> supports semantic syntax highlighting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for pointing out ty.</p>
<p>I see that ty is experimental. Is there any advice on what's not working and workarounds?</p>
