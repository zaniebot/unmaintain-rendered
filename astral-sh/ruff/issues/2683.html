Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi all, thanks for an amazing linter.</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if having support for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8-length/">flake8-length</a> is feasible with ruff. We are currently using this for exception message (where it still throw E501 even though we have disabled E501 globally).</p>
<p>This tool is supported with pylint iirc (as we are in the process of migrating away from pylint to ruff).</p>
<p>I would love to help if the team sees fit.</p>

<p>Do you have an example of something that <code>flake8-length</code> permits, but Ruff flags as a violation? I haven't looked at the plugin source code, but we do allow some of the &quot;exceptions&quot; that are mentioned in the README, like URLs and unbreakable strings.</p>

<p>So in <code>flake8-length</code>, you can set <code>max-line-length</code> as a soft limit. So the following example</p>

<p>Ruff flags as a E501 violation. This is expected as I set the line-length to be similar of black.</p>
<img width="1745" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 05 48 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29749331/217830522-c1f378c8-c1fa-4e4c-b4fb-24d45fe753ce.png">

<p>The image above is flake8 with flake8-length enabled.</p>
<p>The current solution for Ruff that we are using is to disable E501 globally.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like the main difference is that <code>flake8-length</code> skips single-line strings and a variety of comments. I'd probably rather not support that for now since there's also been a request to implement flake8-bugbear's line-length rule (which includes a &quot;tolerance&quot;), and I'm hesitant to have so many different line-length rules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds good to me. I think when flake8-bugbear is supported then I will use that instead then.</p>
<p>Closing for now.</p>
