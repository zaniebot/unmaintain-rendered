<p>What is that? I would like either telegram or discord.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm planning to use Discord for this.</p>
<p>From my perspective, it's the most popular choice for OSS projects, and will thus require the least activation energy for the average user to participate and get involved. (I also already use it to participate in a number of similar communities, so selfishly, it's just helpful for me to put this on Discord vs. monitoring another discussion channel.)</p>
<p>I totally understand that some users won't want to use Discord... but I think the reality is that some people will inevitably disagree with whatever I choose... 😅</p>
<p>I'll add a few caveats / clarifications, though:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>No user or contributor should feel required to be part of the Discord.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to chat with me 1:1 through some other synchronous channel, like Matrix, I'm happy to do that. I don't want to fragment the community by maintaining two community channels on different apps, but I'm definitely happy to engage 1:1 elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I really want GitHub to continue to be a source of truth and to continue growing as a form of searchable documentation. So I'll likely ask people to open Issues if they run into a new problem or new question. (Not always, of course -- we'll figure it out the right heuristics as we go.) This has been my main hesitation around adopting <em>any</em> form of synchronous chat.</p>

<p>as of the date of this comment, the link doesn't work when clicking directly, BUT it does work if you copy-paste at the discord UI.</p>
