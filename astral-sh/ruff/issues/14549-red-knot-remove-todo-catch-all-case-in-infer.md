# [red-knot] remove TODO catch-all case in `infer_binary_expression`

_Issue opened by @carljm on 2024-11-22 23:34_

Similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14548, just a slightly bigger task, since binary expressions naturally have a larger possibility matrix (though again, many combinations should simply result in falling back to `Type::Instance` handling.)
