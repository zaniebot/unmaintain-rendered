<p>This makes me think that the code has an error in it, that I am looking for, but that is not the case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sure @zanieb ,</p>
<p>I create:</p>
<p><code>foo/bar/example.py</code></p>
<p>with the contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">STRING = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;
STRING1 = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;
STRING2 = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;
STRING3 = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&gt; ruff check foo/bar/
foo/bar/example.py:1:1: INP001 File `foo/bar/example.py` is part of an implicit namespace package. Add an `__init__.py`.
  |
1 | STRING = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;
  |  INP001
2 | STRING1 = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;
3 | STRING2 = &quot;This code is not relevant&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>I infer from the output that there is a problem to be fixed on line 1 of the file.</p>

<p>Yeah, that seems reasonable. I think we would want to check for an empty range at byte 0 (<code>TextRange::new(0, 0)</code>) which is where this is being raised.</p>
