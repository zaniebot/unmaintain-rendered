            <div class="timeline-body"><p>According to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#exclude ruff excludes the following folders by default:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&quot;.bzr&quot;, &quot;.direnv&quot;, &quot;.eggs&quot;, &quot;.git&quot;, &quot;.git-rewrite&quot;, &quot;.hg&quot;, &quot;.mypy_cache&quot;, &quot;.nox&quot;, &quot;.pants.d&quot;, &quot;.pytype&quot;, &quot;.ruff_cache&quot;, &quot;.svn&quot;, &quot;.tox&quot;, &quot;.venv&quot;, &quot;<strong>pypackages</strong>&quot;, &quot;_build&quot;, &quot;buck-out&quot;, &quot;dist&quot;, &quot;node_modules&quot;, &quot;venv&quot;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be great if .pixi can be added to this list. pixi is a a package manager (https://pixi.sh/latest/), which creates the environment inside the project in the .pixi folder.</p>
<p>This probably won't affect most users, as pixi would be most likely inside the <code>.gitignore</code> file (and even has <code>.pixi/.gitignore</code>). See https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#respect-gitignore</p>
<p>However this only works, when the project is set up using git and this mechanism also don't work when running ruff before the very first git commit. Therefore, I think it makes sense to also add .pixi folder to the above list.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We want to keep the list to a minimum. Users can easily add their own excludes using <code>extend-exclude</code> or add <code>.pixi</code> to their <code>.gitignore</code>. We can reconsider this once pixi has more widespread adoption.</p>
