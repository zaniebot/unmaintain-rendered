            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This one's hard to implement and can generally be unsafe. We don't have plans to implement it soon. Now that we unsafe fix support it <em>might</em> be more reasonable.</p>
<p>cc @AlexWaygood this kind of thing may be worth considering in categorization.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think auto-fixing isn't even the feature request here - although certainly a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Just having the detection capability would be great.</p>
<p>Does your argument only apply to the fixing part or do you also consider the detection hard to implement?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>+1 to this, would be awesome to have it! I think almost any Python project defines many classes, hence having a consistent order of attributes is critical.</p>
