Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is intended behaviour, but it seems that the line length of in-line comments that do not have a space after <code>#</code> is ignored.
This was tested for <code>ruff 0.0.282</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>pyproject.toml</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
line-length = 4
show-source = true
</code></pre>
<p>Test file</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#aaa
#aaaa
# aa
# aaa
</code></pre>
<p>ruff's output</p>
<pre><code class="language-zsh">ruff check test.py 
test.py:4:5: E501 Line too long (5 &gt; 4 characters)
  |
2 | #aaaa
3 | # aa
4 | # aaa
  |     ^ E501
  |

Found 1 error.
✗ - status code 1

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While looking into another issue, I realised that the issue might actually simply be related to the lack of a space in the line.
For example, modifying the above test file to this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#aaa
#aaaa
# aa
# aaa
print('no-spaces')
</code></pre>
<p>Gives the same output as before (barring the new line):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that’s intentional behavior - we don’t flag overlong lines that consist of a single word with no breakable whitespace. This is generally good since it avoids false positives for URLs and other words that can’t be split across multiple lines without hurting readability.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, that's good to know.
Can this be added to the documentation somewhere? Potentially in the <code>line-length</code> setting?</p>
<p>In any case, I think the rule makes sense most of the times.
My only concern is potentially for tab-indented lines that are long, but breakable without hurting readability.
Such cases would fail silently, while the error raised for the cases you mentioned can be suppressed.</p>
<p>However, realistically speaking, I believe such tab-indented cases would be rare (I can't think of any atm), so it might be more beneficial maintaining the current behaviour (and document it somewhere, imo).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, it looks like I completely missed it. My apologies.
Maybe it's worth a mention of exceptions (with a reference to that explanation) <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#line-length">here</a>? Just a suggestion, though.</p>
<p>In any case, thank you for looking into it!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe you should mention in the documentation at https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#line-length that the rule E501 is disabled by default. That means to enforce a <code>line-length</code> one has to configure in <code>pyproject.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
line-length=120
[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = [&quot;E501&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Without the last line <code>ruff check</code> will not find any line-length violations.</p>
