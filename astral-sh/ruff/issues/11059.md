# `ruff server` should use `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` when pull diagnostics aren't supported

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-04-20 22:20_

Right now, `ruff server` only uses pull diagnostics to send diagnostics to the client - they aren't pro-actively sent. This means that any LSP client that doesn't send a pull diagnostics request [will not have visible diagnostics](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11022). This includes Neovim, Helix, and potentially others at the time of this writing, though Neovim will support pull diagnostics in the upcoming `0.10.0` release.

We should still support pull diagnostics going forward, but if they aren't supported (which the server will check using the client capabilities passed in) we should fall back to a publish diagnostics mode as an alternative.
