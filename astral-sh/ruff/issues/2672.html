            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is either a feature request, or just a general question.  you let me know :)</p>
<p>I have a somewhat long config to enable something like numpy style docstrings <strong>and</strong> D417 (which is, for me, one of the most valuable docs rules).  I see that the readme explains that adding any docstyle convention overrides any additional config, which prevents me from just using that plus D417.  I'm wondering whether an exception could be made for D417 (it doesn't <em>seem</em> incompatible with any other rules)?</p>
