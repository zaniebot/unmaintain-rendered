            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The following situation is almost certainly a user oversight [although legal]:
subclasses not annotated with <code>@dataclass</code> of superclasses that <em>are</em> annotated with <code>@dataclass</code>.</p>
<p>The 5 tools I checked didn't provide a diagnostic/warning for this: mypy, ruff, ty, pylint, flake8.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass(kw_only=True, frozen=True)
class Base:
    x: int

# The user almost certainly forgot to annotate Child with `@dataclass(kw_only=True, frozen=True)`
class Child(Base):
    y: int  # Just a class attribute, not a dataclass field

Child(x=1,y=2)         # TypeError: Base.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'y'
Child.__init__         # &quot;Signature: Child.__init__(self, *, x: int) -&gt; None&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Would it make sense for me to try to create a rule for this?
It should also be discussed whether the rule should additionally enforce that the annotations provide identical arguments (e.g. kw_only etc.) as well, but this is less important than the warning about a complete absence of the annotation as that is easy to miss across files, and additionally it might be more complex to eke out whether the user actually <em>did</em> intent to provide disparate arguments.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think it would make sense to try to add a <em>ruff</em> rule for this since you'd be limited to analyzing a single file at a time. So you'd need the type inference/multi-file analysis from ty. But I don't think we're quite ready to add type-inference-powered lint rules there either.</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like a good idea, but I don't think it would be doable to implement it right now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I assume the model for those will be similar to typescript-eslint, a ruff plugin that uses ty for type-informed linting rules.</p>
