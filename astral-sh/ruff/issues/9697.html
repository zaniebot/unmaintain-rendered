It is very useful in <code>.py</code> files generated from <code>.ipynb</code> that each section of import separated by comment <code># %%</code></p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<pre><code>import os

import cvxpy as cp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# %%  &gt;&gt;&gt; This should make all import below this treated as separate isort task
import sys
import traceback
import warnings
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the feature request!</p>
<p>I agree that having this config would be useful for this specific use-case but I was wondering what&#x27;s the motive behind running Ruff on the generated <code>.py</code> file instead of <code>.ipynb</code> directly.</p>
<p>We do something like this for Jupyter notebooks where we need to treat each cell boundary as an import boundary. This can then be used here by treating comments as another import boundary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would make sense. I just need to exclude all generated py file. Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I&#x27;d prefer not to support this until we see a compelling reason to do so, since we support import sorting within notebooks natively. Gonna close for now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve found this issue because I&#x27;d like to have this feature. So I want to give you a reason to add it. I don&#x27;t like to use Jupyter notebooks for coding. I avoid them with the help of a tool named Jupytext. It allows me to create notebooks from Python scripts. To do so, I add to my scripts special comments that serve as cell delimiters. Then it&#x27;s important that, when I format my code, these comments remain in place. That&#x27;s precisely the problem that isort&#x27;s <code>treat_comments_as_code</code> solves. Please consider adding this option.</p>
