            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did a cursory search of the code and didn't find anything related, so I believe this is a feature request. The only reference to &quot;SARIF&quot; that I found was a comment from a few weeks ago: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1546#issuecomment-1371799394</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Add a flag to output SARIF data during a run, instead of, or in addition to, the existing output.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>GitHub's CodeQL can ingest SARIF files during builds, so that we can track lint issues over time and surface issues inline on diffs. These can be uploaded during pull request builds as well as push event builds.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action#usage">The <code>trivy</code> code/container image scan tool supports SARIF format</a>, and this is very helpful for open source projects (since CodeQL is free there) as well as for companies using CodeQL.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Makes sense! I'll admit that I know nothing about the format so will have to look into it when I have some time.</p>
<p>Of course, would also make for a great PR if anyone is interested!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm looking into this a bit and figure I'll share some resources</p>
<p>There's a bandit formatter plugin at <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/bandit-sarif-formatter">microsoft/bandit-sarif-formatter</a> — you can see the implementation details in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/bandit-sarif-formatter/blob/main/bandit_sarif_formatter/formatter.py">formatter.py</a>. They lean on some <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-python-om">generated Python models</a> and Microsoft also publishes a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sarif-tools">CLI tool</a> which may be useful for testing.</p>
<p>The latest SARIF specification is available as a <a href="https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/main/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json">JSON schema</a>.</p>
<p>@padmano are you still actively working on this? Could you link to a branch here so people don't have to ask?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've also been playing with this a bit lately.  My branch is here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/compare/main...C-Hipple:dev-add-sarif-output-support?expand=1</p>
<p>Approach so far was copy/paste the json emitter and then I'm going to just change up the formatting.  Once it's working i'll clean up the copy/paste and see what can easily be reused without getting too complicated.  Probably not too much will end up shared since sarif files group results per rule found, so <code>Serialize for ExpandedMessages</code> is going to look completely different.</p>
<p>What I still need to figure out in Ruff is the best way to get all of the rules which are enabled, since <code>sarif</code> files expect the full list even if there aren't findings for each run.  I started in my last commit with a <code>with_applied_rules</code> builder method but it doesn't look like the <code>EmitterContext</code> has what I need, and I don't really want to re-parse the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.  I haven't spent too much time looking around here yet, but any direction would be appreciated (maybe there's a global settings singleton i'm missing?)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>^^ Found some time and resolved the issues above, now it's just about finding the time to format the json as the sarif format.</p>
