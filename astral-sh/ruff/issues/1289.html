<p>Black reformats entire files in place. It doesn’t reformat lines that end with # fmt: skip or blocks that start with # fmt: off and end with # fmt: on. # fmt: on/off must be on the same level of indentation and in the same block, meaning no unindents beyond the initial indentation level between</p>

<p>Could we re-open this to support line-based directives for a portion of the file? 🙏</p>
