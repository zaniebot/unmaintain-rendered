            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 Yeah this is why the rule is in the nursery -- as long as we don't support multi-file analysis, we can't implement it reliably. I'm gonna close as this is basically a known issue that will eventually be solved by multi-file analysis.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could consider creating a central tracking issue (or a tag like @zanieb did here). I just want to avoid piling up a bunch of known issues related to multi-file analysis that can't be worked on individually and make it harder to navigate the issue tracker.</p>

<p>Also hit this one while enabling <code>--preview</code>. It's a useful rule. It found out 1 place we were missing <code>__hash__</code> but then had 6 false positives due to superclasses.</p>
<p>Added <code># noqa: PLW1641  # hash implemented by superclass</code> at the false positives for now and keeping the rule.</p>
