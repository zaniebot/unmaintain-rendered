            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I came across this blog that warns against unnecessary coupling caused by passing <code>self</code> into child objects https://johnscolaro.xyz/blog/python-code-smells-passing-self &amp; thought this seems like a good lint rule.</p>
<p>An example is</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.speed = 0
        self.wheels = [Wheel(self) for _ in range(4)]  # BAD! passing-self

class Wheel:
    def __init__(self, car: Car): # Cursed Line
        self.wear = 0
        self.car = car # Cursed Line

    def check_car_speed(self):
        print(f&quot;Car speed: {self.car.speed} km/h&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>I will note that this comes from my experience cleaning up code from more junior developers. I certainly haven't done any further analysis and looked for instances of this sort of pattern in large mature codebases, so maybe there are some use cases where it makes sense? I don't think I've seen any though.</p>
<p>Very curious to hear other people's thoughts!</p>
