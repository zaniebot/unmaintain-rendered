<p>Since this seems hard to automate and sync with a ruff releases, maybe we could add a flag to <code>ruff check</code> to ignore schema violations?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, trying to understand why an update to the schema store is necessary here. What's enforcing that the schema matches that of the store? Do you have another pre-commit hook that's enforcing schema validity?</p>
<p>To put it differently: is it Ruff that's throwing an error here? If so, it seems like the Ruff version used by your pre-commit hook doesn't match that of your configuration file.</p>
