            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The class variable <code>_fields_</code> on ctypes <code>Structure</code> objects, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class mount_attr(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = [
        (&quot;attr_set&quot;, ctypes.c_uint64),
        (&quot;attr_clr&quot;, ctypes.c_uint64),
        (&quot;propagation&quot;, ctypes.c_uint64),
        (&quot;userns_fd&quot;, ctypes.c_uint64),
    ]
</code></pre>
<p>will trigger RUF012, but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.Structure._fields_">documentation says</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>fields</em> class variable can only be set once. Later assignments will raise an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError">AttributeError</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so an exception to this rule would be helpful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It makes sense to me to add this as an exception. In the meantime I think you could annotate the field as either <code>typing.ClassVar</code> or <code>typing.Final</code> to suppress the diagnostic. Or maybe use a tuple for the <code>_fields_</code> since the docs just say it needs to be a sequence.</p>

<p>I only found this lint while looking through additional lints to add. For now I'll just disable it, because adding the annotations or switching the list to a tuple is too much churn. Since the upstream ctypes documentation uses lists of tuples for <code>_fields_</code> everywhere, this is probably in most cases written like this.</p>
