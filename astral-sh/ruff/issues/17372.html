            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
Problem
<p>In a simple Django-Ninja project, routers/APIs endpoints with &quot;unused&quot; (by developers) <code>request</code> trigger <code>ARG001</code>.</p>
Context
<pre><code># Imports and stuff...


@router.get(&#x27;/&#x27;, response=list[UserSchema])
def get_users(request: HttpRequest) -&gt; list[UserSchema]:  # Triggers ARG001!
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Retrieve all Users...&quot;&quot;&quot;

    return [UserSchema.from_orm(user) for user in BaseUser.objects.all()]


@router.get(&#x27;/{uuid}&#x27;, response=UserSchema)
def get_user(uuid: str) -&gt; UserSchema:  # Doesn&#x27;t trigger ARG001, but fails within Django-Ninja...
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Retrieve a specific User by UUID...&quot;&quot;&quot;

    return UserSchema.from_orm(BaseUser.objects.get(id=uuid))
</code></pre>
<p>Please, ping me if you need copy-and-paste setup, I&#x27;ll compose it. For now, my current project has too much project-specific configs (mixins, directories structure, etc.)</p>
Function: <code>get_users()</code>, Endpoint: <code>GET /</code>
<p><code>ruff check</code> for this file tells:</p>
<pre><code>13:15 ARG001 Unused function argument: `request`
</code></pre>
Function: <code>get_user()</code>, Endpoint <code>GET /&lt;uuid&gt;</code>
remove <code>request</code> parameter
<p>Fails when calling the endpoint <code>GET /&lt;uuid&gt;</code>. Because, in fact, <code>request</code> IS used in runtime. Traceback:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_PROJECT/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/ninja/operation.py&quot;, line 133, in run
    result = self.view_func(request, **values)
TypeError: get_user() got multiple values for argument &#x27;uuid&#x27;
</code></pre>
rename <code>request</code> to <code>_request</code>
<p>As suggested in <code>ARG001</code>, such arguments should be prefixed with <code>_</code>. However, it also gives an error:</p>
<pre><code>NameError: Fields must not use names with leading underscores; e.g., use &#x27;request&#x27; instead of &#x27;_request&#x27;.
</code></pre>
&quot;Solutions&quot;
<ol>
<li>Set <code>lint.dummy-variable-rgx = &quot;^request$&quot;</code>. I don&#x27;t think I should do that, though:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the purpose this of this parameter is different</li>
<li>there could be more implicitly used input parameters</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Ignore <code>ARG001</code> altogether because IDEs will most likely highlight unused arguments, anyway. But I don&#x27;t like the idea of CI not catching fundamental linting issues.</li>
<li>Adding <code>#noqa: ARG001</code> to every endpoint method is not good enough.</li>
</ol>
Suggestion
<p>Add a separate linting config parameter for such cases.</p>
<pre><code>[lint.per-varname-ignores]
&quot;request&quot; = [&quot;ARG001&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps, it already exists and I&#x27;m blind/silly.</p>
Version
<p>ruff 0.11.5</p>

<p>I&#x27;m working with Django-Ninja like for ca. a week, hence, there might be other ways. However, <a href="https://django-ninja.dev/guides/input/operations/">how-to in docs</a> doesn&#x27;t seem to suggest an alternative.</p>

<p>I suggested another config parameter because, I presume, it&#x27;d most likely be the cheapest/simplest solution. I mean, it&#x27;s <code>lint.dummy-variable-rgx</code> with another name, or are there caveats? I know a little bit of Rust so I might even try to add a PR for that as a little hands-on exercise.
As for the type inference, as far as I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s in the design/development stage? Or there is a nightly version available already?</p>

<p>Yeah I looked at the docs a bit, and that was my conclusion too.</p>

<p>I think it is pretty much that straightforward. I&#x27;d want to check with @MichaReiser before adding a new config option though.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We do have our type-checker, red-knot, in development right now, but it&#x27;s a separate binary (no nightly release yet, but you can build from source if you&#x27;re really curious 🙂). Eventually we also hope to use some of its type inference capabilities in ruff itself, but that is farther away.</p>
<p>In short, the config option seems like the quickest and easiest way to solve this right now, but Micha might have better ideas.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The underlying problem that I see here is that Ruff doesn&#x27;t understand the <code>router.get</code> (and similar) decorators.</p>
<p>One option is to disable <code>ARG001</code> for any decorated function (unless it is a known decorator). That&#x27;s the safest but probably leads to many false positives. The alternative is to add an allow list of decorators where unused arguments aren&#x27;t flagged.</p>
<p>Both approaches have the downside that any unused argument won&#x27;t be flagged for those functions, which may be overly permissive.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a bit hesitant to add either configuration option just yet unless there are other users/frameworks where people run into this.</p>
<p>@UnoYakshi have you considered opening an issue in <code>django-ninja</code> asking if it would be an option to make the <code>request</code> argument optional (so that it doesn&#x27;t have to be specified in the function if unused in the entire body)?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#x27;d prefer not to exclude <code>ARG001</code> from anywhere if possible. I do like the rule most of the time, decorator or not.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m not really sure if the problem lies within decorators area. Do you mind elaborating why do you think otherwise? As I see it&#x27;s possible to write similar non-decorated (maybe, currying?) code that could dynamically use a function with &quot;unused&quot; argument. E.g., getting a method from a module via <code>inspect</code>, not <code>import</code> (I can provide a code example if I didn&#x27;t express the idea clear enough).</p>

<p>I didn&#x27;t think about that before, but I&#x27;ll open an issue, sure. Update: <a href="https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja/issues/1458">link to the issue</a>.</p>

<p>When I start Django (<code>manage.py runserver ...</code>), it&#x27;s thrown in the console with traceback. Or did you mean something else?</p>
