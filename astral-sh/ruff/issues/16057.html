            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Description</h3>
<p>From the style guide for stub files in the official Python typing docs (https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/writing_stubs.html#maximum-line-length):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stub files should be limited to 130 characters per line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this, and want to use <code>line-length=130</code> for all of my <code>.pyi</code> stub files (if this seems weirdly long to you, then look through some of the stubs of e.g. <a href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy-stubs"><code>scipy-stubs</code></a>, and you'll see why it is the way it is).
But at the same time, I also want to be able to use the oh-so-familiar <code>line-length</code> of <code>88</code> for my <code>.py</code>.</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, there is currently no mechanism that allows for configuring the <code>line-length</code> for <code>.py</code> and <code>.pyi</code>.</p>
<p>For libraries where <code>.py</code> and <code>.pyi</code> live in separate directories, this can easily be worked around with a <code>ruff.toml</code> containing e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">extend = &quot;../../pyproject.toml&quot;
line-length = 130
</code></pre>
<p>But for libraries such as NumPy, where the <code>.pyi</code> and the <code>.py</code> are harmoniously living side-by-side, this isn't an option. And I'm having trouble figuring out how I can achieve this &quot;two-sizes-fits-all&quot; configuration.</p>
<p>If I'm missing something; consider this a question. Elsewise, this could be labelled as either a gummy bear or a feature request; choose wisely.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the nice write up and explaining your use case. This makes sense to me but, unfortunately, isn't supported today. What I think the solution to this is to allow file-level overrides (similar to <code>per-file-ignores</code> but for arbitrary settings).</p>
