            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've been playing around with the microsoft lsp as a way of making ruff available to a wider number of editors (particularly vscode and coc-nvim). The major blocker for me is that the main function for linting <code>ruff::linter::lint_path</code> only accepts a <code>Path</code> for the source. There's currently no public interface for linting from contents, or lower level access to the checking functions (i.e. <code>check_path</code> is private and <code>check_ast</code> requires <code>autofix::fixer::Mode</code> but <code>autofix</code> is private)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven’t had time to dig in on this, but is the solution to exposure lint_path and then have the LSP use the ruff crate as a library? Or do we need to expose that functionality as a binary / CLI? I’m happy to do whichever’s necessary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The critical blocker is being able to take a source input, rather than just the path, whether that be in a publically exposed api or from stdin, both are viable. As a preference working with a public api would be nicer, also leaving open the opportunity for incremental linting.</p>

<p>Comenting on your question from https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/289#issuecomment-1263866024 here since it's a more relevant thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it take to enable others to use the LSP from VS Code and elsewhere?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively most python language servers are expected to be able to installed as a python package itself. So just distributing the language server as a python package using maturin would be enough.</p>
<p>Once that is done, the editors that support lsp would start developing clients to interact with the ruff language server.</p>
<p>Although personally I would like to have a general purpose language server to enable completions and use ruff as just an additional checker either as a separate binary or as an extension. Because the existing language servers for python are implemented in python and extremely slow or implemented in JS/TS (pyright) which I don't like.</p>
<p>Now that you have shown what we can do with Rust for python ecosystem hopefully in the future we can build an entire language server from the ground up in Rust for Python and have ruff as a checker extension for it. Like how Rust Analyzer is for Rust.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>👍 This makes sense! I want to spend some time exploring this soon (maybe this coming week), and putting together some official extensions. I use PyCharm, not VS Code, so I’m less familiar with the ecosystem (I need to understand the relationship between the LSP implementation, Ruff as a library, and then the actual editor extensions or actions and how those are distributed). But I do want Ruff to have the best possible editor support for VS Code given its popularity :)</p>

        </div>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/vikigenius">@vikigenius</a> on 2022-10-21 22:35</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep. As long as you have good language server support following the protocol. The people working on the editors will automatically start working on a client if the server is good/popular enough.</p>
<p>For instance, the moment we have a language server for ruff, I will try to contribute a client to Emacs https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode so that I will be able to use it in Emacs. Similar would happen to all editors I am sure.</p>
<p>So the question basically becomes should the language server be a separate implementation? Or should it be somehow integrated into the same Repo (different crate) like how Rust-Analyzer does it for example.</p>
<p>I know @Seamooo had an inital prototype implementation here https://github.com/Seamooo/ruffd it is a good POC for what a language server will look like in general.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The LSP specification https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/ is actually very readable unlike most specifications if you want a reference</p>
<p>Additionally something to consider is that all language servers will have different capabilities that they supports. A hypothetical <code>ruff-language-server</code> will support formatting related capabilities such as <code>codeActionProvider</code> and <code>diagnosticsProvider</code>.</p>
<p>But it won't support static checking and completion capabilities like <code>completionProvider</code> <code>declarationProvider</code> (goto declaration) etc.</p>
<p>A language server like Rust-Analyzer basically supports everything since it integrates, formatting, diagnostics, completion etc. all in one.</p>
<p>I know that linting itself is a huge task that you are taking on, but it might be useful if things like the parsing, AST/CST logic etc. can be well defined and reusable enough that in the future we can think of adding completion and type checking related capabilities as well for an all in one rust based python language server.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome. I'd like it to be in the same repo, if possible. We can use @Seamooo's implementation as a starting point (or would it ever make sense to build atop something like <a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/tower-lsp"><code>tower-lsp</code></a>? I have to do some research here).</p>
<p>You're exactly right that it'd be good to design this with future capabilities in mind. Ruff already supports auto-fix, but auto-formatting is another good example of a capability that would be interesting to explore within the scope of the project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I didn't know about tower-lsp before. It seems like a pretty useful abstraction. The protocal itself is not that hard to implement as can be seen from the prototype implementation https://github.com/Seamooo/ruffd</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Definitely like the look of tower-lsp, and would be a big step for maintainability. Only reservervations would be having to dig into how it does scheduling as request ordering is important in the case of mutations.
If we're looking to create a code action provider for fixes, the api exposing Check, rather than Message, and making Fix a public type should enable everything.</p>

<li>Integrate Reformat Code with <code>ruff --fix</code></li>
<li>Run <code>ruff --fix</code> for a file when the file is saved</li>

<p>And, We can install the plugin on PyCharm settings from <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff">JetBrains marketplace</a>
The version invokes <code>ruff</code> command and give the python code to <code>stdin</code>.</p>

As the next step, I would try to support <code>ruffd</code> (LSP).

OK, I will check the repository. Thank you.
I feel the speed is not bad for only applying to 1 file using CLI from the plugin.
What LSP request type is supported by <code>ruffd</code>?

I will expect to show the message in the <code>message window</code> like <code>console window</code> or/and highlight the code with the error message on the editor in future versions.
If ruff can inspect the code quickly, we can run the ruff by every user action(changing code).
Or, Can ruff partial inspection with cache?</p>

<p>The plugin is designed to prevent unexpected changes.</p>

<li>This is an optional feature. Users can enable the feature from the settings panel.</li>
<li>The plugin invokes <code>ruff</code> and gives the source code as stdin. And The plugin gets formatted code from stdout. <code>ruff</code> command doesn't write the file directly. PyCharm writes the file.</li>

<p>If ruff can inspect the code quickly, we can run the ruff by every user action(changing code).</p>

<p>The Ruff VS Code plugin just runs constantly on the open file, I think it's fast enough to do it on-user-change.</p>

<p>For instance, the moment we have a language server for ruff, I will try to contribute a client to Emacs https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode so that I will be able to use it in Emacs. Similar would happen to all editors I am sure.</p>

I have published version v0.0.3 of the ruff pycharm plugin.
I added the feature <code>inspection</code> and <code>quick fix</code>
Could you please try it? you can download it <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff">marketplace</a>
If you feel good, I want to put the link on the ruff documents.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tsugumi-sys - I bet that https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-lsp would work with Helix, it's just a matter of configuring it.</p>
<p>Same for Emacs @cole-jacobs.</p>
<p>I can try to figure out how to integrate with those editors and add instructions to the <code>ruff-lsp</code> docs -- there are already a few examples, for Neovim and Sublime Text -- but would also love PRs to that effect.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I spent a little bit of time installing <code>lsp-mode</code> with Emacs but couldn't figure out how to get <code>ruff-lsp</code> to work with it, just too unfamiliar with Emacs. If anyone is able to set it up, and wants to contribute instructions, it would be hugely appreciated.</p>

Last week, I added ruff to my project https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator
After using ruff in the actual project, I am excited about ruff and the PyCharm integration.
I will continue to maintain and add features to the PyCharm plugin.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback and your fantastic project.</p>
<p>PS. After knowing your commit history on ruff. I contribute to OSS every day 😸</p>
