<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

Hi all, thanks for an amazing linter.

I'm just wondering if having support for [flake8-length](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-length/) is feasible with ruff. We are currently using this for exception message (where it still throw E501 even though we have disabled E501 globally).

This tool is supported with pylint iirc (as we are in the process of migrating away from pylint to ruff).

I would love to help if the team sees fit.

Thanks for the kind words!

Do you have an example of something that `flake8-length` permits, but Ruff flags as a violation? I haven't looked at the plugin source code, but we do allow some of the "exceptions" that are mentioned in the README, like URLs and unbreakable strings.

So in `flake8-length`, you can set `max-line-length` as a soft limit. So the following example

Ruff flags as a E501 violation. This is expected as I set the line-length to be similar of black.

<img width="1745" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 05 48 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29749331/217830522-c1f378c8-c1fa-4e4c-b4fb-24d45fe753ce.png">

The image above is flake8 with flake8-length enabled.


The current solution for Ruff that we are using is to disable E501 globally.

It looks like the main difference is that `flake8-length` skips single-line strings and a variety of comments. I'd probably rather not support that for now since there's also been a request to implement flake8-bugbear's line-length rule (which includes a "tolerance"), and I'm hesitant to have so many different line-length rules.

Sounds good to me. I think when flake8-bugbear is supported then I will use that instead then.

Closing for now.
