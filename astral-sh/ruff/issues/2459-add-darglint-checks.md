# Add Darglint Checks

---

_Issue opened by @rbebb on 2023-02-02 00:11_

It would be amazing if [darglint](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint)’s checks/rules were added to ruff. darglint’s GitHub repo was archived at the end of last year and it’s also quite slow.

pydocstyle’s checks only check to make sure parameters in the function match the parameters in the docstring. It doesn’t check that returns, exceptions raised, and yields are documented in the docstring.
