# I001 does not use human sort.

---

_Issue opened by @ghuls on 2022-12-25 10:20_

I001 does not use human sort like `isort`.

I001 also does not indicate the lines on which it finds the problem, but always mentions the first line of the file even if the first x lines are correctly sorted.

```python
# Output as generated by: isort --profile=black /tmp/human_sort_import.py
$ ❯ cat /tmp/human_sort_import.py
from numpy import (
    cos,
    int8,
    int16,
    int32,
    int64,
    sin,
    tan,
    uint8,
    uint16,
    uint32,
    uint64,
)
```

```diff
$ ruff --select I001 --ignore F401  --no-cache /tmp/human_sort_import.py 
/tmp/human_sort_import.py:1:1: I001 Import block is un-sorted or un-formatted
Found 1 error(s).
1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.

Makes sense, thank you! Hopefully easy to fix.

The error ranges could be improved too but it will take a bit more care. Right now, they report based on the start and end of the import block (slew of consecutive imports), since we compare entire blocks at a time.
