            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ruff recently started ungrouping imports from a module when using <code>import</code> ... <code>as</code> ..., Am i doing something wrong?</p>
<p>I'm using Ruff v2025.2.0 in vscode.</p>
<p>Silly example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from numpy import ( # noqa: F401
    array as np_array,
    ndarray as np_ndarray,
    float64 as np_float64,
    int32 as np_int32,
    int64,
    uint32,
    uint64,
)
</code></pre>
<p>formats to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from numpy import (  # noqa: F401
    array as np_array,
)
from numpy import (
    float64 as np_float64,
)
from numpy import (
    int32 as np_int32,
)
from numpy import (
    int64,
    uint32,
    uint64,
)
from numpy import (
    ndarray as np_ndarray,
)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hi</p>
<p>I don't think anything changed recently in isort that changed the behavior but have you tried setting <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_combine-as-imports"><code>combine-as-imports</code></a> to <code>true</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That setting didn't seem to have any influence. I'm confused how this works, i had assumed that formatting imports happened with format (either right-click format or format on save) but that doesn't seem to be the case?</p>
<p>So i was using a vscode setting of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">     &quot;[python]&quot;: {
        &quot;editor.formatOnSave&quot;: true,
        &quot;editor.defaultFormatter&quot;: &quot;charliermarsh.ruff&quot;,
        &quot;editor.codeActionsOnSave&quot;: {
            &quot;source.organizeImports&quot;: &quot;explicit&quot;
        },
    },
</code></pre>
<p>If i do <code>shift-alt-o</code> to organize inputs, ruff separates the <code>import as</code> but i also tried isort and that works as expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, <code>format</code> doesn't organize your imports. You have to use the explicit organize imports command.</p>

<p>Interesting, setting <code>combine-as-imports</code> to <code>true</code> does keep the imports together when I tried, see</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Do you see this only in an editor context or is the behavior same from the command-line? If it's different, can you try using <code>source.organizeImports.ruff</code> instead? The one that you've is a broader code action which means if there are any other extensions that supports organizing imports in a Python file, they will be invoked as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>How do i run ruff from the command line in VScode correctly? I have the ruff extension installed.
If i run <code>ruff check --fix ruff_issue.py</code> i get the <code>ruff : The term 'ruff' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.</code>.</p>
<p>if i run the full path (which i found from the ruff output terminal) i get <code>All checks passed!</code> and it doesn't change anything (i think it should sort the order).
<code>c:\Users\xxx\.vscode\extensions\charliermarsh.ruff-2025.2.0-win32-x64\bundled\libs\bin\ruff.exe check --fix ruff_issue.py</code></p>
<p>Switching the vscode setting to the following makes no change, it then ungroups the import as.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">    &quot;[python]&quot;: {
        &quot;editor.formatOnSave&quot;: true,
        &quot;editor.defaultFormatter&quot;: &quot;charliermarsh.ruff&quot;,
        &quot;editor.codeActionsOnSave&quot;: {
            &quot;source.organizeImports.ruff&quot;: &quot;explicit&quot;
        },
    },
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly i am doing something wrong, and haven't had time to learn how to use this correctly, so please dont be shy about pointing out whatever basic obvious thing i'm missing. Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>I don't think there isn't anything obvious. At least there's nothing obvious to me.</p>
<p>Do you have other extensions installed? Maybe isort? Could you try disabling those extensions to see if the issue still reproduces?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CmpCtrl Is the issue that Ruff organizes the imports from first code snippet to the second code snippet as seen in the issue description? If so, then that's the default formatting. If you'd like to keep them combined, then <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_combine-as-imports"><code>combine-as-imports</code></a> setting can be used as mentioned in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15652#issuecomment-2607465479 (refer to the playground link).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks yea, so i made a new <code>pyproject.toml</code> with that setting this morning and it now works. I was confused since i had tried that when it was suggested before and it made no change to the behavior. I must have had a typo somewhere. I'm also confused about why the behavior seemed to change recently, i must have had the isort extension active in the past. Thanks for the tips.</p>
