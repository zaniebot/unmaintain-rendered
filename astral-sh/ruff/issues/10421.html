            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>missing-todo-description</code> (<code>TD005</code>) triggers on the following code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># TODO(tom):
#   something
#   something
</code></pre>
<p>You can reproduce with <code>ruff check /tmp/todo.py --select TD005 --isolated</code> using version 0.3.2.</p>
<p>I would expect it to understand that the following lines are a part of the TODO description.</p>
<p>Search terms: <code>TD005</code>, <code>todo</code></p>
<p>PS: I created the issue with a nonsense title and missing description (pressed enter accidentally). Sorry for the noise.</p>

<ol>
<li>The source <a href="https://github.com/orsinium-labs/flake8-todos">flake8-todos</a> trigger this as an error. I think that the author expected to have a simple description in the same line.</li>
<li>How could we know that the following line is related to the previous one? It is possible to do so but I think it would be too expensive.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tjkuson I'm curious to know why the description starts on the second line and is this a common scenario in projects? Is there a prior art for this format?</p>

<p>I think it's the indent that should signal that the description is part of the todo comment although not sure.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dhruvmanila It's not very common, but it's used: https://grep.app/search?q=%23%20TODO%28%5C%28%5B%5E%29%5D%2A%5C%29%29%3F%3A%5Cn&amp;regexp=true&amp;filter[lang][0]=Python</p>
<p>I think the motivation is readability (e.g., if the TODO comment consists of a list or is long). That's how I discovered the issue.</p>

<p>I added the indentation as that's what I was used to coming from JetBrains IDEs (which require indentation for the syntax highlighting to apply to the entire TODO text). Not all the examples I found include indentation.</p>
