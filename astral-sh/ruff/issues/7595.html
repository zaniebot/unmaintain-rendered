            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/82978ac9b54e16286e5b2fa60240e06ad8cc88d7/crates/ruff_linter/src/lex/docstring_detection.rs">docstring detection state machine</a>, the first string token is always considered as docstring without considering the context. For example, the first strings in the following example are considered as docstrings:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;abcba&quot;.strip(&quot;ab&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>On the opposite end, if multiple strings are implicitly concatenated then only the first string is considered as docstring:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;first&quot; &quot;second&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Python considers the entire string (<code>&quot;firststring&quot;</code>) as the module docstring but the state machine will only say that <code>&quot;first&quot;</code> is docstring while <code>&quot;second&quot;</code> is a normal string.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we need something more reliable here. I wish this could use our AST-based docstring detection -- that is, I wish we could just move these rules to the AST checker.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> move them, but we&#x27;d then have to re-lex the strings in the AST for any implicit concatenations, which seems expensive.</p>

<p>Why is this necessary, considering that python detects the whole string as docsttring?</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see if @dhruvmanila ends up refactoring our string representation anyway to represent string parts in the AST.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser -- Because the string could contain comments in-between the segments:</p>
<pre><code>x = (
    &quot;foo&quot; # comment
    &quot;bar&quot;
)
</code></pre>
<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem in the token-based model because we iterate over string segments and comment tokens. But in the AST, we&#x27;d need to delineate the string contents from the comments.</p>

<p>I see, but we would only need to do this for strings where implicit concatenated is true. So it shouldn&#x27;t be as many? But I guess it is now more complicated with the <code>fstrings</code> support.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I haven&#x27;t explored it fully but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be an issue once the new AST node for implicit string concatenation is complete.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we would need to move the existing rules which uses the state machine to be based on AST instead of tokens. There aren&#x27;t many -- <code>RUF001-003</code> and <code>flake8-quotes</code> rules. I think the only reason they&#x27;re token based is because of implicit string concatenation.</p>
<p>The implementation should probably be in the semantic model.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, the last rule (<code>Q003</code>) is remaining, maybe I&#x27;ll pick that up this weekend. I remember that was a bit difficult because it supports PEP 701 syntax.</p>
