Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p><a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.244">Release notes for v0.0.244</a> mention that several rules have been added, such as E261.</p>
<p>But when running <code>ruff rule E261</code> I get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>❯ ruff rule E261           
error: invalid value 'E261' for '&lt;RULE&gt;': unknown rule code

For more information, try '--help'.
</code></pre>
<p>I tried with both <code>ruff 0.0.254</code> and <code>ruff 0.0.244</code></p>
<p>And indeed, this rule is not checked when running ruff, with the following file (<code>E261.py</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-E261.py">print(&quot;test&quot;) # Test comment with only one whitespace before it
</code></pre>
<pre><code>❯ ruff check --select E --isolated E261.py
</code></pre>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Romain</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey sorry! I mentioned this in #3355 so I'll just copy over that response for now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah yeah, sorry about that. This is just a confusion in messaging -- we've implemented those rules, but they're currently behind a feature flag, so they're not accessible from the production build.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I want all of the remaining pycodestyle rules to go out in a single coordinated release, since it's arguably a 'breaking' change for users (it'll enable a bunch of previously non-existent rules for any users that enable the <code>E</code> category).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are about 10 more rules to go, hopefully in the next week or two but don't hold me to it :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was about to say that I noticed they were missing from the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#pycodestyle-e-w">docs here</a>, so it is intended behavior that they are not enabled yet :slightly_smiling_face:<br />
(And sorry for missing the already filed issue :see_no_evil: )</p>
<p>Which section of the changelog should I watch to notice when they are activated? The <code>Rules</code> section?</p>
<p>Thanks for the super quick reply!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah the <code>Rules</code> section. I'll probably be pretty loud about it when they're enabled since it'll be a big change for some setups :)</p>
