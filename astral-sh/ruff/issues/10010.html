            <div class="timeline-body"><p>D105 checks for documented magic methods, except that <code>__init__</code> is special cased into D107 since many people put that documentation instead into the class docstring.  I'd like ability to add addition magic methods to be considered an init method.  In particular, the dataclass <code>__post_init__</code> method as well as the attrs <code>__attrs_pre_init__</code>, <code>__attrs_post_init__</code>, and <code>__attrs_init__</code>.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is more appropriate to add an option of methods to be ignored for docstrings, similar to how that <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pydocstyle_ignore-decorators">already exists</a> for decorators.  Then I could add those various init functions to that instead to be ignored by D105.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If possible, i'd prefer not to make this an option and instead figure out if this is a common pattern and, if so, just change the rule to reflect it, similar to <code>__init__</code>. Do you know if this pattern of (not) documenting <code>__post_init__</code> is common?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To be honest, I'm not sure if <code>__post_init__</code> is typically documented or not.  I personally see no reason to document it as anything unique in it should be documented in the class docstring, in my opinion.  This is why I kind of shifted my thought in the second paragraph that perhaps it makes more sense to add a whitelist of function names to be ignored by D105, which would also allow a use to add the <code>attrs</code> methods or any other library or common functions they don't care to document...</p>
