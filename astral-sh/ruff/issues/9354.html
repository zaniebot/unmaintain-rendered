            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey there :wave:</p>
<p>Thanks for this great project!</p>
<p>I'm exploring the idea of migrating some projects from flake8 to ruff.
I'm currently having a hard time seeing exactly all the flake8 rules I rely on v.s. the ones implemented in ruff.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is the wrong venue for this or duplicating lots of existing discussions on that topic... happy to be redirected to the right place</p>
<p>My current approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>for each flake8 plugin I use, find the relevant section in the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules">ruff rules</a><ul>
<li>side-by-side compare the rules provided by the latest version of the coresponding flake8 plugin</li>
<li>for the missing ones flag them to check later in ruff issues or other existing ruff rules if they are: already covered by other ruff rules, obsolete and wont be implemented, to be implemented</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process seems tedious, manual and error prone.
Is there a central place where one can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>a side by side comparison of flake8-plugin behavior (at a given version) and ruff rules<ul>
<li>for the ones not implemented: a status or rationale</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This would help a lot figuring out how ruff would behave compared to a given flake8 set of plugins / versions for a given project and also update the list of rules to be implemented when new versions of plugins come out.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've been thinking of implementing something like this to (try to) cover all of the reimplemented rules, but by golly do I have too many side projects...</p>
<p>For context (and prior art),</p>
<ul>
<li>my <a href="https://github.com/akx/pylint-to-ruff">pylint-to-ruff</a> project currently parses the list from the issue #970 and hopes for the best</li>
<li>I think <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8-to-ruff/">flake8-to-ruff</a> <del>just relies on its own tribal knowledge (since it's built from this repo afaiu), etc. (It might be a good idea to port it to Python instead?)</del> was retired in #9329, so it might be worth to reimplement it in Python as a separate project that'd use this same knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would certainly be useful if all of this was in one machine-readable place 😄</p>
