            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17317 reclaimed much of the performance regression from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17286, but it appears as though we have still lost a fair bit of performance over the last two days, much of it due to work on <code>*</code> imports. Here's an annotated graph of how the Codspeed <a href="https://codspeed.io/astral-sh/ruff/benchmarks/crates/ruff_benchmark/benches/red_knot.rs::check_file::benchmark_cold::red_knot_check_file%5Bcold%5D"><code>red_knot_check_file[cold]</code></a> benchmark has changed over the last two days:</p>

There are some suggestions in this thread for further optimisations that we could make: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/17317#discussion_r2035680272</p>
