            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/13309 I found that the following rules can be in conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/complex-if-statement-in-stub/#complex-if-statement-in-stub-pyi002">complex-if-statement-in-stub (PYI002)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/if-with-same-arms/#if-with-same-arms-sim114">if-with-same-arms (SIM114)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import sys

if sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 11):  # SIM114
    OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF: int
elif sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 8) and sys.platform == &quot;linux&quot;:
    OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF: int
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">import sys

if sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 11) or (sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 8) and sys.platform == &quot;linux&quot;):  # PYI002
    OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF: int
</code></pre>
<p>What would the recommendation be here? Could either rule be adapted so they work together ?</p>
<p>In this specific case, granted that typeshed's oldest supported Python version is 3.8, this could be adapted to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">import sys

if sys.version_info &gt;= (3, 11) or sys.platform == &quot;linux&quot;:
    OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF: int
</code></pre>
<p>But the underlying issue still exists.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening this issue.</p>
<p>I see how the interaction here is unfortunate but I also worry that simplifying the boolean condition would require a SAT solver or similar, which seems a bit overkill, but I might be wrong on this.</p>
<p>While unfortunate, I do think that the current interaction between the two rules is reasonable:</p>
<ul>
<li>It honors the user's intention to flag and fix identical-if-arms</li>
<li>It leaves it to the user to simplify the if condition OR to disable <code>SIM114</code> if the condition can't be simplified.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If the official recommendation is there's no better solution than to noqa and it's up to the dev to decide what they prefer. Then that answers my question. I wasn't sure if maybe I was missing something.</p>
