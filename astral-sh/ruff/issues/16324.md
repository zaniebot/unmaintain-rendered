# New rule request: instance attribute defined outside __init__

---

_Issue opened by @Garrett-R on 2025-02-23 02:29_

### Description

PyCharm catches this:

```py
class Foo:
    def define_attr(self):
        self.x = 5
```

by complaining that:

> Instance attribute x defined outside \_\_init\_\_ 

Would be a nice Ruff rule!
