            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The windows download for 0.8.5, is detected as a trojan, thought I should report it, probably a false positive, but didn't see any other issues for it.</p>
<p><strong>File</strong>: ruff-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
<strong>Version</strong>: 0.8.5</p>
<p>This is on Windows 10 with Windows Defender.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for reporting. We've historically not been able to do much about this. It helps if users report the warnings as false positives if their anti-virus software supports them.</p>
<p>I upload this specific file to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4ca646f3659a88eb64b73bcfd4a4927c0194005c5aff69f4c71406d4370360c2">virustotal</a> and not a single scanner reports it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, thought I'd just report it incase it wasn't just a false positive seeing as there didn't appear to be any other issues about it, I was searching for &quot;windows&quot; and &quot;trojan&quot; instead of &quot;virus&quot; (guess this issue should help the search results at least). But anyways like magic, today I was able to download the archive without windows defender complaining and since also updated to 0.8.6 fine.</p>
<p>So who knows what was going on in windows defenders mind 👀</p>
