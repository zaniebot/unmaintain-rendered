            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi.</p>
<p>Can you tell me more about what diagnostics you aren't seeing. Is it Ruff diagnostics or Pylance diagnostics?</p>
<p>Ruff doesn't support workspace diagnostics. It only shows diagnostics for the open files. If it's something about Pylance, then I'm sorry, but you'll have to ask on the Pylance issue tracker.</p>

<p>I understand that. But those warnings and errors can come from different extensions. E.g. some warnings come from Ruff where others come from Pylance.</p>
<p>Ruff doesn't support workspace diagnostics. So the behavior you're seeing is expected. What's up with Pylance, I can't say. You'd have to ask the pylance maintainers for help</p>
