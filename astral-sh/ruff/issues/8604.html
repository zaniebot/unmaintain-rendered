            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Working on a codebase where <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flake8-class-newline/">flake8-class-newline</a> is enforced. To quote that module:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#blank-lines">PEP8</a> says we should surround every class method with a single blank line. However flake8 is ambiguous about the first method having a blank line above it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ruff formatter currently removes leading spaces after a class definition if there is no docstring. Honestly, I've seen more Python classes without a leading space before the first method than ones with a leading space, so I don't think adding a space should necessary be the default, but it would be nice to have an option for having it (or ignoring it if it exists).</p>
<p>Class without newline (current ruff formatting)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class AClassWithoutANewLine(object):
    def a_method(self):
        return 'a_value'
</code></pre>
<p>Class with newline (flake8-class-newline expected formatting)</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class AClassWithoutANewLine(object):

    def a_method(self):
        return 'a_value'
</code></pre>
<p>When a docstring is present, ruff currently adds a space between the docstring and first method, which passes the flake8-class-newline linter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report; this is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8566 and I think the reasoning there stands. Happy to hear additional thoughts though.</p>
