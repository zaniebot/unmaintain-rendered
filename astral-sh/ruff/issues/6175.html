            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sometimes we have large dictionaries, enums, or even lists that contain relevant config info, but the order of the elements is not relevant. For example, we have a map from each of our Django models to the relevant basenames. We need to include every model, and it&#x27;s easier to verify that a model is already included if you know where to look. This can be accomplished by alpa-sorting the keys. My suggestion is for there to be a special comment I can put at the top of the collection which will cause the entries to always be alpha-sorted. Maybe <code># autosort</code> so that other tools can adopt the convention if they so choose?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this can be collapsed with <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1198">astral-sh/ruff#1198</a> which proposes that we support sorting collections based on isort&#x27;s rules (though that&#x27;s not fully decided yet).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would that apply to all collections? This would potentially break other lists for which the order changes the behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, I believe there&#x27;s a pragma comment to mark such collections (see the linked issue for more).</p>
