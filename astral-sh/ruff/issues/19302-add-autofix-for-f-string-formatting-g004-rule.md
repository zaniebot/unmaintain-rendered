# Add Autofix for f-string formatting G004 rule

> The current rule we need the most in microsoft/onnxruntime is G004. Because everything else can be turned into an f-string first.

I closed this because i think #15555 is enough to track this feature request. We don't need an issue for every PR (we generate the changelog from the merged PRs and not the closed issues)
