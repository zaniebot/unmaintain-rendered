            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Very cool tool 🔥 Ran it on a gigantic repo and it crunched through everything in 100 seconds, where as Flake8 would just puke if we tried to lint everything in 1 shot.</p>
<p>Only problem, I'm getting an issue trying to configure it to run as a pre-commit hook :(</p>
<p>I have a bad feeling that I'm just doing something dumb here, but for the life of me I cannot figure it out, so gonna file it as a bug just in case.</p>
<p>I have a repo where all my python files are inside a <code>src</code> directory in my repo root.</p>
<p>Running <code>ruff src</code> from the root dir works as expected, no errors.  However, with the following pre-commit hook</p>
<pre><code>fail_fast: false
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        name: ruff
        entry: ruff src
        language: system
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff seems to completely ignore the directory, and all of my files from root downwards get linted.</p>
<pre><code>pre-commit run
ruff.....................................................................Failed
- hook id: ruff
- exit code: 1

Found 469 error(s).

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think the issue here is that ruff is trying to run against <em>all staged files</em>. (The way <code>pre-commit</code> is designed is that it expects to pass the list of changed files to the underlying tool, rather than always running against a pre-defined directory like <code>src</code>.)</p>
<p>That being said, if you change <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> to this, it should then only check staged <em>Python</em> files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.0.95
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to keep using <code>repo: local</code>, you could do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        name: ruff
        entry: ruff
        language: python
        &quot;types&quot;: [python]
</code></pre>
<p>There might be a way to <em>always</em> run against all files in <code>src</code> (and no other Python files), I'll play around with it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I think you could do this to limit to <code>src</code>:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ah yep looks like that did the trick.  Thanks so much! Will close this out</p>

<p>Nope, private company monolith. ~19000 python files, some of them terrifyingly large.  This was also totally cold, I'm sure that it takes a fraction of that with the cache in place :)</p>
