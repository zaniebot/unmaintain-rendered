            <div class="timeline-body"><p>red-knot currently issues false positives on the following snippets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">def str_instance() -&gt; str:
    return &quot;foo&quot;

some_string = str_instance()


try:
    x = some_string[5]
except IndexError:
    raise ValueError(&quot;no&quot;)
print(x)  # false positive 'possibly not defined' error here


def f():
    try:
        y = some_string[5]
    except IndexError:
        return
    print(y)  # false positive 'possibly not defined' error here


while True:
    try:
        z = some_string[5]
    except IndexError:
        continue
    print(z)  # false positive 'possibly not defined' error here

    try:
        aa = some_string[5]
    except IndexError:
        break
    print(aa)  # false positive 'possibly not defined' error here
</code></pre>
<p>In all of these situations, we see that a variable is declared in the <code>try</code> branch but not the <code>except</code> branch of the <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block. We realise that either branch could be taken, so we union together the boundedness of the two branches to conclude that the variable is possibly unbound at the point where it is read later in the same scope.</p>
<p>What we're missing is special understanding of the <code>return</code>, <code>raise</code>, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements. When we union together the boundedness of the branches, we need to exclude all branches that always end in one of these statements, because we can determine that later statements in the same scope will be unreachable by branches that always end in one of those statements.</p>
