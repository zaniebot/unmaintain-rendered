# SIM114: duplicate reports and same source code is shown

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-02-12 21:33_

```python
failures = errors = skipped = disabled = 0
if result.eofs == 'O':
    pass
elif result.eofs == 'S':
    skipped = 1
elif result.eofs == 'F':
    failures = 1
elif result.eofs == 'E':
    errors = 1
else:
    errors = 1
```

reports:
```
foo.py:9:5: SIM114 Combine `if` statements using `or`
  |
9 |     errors = 1
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ SIM114
  |

foo.py:9:5: SIM114 Combine `if` statements using `or`
  |
9 |     errors = 1
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ SIM114
  |

foo.py:9:5: SIM114 Combine `if` statements using `or`
  |
9 |     errors = 1
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ SIM114
  |

foo.py:9:5: SIM114 Combine `if` statements using `or`
  |
9 |     errors = 1
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^ SIM114
  |

Found 4 errors.
```

→ it's always the same line and row. Should only reported once then.
→ it should underline the whole affected source code

Thanks, doing another pass on this one anyway to improve a few things.
