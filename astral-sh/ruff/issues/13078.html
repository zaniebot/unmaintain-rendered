            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the pylint/ruff gap tracking issue #970 some rules are striked as to indicate that it is considered obsolete/unneeded.</p>
<p>As I am using this issue in scripts to determine the gap every now and then, I noticed one of them is not striked like the rest.</p>
<p><code>confusing-consecutive-elif / R5601</code> has just the name striked, while the rest is striked through to the end of the rule code.</p>
<p>If possible can it be fixed?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
