### Summary

It would be neat if the Ruff formatter supported fibonacci indentation, like this: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ewic.fibonacci-tabbing

Hi

Thanks for the suggestion. Ruff's formatter is intentionally opinionated and tries to follow best community practices. While I can see that this formatting style can be useful, it doesn't qualify the community best practice bar.
