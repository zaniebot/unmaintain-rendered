<p>It'd be good to implement (and hopefully extend) the concept of this project in enforcing best practices for asyncio usage.</p>

<p>Missed this. Had some chats about working on this the last few days in the Discord but did not mention it here. Just opened PR, but as a first time contributor I might not have come up with the most elegant solution. Happy to close for your solution if it's better, or merge the two or something else along those lines.</p>

<p>I'm a first time contributor as well, feel free to peek at what I've done so far: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/4433</p>
<p>Still missing some docs for the violations</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I could have been more clear as well 😅 . Going to leave it to @charliermarsh to decide what's to happen for this one and be a bit more transparent on the next one.</p>

<p>time.sleep -&gt; triggers rule
from time import sleep -&gt; doesnt</p>

<p>Just pointing this out if the PRs port the code exactly as it is on that project to avoid the same mistakes</p>

<p>Good catch., cheers! I'll mark mine as draft with some TODOs, but will hold off on implementing them in case https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/pull/4433 covers that already, in which case I can close mine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going to move forward with reviewing #4432 since it strikes me as a bit more complete (uses scoping logic to detect the async function context, includes documentation for the rules). I'm sorry @inikolaev, I know it's disappointing to put in work on a PR and not see it merged into the codebase, but we now have two similar PRs for the same scope of the work and so I have to choose between them somehow.</p>
<p>If you're interested in contributing, I'd love to help you find something else to work on (e.g., I'd love to finish the <code>flake8-pyi</code> rules from https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/848), but I totally understand if you'd rather not.</p>

<p>No worries, I will look for something else to implement 👍</p>
