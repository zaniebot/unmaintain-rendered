            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PERF401 is triggered on code that has the walrus operator inside. The walrus operator is not available in the list-comprehension if-shorthand and it can not be recreated within a single list-comprehension.</p>
<h1>Minimal example</h1>
<pre><code class="language-py">items = []

for i in range(5):
    if j := i:
        items.append(j)
</code></pre>
<p>This code can obviously be refactored to not include the walrus operator but there are more complex scenarios where it is impossible to do so without using multiple list-comprehensions or duplicating code.</p>
<h1>More complex example</h1>
<pre><code class="language-py">import re

items = []

for s in [&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;cde&quot;, &quot;efg&quot;]:
    if match := re.match(r&quot;e[a-z]+&quot;, s):
        items.append(match.group(0))
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Although it does work if you parenthesize the walrus:</p>
<pre><code class="language-pycon">&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i in range(5) if (j := i)]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>So maybe the rule is correct in emitting a diagnostic here -- maybe we just need to add a clarification to the docs (that says you'll need to parenthesize the <code>if</code> condition if it has a walrus in it) and make sure the autofix doesn't introduce a syntax error?</p>

<p>Oh, I didn't realize that but it's obvious now 😄</p>
<p>Then I agree with you that the documentation could include something about it 👍</p>
