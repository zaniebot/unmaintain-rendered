# ANN401 should find nested `Any`

_@MartinBernstorff_

### Summary

The original `flake8-annotations` does not support it: https://pypi.org/project/flake8-annotations/#dynamic-typing-caveats

But it would be awesome to support in ruff! Alternatively, we/I could update the [ruff docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/any-type/) to document the caveat.
