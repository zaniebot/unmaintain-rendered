            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice if the <code>flake8-todos (TD)</code> checks could be configured with the specific tag that triggers them. Right now they run against <code>TODO</code>, <code>FIXME</code>, and <code>XXX</code>. I would want to restrict that to run against <code>TODO</code> only, for example.</p>
<p>This would be especially nice to cut down on noise against lines that contain <code>FIXME</code>, now that <code>flake8-fixme (FIX)</code> is also implemented. I would personally want <code>TD</code> to run against <code>TODO</code> comments, and <code>FIX</code> to run against <code>FIXME</code>s</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would like this as well - i have a similar use-case to #6808 - XXXs require immediate resolution and TODOs are allowed provided they have a ticket link. however, use of an XXX fails both TD001, TD003, and FIX003 - ideally it would only fail FIX003.</p>
