<p>I applied TCH autofixes to pytorch recently, and hit a pretty gnarly false positive here.
In this case <code>TCH005</code> TYPE_CHECKING &quot;pass&quot; is used to trigger the else block. When the autofix is applied, instead of doing something sensible like changing it to an <code>if not TYPE_CHECKING</code> it just deletes the entire block. Here is the commit ID that reverted it:
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/125536/commits/b7f8f56a079399a32129e3fcc424ae88202baea5#diff-5f3d4caa0693a716fc46fd7f6339312f1b5f0bf89e3a3ff58e9dc13a9486b17aR1103</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if TYPE_CHECKING:
   pass
else:
   print(&quot;IMPORTANT PRINT STATEMENT HERE&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>the fixit would delete the entire code block instead of doing a more sensible fix.</p>
