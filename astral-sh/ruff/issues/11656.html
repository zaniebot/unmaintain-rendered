Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>The following case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">test = 1
test3 = 3
test = test * 2 * test3 * 4
96
</code></pre>
<p>is probably safe as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">test = 1
test3 = 3
test *= 2 * test3 * 4
96
</code></pre>
<p>or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Similarly for concatenation (which is non-commutative, but associative), seems fine here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">test = &quot;1&quot;
test3 = &quot;3&quot;
test = test + &quot;2&quot; + test3 + &quot;4&quot;
'1234'
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">test = &quot;1&quot;
test3 = &quot;3&quot;
test += &quot;2&quot; + test3 + &quot;4&quot;
'1234'
</code></pre>
<p>Example of an operator where this doesn't work (division):</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">test = 1
test3 = 3
test = test / 2 / test3 / 4
0.041666666666666664
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py">test = 1
test3 = 3
test /= 2 / test3 / 4
6.0
</code></pre>
<p>(also just for fun, <code>/</code> is technically a concatenation operator for <code>Path</code>, but that'd require checking for the type)</p>
<p>ruff version 0.4.7</p>
