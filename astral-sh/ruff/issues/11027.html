            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm very excited about the new Ruff LSP, and I would like to try it out in Helix, my editor of choice :)</p>
<p>I did not have a ton of time to look at the config yet but I started playing around with it and I believe the config should start with something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[language-server.ruff]
command = &quot;ruff&quot;
args = [&quot;server&quot;, &quot;--preview&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Then the language server should be added alongside whatever other server you like to use (guess which one I use):</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
language-servers = [&quot;ruff&quot;, &quot;pylsp&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I haven't really had a ton of success for now with server-specific configs (like the ones in the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_server/docs/setup/NEOVIM.md">neovim setup</a>), so a dedicated setup guide would be much appreciated :)
Or really any pointer on the setup!</p>
