# Requesting rule for `empty-body`

---

_@maifeeulasad_

### Summary

Currently we have `invalid-return-type`. But I want to pin point it to further and narrow it down to `empty-body`. `mypy` has support for this. Personally I think it will be a great addition considering migrating from `mypy` to other linter like `ty`

Willing to work on this one. It will take me a day or two push the changes.

Thank you, looking forward to it 😃! As I explained in https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1922, there's no need to create an issue over at Ruff to make an improvement to ty :-) Feel free to comment over at https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1922 if you have any further questions on how to go about this
