            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it does look pretty stable. Searching for related issues and PRs turns up a lot of results, but the ones I checked only referred to PLR0917 and didn't actually modify it. We should consider stabilizing it in the next minor release.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Trying to remember what the reason was that we didn't stabilize the rules...</p>
<p>The only thing that comes to my mind is that we had concerns around various complexity rules (this is a one-off because it tries to approximate complexity by the number of positional arguments). That would explain why many of the other <em>too-many</em> rules haven't been stabilized. But I wasn't able to find any mention in notion. @AlexWaygood do you remember why we haven't stabilized this rule (it was added in 2023)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm looking at this again for 0.13, and I think there are a couple of potential blockers for stabilization:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a pretty opinionated rule, so we may want to wait for #1774 (I commented this <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/19240#issuecomment-3053483488">here</a> too)</li>
<li>We may want to update the rule to skip pytest hooks (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7286#issuecomment-2571570758)</li>
</ul>
<p>Related to the first point, clippy's analogous <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/stable/index.html#too_many_arguments">rule</a> has a default severity of <code>warn</code>, so https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1256 may be related too.</p>
<p>I think we should probably resolve the second issue before stabilization, but I don't think being opinionated is necessarily a hard blocker on its own.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-arguments/"><code>PLR0913</code> (<code>too-many-arguments</code>)</a> used to work like this one and was changed to be less useful, this is why this rule exists. This rule has a strictly more narrow scope as <code>too-many-arguments</code>, so it’s also strictly less opinionated.</p>
