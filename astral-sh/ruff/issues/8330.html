            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Black 23.10.1 and Ruff 0.1.3 produced slightly different outputs for a method call chain that includes a comment, and I couldn't find a relevant issue in the issue tracker. I've reduced to it to a much simpler example where both tools produce identical formatting for <code>x = ...</code> but different formatting for <code>y = ...</code> — black doesn't insert a newline before the closing <code>)</code> and <code>.f()</code>.</p>
<p>It isn't clear to me which tool is producing the &quot;best&quot; result. I find black's decision here slightly odd, and if I add a second method call after the <code># Comment goes here: black and ruff differ</code> line, black <strong>does</strong> insert a newline before <code>.f()</code>. So perhaps I should file this is an issue with black?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting, thank's for reporting.</p>
<p>To me, ruff's formatting seems more consistent and produces fewer changes when inserting/removing <code>.g()</code> (a method call) from the call chain, which is what both Black and Ruff optimize for.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure why black avoids inserting the newline when omitting <code>g</code>, and it could be a bug on their side. But it's also likely that there is reason for the deviation that just isn't obvious from this example.  It might be worth filing an issue on their side.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There have been quite a few similar issues filed with Black recently, and they've all been given the label <code>T:bug</code>. So I think it's fair to say that ruff's formatting isn't an issue here.</p>
