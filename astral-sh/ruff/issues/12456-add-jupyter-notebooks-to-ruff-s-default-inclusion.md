# Add Jupyter Notebooks to Ruff's default inclusion

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-07-22 16:26_

I think it's time we promote Jupyter Notebooks to be included by default in Ruff i.e., promote notebook files to stable.

This requires a minor version bump.

Also, the new native server doesn't run on Jupyter Notebooks unless it's explicitly included using a configuration file.
