...quoting the contents of `Desktop/RunEveryCommand/ruff/Broken/PY_FILE_TEST_11381303964.py`, the rule codes E703, W293, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!

<p>So I think what's happening is that the interaction between <code>W293</code> and <code>D100</code> is actually the root cause. I'll work on a follow-up for now.</p>
<p>I think what may (more a note to myself than anything) be happening is that <code>D100</code> checks for a docstring at the last line of code, so when <code>W293</code> deletes the blank line, we re-lint the file and <code>D100</code> is expecting the same range. Need to look into how Ruff re-lints though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Relatedly, @charliermarsh I wonder if we should look into our error reporting to see why the correct pair wasn't outputted. From what I can tell, in this case we only output what rules we've <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff/src/linter.rs#L449">already fixed</a>, so <code>D100</code> wouldn't show up. Maybe we should show the full rule selection (or selector, since <code>ALL</code> would get messy) and keep track of which rules we've checked already? Not sure of a best path forward there, not super familiar with <code>linter.rs</code> yet.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like the actual content of the file ends up being:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">'if True:\n'
'    x = 1; \\\n'
'   '
</code></pre>
<p>I was able to replicate the issue by attempting to run (in a separate file):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if True:
    x = 1; \
</code></pre>
<p>Note the missing newline after the <code>\</code>.</p>
<p>I think that's the root cause of the issue here - stripping the blank line strips all whitespace, leaving the last <code>\</code> which throws the syntax error.</p>
<p>It also seems like the issue only throws on <code>LintSource::Ast/Imports</code> rules (even without any imports). It throws with <code>D212, D205, SIM103, T100, A001, TID251</code> (all AST-based, picked from random linters) and <code>I001/I002</code> (imports), but not with <code>TD002, T001</code> (both token-based), <code>E101</code> (physical lines), <code>E211</code> (logical lines), <code>N999</code> (filesystem).</p>
<p>Just posting my updates here for future reference - sorry if that's bad form or if that's supposed to go in the PR or something. Regardless, I'll take a look at why the AST rules fail with <code>W293</code> tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wondering if this is related to #4828</p>
<p>E: Actually, this may only be related to <code>AST/Import</code> lints since they're the only ones that ascribe any meaning to the AST</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh Would actually like your thoughts on this, since it may require some deeper fixes.</p>
<p>I've been hacking around to see what's going on. Basically, we take the initial file (note that the last line is 3 spaces):</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">if True:
    x = 1; \
   
</code></pre>
<p>We then, according to the fix of <code>W293</code>, strip out the last line since it's all whitespace. This then leads to a <code>SyntaxError</code> due to the file ending with <code>x = 1; \</code> (essentially trying to continue the line with nothing to continue).</p>
<p>I was originally looking at including <code>;</code> and <code>\</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff/src/rules/pycodestyle/rules/trailing_whitespace.rs#L82">existing code's</a> whitespace detection as &quot;effective whitespace&quot;. Basically, if a <code>\</code> terminates the line and the next non-whitespace character is a <code>;</code>, we know that we're attempting to split lines on an empty statement and should remove them as well.</p>
<p>I then realized that the issue is due to the way that we perform autofixes. We fix a line, then loop over the new AST and attempt to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff/src/linter.rs#L415">re-parse</a> it. This second parse introduces the error due to the RCA above. The issue here is that the fix actually spans fixing the two lines simultaneously (e.g., removing <code>; \\n&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;</code> all in one go - removing the three spaces first won't work, as outlined above.</p>
<p>I'd like your input on how to fix this. It seems like we have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decouple the rule from the concept of <code>Line</code> - seems hacky since it's just this edge case. This would make the rule's implementation unique against other rules, which doesn't seem good.</li>
<li>Move it to a different linter (maybe <code>LintSource::Token</code>?) since those rules <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4404#issuecomment-1583963725">don't seem to throw</a>. I'm not sure if we'd like to do that or even if it would work, just an initial solution I thought about.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a cleaner solution in mind, or can offer any advice, that'd be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>
