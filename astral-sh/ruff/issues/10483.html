            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am wanting to ignore docstring rules in my project's unit-test directories. I have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file located at the root of the project, which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[build-system]
# https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/depending_on_numpy.html#adding-a-dependency-on-numpy
requires = [&quot;Cython&gt;=0.29.32&quot;, &quot;oldest-supported-numpy&quot;, &quot;setuptools&quot;, &quot;wheel&quot;]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
filterwarnings = [
    &quot;ignore::skbio.util.SkbioWarning&quot;,
]

[tool.check-manifest]
ignore = [
    &quot;.coveragerc&quot;,
    &quot;.dockerignore&quot;,
    &quot;.editorconfig&quot;,
    &quot;aarch64.Dockerfile&quot;,
    &quot;checklist.py&quot;,
    # created by conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3 action
    &quot;ci/setup-miniconda-patched-conda_host_env.yml&quot;,
]

# Basic configurations for Ruff.
# See https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/
[tool.ruff]
target-version = &quot;py38&quot;
exclude = [
    &quot;doc/**&quot;,  # documentation
    &quot;web/**&quot;,  # website
]

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;D&quot;]  # pycodestyle (E, W), pydocstyle (D)
ignore = [
    &quot;D203&quot;,  # puts a space before class docstrings
    &quot;D213&quot;,  # puts summary on second line
    &quot;D400&quot;,  # redundant with D415 in place
    &quot;D301&quot;,  # forces raw string literals
]
</code></pre>
<p>Then I add a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file to one of my unit test directories, which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff]
extend = &quot;../../pyproject.toml&quot;

[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = [
    &quot;D100&quot;,
    &quot;D101&quot;,
    &quot;D102&quot;,
    &quot;D104&quot;
]
</code></pre>
<p>I then try to run <code>ruff check path/to/test_directory</code> and ruff doesn't ignore the rules outlined in the <code>toml</code> file located in this directory. Furthermore, when I try to run <code>ruff check .</code> from the root directory, after having run all previous steps, I now get the following errors:</p>
<pre><code>ruff failed
  Cause: Failed to read /home/maton/qlab/skbio/github/scikit-bio/skbio/pyproject.toml
  Cause: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm running Ruff 0.3.2</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It does, which was the confusing part. I upgraded to ruff 0.3.3 today and can't replicate the issue. Anyway, I'm now using ruff's <code>lint.per-file-ignores</code> instead of putting separate <code>toml</code> files in all the test folders, and that is working for me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay thanks! That's strange, there's not much to that error, I believe it comes directly from the standard library when we try to read the file.</p>
