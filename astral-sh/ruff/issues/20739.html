            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><code>__future__.annotations</code> is deprecated as of python 3.14, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/#abstract</p>
<p>would be nice if ruff had a rule (similar to the existing pyupgrade rules) to suggest removing it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with the suggestion but not the reasoning: for most use-cases the default behavior of Python 3.14 will look the same with or without <code>from __future__ import annotations</code>, but it is not the case that <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> does nothing in Python 3.14 or is deprecated.</p>
<p>If you follow that link it specifies that <code>__future__.annotations</code> will not be deprecated until after Python 3.13 is EOL, which is quite a ways off. Until then <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> has the same effect in Python 3.14 as it did before - to turn annotations into strings. See the discussion around https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/18502#issuecomment-3355668188 for more.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hmm i guess i misread it then. although i the way i see it, &quot;is deprecated&quot; and &quot;will subsequently be deprecated&quot; mean the same thing to me as long as there's a suitable replacement. if the new behavior in 3.14 is intended to replace <code>from __future__ import annotations</code> then that means it doesn't make sense to use it at all in new code (unless targeting python &lt;=3.13), regardless of whether it's formally deprecated.</p>
<p>i guess to avoid confusion the error message could say something like &quot;<code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is <em>unneccessary</em> as of python 3.14&quot; instead of &quot;<code>from __future__ import annotations</code> is <em>deprecated</em> as of python 3.14&quot;</p>
