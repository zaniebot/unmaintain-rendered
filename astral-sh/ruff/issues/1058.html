            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>add-trailing-comma</code> also has <a href="https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma#unhug-trailing-paren">unhug-trailing-paren</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma#unhug-leading-paren">unhug-leading-paren</a> and <a href="https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma#multi-line-method-invocation-style----why">avoids arbitrary indentation</a>.
Which is not enforced by Ruff or Autopep8. Even Black only enforces it when magic commas are used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># This is found acceptable by Ruff, Autopep8 and Black
print(1,
      2,
      3,
      4,
      5)
      
# This is what add-trailing-commas changes it to
print(
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
)
</code></pre>
<p>So Ruff hasn't yet completely replaced it for me, though I'd love to see it get there. Is this the right place or should I open a new issue?</p>
