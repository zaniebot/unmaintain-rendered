# Implement round-trip tokenization

Fuzzy idea, since this would have to go through RustPython, but what Anthony's implemented in [`tokenize-rt`](https://github.com/asottile/tokenize-rt) looks really useful, because it allows you to define fixes at the token level but then generate high-fidelity source code.
