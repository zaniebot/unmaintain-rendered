            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I searched, but didn't find any specific issue / discussion related to this. In short, no matter what the configuration, en engineer can always noqa the lines. It &quot;should&quot; get caught in the Code Review, but what if... ruff had a rule to only allow a certain set of rules to be noqa, and would fail if any rule outside of this set was to be added?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13341 in that it asks for a way to disallow the use of <code>noqa</code> for some rules.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't quite the same though, since the issue you mention is about preventing the suppression of a specific rule, while my request was to only allow the suppression of some rules from the start.</p>
<p>They do address the handling of noqa comments, but I do believe that the approach is fundamentally different - one would need to suppress every rule except the whitelisted ones with the issue you mentioned.</p>
<p>As a result I think both could be covered, and would be different features. So can you please reopen @MichaReiser ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, there's a difference in approach where one asks for allowlisting the rules and the other asks for a denylist.</p>
<p>I don't think this warrants two different issues. The main feature we need is a more fine granular control for allowing/disallowing noqa usage on a per rule basis</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But wouldn't it be a nightmare to maintain disallowing noqa usage for all but a specific list of rules? Especially since one would need to update it based on new rules at every ruff update. While having a base set of allowed noqa rules would be self-maintained, since new rules would be automatically disallowed for noqa usage</p>
