            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Have you considered adding some documentation outside of the readme, potentially with mdbook?</p>
<p>I ask because the readme page is getting quite lengthy, but could probably use some more detail in places like error code descriptions, command line arguments/config files (with examples) and use with editors.</p>
<p>A structure like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/837bf370de144a682041e68bb67469b9f68a55ce/compiler/rustc_error_codes"><code>rustc_error_codes</code> crate</a> might be good to start building. This would enable something like <code>ruff --explain E123</code> in the future as well</p>
<p>Is there any interest? If so, I would be willing to get a PR together</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this is extremely important! I've been putting it off, but the docs are falling way behind the scope of the project.</p>
<p>I want to be fairly intentional about creating proper docs (need to think on the exact structure and setup a bit more), but I think creating dedicated descriptions for error codes like you've described above (something could power <code>--explain</code>) would be a great start. In other words: I don't know exactly where I want the docs to live etc., but something like the <code>rustc_error_codes</code> setup looks like it could plug in to a variety of options? I would be happy to start with mdBook too with the caveat that I might move to a different system somewhere down the line (TBD).</p>
<p>PR welcome!</p>
