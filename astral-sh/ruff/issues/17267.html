<p>We should use an example that demonstrates Red Knot&#x27;s capability better</p>
<p>Any suggestions? I don&#x27;t mind updating the playground (should only take me a minute)</p>

<p>As a frequent user of the playground, I think: yes, it would be great to have an example to get started. But I would also just like to see that once. So I think I would like the &quot;reset&quot; button to just create an empty <code>main.py</code> file.</p>
<p>Not that we have to do this (right away), but some playgrounds also have something like a dropdown selection of various examples, which can be illustrative as well.</p>

<p>Monaco&#x27;s playground is like this, but I don&#x27;t think it has good ergonomics. I very much prefer react&#x27;s embedded playground for examples like this (https://react.dev/learn). For the beginning, it could simply be a markdown with examples and links to the playground</p>
