            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like this is related to https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10188 which has been fixed upstream in the meantime. I suggest we do one manual sync (#15492) and then simply wait for this runner update: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/pull/11377.</p>
