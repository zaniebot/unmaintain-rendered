            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like this is related to <a href="https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10188">cli/cli#10188</a> which has been fixed upstream in the meantime. I suggest we do one manual sync (#15492) and then simply wait for this runner update: <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/pull/11377">actions/runner-images#11377</a>.</p>
