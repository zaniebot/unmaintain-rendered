            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe there is a flake8 plugn for this but I can't find it, also not a rule for ruff: Quite often I have to make sure that to avoid unintended side effects of imports all regular code should be guarded by functions, classes or <code>if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine(&quot;postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/mydatabase&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The inspection could look like this:</p>
<pre><code>script.py:3:1: FOO999 Code is not guarded by function or if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;, importing it may have unindented side effects
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>I's not safe to autofix because it will certainly change behaviour if you rely on the code being run on import. Manual fixes would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">from sqlalchemy import create_engine

if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
# or
def get_my_engine():
    engine = create_engine(&quot;postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/mydatabase&quot;)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@charliermarsh feel free to assign this to me, I can take a look. I'll put it under the <code>RUF</code> linter. Want to get back into the AST, seems like we'll have to keep track of the scope block and ensure that all statements are associated with a scope?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's probably too restrictive of a lint to include in <code>RUF</code>, another case where we could use some kind of opt-in pedantic category.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Even if not used as a rule directly, this kind of analysis would be useful to detect modules causing side effects (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8149)</p>
