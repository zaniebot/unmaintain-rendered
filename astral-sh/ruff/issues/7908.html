Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>If I use the time magic (%%time) in a notebook cell</p>
<pre><code>%%time
x=1
</code></pre>
<p>then any subsequent cell that makes use of <code>x</code> will report F821 Undefined name <code>x</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is happening because <code>%%time</code> is a cell magic which applies to the entire cell. We ignore all cells containing those and that's why <code>x</code> is undefined in subsequent cells. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything inside that cell is consumed by IPython and usually it's executed in such a way that anything inside isn't leaked outside that cell</li>
<li>The cell could contain basically any syntax, even non-Python using <code>%%bash</code>, <code>%%html</code>, etc. which means we have to consume the entire content as string and so we can't really do analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>FWIW, Pyright raises the same error. Another interesting thing is that <code>%%time</code> isn't mentioned in their documentation but when I look at the help text (using <code>%%time?</code>) they've suggested to use <code>%%timeit</code> instead. Using <code>%%timeit</code> the variable isn't leaked outside the cell:</p>
<pre><code>%%timeit x = 1
x * x
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wouldn't classify this as a bug as it's expected behavior. It's interesting that <code>%%time</code> modifies the global scope but not the local one:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
	%time x = 1
	print(x)

foo()
</code></pre>
<p>Running the above will raise a <code>NameError: name 'x' is not defined</code></p>
