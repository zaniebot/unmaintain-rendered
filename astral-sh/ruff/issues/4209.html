            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe I'm missing something. In pydocstyle, D1xx checks are only for items that are considered to be public. If  <strong>all</strong> is set at in the module, only those classes, function, etc are checked.  (see https://www.pydocstyle.org/en/2.1.1/error_codes.html#publicity)</p>
<p>When I tried running for the same checks in Ruff, I get the rule violations everything (for example: &quot;D102 Missing docstring in public method&quot;)  in that module, whether it's listed in <strong>all</strong> or not.</p>
<p>My config in my pyproject.toml file.</p>
<pre><code>...
[tool.ruff]
select = [&quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;D&quot;]

[tool.ruff.pydocstyle]
convention = &quot;google&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed, we should support this. I think this is the same as #993, so closing just to deduplicate, but let me know if I'm mistaken.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>D'oh!! I was looking for an existing one to avoid duplicates but missed it. That's 99% of what I'm asking about. Sorry about creating the dup. I'll comment on the other issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No need to apologize at all. For better or worse I tend to have most of the Ruff issues sitting somewhere in my brain. It's a lot easier for a me to remember a duplicate than for a contributor to comb through all the issues matching &quot;docstring&quot; :joy:</p>
