            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/beartype/plum#readme">plum-dispatch</a> library adds support for multiple dispatch.</p>
<p>That means multiple definitions (methods) of a function, and dispatching on the arguments.</p>
<p>This means, as of now, that every additional definition is flagged as a redefinition.
That counts for both used as well as unused definitions.</p>
<p>The @dispatch decorator could be used to differentiate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! This actually came up  previously in #11888, and I think the explanation there still stands. In short, this is tricky for static analysis tools to capture, and we prefer not to encode behavior specific to third-party packages into Ruff. So I think the best option would just be to use a <code>noqa</code> comment.</p>
