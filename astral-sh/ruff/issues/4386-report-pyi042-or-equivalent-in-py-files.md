# (🎁) report PYI042 (or equivalent) in .py files

Type alias should be Upper case in py files, not just pyi files.

I wonder if there are other PYI rules that should also be applied to .py files 🤔

Yeah there's a set of rules that need to be enabled in `.py` files -- there's some existing discussion in #4166.
