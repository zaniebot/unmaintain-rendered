# (🎁) Icon for Idea plugin

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2023-07-27 01:41_

Hi 👋,

I'm attempting to address this issue:

https://github.com/koxudaxi/ruff-pycharm-plugin/issues/136.
I would like some advice from your media relations team regarding iconography, I wasn't able to find a press pack on any of your documentation.

It must be an svg: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/plugin-icon-file.html#plugin-logo-requirements

I can see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/docs/assets/ruff-favicon.png, but it is a png.

We have the technology to support both a light and a dark icon, although that might not be required.

Hey @KotlinIsland . Our [brand guidance](https://brandpad.io/astral/) contains a few tool badges (in SVG). Does that suite your needs? CC @charliermarsh , head of the media relations team

The Ruff logo in the brand guidance is sized differently to the one used for the vscode extension. Are you happy for me to use it for the Idea icon? I think the VScode one looks better, but I can't steal that one because it's a png.

Hahah those other icons were just examples to demonstrate the pattern and motivate the design of the letters, they are not Easter Eggs of things we're actually building right now :)

Here's the icon as an SVG.
