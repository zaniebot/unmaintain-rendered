<p>After bumping ruff from 0.0.261 to 0.0.262, I&#x27;m getting conflicted errors from the rules S602 and S603. See below for the minimal code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

proc = Popen([&quot;/foo/bar&quot;], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, shell=False)
</code></pre>
<p>I have been setting <code>shell=False</code> as per the S602 rule. However, running this snippet with ruff 0.0.262 errors with the S603 rule, which suggests to set <code>shell=True</code>. And if I do that, then the code is failing the S602 rule. Would you be able to check and see if this is intentional?</p>
<p>You can find the GitHub Action logs <a href="https://github.com/zeshuaro/telegram-pdf-bot/actions/runs/4753738626/jobs/8445683417?pr=1508">here</a> with the above error introduced in 0.0.262.</p>
<p>And you can find my ruff config <a href="https://github.com/zeshuaro/telegram-pdf-bot/blob/master/pyproject.toml#L58-L112">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Happy to look into this! I&#x27;m not able to find any S602/S603 rule, though - <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#flake8-bandit-s">here</a> are the <code>S</code> rule codes. Could it be under a different code? I could also look at it if you could provide the human readable name.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gotcha - I can submit a fix to make these mutually exclusive if that makes sense? Seems like they only differ on shell truthiness, so I think that&#x27;s the easiest way to go</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m confused between these two as they&#x27;re the exact opposite of each other. If we try to make them mutually exclusive, then which one to detect first?</p>
<p>I think we should actually look into why these two rules exists in the first place and then decide what the fix should be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It think B603 is a lower priority than B602:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because this is a lesser issue than that described in subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true a LOW severity warning is reported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that&#x27;s the case, in the case where both are enabled we could defer to checking S602 first - if it&#x27;s triggered, we could short-circuit the S603 check</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Huh, interesting. So I guess we&#x27;re consistent with Bandit here? And the only workaround within Bandit is to add a <code># nosec</code> or similar, to allow low-risk <code>subprocess</code> calls?</p>
<p>I suppose we could consider removing <code>S603</code> altogether. Or, we could modify <code>S603</code> to only flag calls with dynamic arguments, like variables, and let all-string calls be considered &quot;safe&quot;, which seems to be what they suggest in that issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, this rule (S602) seems completely useless right now. It triggers on a simple <code>subprocess.check_output([&#x27;/usr/bin/foo&#x27;])</code> which has zero non-hardcoded input...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure if this should be a new issue, but I think S602 should also trigger unconditionally for <code>os.popen</code> as per <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/is-time-to-remove-os-module-spawn-functions/55829/13">this comment</a>.</p>

<p>What do you mean? Do you not see any squiggly lines? You&#x27;ll need to enable to rules in the settings tab which is on the left sidebar. And, you might also need to enable preview mode if the rule isn&#x27;t stabilized yet.</p>
