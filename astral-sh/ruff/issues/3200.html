            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. Thanks for this great project. I have a question about finding incorrect/non-existing class/methods imports in python with static analysers. Is there any static analyser here that can find this type of errors? (probably with some false-positives)</p>
<pre><code>from models.X import Y   # Y doesn't exists in X
print(Y)
</code></pre>
<p>PyCharm's built-in analyser hints this with &quot;Cannot find reference ' X' in 'Y' &quot;.
Is this somehow supported in ruff or any other tools?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like Ruff to be able to do this but it can't do it yet, and I've prioritized some other things above that kind of analysis. So it's within-scope for the project, but there's not a clear timeline on when it would happen.</p>
<p>(Your best bet, if you want to perform that kind of analysis, is to use a type checker, like <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> or <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy">mypy</a>.)</p>
