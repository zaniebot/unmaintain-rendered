            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The Jupyter formatter has a couple of issues when running on notebooks.</p>
<p>One is it removes semicolons at the end of lines. <code>black[jupyter]</code> does not remove semicolons at the end of lines when running on a notebook, since it's used to mark output as hidden, for example when plotting. <code>plt.plot();</code> will show the plot but not print out the repr for the Artists that the plot method returns.</p>
<p>Edit: On the last line of a cell. Related: #7300 which is for the linter. But that's rule based, so it's easy to turn it off for <code>*.ipynb</code> files, while there isn't a workaround for the formatter, making it a blocker.</p>
<p>(Fixed in main) The other is that it can't read a notebook that black and ruff-lint are able to read. The error is:</p>
<pre><code>error: Failed to format docs/examples/HistDemo.ipynb: source contains syntax errors: ParseError { error: UnrecognizedToken(Percent, None), offset: 0, source_path: &quot;&lt;filename&gt;&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>I'm guessing it's choking on a line magic, perhaps? The file does have this line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">%config InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity=&quot;last_expr_or_assign&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Which is the only <code>%</code> in the file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IPython has several modes. If you set:</p>
<pre><code>%config InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity=&quot;last_expr_or_assign&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then either <code>val = expr</code> or just <code>expr</code> will print if it's the final statement in the cell, unless there's a semicolon (see, for example, https://hist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/HistDemo.html). By default, only <code>expr</code> will display, and <code>val = expr</code> won't. I'd say simply allowing a final semicolon in cells on expressions or assignment expressions would be fine.</p>
<p>IIRC <code>a.b =</code> and <code>a[b] =</code> statements don't display even in the enhanced mode, but could be wrong.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The function after that puts them back - not sure why you'd need to remove it and then put it back, since the normal formatter also removes them - just checking to see if it's there and then putting it back seems like it would also work. Anyway, what cases are not covered by assignments and expressions? Blocks can't end lines, for example. Simicolons aren't needed for import statements - I wonder if black keeps them, actually. :)</p>

<p>Nice find. Removing them and adding them back sounds complicated. We can just preserve them 😄</p>
