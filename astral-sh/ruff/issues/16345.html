            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You&#x27;re right, the rule is stable but we extended its scope in preview (only for now) to also cover <code>min</code>, <code>max</code> and <code>sum</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many builtin functions (this rule currently covers <code>any</code> and <code>all</code> in stable, along with <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, and <code>sum</code> in <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/">preview</a>) accept any iterable, including a generator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x27;s why this behavior is expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah ok, thanks for the quick response! Should have read the docs more thoroughly...</p>
<p>My original problem was the following: I want to enable checks for E302/E303.
Therefore I set <code>preview = true</code> in my <code>pyproject.toml</code>, but this changed the behavior of C419.</p>
<p>So I set <code>explicit-preview-rules = true</code> and <code>select = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E303&quot;]</code> explicitly.  But preview features of C419 are still enabled.
I would expect preview features of C419 not be be enabled in this case.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a bit hard to spot.</p>

<p>We, unfortunately, don&#x27;t support such granular preview selection today</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, thank you!</p>
<p>To me as a user, it was not clear why I can explicitly enable E303 (a rule in preview mode), but not explicitly enable/disable preview mode for new features of an already stable rule when <code>explicit-preview-rules = true</code> is set.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea to enable those experimental features only if the rule is explicitly selected when <code>explicit-preview-rules = true</code> is set? From my point of view this would be a more consistent behavior, but I might be missing some important other considerations.</p>
<pre><code>[tool.ruff.lint]
preview = true

# Use explicit-preview-rules for a more granular selection
explicit-preview-rules = true

# This would not enable E303 and keep default behavior of C419
# Currently it does not enable E303, but experimental features of C419 are enabled
select = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;E&quot;]

#  This would enable E303 and experimental features of C419
select = [&quot;C&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;E303&quot;, &quot;C419&quot;]

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Our motivation for preview is to give users a possibility to use new features early but it&#x27;s also in our interest that we get feedback early. But it&#x27;s not the first time that this has come up and there&#x27;s some more context in <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12343">astral-sh/ruff#12343</a>#issuecomment-2230633910.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll close this issue in favor of the one I just linked because they&#x27;re about the same preview-behavior confusion.</p>
