            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As Red Knot is now &quot;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crmarsh.com/post/3lgvhzdfrps26">officially</a>&quot; public knowledge, the crate should at least have a short informational user-facing <code>README</code> explaining what it is, what its goals and non-goals are as well as what state it is currently in.</p>
<p>Such a file would serve as the single source of truth, which might help with attracting more potential contributors.</p>
