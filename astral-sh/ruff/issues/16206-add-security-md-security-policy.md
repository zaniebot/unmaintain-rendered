# Add SECURITY.md - Security Policy

---

_@AhlamBCoding_

### Description

Hello I’d like to propose the addition of a SECURITY.md file to this repository. This would make it easier for users/developers to report security vulnerabilities responsibly improving the project’s security posture and potentially increase the project’s [OpenSSF Scorecard rating](https://scorecard.dev/)https://scorecard.dev/.
Here’s a guide that could be helpful during implementation: [Adding Security Policy to Your Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository)

For reference, this is uv's security advisory

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/SECURITY.md

We should be able to copy most of it, with the exception of the first section.
