Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I noticed that the B006 warning (using mutable data structure as argument default value) disappears when I add a type hint for the argument.  Minimal example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Sequence


class Foo:
    def foo(self, x: Sequence[int] = [1, 2, 3]):  # no warning here
        ...

    def bar(self, x=[1, 2, 3]):  # B006
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>Output of <code>ruff check --isolated --select B foo.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/tmp/foo.py:8:21: B006 Do not use mutable data structures for argument defaults
Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>As the type hint doesn't change the behaviour, there should be a B006 warning in both cases.  I quickly double-checked and flake8 indeed gives a warning for both methods.</p>
<p>Ruff version: 0.0.241</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is actually an intentional change -- if you use a type annotation with an immutable type, we don't warn, since your type checker should tell you that you can't modify these:</p>

<p>We could consider making this configurable, but it is working as intended.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I see.  I have to admit, I wasn't aware that <code>typing.Sequence</code> is explicitly denoting an immutable type.  Indeed, if change the annotation to <code>MutableSequence</code>, I get the B006 in both cases.</p>
<p>While I understand the reasoning, I would vote to indeed make this configurable.  The current behaviour relies on 1) me using additional tools (which I may not always do) and 2) the code being fully annotated.  For example the following code does not result in a mypy error because <code>func()</code> is not annotated and thus not checked.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Sequence

class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x: Sequence[int] = [1, 2, 3]):
        self.x = x

def func(f):
    f.x[0] = 42

f1 = Foo()
func(f1)

f2 = Foo()
print(f2.x)  # prints [42, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>That said, I could also understand if you don't want to bloat ruff with too many fine-grained settings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think my preference here is to leave the existing behavior as-is. I understand why one might want to disable this, but I think the current behavior is reasonable and I'd rather keep the bar a little higher for adding more settings.</p>
