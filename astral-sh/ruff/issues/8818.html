Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>If I define an enum file with ellipsis in PYI files, the linter complains</p>
<pre><code>class CreationMeta(Enum):
    DEFAULT = ...
    IN_CUSTOM_FUNCTION = ...
    MULTI_OUTPUT_NODE = ...
    NO_GRAD_MODE = ...
    INFERENCE_MODE = ...
</code></pre>
<p>in a .PYI files, these values are all set to <code>...</code> to denote that they will be populated in other code, and we only care about what the members of the enum are. This is a pretty common idiom so we may want to explicitly whitelist in our check or at least propose a better fix for PYI files as I am unaware of another way of doing this with a placeholder value for <code>Enum</code>.</p>
