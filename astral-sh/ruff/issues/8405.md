# Feature Request: ICN001 import-alias-is-not-conventional fixer

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Trying out ruff 1.0.3, I'm getting a fair few non-conventional import warnings:

```
ICN001 `matplotlib` should be imported as `mpl`
ICN001 `matplotlib.pyplot` should be imported as `plt`
ICN001 `networkx` should be imported as `nx`
ICN001 `numpy` should be imported as `np`
ICN001 `tkinter` should be imported as `tk`
```

Is this something which could have a fixer? The import lines themselves ought to be fairly easy to fix, but you _also_ need to update all usage of the old name to the new alias.

(Ideally without introducing a bug due by creating a name collision etc.)

I think we actually do support a fix for that rule. Have you tried running with `--unsafe-fixes`?

Confirmed, and it looks to have worked perfectly too. I'm not sure how I overlooked this. Apologies, and thank you!
