Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>Just discovered <code>ruff</code> recently - amazing work - thanks!</p>
<p>I show the problem in the short video below. When running ruff (via vscode's <code>formatOnSave</code>), an import line of length &gt;79 is formatted to break imports over several lines - then black/ruff settings of max line length 120 are respected, reformatting the imports. I run this 5 times in the video:</p>
<p>https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12820901/219914833-90165e62-2ac5-43e1-b607-a7e5c653ac55.mov</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using the vscode plugin, shipping with ruff version <code>ruff 0.0.239</code>.</li>
<li><code>black, 23.1.0 (compiled: yes) -- Python (CPython) 3.9.16</code></li>
<li>The effect is not observable when plain ruff from the command line without the plugin.</li>
<li>This could well be a conflict in configs (I'm new here:)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey thanks for the kind words!</p>
<p>My best guess is that you have isort enabled (since the style of formatting that's being applied to the imports matches isort's behavior IIRC, but doesn't match Ruff's).</p>
<p>Can you try disabling the isort extension in VS Code?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>🤦  the <code>isort</code> plugin was sync'd and enabled globally - deactivating resolves the issue 🙌</p>
<p>@charliermarsh - one quick question - I saw in a thread somewhere that there is an <code>&quot;ALL&quot;</code> tag for the <code>select</code> config. Is there also one for <code>fixable</code>?  I can't find any documentation on this, but want to check the following is a valid starting point to build from, while learning about ruff:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">[tool.ruff]
select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
</code></pre>
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/charliermarsh">@charliermarsh</a> on 2023-02-19 14:59</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that works.</p>
<p>So in that case, you'd start from <code>ALL</code>, then disable rules selectively as you go:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
select = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
ignore = [
  # Or whatever you want to turn off.
  &quot;D100&quot;,
]

fixable = [&quot;ALL&quot;]
unfixable = [
  # Maybe you want to avoid autofixing `SIM` violations.
  # Note that any rules you include in `ignore` don't have to be
  # included here, since we won't even _try_ to fix those.
  &quot;SIM&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>The other approach is to explicitly build up the list of rules you <em>do</em> care about, like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">select = [
  &quot;E&quot;,
  &quot;F&quot;,
  &quot;SIM&quot;,  # flake8-simplify
  &quot;B&quot;,  # flake8-bugbear
]
</code></pre>
<p>I tend to prefer the latter approach as it's more explicit but it's just a personal preference.</p>
