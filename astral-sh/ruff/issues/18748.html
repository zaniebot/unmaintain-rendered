            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>I have a large request. In my company we are using <a href="https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach">tach</a> which has been extremely helpful to control and manage dependencies in our monorepo. I also remember vaguely @charliermarsh one time posting a demo of I believe an output of <code>ruff</code> that was able to show/map all interdependencies in the code base (which I would guess you are building up internally anyway to be able to power <code>ruff</code>). I imagine going from there to what <code>tach</code> offers might not be a very large stretch. Now, it appears that the startup behind tach has pivoted and tach is no longer maintained.</p>
<p>The scope of tach seems to my eyes to fit very well with astral&#x27;s scope/ambition. I am very curious how you guys feel about this, and whether this is something you would consider at all?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am just a happy user of tach (and ruff, and uv), not affiliated with them in any way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi. Thanks for proposing this idea.</p>
<p>Ruff has an <code>analyze</code> command that allows you to extract some of that information into a JSON. But it currently doesn&#x27;t provide a way to enforce this in any way. Some form of report would definetely be nice so that not every user has to build their own visualization.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not quiet sure I fully understand what kind of errors are that tach checks for but it doesn&#x27;t sound unreasonable to add similar checks to ruff (optional).</p>

<p>Thank you. That&#x27;s very kind. It will probably be a while before we have
the capacity to increase our scope. Building a type checker is surprisingly
a lot of work (okay, we sort of knew what we signed up for but it&#x27;s still a
lot of work 😅 )</p>
