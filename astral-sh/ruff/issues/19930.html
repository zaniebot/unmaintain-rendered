            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I currently have a file with a TC004 error (move import out of TYPE_CHECKING block).</p>
<p>When I click &quot;Quick Fix&quot;, ruff correctly moves the import. But when I run, <code>source.FixAll</code>, the problem remains. I can't figure out if this is considered a &quot;safe&quot; change or not, so maybe the issue is that this is considered an unsafe fix and that's why it isn't applied, but I would really like it to be an option.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>vscode extension is v2025.24.0</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I think you're right. TC004 has an unsafe fix, although it's not currently documented as such (it's listed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/15584 though). I think you can use the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_extend-safe-fixes"><code>lint.extend-safe-fixes</code></a> setting if you want to consider this specific fix safe.</p>
