This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BInfinite%20loop%5D

...quoting the contents of `PY_FILE_TEST_1909706726.py`, the rule codes ANN201, D100, D103, F841, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
