# `non-augmented-assignment` (`PLR6104`) should not trigger when the target is negated

_Issue opened by @augustelalande on 2024-04-16 22:00_

`non-augmented-assignment` (`PLR6104`) should not trigger when the target is negated

For example:
```
x = 5 - x
```
augmented assignment will not be more concise since it would require two assignments.
```
x *= -1
x += 5
```

I believe this is already fixed in #10909, but not released.
