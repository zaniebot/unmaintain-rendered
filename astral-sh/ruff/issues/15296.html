            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As @harahu mentioned in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/14535#issuecomment-2516967026, most pep8-naming rules don't apply for third-party stubs</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>But</strong> relevant rules could be made to apply to names decorated with <code>@type_check_only</code>, since that's a clear signal the stub author is very likely in control of that name (there's some niche exceptions for when a class is defined inside a function, but needs to be exposed in stubs)</li>
<li><code>N811</code>, <code>N812</code>, <code>N813</code>, <code>N814</code>, <code>N817</code> are probably fine in stubs, as long as the name isn't re-exported (in <code>__all__</code>, <code>foo as foo</code> or <code>var = var</code>)</li>
</ul>
