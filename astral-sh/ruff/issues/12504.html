            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a documentation issue, not related to the logic.
This issue is relevant for the current version: 0.5.4.</p>
<p>In https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/f-string-in-exception/ there's a section that shows the traceback before and after, in the after one it does not include the first line of the traceback.</p>
<p>I wanted to open a PR to add the missing line, but when opening the code docstrings it seemed to already include that line:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/2ce3e3ae60ba44700b5e98a61adc96d80b0e4bd3/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/flake8_errmsg/rules/string_in_exception.rs#L43-L48</p>
<p>I went to the <code>docs</code> repo, and there the first line was missing:
https://github.com/astral-sh/docs/blob/main/site/ruff/rules/f-string-in-exception/index.html#L827-L830</p>
<p>I don't know what the source of this mismatch is, but seemed that just opening a manual change to the generated docs is not the way to go. So here I am opening an issue.</p>
