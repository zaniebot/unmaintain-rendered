# Formatter: Docstrings

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-07-31 13:16_

> Black also processes docstrings. Firstly the indentation of docstrings is corrected for both quotations and the text within, although relative indentation in the text is preserved. Superfluous trailing whitespace on each line and unnecessary new lines at the end of the docstring are removed. All leading tabs are converted to spaces, but tabs inside text are preserved. Whitespace leading and trailing one-line docstrings is removed. [[source](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#strings)]
