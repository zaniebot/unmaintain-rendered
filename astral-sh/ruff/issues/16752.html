            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>F841 does not report variables that are unused in certain branches. Below is a short example (<a href="https://play.ruff.rs/0e1d38e6-17b0-4355-a37a-089d454de311">playground</a>) showing the issue</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def func(x):
    if x:
        io = &quot;&quot;
    else:
        io = &quot;foo&quot;
        print(io)   
</code></pre>
<p>This issue was <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/758">originally reported</a> to pyflakes and closed as duplicate of https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/715.</p>
<p>They mention is unlikely they will implement branch analysis, but ruff already has (I guess) the machinery needed to support this use case.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>v0.11.0 (playground)</p>

<p>Actually, Ruff doesn't have the machinery to support this, but we're working on it. But it's going to take a while to get ready for prime time ;)</p>
