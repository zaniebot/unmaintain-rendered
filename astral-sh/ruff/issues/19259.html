            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Just got this:</p>
<pre><code>RUF002 Docstring contains ambiguous `×` (MULTIPLICATION SIGN). Did you mean `x` (LATIN SMALL LETTER X)?
</code></pre>
<p>But I <em>deliberately</em> used the <em>correct</em> unicode sign for multiplication, that's what it's for 😁 I don't see how anyone would accidentally use this instead of <code>x</code>, you need to do a rather more work to type <code>×</code>, e.g. on Linux it's three keystrokes (<code>COMPOSE x x</code>).</p>
<p>I can sort've see the security concern, but if you're going to include symbols that people might deliberately use, perhaps split it into two lints, one for &quot;no one would ever do this legitimately&quot; and one for &quot;symbols that actually look somewhat different and might be legitimately used&quot;.</p>
<h3>Version</h3>
<p>0.9.4</p>
