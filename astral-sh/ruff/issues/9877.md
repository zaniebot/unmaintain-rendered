# `D413` is enforcing excessive whitespace

_Issue opened by @BrentWilkins on 2024-02-07 19:31_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

It seems that the change in [this PR](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9654) is exposing a bug in the `D413`. Ruff is calling this docstring bad:

```python
"""Make a summary line.

Note:
----
  Per the code comment the next two lines are blank. "// The first blank line is the line containing the closing
      triple quotes, so we need at least two."

"""
```

> Missing blank line after last section ("Note") Ruff([D413](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blank-line-after-last-section))

I can't see what's different between what I have and the `Use instead:` section of [the documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blank-line-after-last-section/).

I can make Ruff happy by adding excessive blank lines:

```python
"""Make a summary line.

Note:
----
  Per the code comment the next two lines are blank. "// The first blank line is the line containing the closing
      triple quotes, so we need at least two."


"""
```
