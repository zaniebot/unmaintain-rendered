            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am currently using mypy, but wanted to test pyrefly (as well as ty).</p>
<p>I have a few modules with weak or lacking types because it's really just wrappers for c modules, or it's old libraries etc. So I added <code># mypy: ignore-errors</code> to the top.</p>
<p>Pyrefly also supports this: <code># pyrefly: ignore-errors</code> https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/error-suppressions/, but when I tested that ruff complains about unused code.</p>
<p>I also tested the other per-line suppression comments but they didn't have this issue.</p>
