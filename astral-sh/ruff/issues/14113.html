<p>B007 (unused-loop-control-variable) does not trigger when variables are shadowed.</p>
<p>See this extremely contrived example:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = my_other_dict = {}
my_list = []
for k, (v1, v2) in my_dict.items():
    for v1 in my_other_dict.values():
        print(v1)
    v2 = &quot;flibble&quot;
    print([k for k in my_list if k &gt; 0])
</code></pre>

<p>(Example is somewhat nested loop focused as that&#x27;s what I thought the problem was initially)</p>
<p>Interestingly, PERF102 <em>does</em> trigger with this example, but I think only because it doesn&#x27;t process comprehensions at all? If it&#x27;s expanded out the warning goes away.</p>
<p>The only thing of note from ALL is PLW2901, which detects the variable shadowing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess technically my previous example wasn&#x27;t &quot;shadowing&quot;, but an issue of scope. But shadowing <em>also</em> doesn&#x27;t work (as you showed well in your original example):</p>
<pre><code>for k in ls:
    k = 2
</code></pre>
<p>But, as you also point out, this is caught by <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/redefined-loop-name/">PLW2901</a>.</p>
