            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Taking the following 2 code cells as an example:</p>
<p><em>Cell 1:</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
	print(&quot;first&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Cell 2:</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">	print(&quot;second&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, Ruff would concatenate it into a single source and pass it to the parser. This means that the parser would see it as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo():
	print(&quot;first&quot;)
	print(&quot;second&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Which is a valid code. But, actually the indentation before the second print statement is invalid as it is in another cell.</p>
<p>A possible solution, as suggested by @MichaReiser, would be to run the parser per cell, merge the statements, and update the node ranges for all the subsequent cells with the correct offset.</p>
