<p>One of the bits of feedback I&#x27;ve had from colleagues about using ruff is the lack of visibility over which rules are implemented and which aren&#x27;t:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No I wouldn&#x27;t have expected it, but one of my concerns about Ruff was potentially poor pycodestyle support, which is the main thing we wanted out of flake8. <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/df57c7dc-8ff2-4014-bd97-fb91bd83d846">I&#x27;ve set up an example in Ruff&#x27;s playground</a> and it doesn&#x27;t catch any issues, which from further inspection <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#error-e">its pycodestyle support</a> doesn&#x27;t claim it supports these rules at all. I&#x27;d have assumed the table would be complete with gaps for no support instead of just missing rows for no support 😠
It looks from diffing with <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/blob/main/docs/intro.rst#error-codes">pycodestyle&#x27;s rules</a> that Ruff is missing E121-E133, of which only 4/11 rules are disabled by default in pycodestyle. I didn&#x27;t actually know that pycodestyle disabled anything by default, and that would explain a lot of the changes that [snip] had to make when converting to Ruff. <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402">Ruff do have an issue for supporting the rest of the rules</a> but it looks like it&#x27;s not been thought about for a little while...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously specific to pycodestyle but it would apply to all linter types.</p>
<p>It&#x27;d be nice if the rules table listed everything unsupported or not. Would cover both &quot;not yet supported&quot; (like those mentioned above) and &quot;never supported&quot; (e.g. B001)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for sharing this feedback. I understand that it can be confusing that Ruff lists linter categories without supporting all linters from upstream.</p>
<p>Our long-term solution to this is to re-categorize our rules (see #1774) to clarify that Ruff is not an exact reimplementation of upstream linters. We could then provide a migration tool that migrates your existing linter configuration and warns you about unsupported lint codes.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what a good short-term solution looks like. Adding all rules, including the unsupported rules (some of which we intentionally do not support), would bloat Ruff&#x27;s documentation a lot. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m unsure if it is the right solution to communicate missing rules. We would also have to automate the documentation generation to ensure we remain up-to-date when upstream linters add new rules(we&#x27;re trying to hit a moving target). Considering that this is possibly wasted work long term, it might be better to start with a migration tool right away.</p>
