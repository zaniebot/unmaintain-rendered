# Request: PYI030 autofix

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-10-09 02:32_

I am using `ruff==0.0.292`, and am turning on `PYI`.  I am wondering, why doesn't `PYI030` have an autofix?

It seems possible to at least support partial autofixes here, any chance we can add this capability?

Should be doable if anyone is interested in it.
