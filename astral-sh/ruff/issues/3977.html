Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>With ruff 0.0.261, using the &quot;RUF&quot; rule, the following docstring:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;&quot;&quot;All the account’s items&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>produces the following error:</p>
<pre><code>RUF002 [*] Docstring contains ambiguous unicode character `’` (did you mean ```?)
</code></pre>
<p>The Unicode character in the comment is U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK which is drawn from upper right to lower left. The suggested substitution is the backtick character which is drawn from upper left to lower right - this character is not semantically related to the Unicode character.</p>
<p>This suggestion is automatically applied when <code>--fix</code> is specified, producing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">&quot;&quot;&quot;All the account`s items&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Is this to avoid messing with docstring quotes by not substituting the single quote character <code>'</code>? In that case I would suggest not making this Unicode character autofixable at all, rather than substituting an unrelated character.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm, yeah, that's an interesting substitution. We actually didn't create the substitution table -- it's taken from the same source as VS Code, and is intended to match VS Code's own list of confusing characters + their replacements. It looks like VS Code offers the same suggestion:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309177/232137713-75fc65b9-5152-4fd5-a024-7396b74921d6.png" alt="Screen Shot 2023-04-14 at 3 24 50 PM" /></p>
<p>That's not to say that the table can't be improved, only to clarify that we didn't apply any of our own discretion in generating the list. We could consider changing that replacement to instead suggest <code>'</code> though?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>'</code> has syntactic meaning, so it would not be able to be a naive fix.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">'All the account’s items.'
</code></pre>
<p>works as a docstring, although a dodgy one... Substituting <code>'</code> would make semantic sense but would cause a syntax error if autofixed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would make 2 suggestions for this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave the existing behaviour but remove autofix for this.</li>
</ol>
<p>or,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Substitute <code>'</code> for <code>’</code>, automatically adding an escape character if in a single quoted string.</li>
</ol>
<p>For # 2, would it be possible to construct an anti-example where this suggestion could still change the meaning of code? For example, constructing a string and passing it to eval?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think auto fix should probably be disabled for this sort of thing since the underlying ambiguous characters might be in a i18n related string or some documentation (even if it's not a doc comment, e.g., Django column help text) that is intentional</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does anyone here see <code>'</code> and <code>’</code> on their screen without being able to visually distinguish them?</p>
<p>If not: why is <code>’</code> included in the table at all?</p>
<p>On a different note, it hurts my typographic sensibilities to see that specific substitution being made lol. I always see when people using grave accents instead of typographically correct quotes, and I always wince.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is being replaced originally comes from <a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/14.0.0/confusables.txt">Unicode directly</a>, with only some minor overrides from vscode.
I think the main intention of this feature is to prevent malicious code.</p>
<p>That a grave accent is recommended here is an upstream bug imho. My PR contains some background information as well: https://github.com/hediet/vscode-unicode-data/pull/1</p>
<p>The discussion whether replacing with <code>'</code> is a good idea, because it might break code in context of a single-quoted string should probably be had, but I am also with you @flying-sheep , that <code>'</code> and <code>’</code> are distinct enough to be allowed.
In the mean time you can allow it explicitely in your project:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
allowed-confusables = [
    &quot;’&quot;,  # Cf. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/3977
]
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a similar problem. I get <code>RUF002 Docstring contains ambiguous </code>ı<code>(LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I). Did you mean</code>i<code> (LATIN SMALL LETTER I)?</code> but &quot;ı&quot; and &quot;i&quot; are separate letters in the Turkish alphabet.</p>
<p>Couldn't be sure if I should open a new issue. Please let me know if so.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@kureta - I think that's following the intent of the rule, since the goal is to identify confusable Unicode characters in otherwise-ASCII words. I'd suggest adding it to the <code>allowed-confusables</code> list if it makes sense in your project! https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#allowed-confusables</p>
