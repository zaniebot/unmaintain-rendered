            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue is somewhat releated to #5445 and #10084 but applies to more generic version of reported issues.
In general on <code>NTFS</code> and on <code>FAT</code> file systems executable permissions are not avialable by default resulting in all files being executable. What I noticed is that the problem is not as simple as avoiding checking this rule on windows / wsl etc. as NTFS and FAT system may also be used for drives which are shared between Windows and Linux OS.</p>
<p>In my case, I have an <code>exFAT</code> drive shared between <code>Windows 11</code> and <code>Ubuntu 24.04</code> and all files appear as executable. When I am running ruff on Ubuntu 24.04 <code>EXE002</code> is triggered.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">-rwxr-xr-x  1 argmaster argmaster   2543 Aug 16 19:53 conftest.py
drwxr-xr-x  3 argmaster argmaster 131072 Aug 16 20:29 examples

-rwxr-xr-x  1 argmaster argmaster     35 Aug 16 19:53 .gitignore
</code></pre>
<p>Hence I would recommend adding some additional heuristic to detect if filesystem used supports executable permissions. This should only be needed on Unix family of operating systems.</p>
<p>Simple, although not perfect way to detect if file system supports executable bit could be to create temporary file next to a python file we are checking and make an attempt to toggle executable bit on it. Handling symlinks could get tricky though. I am not knowledgable enough to suggest better solution unfortunately.</p>
<p>Python <code>3.12.0</code>
ruff <code>0.5.1</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the detailed write up. Yes, this is a known limitation and we discussed some solutions in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10084 I'll merge the two issues</p>
