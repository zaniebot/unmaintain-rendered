            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These rules guard against using mutable default values in <code>dataclasses</code>. It would be nice if these rules <em>also</em> supported attrs,  which is the (more feature-rich) predecessor which is also pretty widely used.</p>
<p>If this is something that you'd be open for, I think I can get some time to potentially contribute a patch myself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was recently bit by the lack of these rules working with attrs. So I also wish to see this implemented please. Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yes, sorry -- I have gotten distracted by other things at work. I hopefully will still get to this &quot;at some point&quot;, but if anyone else has time they should feel free to implement it themselves.</p>
