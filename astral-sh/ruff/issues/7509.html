Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p><code>FBT001</code> could be changed to have more positive cases. This will break the current behavior.
Should we include rule behavior changes in the preview mode?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This could introduce a lot of new positives.
Is it possible to have a preview of rules behavior change?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe yes, once we reach 0.1.0 but depends on the change. See the <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/6998">versioning policy</a> proposal.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Technically we don't need to adhere to this until 0.1.0, but yes, the intent is that significant rule changes (that aren't bug fixes) are gated behind preview, and go out in minor releases. However, there's a carveout for bug fixes (as I said) and changes that adhere to the intent of the rule, so this one is a good test case for that criteria.</p>

<p>This should already apply with 0.1.0</p>
