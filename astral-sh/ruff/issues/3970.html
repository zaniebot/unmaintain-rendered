Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I want to be able to specify the default files within the configuration file so that I don't need to duplicate this config in different places.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff]
files = [&quot;src&quot;, &quot;scripts&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Then it is possible to invoke ruff without passing any paths:</p>
<pre><code>👉 ruff
yada yada yada
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>[Edit]
I think what I wanted is already possible, I just did't get it when I read it the first time, see the <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/#pyprojecttoml-discovery">docs</a>
For Windows, the $(config_dir) is equivalent to: %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming<br />
So putting a a pyproject.toml into %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\ruff should set a global default and I confirm it works on my PC.</p>
<hr />
<p>Do I understand the described use case correctly, that it should be possible to declare a pyproject.toml file as the global default, which overrides the built-in ruff default settings (but does not override project-specific pyproject.toml files)?</p>
<p>In that case, I agree very much that this feature is very helpful, even needed.</p>
<p>PS: Thanks for your development efforts, ruff is great!</p>
