Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<h1>Issue</h1>
<p>The diff output is reversed since #7813.</p>
<p>For example, if I give ruff the following input file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from .logging import config_logging
from .settings import ENV
from .settings import *
</code></pre>
<p>then I get the following correct output with <code>v0.0.292</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">--- test.py
+++ test.py
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 from .logging import config_logging
+from .settings import *
 from .settings import ENV
-from .settings import *

Would fix 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>But with the main branch, I get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">--- test.py
+++ test.py
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 from .logging import config_logging
+from .settings import ENV
 from .settings import *
-from .settings import ENV

Would fix 1 error.
</code></pre>
<h1>Fix</h1>
<p>I traced it back to <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/2d6557a51bfeb43ed1e922383ad066ce6626fec8/crates/ruff_linter/src/source_kind.rs#L94">this line</a>, where the old and new source files are reversed. It should read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let text_diff = TextDiff::from_lines(src, dst);
</code></pre>
<p>If that's ok, I can submit a quick PR to fix it. There are 2 tests whose snapshot needs to be updated as a consequence, but apart from that the only change needed is the one I mentioned above.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zanieb it seems like there are only two integration tests that test the output of the CLI diff option (<code>diff_shows_safe_fixes_by_default</code> and <code>diff_shows_unsafe_fixes_with_opt_in</code>), and they were added in #7769, which was merged 2 days after #7813 ^^</p>
