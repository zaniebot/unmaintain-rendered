            <div class="timeline-body"><p>is there a way to just get the list of codes that were found without duplication?
e.g. if there are multiple errors found of the same code, the code will only be contained in the summary one time. Such that you get an overview of what codes are found.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print('hello world 1')
print('hello world 2')
</code></pre>
<p>will print out the codes <code>T201</code> and <code>Q000</code> 2 times, but what I want is something like</p>
<pre><code>Found the following errors:
- T201: 2 times
- Q000: 2 times
</code></pre>
<p>I have a project where ruff found more than 12000 errors and I want to discuss whether the codes are relevant for it or not. Therefore, a list of found codes with the frequency would be nice</p>
