            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#pyflakes-f">F841: unused-variable</a>, it would be nice to have a <code>unused-function</code> rule.</p>
<p>For example, it could catch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># foo.py

def bar():
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>if that's not important anywhere in repo.  This rule of course wouldn't be used by libraries whose functions are used outside the repo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>sounds like something that https://pypi.org/project/vulture/ does, would be nice if ruff started supporting dead code rules however!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for opening the issue! I think this is being tracked in #872. As mentioned there, this will require the multi-file analysis and type inference that we're working on in red-knot.</p>
