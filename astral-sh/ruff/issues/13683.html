            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What about a new check based on this example from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#examples"><code>urllib.request</code> documentation</a>, which tells that <code>urlopen</code> does not need to be used as a context manager? The first version is more verbose and has a level of indentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>with urllib.request.urlopen(&#x27;http://www.python.org/&#x27;) as f:
    print(f.read(100).decode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;))
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to achieve the same result without using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-context-manager">context manager</a> approach.</p>
<pre><code>f = urllib.request.urlopen(&#x27;http://www.python.org/&#x27;)
print(f.read(100).decode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;))
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m a bit surprised that <code>urllib</code> promotes the use without a context manager. Reading through some stack overflow threads suggests that the returned object automatically calls <code>close</code> when the object gets deleted but that means that the resources are only cleaned up when the result object gets garbage collected. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s something we want to promote by a rule. @AlexWaygood do you know how the suggestion in the <code>urllib</code> documentation is to be understood?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure I would really describe the docs as <em>promoting</em> the use of <code>urlopen</code> without a context manager. It mentions that it <em>can</em> be used without a context manager (which is true: if you really want to take responsibility for closing it manually, you <em>can</em>), but the first examples given in the docs use a context manager, and most examples in the docs following this note also use a context manager.</p>
<p>I definitely don&#x27;t think we should be recommending people to use <code>urlopen</code> without a context manager, I&#x27;m afraid. As @MichaReiser says, relying on the resource to be closed when the object is garbage-collected is extremely fragile. You have no idea exactly when it will be closed, and if the reference is only garbage-collected while Python is shutting down at the end of the programme, there&#x27;s the possibility that the resource might never be closed properly.</p>
<p>Thanks for the rule suggestion @opk12! However, if there&#x27;s a bug here, it&#x27;s in the CPython <code>urlopen</code> docs, which could perhaps be clearer that although using the function without a <code>with</code> statement is possible, it&#x27;s definitely not recommended.</p>
