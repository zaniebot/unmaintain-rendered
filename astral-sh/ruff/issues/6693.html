            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>would it be possible to implement a <code>fixable</code> configuration option for rust, similar to the <code>unfixable</code> option?
The usecase for this would be be a ruff configuration with a large number of rules, where only a small amount of auto-fixes should be allowed.
Currently, I have to replicate nearly the entire contents of the <code>select</code> option into the <code>unfixable</code> option, because I want the auto-fix only for one single rule.
This approach is also error-prone, because if I want to add another rule to <code>select</code>, I must ensure to also add it to <code>unfixable</code>.
This contradicts the &quot;single source of truth&quot; principle.</p>
<p>Of course, a simple workaround would be to use to different configuration files and run rust twice, but IMO this clearly contradicts the performance mindset of the tool.</p>
<p>Using the above described approach, the entire set of fixable rules could be computed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>if `fixable` is not configured:
    CONFIGURED_FIXABLE_RULES = ALL_ACTIVATED_RULES_THAT_ARE_TECHNICALLY_FIXABLE
else:
    CONFIGURED_FIXABLE_RULES = those rules that are contained in the `fixable` option
FIXABLE_RULES = CONFIGURED_FIXABLE_RULES - CONFIGURED_UNFIXABLE_RULES
</code></pre>
