            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have can pass --no-cache via the CLI to disable cache. Do we not have a setting to do this in the pyproject.toml?</p>
<p>A simple setting like this would be nice. Ruff is fast enough for me that cache only brings problems and adds a bunch of .ruff_cache folders everywhere. I prefer to keep it disabled</p>
<p>[tool.ruff]
cache = false</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is no built-in way to disable the cache. However, on Unix, you can set <code>cache-dir = &quot;/dev/null&quot;.  You can also set </code>cache-dir=&quot;some/shared/directory/.ruff-cache` to use a shared directory between project, to reduce the &quot;cache folders everywhere&quot;</p>

<p>Can you tell me more about the problems you run into with caching? It would be great if we can fix those.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can&#x27;t speak for the OP, but I like to run CI checks in a read-only copy of the working tree (helps ensure decent code hygiene like not writing files in the code tree, etc) and between that and docker, arranging for there to be a <em>writable</em> cache dir can be a bit of a PITA.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can set the <code>RUFF_NO_CACHE</code> env variable in CI to disable caching.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yup, that (or even the CLI flag) is definitely good enough for my use-case.  (I actually also really like your suggestion of setting the cache dir somewhere outside the repo, which is what I did in the end even for CI.)</p>
