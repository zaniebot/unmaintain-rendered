_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-04 06:15_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select SIM300 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
B<A[0][0]or B
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/663898301978.py:1:1: SIM300 Yoda conditions are discouraged, use `A[0][0]>B` instead
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/663898301978.py`, the rule codes SIM300, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!

We're fixing this as `A[0][0]>Bor B`. It seems that the "no whitespace between `A[0][0]` and `or` keyword is problematic.
