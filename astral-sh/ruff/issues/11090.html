            <div class="timeline-body"><h1>Feature request</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It is common in data science to use capital letters in names (lowercase for vector, uppercase for matrix). Example: <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.fit">X in fit function in sklearn</a></p>
<p>This goes against N803, e.g. 'Argument name <code>X</code> should be lowercase`'</p>
<p>This leads to many warnings across data science codebases.</p>
<p>I know, that technically it is correct and it should be warned, but to be able to suppress it in <code>pyproject.toml</code> could be beneficial in some cases.</p>
<h2>Pylint comparison</h2>
<p>Maybe something like <a href="https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#good-names">good-names</a> could be added. Should it solve only N803? Probably it could whitelist a lot of other rules as well, but I'm not sure.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>If others don't think, that this is good idea, you can close it as maybe there should be issue rather on scikit-learn.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As a hack, I think you could add it to https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx -- but it's not really the intended use of that variable, and it will ignore other errors on variables named <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>I'd be open to adding something like <code>good-names</code>, but I'd probably want it to apply to all <code>N</code> rules for simplicity. Curious for more opinions though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, we already have these settings that apply to all the <code>pep8-naming</code> rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names</li>
<li>https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pep8-naming_extend-ignore-names</li>
</ul>
<p>Do those suffice for this? It seems like they use glob patterns rather than regexes, which is slightly surprising to me, but probably hard to change at this point 😄</p>
