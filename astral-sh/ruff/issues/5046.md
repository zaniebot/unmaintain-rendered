# Ignoring a specific pylint rule does not work

_Issue opened by @shager on 2023-06-13 10:10_

Hello,

I am currently trying to setup ruff as a linter.
I want to use all of the pylint rules, with a few exceptions.
My pyproject.toml file currently looks like this:
```
select=[
    "I",     # isort
    "PL",    # pylint
    "E",     # pycodestyle errors
    "F",     # pyflakes
    "S",     # flake8-bandit
    "TID251" # banned-imports (banned-api), see configuration below
]

ignore=[
    "S102", # "exec-builtin"
    "PLW0603", # "global-statement"
]
```
However, if I try to execute ruff using the above configuration, I get the following error:

```
Running ruff on paths <MY_PROJECT>
ruff:
Please reformat error: Failed to parse `pyproject.toml`: TOML parse error at line 167, column 5
Please reformat     |
Please reformat 167 |     "PLW0603", # "global-statement"
Please reformat     |     ^^^^^^^^^
Please reformat Unknown rule selector `W0603`
ruff: 0:00:00.006543
```

To me, it seems like ruff somehow is not able to parse the pylint rule codes.
Am I doing something wrong here, or might this be a bug?

Thank you very much in advance!

I just noticed that this is already fixed, sorry for the noise
