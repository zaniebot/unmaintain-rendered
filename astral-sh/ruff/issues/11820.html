            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m seeing a case where black is expanding an assignment but ruff is not - even re-writing the black formatted result.</p>
<p>To keep it concise, this example uses an ultra-short line-length of 14:</p>
<p>Input</p>
<pre><code>long_variable_name = 1234
</code></pre>
<p>Black:</p>
<pre><code>long_variable_name = (
    1234
)
</code></pre>
<p>Ruff:</p>
<pre><code>long_variable_name = 1234

</code></pre>
<p>This seems to occur only when the name of the variable assigned to, is longer than line-length (so expanding the line won&#x27;t bring it within the allowed length).</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t find this in the documented deviations or other issues at present, and this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a duplicate of another issue.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I can confirm that #8940 would fix the deviation. The problem is, that the PR has a few regressions around call expression formatting, which is why the PR was abandoned. So fixing this requires some more work and is also something that I don&#x27;t think we can fix outside of a new formatter style guide as it would change how already formatted code gets formatted.</p>
<p>But we should have a second look at this when we work on the next formatter style guide to see if we can match Black more closely.</p>
<p>The main issue here is that Ruff doesn&#x27;t parenthesize the expression if the <code>(</code> doesn&#x27;t fit inside the line length, whereas Black only avoids the parentheses if the content doesn&#x27;t fit into the line length.</p>
