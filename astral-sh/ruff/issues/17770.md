# `S110` only works for `Exception` not other exception types for multi-line `try` blocks

---

_Issue opened by @shearer12345 on 2025-05-01 16:24_

### Summary

For multi-line `try` blocks `S110` only detects for `Exception` - other exception types (e.g. `RuntimeError`) stop it detecting.

See [playground link for reproduction](https://play.ruff.rs/b6777ce2-5c56-4d5e-967e-d1fe85a9e309)

Also relates to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8593 - where `S110` is suggested for that case.

```python
# Detected by S110
try:
    i = 42
    j = 24
except Exception:
    pass

# Not detected by S110
try:
    i = 42
    j = 24
except RuntimeError:
    pass
```

gives 
```bash
$ ruff check --isolated --select S110 test.py
test.py:3:1: S110 `try`-`except`-`pass` detected, consider logging the exception
  |
1 |   try:
2 |       i = 42
3 | / except Exception:
4 | |     pass
  | |________^ S110
5 |
6 |   try:
  |

Found 1 error.

```

### Version

Does setting [`checked-typed-exception`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-bandit_check-typed-exception) work for you ([playground](https://play.ruff.rs/97395e63-9e60-463a-bc06-8403752d6633))

Thanks Micha,

I hadn't seen that setting - I'd expect them to be linked from the specific
rule page (https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/try-except-pass/), not just
the general flake8-bandit page (
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#flake8-bandit-s).

Is that a reasonable expectation?

Using checked-typed-exception does work for me. Thanks

John
