            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using SIM110 I ran into this change:</p>
<pre><code>-        for p in self.predicates:
-            if not (yield p.is_satisfied.asynq()):  # noqlint
-                return False
-        return True
+        return all((yield p.is_satisfied.asynq()) for p in self.predicates)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is using the <a href="https://github.com/quora/asynq">asynq</a> framework, causing the unusual yield. Ruff should not apply this fix if there is a <code>yield</code> in the condition, as the <code>yield</code> will end up in the inner generator expression, where it is a SyntaxError in recent Python versions.</p>
<p>While looking at the code I noticed that Ruff already protects against this class of bug with <code>await</code>, but the protection is slightly too eager: it applies if there is an <code>await</code> in the for loop's iter expression. However, the iter expression of a genexp is evaluated in the outer scope, so it's fine if there's an <code>await</code> there.</p>
<p>I will submit a PR soon with a proposed fix.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that Ruff ate the comment here. That feels like a bug too, but it's probably more involved to fix so I'll skip it for now.</p>
