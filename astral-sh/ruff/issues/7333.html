Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p><strong>example file</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># noqa is used extensively in this file [...]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>output</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ ruff --select ALL foo.py
...
warning: Invalid `# noqa` directive on foo.py:1: expected `:` followed by a comma-separated list of codes (e.g., `# noqa: F401, F841`).
...
</code></pre>
<p>(using <code>--isolated</code> removes the warning)</p>
<p>No settings, version <code>0.0.289</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Real life incident</strong>: https://github.com/python-trio/trio/pull/2795/files/78d67c11d99d64c19f0e5182608b6653ad32924b#r1323337111</p>
<p><strong>Minimal suggested fix</strong>: Ignore warning if the line is blank, and the comment has trailing characters after <code>noqa[^:]</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think my preference is to retain our current behavior. I know it's annoying in certain cases, but it's possible that the user wrote a line that starts with <code># noqa</code> followed by an explanation and expected it to work as a blanket ignore comment.</p>
