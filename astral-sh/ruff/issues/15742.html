<p>The fix for <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/starmap-zip/"><code>starmap-zip</code> (RUF058)</a> in Ruff 0.9.3 can cause a <code>TypeError</code> at runtime when all the arguments to <code>zip</code> are starred empty iterables.</p>

        pass
f([])
#EOF

$ python ruf058.py

$ ruff --isolated check --preview --select RUF058 ruf058.py --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ cat ruf058.py

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! It seems reasonable to me to add a cautionary note about this to the rule&#x27;s docs. However, I don&#x27;t think this potential unsafety is enough to warrant marking the fix as always unsafe. It seems quite unlikely to come up in real code, and there are costs to marking a fix as always unsafe. I&#x27;d imagine a lot of our users never run Ruff with <code>--unsafe-fixes</code>, and so marking this fix as unsafe would mean that they would never get the benefit of the fix at all. If we have too many stylistic diagnostics that can&#x27;t be easily autofixed, it can make running Ruff feeling like a burden that leads to needless busywork for our users, rather than something that they appreciate because it helps them write better, more idiomatic code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In this case, perhaps not emitting a diagnostic at all would be the correct thing to do. The user might be relying on <code>zip()</code> to take care of the empty case, and so they shouldn&#x27;t be asked to change the code.</p>
