            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#NotImplemented">According to the docs</a>, <code>NotImplemented</code> is supposed to be mainly (or exclusively?) returned by some special dunder methods like <code>__eq__()</code>, <code>__lt__()</code> or <code>__imul__()</code>. That's why I would like to get a warning when returning it from any other context, because this may not be intended (and I consider it a code smell).</p>
<p><strong>Invalid Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def foo() -&gt; bool:
    return NotImplemented
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">class C:
    def __foo(self) -&gt; str:
        return NotImplemented
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Valid Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class C:
    def __eq__(self, other: object) -&gt; bool:
        return NotImplemented
</code></pre>
<p>I think in most cases one actually wants to raise instead, but I wouldn't fix it automatically because it changes behaviour.</p>
<p>As far as I know, no other linters can check this explicitly. Pylint produces follow-up issues if the returned value is not handled properly, Mypy can only warn about &quot;Returning Any&quot;. But these warnings can be misleading.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/363">a similar feature request for Mypy</a>. I'm not sure which tool is the right one for this check, though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that makes sense to me, now that Python has abstract class (and method) support without needing <code>NotImplemented</code>. However, I don't think we should add this rule before we finish #1774 because I consider this a rule that intentionally restricts the allowed syntax.</p>
