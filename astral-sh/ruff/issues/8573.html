            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#pydocstyle-convention, it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enabling a convention will force-disable any rules that are not included in the specified convention</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I can't seem to find documentation about <em>which</em> rules are included in <em>which</em> conventions! Maybe I totally missed it, but I only found this information by going to the source code and finding https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4760af3dcbcf772fdcc1cae9aa9d0c4b8037c132/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pydocstyle/settings.rs#L24</p>
<p>Is there some place this is documented? If not, how easy/hard would it be to add some documentation? I'd be happy to contribute a patch if the best way is to just add some markdown at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4760af3dcbcf772fdcc1cae9aa9d0c4b8037c132/crates/ruff_workspace/src/options.rs#L2378, but maybe there's some clever way to auto-generate that information from the code to ensure it stays in sync?</p>
