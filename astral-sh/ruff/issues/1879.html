Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

<p>I'm not sure there is much to do, but it seems tricky to identify spreads <code>**</code> in the Rust Python AST</p>
<p>With the Python AST <code>{&quot;foo&quot;: 1, **{&quot;bar&quot;: 1}}</code> would be represented with a <code>Dict</code> node with one key and two values, so detecting a spread is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>With the Rust Python AST it seems like the only difference is the location information (which can also be affected by whitespace)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{**foo,    &quot;bar&quot;: True  }
