Ruff to https://github.com/python-babel/babel/ and figured I&#x27;d try <code>--select=ALL --fix</code> and look through the diff, and found a surprising combination of breaking autofixes – maybe the autofix for T201 (&quot;<code>print</code> found&quot;) should also be made a suggestion (as there&#x27;s been discussion for some other rules in other issues here), not a default?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, yeah, sorry, should&#x27;ve been more clear there!</p>
<p>It does run but it no longer does anything of value since all it was meant to do was print things and the autofix got rid of that. This is really of course only an issue if <code>T201</code> is enabled and not marked <code>unfixable</code> :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No totally! Just making sure we weren&#x27;t producing invalid syntax.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m more and more feeling like we should disable a bunch of autofixes by default and require users to opt-in to them. This is a useful rule but it&#x27;s probably surprising that it autofixes itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also wondered what <code>T201</code> is about. I don&#x27;t understand its purpose. This maybe makes sense for a library.
I aksed that upstream in <a href="https://github.com/JBKahn/flake8-print/issues/59">JBKahn/flake8-print#59</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@spaceone It makes a lot of sense for libraries or e.g. webapps where you don&#x27;t want your views or models or whatnot to randomly print things out (e.g. where the policy would be to use <code>logging</code>).</p>
