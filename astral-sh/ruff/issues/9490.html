Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>I'm using pyenv and had created a new virtual for Python 3.12.0. I installed ruff using pip the regular way (<code>pip install ruff</code>) in a new project folder, but I got an error when trying to run anything:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ruff check .            
ruff failed
  Cause: Failed to create cache file '/home/golgor/Code/phoenix-test-bench/.ruff_cache/0.1.12/1189904080403456301'
  Cause: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>I am running zsh on Fedora Linux, but I also tried in bash, both in VS Code and system terminal. I only installed ruff and tried to run it immediately so no configurations or anything.</p>
<p>I did some tests and noticed that it seems to only be the latest release.</p>

<p>I tried to run it with the --isolation option, and then it worked fine and after this the regular command works fine as well. Not sure if this is a bug or just some wierd environment issue for me. Unfortunately I can't reproduce it anymore, maybe someone else has had a similar issue?</p>
