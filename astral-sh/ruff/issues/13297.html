            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In https://github.com/jaraco/zipp/pull/125, I learned that users can, intentionally or not, sneak non-printable characters into the code through otherwise innocuous pull requests. This particular one was caught by <code>mach lint</code> in a downstream system. It would be nice if ruff could catch such changes. I'm not confident it's possible, but I wanted to flag it as a feature for consideration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm rather surprised that we don't already have that. There's an existing rule to catch <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/ambiguous-unicode-character-docstring/">ambiguous unicode characters</a>, but it doesn't cover invisible characters.</p>
<p>I'm very much in favor of adding the rule. We would have to think about if it should be a new rule or be added to the above mentioned rule</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suggest add <code>--show-all-characters</code> option to show non-printable characters like <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> also:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@xyb, this issue is different. It isn't about showing invisible characters; it's about linting for invisible characters.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I agree this is a separate request, but it's related because it would be confusing if Ruff reports an invisible character without helping the user fix it.  If you agree, I'll go ahead and create a new issue to track this requirement.</p>
