            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <a href="https://github.com/jaraco/zipp/pull/125">jaraco/zipp#125</a>, I learned that users can, intentionally or not, sneak non-printable characters into the code through otherwise innocuous pull requests. This particular one was caught by <code>mach lint</code> in a downstream system. It would be nice if ruff could catch such changes. I&#x27;m not confident it&#x27;s possible, but I wanted to flag it as a feature for consideration.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m rather surprised that we don&#x27;t already have that. There&#x27;s an existing rule to catch <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/ambiguous-unicode-character-docstring/">ambiguous unicode characters</a>, but it doesn&#x27;t cover invisible characters.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m very much in favor of adding the rule. We would have to think about if it should be a new rule or be added to the above mentioned rule</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suggest add <code>--show-all-characters</code> option to show non-printable characters like <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat">bat</a> also:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@xyb, this issue is different. It isn&#x27;t about showing invisible characters; it&#x27;s about linting for invisible characters.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MichaReiser I agree this is a separate request, but it&#x27;s related because it would be confusing if Ruff reports an invisible character without helping the user fix it.  If you agree, I&#x27;ll go ahead and create a new issue to track this requirement.</p>
