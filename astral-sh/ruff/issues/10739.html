            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, I&#x27;m newly migrating to ruff and it works so far so good for me, thank you for making this great tool!</p>
<p>However, I noticed that ruff uses the <code>config_dir</code> in <code>dirs</code> crates, which goes to <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support</code> under macOS. Generally I believe that as a CLI tool (and like many others), ruff should probably stick with XDG config home under macOS. When I look into my <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support</code>, they&#x27;re almost all GUI application stuffs. Also, I think it is expected &amp; intuitional to read config from <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> since macOS mostly behave in *nix way.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a similar request in a comment for <code>uv</code> as well: <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1511">astral-sh/uv#1511</a></p>
<p>I&#x27;m not a macOS user so I don&#x27;t have a good sense of what the right choice is. But my understanding is that <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> is commonly used on macOS. I have a fair number of things in my <code>~/.config</code> directory on my test mac mini for example.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I prefer Linux to macOS but use macOS as a daily driver and I would be very confused if <code>~/.config</code> was not a valid configuration path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I use macOS exclusively. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t know where to expect the config to go. I&#x27;d have to look it up in the docs for any given tool. But looking at my machine, I do think <code>~/.config</code> is more appropriate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That was a matter of discussion for PDM too (which does not recognise the XDG_* vars for macOS). PDM does this because the underlying Python package platformdirs does this. As a mac user who versions their dotfiles, I spent a bit of time to make sure that as many projects as I use can save data under <code>~/.config</code>. It makes the most sense, it&#x27;s more portable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could you report this upstream at https://github.com/dirs-dev/dirs-rs? I&#x27;m not a mac user so i&#x27;m not qualified to weigh in on this, i just wouldn&#x27;t want to diverge from the effective rust standard without an upstream discussion first</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@konstin I think it&#x27;s been discussed before upstream and they are pretty opposed: <a href="https://github.com/dirs-dev/directories-rs/issues/47">dirs-dev/directories-rs#47</a></p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d consider <code>dirs-rs</code> to be an effective Rust standard personally. But it is probably the most popular implementation of XDG.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s also some other discussion that touches on this topic here: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-split-cargo-home/19747</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we want xdg over the platform default on mac, we should consider switching to something like  <a href="https://docs.rs/etcetera/latest/etcetera/app_strategy/struct.Xdg.html">etcetera&#x27;s Xdg</a> and <code>etcetera::app_strategy::choose_app_strategy</code> (&quot;Returns the current OS’s default <code>AppStrategy</code> This uses the <code>Windows</code> strategy on Windows, and <code>Xdg</code> everywhere else.&quot;) over <code>directories</code>.</p>
