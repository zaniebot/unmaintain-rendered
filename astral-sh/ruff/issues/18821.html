            <div class="timeline-body">Summary
<p>The &quot;Why is this bad&quot; reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class that implements <code>__eq__</code> but not <code>__hash__</code> will have its hash method implicitly set to None, regardless of if a superclass defines <code>__hash__</code>. This will cause the class to be unhashable, which will in turn cause issues when using instances of the class as keys in a dictionary or <strong>members of a set.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasize mine)
Meanwhile, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#set-types"><code>set</code> is documented as a container for <em>immutable</em> objects</a>.
Indeed, a hash should never change throughout the lifetime of an object, so it is not sound to support hashing for objects that are intended to be mutable.
I would expect the rule&#x27;s documentation to emphasize this important limitation.</p>

<p>I consider the rule invalid because it enforces users to provide the code they don&#x27;t need. It&#x27;s totally OK to have either <code>__hash__</code> or <code>__eq__</code>, or both of them, depending what you need. Maybe it didn&#x27;t sound like that, but I agreed with what you&#x27;d written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a hash should never change throughout the lifetime of an object, so it is not sound to support hashing for objects that are intended to be mutable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The false assumptions that this rule made are:</p>
<ul>
<li>all objects are immutable</li>
<li>all objects can be hashable</li>
</ul>

<p>Well if you&#x27;re writing a library, you cannot make assumptions about what end users actually need. The way I se it, this lint pushes you in a direction that&#x27;s never incorrect (provided the nuance I want to add). If you don&#x27;t need it (for writing anything <em>other</em> than a library), you can simply not enable this rule. Is that so bad ?</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, custom hashability  has been always an optional ability of Python objects and pushing anyone towards that direction isn&#x27;t nice. A class with <code>__eq__</code> and  without <code>__hash__</code> isn&#x27;t incorrect or non-idiomatic, so what&#x27;s the point of considering it a linting error? Many people learn how to write code by trial-and-error and if &quot;ruff&quot; says it&#x27;s incorrect, they&#x27;ll learn that way. But here it&#x27;s misleading people. So I do think it&#x27;s incorrect and may cause YAGNI violations.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Disabling the rule makes sense to me when I agree that the rule makes sense and I accept my code doesn&#x27;t fulfil it for some reason. In case of <code>PLW1641</code> I don&#x27;t think this way as it depends on the class semantics whether <code>__hash__</code> is needed together with <code>__eq__</code> or not, what can&#x27;t be validated by the static linter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The difficulty is that I am not aware of an unambiguous way for a linter to determine if a class is meant to be immutable (other than certain library conventions such as <code>attrs.frozen</code>.) As the rule stands, even with a documentation change, one would still get false positives even in legitimate &quot;library&quot; settings.</p>
<p>For instance, if one reimplemented <code>set</code> in pure python, one would need to leave <code>__hash__</code> unset (or set explicitely to <code>None</code>, which creates other linting problems if actually attempted.) But because <code>set</code> has an <code>__eq__</code>, this rule would be innappropriately triggered.</p>
<p>So the OP is correct, but this goes beyond a documentation problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Possible heuristics for &quot;this is a mutable class&quot; that could help:</p>
<ul>
<li>the class inherits from <code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, <code>set</code>, <code>collections.OrderedDict</code>, any of the <code>collections.abc.Mutable*</code> protocol classes, or any other stdlib class that implements a mutable container</li>
<li>the class implements <code>__setitem__</code> or <code>__delitem__</code> [refinement: &quot;and the implementation doesn&#x27;t unconditionally throw an exception&quot;]</li>
</ul>
<p>But I do think that adding text along the lines of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>__hash__</code> should only be defined for <em>immutable</em> objects.  If this class is mutable, then you should instead annotate it with <code>__hash__ = None</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>would be a solid improvement over what there is now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe that this check is just completely wrong. The only case for it to be true is when object is already used in set/dict.</p>
