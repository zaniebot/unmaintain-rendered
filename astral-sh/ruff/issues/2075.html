            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I updated to ruff v0.0.229, and added <code>INP</code> to the list of linters I would like to run.
After running the new version it failed with the below error (which was correct);</p>
<pre><code>src/xxx.py:1:1: INP001 File `src/xxx.py` is part of an implicit namespace package. Add an `__init__.py`.
</code></pre>
<p>I added <code>__init__.py</code> to the src folder, and yet.. I'm seeing the same error.</p>
<p>I did an experiment, and I added in a different branch <code>__init__.py</code> to the src folder before running <code>ruff</code>, and indeed there is no <code>INP001</code> failure, I then deleted the <code>__init__.py</code> from the src file, and this time when I ran <code>ruff</code> I didn't encounter any <code>INP001</code> failure.
If I'm not missing anything (which usually I do :-)), it seems that something is cached and not being cleared correctly</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Mmm yeah, good call, this definitely breaks our caching model, since it's a per-file check that depends on <em>other</em> files.</p>
<p>You can run Ruff with <code>-n</code> or <code>--no-cache</code> for now. It shouldn't be much of a noticeable difference. Let me think on how to fix this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This appears like it might have resurfaced again?  In <code>v0.11.2</code> I am seeing this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ruff check .
profiling/profile_scan.py:1:1: INP001 File `profiling/profile_scan.py` is part of an implicit namespace package. Add an `__init__.py`.
Found 1 error.
$ ruff check . --no-cache
All checks passed!
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.11.2
</code></pre>
<p><code>profiling/__init__.py</code> legitimately did not exist when I first saw this happen. When I added it it did not get rid of the error.  I tried removing it and replacing it, and adding contents to it, and I don't know what else.  Then I found this bug report and <code>--no-cache</code> fixes it.</p>
<p>Since it seems like <code>--no-cache</code> will just make Ruff run a tiny bit slower (which is hilarious, since it is SO fast) I'm just going to force <code>--no-cache</code> in all usage for now.</p>
