            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi 👋🏻</p>
<p>I'm loving Ruff so far. Today I was writing some tests and found that I'm getting an error on the <code>assert</code> statement due to <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/assert">this</a> rule in my tests file. I want this rule for my codebase but not for my tests. Additionally, there are some other rules that I don't want to enable in tests like <a href="https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/magic-value-comparison">magic value comparison</a>.</p>
<p>For this kind of scenario, I would like to disable the rule for the specific directories.</p>
<p>Thanks for such a great library ❤️</p>

<p>P.S. Thanks to the ruff I was able to identify one minor type improvement in FastAPI docs and made my first contribution 😇</p>

<p>Can you accomplish what you need with <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#per-file-ignores">per-file-ignores</a>? In your <code>pyproject.toml</code>, you'd typically do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
&quot;tests/**&quot; = [&quot;S101&quot;, &quot;PLR2004&quot;]
</code></pre>
