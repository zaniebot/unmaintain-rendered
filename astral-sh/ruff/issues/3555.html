Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

<p>First of all, thank you so much for a great linter! We recently moved from <code>flake8</code> to <code>ruff</code>, which massively sped up our linting step, and allowed us to check for things we couldn't previously use <code>flake8</code> plugins for, like <code>flake8-type-checking</code>, due to having to support Python 3.6. This just worked with <code>ruff</code>, without any hassle! 👏</p>
<p>We recently updated one of our repositories to a newer version of Python, and wanted to turn on UP006, specifically, when we ran into what we believe is a bug.
If the typing annotation that includes a generic from typing that is no longer necessary, according to PEP585, the UP006 rule does not flag it as an error.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from typing import Dict

does_not_flag: &quot;Dict[str, str]&quot; = {}
does_flag: Dict[str, str] = {}
</code></pre>
<p>The command used to run is <code>ruff check up006.py --isolated --select UP006</code>, and the output of <code>ruff --version</code> is <code>ruff 0.0.256</code>.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for all your work!</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> we can check and fix these but I need to do some research -- there are some unintuitive corner cases around quoted annotations. We should almost certainly be flagging them as errors though, even if we can't autofix them.</p>
<p>(Related to #3508.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For now, made sure that we flag these. In the future, we'll be able to autofix <em>some</em> cases, but not all (e.g., this is valid, but hard to fix: <code>x: &quot;Li&quot; &quot;st[int] = []</code>).</p>
