<p>By the document, <code>PLR0917</code> shall only happen in a function call, not in the function definition.
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/too-many-positional/</p>
<p>But in the tests, it will fail in the function definition.
From the tests, it's more like <code>too-many-no-default</code> rather than <code>too-many-positional</code></p>

<p>Can you clarify this bit? I might be misunderstanding what you're trying to say but from my perspective the docs does mean <em>function definitions</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Checks for function definitions that include too many positional arguments.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry I misunderstood the document earlier, that's because I didn't know to use <code>*</code> to force keyword argument is a feature of Python language. I thought it's a feature of linter shall only be check in the function call not function definition. Maybe we can add this to document of linter to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
