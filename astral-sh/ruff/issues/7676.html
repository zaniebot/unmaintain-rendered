            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Couldn&#x27;t find a previous issue for this.</p>
<p>The following code:</p>
<pre><code>def outer_func():
    variable: int

    def func():
        nonlocal variable
        variable = 1

    func()
    assert variable == 1


outer_func()
</code></pre>
<p>This executes just fine but <code>ruff</code> has an issue with it:</p>
<pre><code>❯ ruff check --select=F821 test.py
test.py:9:12: F821 Undefined name `variable`
  |
8 |     func()
9 |     assert variable == 1
  |            ^^^^^^^^ F821
  |

Found 1 error.
</code></pre>
<p>Not that this code works because of <code>outer_func</code>. If <code>variable</code> was defined at module level the code fails.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for filing. This is tough to get right in the general case since you need to reason about the complete flow of the program...</p>
<p>It looks like Pyright <em>also</em> flags this as unbound.</p>
<p>Mypy doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s also too permissive in that it allows <em>this</em>:</p>
<pre><code>def outer_func() -&gt; None:
    variable: int

    assert variable == 1


outer_func()
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m tempted to close as <code>wontfix</code> since it seems rare and hard to get right. Alternatively, we could do what we do for globals and add a binding for <code>variable</code> as soon as we see the <code>nonlocal</code>, which would be closer to Mypy&#x27;s behavior (and so have some false negatives instead of false positives).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>pylint</code> also accepts this while raising on the variant where <code>variable</code> is defined outside of <code>outer_func</code> as well as raise <code>used-before-assignment</code> on the example you gave.
<em>Although as <code>pylint</code> maintainer I&#x27;m obviously biased :smile:</em></p>
<p>At work we&#x27;re trying to put as much of our checks in <code>ruff</code> instead of <code>pylint</code> and we had to put quite a bit of ignores for this false positive. We use this pattern in testing code to test some obscure behaviour and I would never use it in production code as I don&#x27;t think it is a good pattern. That said it is valid Python and I think preferring false negatives over false positives is usually better?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve used a similar pattern for testing as well, but I think I usually initialize the variable as <code>None</code> instead of just annotating it. It seems like that would generally lead to clearer error messages if things don&#x27;t work as intended in your inner function.</p>
<p>I do agree a false negative seems a little better than a false positive.</p>
