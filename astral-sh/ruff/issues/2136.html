            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ahahhaahahahh oh that&#x27;s a weird problem to have. Had no idea there was such a limit, but thinking about it makes total sense. Guess they will adjust the limit for ruff. Hope you keep releasing daily though. It&#x27;s nice to check the new changes when I find time :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For the future, we have two (three?) options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build fewer wheels (e.g., we could make some decisions based on platform popularity).</li>
<li>Release less often (once-a-week, probably).</li>
<li>Ask for a bigger exemption.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could also remove wheels (while keeping the sdist) from older releases when the limit approaches. I don&#x27;t know if GitHub releases on OSS projects have a project size limit but if not, the wheels for older releases could remain available there once they get removed from PyPI. It doesn&#x27;t go well with pertaining to the immutability of releases on PyPI that users may expect but technically it is an option.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Deleting wheels from PyPI would mean installs would fail for people who have pinned them, which is the default with <a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit</a>, and common for linters, especially fast-moving ones!</p>
<p>Also worth bearing in mind that the wheel sizes are increasing over time as more rules and so on is added.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could also consider not building quite as many wheels (by looking at platform / target popularity), although that feels bad too, since it’s so easy for us to ship them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, I feel like I should clarify that the intent with not going with a large number straight up was not to disincentivise the project from supporting users or reducing velocity of development. PyPI is a shared resource and I want to be cautious in setting a precedent for &quot;give me lots of space on a shared resource&quot; requests being granted on a blanket basis.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s 100% OK for you to come back around and say &quot;hey, we considered changing things but didn&#x27;t for $reasons&quot; if you hit the limit in a few more months. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @pradyunsg, I really appreciate that clarification. By the same token, we of course want to be good members of the community and not abuse those shared resources. So we&#x27;ll continue to be mindful of the rate of increase -- <em>but</em>, per your note, I&#x27;ll try to avoid letting those concerns get in the way of positive user impact.</p>
<p>On the bright side, we kind of naturally fell into a more deliberate ~once-a-week cadence over the past ~month. So while we&#x27;ll likely hit the revised cap eventually, it should take longer than last time.</p>
