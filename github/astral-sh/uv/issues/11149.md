# Unified run command

---

_Issue opened by @T-256 on 2025-01-31 23:04_

### Summary

As we going forward, `uv run` and `uv tool run` commands are getting more similar to each other, opened this to discuss about blockers of unified run command which could be smart (and environment aware) command that also accepts opt-in/opt-out arguments to focus on what user needs.

Prior discussions:
- #8666 
- #7186
