# Bug/Feature: UV Build Backend not working with namespace packages

---

_Issue opened by @badrobit on 2025-05-12 20:00_

### Summary

When creating a package with a namespace e.g. `matsbrain.fake_library` I am able to get it to build properly but when I attempt to import the library built the python interpreter does not seem to be able to find the packages: 

```shell
$ uv run python -c "import matsbrain.fake_library"

> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
>    import matsbrain.fake_library
> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matsbrain'
```

This is using the `uv_build_backend` and in a mono-repo structure.


Minimal Reproducable Example: (GitHub Repo) https://github.com/badrobit/uv-build-namespace

### Platform

Darwin 24.4.0 arm64

### Version

0.7.3

### Python version

3.13.3

This is a known limitation right now, I don't think we support them yet.

@zanieb thanks! mostly asking as I didn't see it on [this ticket](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8779#issuecomment-2862072292) as a planned todo, do you know if it is planned before the production ready release of the `uv_build_backend` or will it be something to come after the initial release?

We track support for namespace packages over in #12832
