# tweak `uv pip compile --group` comments

---

_Issue opened by @Gankra on 2025-03-26 16:41_

### Summary

Per https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/2062#issuecomment-2751991047


> [@Gankra](https://github.com/Gankra) to be in line with the build system extraction refs, the output would need to be
> 
> ```diff
>  # This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
>  #    uv pip compile pyproject.toml --group subdir/pyproject.toml:foo
>  iniconfig==2.0.0
> -    # via mysubproject (subdir/pyproject.toml:foo)
> +    # via mysubproject (subdir/pyproject.toml::dependency-groups.foo)
>  typing-extensions==4.10.0
>      # via myproject (pyproject.toml)
> ```
> (see https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#maximizing-reproducibility for the build deps refs output example that has things like `via my-cool-django-app (pyproject.toml::build-system.requires)`)

Easy to do and morally non-breaking.
