# Add uv venv list

---

_Issue opened by @etterathe on 2024-12-11 11:13_

It'd be great to have something like uv venv list that lists all virtual envs created on pc and allows for quick actions on them, like activating and switching between them. Similar concepts: conda env list or lsvirtualenv from virtualenvwrapper.

The prerequisite for this function should be that UV supports centralized virtual environment management.
