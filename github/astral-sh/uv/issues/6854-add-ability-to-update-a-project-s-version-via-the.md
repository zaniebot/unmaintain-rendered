# Add ability to update a project's version via the command line

---

_Issue opened by @valentincalomme on 2024-08-30 07:20_

I love the new features in `uv`. One feature that I found myself wanting was the ability to do something like `uv version minor` or `uv version 1.2.3` to update the version of my package.

Essentially, looking for something similar to the `poetry version` command: https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version

It would allow me to not have to use external packages like `bump2version`
