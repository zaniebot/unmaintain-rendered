# allow multiple --package arguments to uv sync

---

_Issue opened by @kapilt on 2025-05-21 11:21_

### Summary

I'm currently converting over a project (https://cloudcustodian.io) to use uv. its structured as a workspace over multiple packages. for developer installations, we simply use --all-packages.

For our docker images we allow a build arg to specify a subset of packages. we'd like to be able to simply pass those as additional --package flags to uv sync, but currently that results in an unsupported error.

```
the argument '--package <PACKAGE>' cannot be used multiple times
```

the alternative atm is to invoke uv sync multiple times with --inexact, but we'd rather avoid that.

its not clear why the single --package flag restriction exists, given --all-packages allows for multiple package to be sync'd at once.
