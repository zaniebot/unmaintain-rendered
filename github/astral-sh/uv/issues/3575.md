# Support passing version to install.sh

---

_Issue opened by @rossmacarthur on 2024-05-14 12:41_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


I'd love to be able to pass the version to the script, e.g. so that in my Dockerfile I'm using a specific version. Semver compatible would be versions specification would be even better.


```
uv-installer.sh

The installer for uv 0.1.43

This script detects what platform you're on and fetches an appropriate archive from
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.1.43
then unpacks the binaries and installs them to

    $CARGO_HOME/bin (or $HOME/.cargo/bin)

It will then add that dir to PATH by adding the appropriate line to your shell profiles.

USAGE:
    uv-installer.sh [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -v, --verbose
            Enable verbose output

    -q, --quiet
            Disable progress output

        --no-modify-path
            Don't configure the PATH environment variable

    -h, --help
            Print help information
```

I think we should consider just adding versioned links to each installer. It's not guaranteed that (e.g.) the install script for 0.1.43 knows how to install all versions of uv.

You can now do:

```text
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.1.41/install.sh | sh
```

Or:

```text
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/0.1.41/install.ps1 | iex"
```
