I think this was fixed in a newer version.

Can you try with the latest uv? 0.2.15 is several versions behind.

Unable to build uv under msys2(python -m pip install "uv=0.2.23")

 2.cargo version: 1.79

error: failed to run custom build command for `libz-ng-sys v1.1.15`
Caused by: build-script-build_zng

You're trying to build uv from source, is that intentional? Seems like you need a C++ toolchain for `libz-ng-sys`.
