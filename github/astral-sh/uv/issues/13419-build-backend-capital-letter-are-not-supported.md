# Build backend: Capital letter are not supported

---

_Issue opened by @followheart26 on 2025-05-13 02:50_

> It works with `module-root = ""`, we should accept `./`, too, though.
> 
> i use module-root = "", and i find that if the source code dir named like nBk tCk  also raise the Error: Expected a Python module directory at: `tCk`, can't i use capital letter in source code dir?
