# Should lock file be committed to source control?

_Issue opened by @ngaloppo on 2024-12-11 01:29_

Seems like a basic question, but can't find this information in the documentation.

Yep! https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#uvlock and https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/layout/#the-lockfile

@zanieb is the recommendation to commit uv.lock is similar for application and libs? 

from cargo/rust ecosystem i know that:

- Things that produce a final product, namely applications and binaries, should commit Cargo.lock to ensure a deterministic build.
- Library crates should not commit a Cargo.lock file, because it’s irrelevant to any downstream consumers of the library—they will have their own Cargo.lock file;  Cargo.lock file for a library crate is ignored by library users.

what would be your suggestion?
