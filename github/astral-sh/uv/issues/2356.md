# Failed to install wheel file: `Names must start and end with a letter or digit and may only contain -, _, ., and alphanumeric characters.`

_Issue opened by @licht1stein on 2024-03-11 12:55_

I'm using this in Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /code
COPY ./dist/$wheel /code/$wheel

RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
RUN /root/.cargo/bin/uv pip install --system --no-cache-dir --only-binary /code/$wheel
```

And I'm getting an error:

```
Not a valid package or extra name: "/code/main-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl". Names must start and end with a letter or digit and may only contain -, _, ., and alphanumeric characters.
```

Is there a way to install from this wheel file?

I couldn't find a way to install from`.whl` in the docs

Apparently there's a workaround:

```sh
RUN /root/.cargo/bin/uv pip install --system --no-cache-dir "main @ $wheel"
```

Also it's duplicate of #1403

Yeah, the error message is bad atm, merging into #313.

I added a clearer error message for this: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2369

This is supported as of `v0.1.24`. You can `uv pip install /code/main-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` directly, without including a package name.
