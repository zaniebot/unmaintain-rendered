# Project rebuilds on `uv run` after `pyproject.toml` edit "feel bad"

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-10 19:19_

Fuzzy feedback after migrating to `uv run`: it's annoying that the project rebuilds, uninstalls, and reinstalls at seemingly random points in time. Those points in time aren't actually random -- it's whenever I edit the `pyproject.toml`. But it _feels_ random as a user.
