_Issue opened by @ChoSeoHwan on 2024-12-30 06:24_

```bash
$ uv version
uv 0.5.9 (0652800cb 2024-12-13)
```

2. run any uv command (with errors)

```bash
$ uv run hello.py 
Segmentation fault

$ uv python list
Segmentation fault
```

3. downgrade to uv@0.5.8 version

```bash

Huh, very little changed between these two releases. Maybe #9815?

Oh.. I see.
But my team members are also experiencing the same issue.
The flow from installation to usage is as follows. uv does not work after `0.5.9` version.

We've had a few releases since you filed this issue, just wanted to check in that it's still happening with the latest (uv@0.5.18)?

I'm working on trying to reproduce, but no luck so far. Does running the faulting commands with `-v` produce any more output?

Conveniently I actually found a Windows 10.0.19045 machine, but alas uv 0.5.9 works fine on it.

ok I finally solved the issue.


I don't know the exact reason, but since `uv@0.5.9`, it has been causing errors due to conflicts with our internal security system.

After debugging with `WinDump`, I found that it was a conflict with a security program called `PaperSecu`.



Since it was confirmed that it was not an issue with uv itself, I will close this issue for now.
