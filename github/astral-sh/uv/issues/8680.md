# CI flakiness: clang not found

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-10-29 19:16_

Sometimes, the mac os build fails due to an error about clang not being found, e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/11580779758/job/32240068407

>   = note: sh: line 1:  3503 Bus error: 10           /Applications/Xcode_15.4.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild -sdk /Applications/Xcode_15.4.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk -find clang 2> /dev/null
