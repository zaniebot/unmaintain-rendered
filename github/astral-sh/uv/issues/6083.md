# `--no-build-isolation` isn't supported for `uv tool`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-14 13:35_

I think the use of `OnlySystem` for Python discovery means that users can't provide a pre-populated environment for (e.g.) PyTorch.

See, e.g., https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1715#issuecomment-2287843602.

Marking as a bug since I assumed it did work.

Hm this is tough, it seems really weird to detect a virtual environment when installing a tool?

Note that this is just the environment used for building. It doesn't need to have access to the virtualenv after the build step.

I guess we can change interpreter lookup when `--no-build-isolation` is passed, a little weird but better than always doing it.

This might be tricky, we _always_ create a virtualenv for the tool and install into the virtualenv. We'd need to find a way to... give that environment access to the user-provided virtualenv, I think? Like via `sitecustomize.py` maybe.
