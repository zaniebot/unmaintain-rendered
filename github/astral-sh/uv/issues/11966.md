# relative paths for editable installs in `uv pip compile`

---

_Issue opened by @bantucaravan on 2025-03-05 00:34_

### Summary

requirements.in includes:
```
-e .
```
I want to create a compiled requirements.txt in "foo/bar/" that installs the package 2 levels up.
when I run `uv pip compile requirements.in -o foo/bar/requirements.txt` I get:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o foo/bar/requirements.txt
-e .
    # via -r requirements.in
```
But I expect to get:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o foo/bar/requirements.txt
-e ../../
    # via -r requirements.in
```

I also tried moving the CWD to foo/bar/ and using the --directory option, neither changed the output.

### Platform

Darwin 23.2.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.6.3 (a0b9f22a2 2025-02-24)

### Python version

Python 3.10.11

Hmm, this seems like the correct behavior to me. We intentionally preserve the verbatim path supplied by the user. I think I'd expect that your `requirements.in` contain `-e ../../`, and that you run `uv pip compile` from _that_ directory.

fair, it may be the intended behavior. A bit of motivation: the reason I want to have the behavior is I have a library in "foo/bar/" that I want to both install into a venv at the root and separately provide a requirements.txt in "foo/bar/" for a containerization build that only uses the sub directory (I know that is a bit opposite of what I initially described, but the same issue comes up).

This is counter-intuitive because relative paths in `-e <dir>` and `-r <file>` in a `requirements.in` file are treated differently. 
- `uv pip compile` resolves relative paths in  `-r <file>` relative to the **directory of the file** that contains the line, and
- `uv pip install -r <file>` resolves paths i `-e <dir>` relative to the **current working directory**, where the command is executed.

But my conclusion is that [this is how `pip`](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6112) and `pip-tools` currently work, so while it's bad UX, it is [expected for a drop-in replacement](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/).
