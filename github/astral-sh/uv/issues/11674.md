# Feature: `uv tool install <package> <package> <package>`

---

_Issue opened by @amotl on 2025-02-20 18:04_

### Summary

Hi. Thank you again for working on this wonderful tool.

We are just getting hooked by the `uv tool` subsystem [^1], and would like to add a suggestion about it: While `uv pip install` accepts multiple package names, `uv tool install` currently doesn't. Maybe you can do something about it?

[^1]: That's really an excellent one. Thank you so much!


### Example

```shell
uv tool install --upgrade --compile-bytecode cratedb-toolkit grafana-import influxio mqttwarn
```

Glad you like it!

I think the hard part is that allowing installation of multiple tools in a single invocation would conflict with other options like `--from` and `--with`. We could add support and error if the other flags are used?

That's part of why we have `uv tool upgrade` as a separate interface.

I see the conflict, thanks for explaining. Maybe it's not worth the obfuscation of the option parser: Feel free to close the ticket any time at your disposal.

Indeed, we had to use `uv tool install` together with `--with` just recently over here as a workaround.

I have no idea how to otherwise resolve this conflict. If this is a viable way to tremendously improve usability in likely >80% of the situations, we will be very happy about it. If not, because obfuscation weighs in negatively too much, we can absolutely understand it.

Would be nice to have ability to install multiple tools at once, as `pipx` supports this.
