# Add logging when retrying on transient request failures

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-05-14 10:42_

We use `request_middleware`s `RetryTransientMiddleware` to retry transient failures. We should log (debug level) whenever we retry a failure. This should help debugging issues such as #3514.
