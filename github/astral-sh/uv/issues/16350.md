Should we add retries to the existing bash script? I don't think docker buildx imagetools create has built-in retries, but I think we can add it using a bash for loop / break

I dunno, the rate limiting issues persisted for >24 hours so retries may not be sufficient.

I just upgraded to a higher tier, unfortunately giving them money is the solution.

I'll leave this open to track reverting those two changes I made.
