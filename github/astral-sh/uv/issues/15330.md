You'll want `uv tool install yt-dlp --with <YOUR_PLUGIN_GOES_HERE>`

but every time using `uv tool install yt-dlp --with <YOUR_PLUGIN_GOES_HERE>` yt-dlp dependencies and yt-dlp plugins that are already installed are always removed from yt-dlp

You could put these in some `my-yt-dlp-requirements.txt` and use `--with-requirements` instead of `--with`. If you need more plugins, edit the file and rerun the command.

will there be an option to add dependencies without deleting existing dependencies and without `my-yt-dlp-requirements.txt`
