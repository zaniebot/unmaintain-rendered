# [Windows] .venv created in user folder instead of project folder with certain path

---

_Issue opened by @AlphaMoonbaseBerlin on 2025-10-08 11:08_

### Summary

This took a while to find out, and not sure what the issue is.
I have a project folder with the following path
```C:\Users\XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX\Documents\GitHub\Kundenprojekte\XXXXX\XXXXXX_Research_XXXXXXX_25269\tti```
where X is a standin for any regular letter (no umlaute or similiar). The length is the length of the given path.

When I run any uv command, uv created a .venv in the user folder.
```Creating virtual environment at: C:\Users\XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX\.venv```
When I move the folder up to 
```C:\Users\XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX\Documents\GitHub\Kundenprojekte\XXXXXX_Research_XXXXXXX_25269\tti```
it creates the .venv es expected in the projectfolder itself.

No ENV-Variables set. 

### Platform

Windows 10

### Version

uv 0.9.0 (39b688653 2025-10-07)

### Python version

>=3.11

Just as a clarification: Does your username (`XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX`) actually have a space in it?

@gschizas 
Yes, but this is not the cause for the issue. 
When I shorten the path by removing the numbers, it works as expected and creates the .venv in the project folder.

```C:\Users\XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX\Documents\GitHub\Kundenprojekte\XXXXX\XXXXXX_Research_XXXXXXX_25269\tti```
becomes
```C:\Users\XXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXX\Documents\GitHub\Kundenprojekte\XXXXX\XXXXXX_Research_XXXXXXX\tti```
