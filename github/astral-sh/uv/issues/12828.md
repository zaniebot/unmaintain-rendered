# support `uv tool install --from=. cmd`

---

_Issue opened by @tonnico on 2025-04-11 08:13_

### Summary

It would be nice to install a local package with different scripts in it.

### Example

my project looks like this:

```toml
[project]
name = "toolbox"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"

[project.scripts]
toolbox = "toolbox:app"
tb = "toolbox:app"

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

while

```
uv tool install .
```

is working

```
uv tool install --from=. tb
```

is not.

`uv tool install` installs all scripts of a tool, so `uv tool install --from . toolbox` will install both scripts.

ah I see what i've done wrong.

I mixed `uv tool install` and `uv tool run`.

```uv tool run --from . tb``` works
but
```uv tool install --from . tb``` did not work
