# uv add hangs for ssh if remote asks for authentication and --verbose is not provided

_Issue opened by @tbrugere on 2025-01-25 00:25_

### Summary

**reproduction steps**

```console
$ uv init test
$ cd test
$ uv add git+https://github.com/hello/world
Updating https://github.com/hello/world (HEAD)
Updating https://github.com/hello/world (HEAD)
  Resolving dependencies
```
- result: `uv` hangs indefinitely
- expected result: `uv` either asks for authentication, or raises an error

Note that if `--verbose` is provided, then uv asks for user authentication.

```console
$ uv init test
$ cd test
$ uv add --verbose git+https://github.com/hello/world
