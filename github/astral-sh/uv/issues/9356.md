# `uv pip install --target` flags says to add `--system` 

---

_Issue opened by @PatrickAlphaC on 2024-11-22 14:22_

Running the following:

```bash
uv pip install requests --target ./
```

Results in:

```
error: No virtual environment found; run `uv venv` to create an environment, or pass `--system` to install into a non-virtual environment
```

However, I think this is incorrect. I am giving the pip install a target so it shouldn't want to be installed with --system?

If I may add on your issue:
```bash
uv init --package try_pip_install_target
cd try_pip_install_target
uv add numpy
cd ..
uv pip install --target try_pip_install_target requests
```

Gives the same error.
```bash
error: No virtual environment found; run `uv venv` to create an environment, or pass `--system` to install into a non-virtual environment
```

But:
```bash
cd try_pip_install_target
uv pip install --target ./ requests
```
Works.

So doing `uv pip install --target <target-path>` where `<target-path>` is a sub-directory or unrelated directory won't work even if that directory contains a `venv`. But doing it inside a directory that contains a `venv` works.

So either the command was not designed to mirror `pip install` and in that case maybe the documentation is not clear enough, and I guess in that case, probably, this is a command made for workspaces.

Or it was designed to mirror `pip install` but doesn't work correctly.

Or I'm misunderstanding some subtle detail 😅

I need to refresh my memory here, but I agree that at minimum it's confusing.

This has come up enough times that I'll look into changing it:
