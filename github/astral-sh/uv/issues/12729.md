# Pyodide support?

---

_Issue opened by @hoodmane on 2025-04-07 20:34_

I am looking into what it would take to add support for installing Pyodide wheels to uv. Supposing that I contribute it, would uv accept support for:
* creating Pyodide virtual environments, and
* installing Pyodide wheels?

Yep!

I added Pyodide support to `uv pip` in #12731. 

What about installing the Pyodide runtime? I'm not sure how to handle the node dependency -- how would you feel about relying on an appropriate node version lying around on the path?

I'm not sure whether/how to add an integration test to CI in #12731. Presumably it would be easier if `uv python install` knew how to install Pyodide, but perhaps in the short term it would make since to make an integration test that installs `pyodide-build` and have it install the Pyodide runtime for us.

Windows support is also a completely open question.

Thanks for bring the conversation here, @hoodmane – this is great!

Resurfacing my previous suggestion here that we had decided to close earlier: https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide-build/issues/119

> Windows support is also a completely open question.

I think we could leave out Windows support until we support it upstream in Pyodide and in pyodide-build's CI, as it would be misleading if the `pyodide venv` command works with Windows when paired with `uv` and doesn't work with other Python builds.

Well my thought was that `pyodide venv` may continue not to work on windows but using `uv venv` could make pyodide venvs that work on windows. It might be easier.

I do think it will be hard to support without getting a windows machine. And maybe supporting WSL is enough.

I'm not sure I know enough to say yet. What does installing the Pyodide runtime entail? Where and how would it be exposed to the user?

Presumably it would be easier if uv python install knew how to install Pyodide, but perhaps in the short term it would make since to make an integration test that installs pyodide-build and have it install the Pyodide runtime for us.

Generally, it's fine to install it however a user would. We have integration tests that install various Python distributions already.

Sounds good. For #12731, I will make an integration test that installs the Pyodide runtime the normal way. We can discuss whether we want `uv python` to be able to install/run Pyodide later, after #12731 is merged.
