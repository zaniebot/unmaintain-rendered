# Deduplicate unnamed URL and editable URL parsing

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-31 13:40_

I think the requirements here are identical, but we have two totally separate paths for them (and now have some bugs for unnamed URLs that we already fixed for editables).

For example: `./scripts/packages/black_editable[colorama, uvloop]` doesn't work, but `-e ./scripts/packages/black_editable[colorama, uvloop]` does.
