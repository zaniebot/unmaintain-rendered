# Support `manylinux_x_y` in `--python-platform`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-10 16:23_

See: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4965.

This is a bit tricky because we still want great output in the `--help` menu and JSON schema, but it will no longer be static and I don't think we can use `ValueEnum` or other derives.

I think this was fixed per 7925d255f7de18cc0e658955a71f9f50bee6b32d ?

That added support for `manylinux_2_31` but not arbitrary `manylinux_x_y`.

Would you accept a PR that adds enumerations for the `manylinux` policies in [this table](https://github.com/mayeut/pep600_compliance?tab=readme-ov-file#acceptable-distros-to-build-wheels) just like what was done in #4965?

I understand it is not the general support for `manylinux_x_y` that this issue is about, but if you're okay with it, I'd be happy to make a PR.

Yeah that's fine, PR welcome.
