# Warn if a directory specified in `--index` exists but is empty

---

_Issue opened by @jtfmumm on 2025-06-09 16:21_

Currently, if a directory specified by `--index` for `uv add` is empty, uv will fall back to PyPI without warning the user. This is likely not what was intended so we should add a warning.
