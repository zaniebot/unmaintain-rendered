# `uv sync` twice tries to install to /usr/local/lib the second time

_Issue opened by @c0g on 2025-06-05 17:33_

### Summary

We have a fairly complex workspace repo so I'm struggling to find a minimal reproduce - doesn't reproduce with two sub-projects with cross-dependencies, also doesn't reproduce if I just copy the pyproject.toml skeleton from my project (e.g. remove all our code 😓). Will keep plugging away at re-producing in something I can share.

The very short is if I run `uv sync` once, it creates a .venv and works fine. If I run it again with a .venv in the directory, it tries to install into /usr and fails because I don't have write access into /usr.

I've attached log files of the first and second run. 

I ran a bisection and the problem seems to have been introduced in 0.6.4 -- it works fine on 0.6.0 - 0.6.3. I have logs from all installs during the bisection if those might be helpful. Also happy to run any other diagnosis commands.

Can you share the output of the following with the venv activated?
```
python -m sysconfig 2>/dev/null | head -14
``` 
How did you install the system Python interpreter?

Unfortunately I no longer have access to this system so can’t run the command. It was just the standard 3.10 python on Ubuntu 22.04.

I’ll close this since I can’t provide any more info. Sorry.
