# uvx run is trying to access file() but this is a Python 2 function

_Issue opened by @wsw70 on 2025-01-12 09:42_

I tried to run with `uvx` a simple script (`uv run` is fine):

```
PS C:\Users\yop\Perso\dev-perso\single obsidian daily manager> uvx run .\manage-daily.py
  × Failed to build `run==0.2`
  ├─▶ The build backend returned an error
  ╰─▶ Call to `setuptools.build_meta:__legacy__.build_wheel` failed (exit code: 1)

      [stderr]

      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
```

It seems that `uvx` is trying, at some point, to access `file()` but this is a Python 2 function (I use Python 3.12, where `open()` should be called instead).

I tried with `uvx --python 3.12`, same result.

uvx **run**?
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools

It's expected behavior given that you're using a package called "run" from PyPI.

My bad - I thought that `uvx` was to `uv` what `pythonw` is to `python` -- yes this is weird, in retrospective I do not know how I made the bridge in my head :)  Sorry for that!

Just as a note, this is a [build failure](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/build_failures/) — that error isn't from uv.
