# Please add the ability to  `uv pip install` for the global interpreter to speed up docker builds

_Issue opened by @dempstert on 2024-03-07 01:29_

Feature Request:
At the moment UV requires a virtualenv in order to install requirements.

In order to speed up docker builds, can we introduce the ability to run uv install and introduce requirements to the global interpreter?

I believe this is already possible. Have you tried running with the `--system` flag, as in `uv pip install --system`?
