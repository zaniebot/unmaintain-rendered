_Issue opened by @5hojib on 2025-02-16 15:45_

In my Ubuntu system, python3.13 and python3.13-nogil, python3.13-nogil can executable via python3, cause I have set symlink. When I use uv venv , it use python3.13, even if I try to install packages using --break-system-packages --system options, it install packages in python3.13, how can I python3.13-nogil environment?
