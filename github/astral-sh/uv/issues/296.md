# Add support for Git revision references in VCS URLs

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-11-02 18:12_

See: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support. We need to support, e.g., `MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject.git@v1.0`. I didn't realize that pip expects a different format here than Cargo, which uses query parameters.
