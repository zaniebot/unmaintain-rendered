# Feature request: `--dry-run` or something similiar for uv pip install 

---

_Issue opened by @notatallshaw on 2024-02-15 21:17_

I would like to test uv's ability to correctly resolve requirements, and in general it it sometimes useful to know how a package installer will install some requirements without actually installing them. An alternative to this would be `uv pip download` which is something I used to use a lot before `--dry-run` existed in Pip.

At the moment I am rebuilding my virtual environment each time. Maybe I am missing something and there is a supported workflow already?

Have you tried `uv pip compile`?

It can also read from stdin, e.g. `echo "black" | uv pip compile -`.
