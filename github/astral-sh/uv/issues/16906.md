# `invalid Zip archive: Duplicate filename` on duplicated `module-name`

---

_Issue opened by @Yamakaky on 2025-12-01 09:47_

### Summary

`uv init --lib test`

Edit `pyproject.toml`:
```
...
[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-name = ["test_lib", "test_lib"]
```

```
❯ uv build
Building source distribution (uv build backend)...
Building wheel from source distribution (uv build backend)...
  × Failed to build `/var/tmp/pote-lib`
  ├─▶ Failed to write wheel zip archive
  ╰─▶ invalid Zip archive: Duplicate filename
```

It took me some time to find the issue during an internal migration to uv. Printing the module name in the error message would greatly improve the experience. 

### Platform

Linux 6.8.0-47-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.9.11

### Python version

_No response_

We should probably just deduplicate the module name list

If we do this, we should also handle `foo` and `foo.bar` being in the same list.
