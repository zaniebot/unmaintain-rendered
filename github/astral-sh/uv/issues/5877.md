# Move "Searching for..." `python install` logging to verbose

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-07 17:08_

I think we should just show the progress bars here personally (by default).

I'm referring to the top part here:

```

Yes this is a little weird, but what if one of the versions is fulfilled already?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-08-07 17:27_

I guess we print

> Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.8.12
> Found existing installation for Python 3.8.12: cpython-3.8.12-macos-aarch64-none

I think we could just show the latter one, though I think both of these are basically debug logs and we should have some other indicator more consistent with the rest of our CLI that we found an existing version?

Hmm, we generally don't really show anything (e.g. in `uv pip install`) if a package is already satisfied.

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-08-07 17:48_

I think the "what satisfied this request" is a bit more complicated with Python versions than packages, but that is a fair point.

Also, it's a bit different in that we might read the versions from a `.python-version(s)` file and if we only display what we need to install how will you know which versions were checked?
