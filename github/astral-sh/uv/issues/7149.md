# Config and command to install dependencies with alternative package indexes

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
I'm using AWS CodeArtifact and I want to install all dependencies with an uv command — without running anything, just to have the dependencies available for my IDE after cloning the project —.

Currently, the only way I could find is to have a script (e.g. `install_requirements.sh`) in each project that would [export UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/alternative-indexes/#aws-codeartifact) (except that I personnally use the SSO profile with `--profile` option in AWS CLI), then run the `uv pip install` command.

Is there something planned to have something defined somewhere (e.g. some `uv` install hooks?) that would be automatically used by an `uv` command to install dependencies, without a custom script?
The idea is that, if someone wants to clone a repo to start working on it, there would be an official way to do that.

I think we'll be tackling this in #171 when we allow add index sources to the `pyproject.toml` directly, cc @charliermarsh
