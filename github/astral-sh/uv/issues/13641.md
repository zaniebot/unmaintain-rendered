# Allow names to be written for editable requirements

---

_Issue opened by @delfick on 2025-05-25 05:56_

### Summary

Hello,

I asked about this here https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3682#issuecomment-2820120902 but it seems that wasn't seen so I'm making it's own issue.

When using the compiled .txt as a constraints file it can't find the name of the editable package when it has the #egg= in it (i.e. `-e file:some-package#egg=some-package` doesn't work with error: Unnamed requirements are not allowed as constraints) but if I manually change it to `-e some-package @ file:some-package` then it does work.

Can `uv pip compile` be given a flag to allow this kind of output please?

### Example

_No response_

Can you use the editable as regular dependency? Using editables in constraints file would mean the constraint doesn't limit the resolution, but overrides it. By default, using a URL dependency (which includes files and git) will coerce all other requirements of the dependency to the version behind the URL, and this would be more explicit.

@konstin yeah, I agree it's a bit of a hack what I'm doing

Ultimately I'm kinda replicating a `workspace = true` uv source to make it so we don't need `PYTHONPATH` to have the code in the repo importable from the virtualenv we're in

(I'd love to switch to uv workspaces and also be using a uv.lock but that's much easier said than done in the repo I work on and we currently have our dependencies split across multiple `.in` files so that we don't have to install all of our 500+ dependencies for every job in CI)
