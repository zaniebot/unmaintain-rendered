# allow auth with headers

_Issue opened by @davidszotten on 2024-02-15 22:08_

would you be open to allowing passing auth headers, eg something along the lines of https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8042

Thanks for the request! I'm not sure when we'll be able to support this, but we will consider it.

For my own notes, xref to a "blocking" reason in `pip`: https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8078#issuecomment-657037943

yes it sounds like having this configured per _host as opposed to per _index is one solution to the security issue

We need this in pip, and I'd like to point out that different auth per-host is not enough - for git repositories it's quite likely that bearer tokens would be configured *per-repository*. If uv allowed this, we'd be switching right now.

We use a poetry plugin to do this today.  (concerned only with indexes, in reference to https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/8078#issuecomment-657037943).

A per host or per index option would make adopting `uv` over poetry very simple.

has anyone found a workaround for this by any chance?
