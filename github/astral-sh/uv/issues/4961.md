@zanieb what would be the difference between `--reinstall`  from the `force` arg?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-10 22:15_

Good question, defer to @zanieb... If nothing, though, we should consider removing `--force` and replacing it with `--reinstall`.

Wow that's a great question — I forgot how my own CLI works. I honestly don't see what `--force` does differently today. Maybe we'll want `--force` to work similar to how it does in `uv tool install` once we install shim (or similar) for Python but we don't support that yet and I'm not sure what it will look like. Seems like we should just rename it!

I'll go for renaming then, thanks!
