# Missing .gitignore in projects.md documentation

---

_Issue opened by @AbhiUpadhye on 2025-05-24 16:27_

### Question

Hi team,

When we create project using uv init there is a .gitignore file that is created but documentation does not reflect it.
Location: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/5b25e896b5a68daf2420ae71c6dbf0a0c3aeddc5/docs/guides/projects.md?plain=1#L33

I think adding this would help users understand.
Can it be added to docs of projects.md file?
If helpful, I'm happy to open a pull request with the update!

Thanks for the great project!

The `.python-version` file is explained in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/

Feel free to put up a PR adding the `.gitignore` to that list, thanks!
