# uv GitHub actions on a server by SSH, not on the runner

---

_Issue opened by @bolinocroustibat on 2024-09-16 12:51_

Is there a way to run the [uv GitHub actions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/) on a server accessible by SSH, instead of running them on the GitHub Actions runner?

If not, is it recommended to install uv on a production server, so that it speeds up deployments installs?

I would recommend doing this! There's no reason to use the GitHub action if you're not on GitHub Actions.
