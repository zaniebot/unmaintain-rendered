Hi,
Is it possible to add the :

Thank you.

👍 I believe this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/313. (We do support `flask @ git+https://github.com/pallets/flask.git@refs/pull/5313/head`, but we currently require the `flask @`.)

This is supported as of `v0.1.24`. You can `uv pip install git+ssh://...` directly, without including a package name.
