# `XDG_BIN_HOME` common default not used

---

_Issue opened by @thernstig on 2024-09-02 12:44_

In case someone has not set `XDG_BIN_HOME`, it installs into `~/.cargo/bin/` on Linux.

A common convention is however to install into `$HOME/.local/bin`. Example: https://gist.github.com/roalcantara/107ba66dfa3b9d023ac9329e639bc58c

The benefit is of course the same as with anything else for the XDG spec. It keeps the home dir clutter free.

I think we intend to change the install directory, but it's something of a breaking change so may come in a minor release.

I am trying to introduce uv into an organization, due to that it obviously is far superior to anything else for anyone who has followed the Python echo system for years. Though I know some developers will frown about creation of directories in the root of the home dir, so this change is, believe it or not, something I will want to wait for. Some devs can be pretty adamant about minor things 😄
