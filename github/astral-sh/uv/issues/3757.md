# Add changeset detection to CI

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-22 18:55_

We do this in CI, at least to avoid running tests etc. for documentation changes. Some small wins here.

Example from Ruff: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/573facd2bad5d43abed7c9da903f9cf243d29d58/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L22
