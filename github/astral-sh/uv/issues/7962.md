# Instal via brew results in an outdated/old version (i.e. 0.1.xx)

_Issue opened by @mgiugliano on 2024-10-07 09:09_

On my mac (M3, Sonoma, 14.6.1 (23G93)), typing 

```brew install uv```

does install uv but an old version (0.1.xx).
As an absolute beginner of uv, typing 
```uv init example```

returns an error (unknown command 'init').

The install via curl results in version 0.4.18 and "init" is now a command of uv.

I see 0.4.19 here: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/uv

I'm not sure what's going on there. Maybe you had an old uv installed somewhere else?

@charliermarsh I did see (on the brew formula website) mention to the last version of uv but that was not what it was installed. It was my first install ever of uv. I nonetheless resorted to other installation method.
