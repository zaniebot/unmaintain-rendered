# uv add torch very slow

---

_Issue opened by @Youjin1985 on 2025-04-10 01:57_

### Summary

My uv version is 0.6.3 in Windows
‘uv add torch’ downloads torch extremely slow

I've seen this issue https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5073 and having most recent version does not help.
pip downloads are fast, uv downloads are extremely slow


Please tell what kind of logs can I provide so you can investigate this further?

### Platform

Windows 11 24H2 

### Version

uv 0.6.3 (a0b9f22a2 2025-02-14)

### Python version

python 3.13.2

How many seconds do `pip install torch` and `uv pip install torch` take, and how fast is your internet connection? Are you setting any caching options for pip or uv?

I cannot reproduce it on Windows now, but on Macos in same network it is installed fast (in about one minute - both with uv and pip), so, I think problem is in Windows. I will post again when I have access to original Windows environment where the problem was.
