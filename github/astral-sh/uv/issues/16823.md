# uv installs and uninstalls yggdrasil-engine==1.0.0 during each sync

---

_Issue opened by @ErliSoares on 2025-11-23 15:29_

### Summary

Whenever I synchronize the project with the dependency `yggdrasil-engine==1.0.0`, `uv` uninstalls and reinstalls it.

Result of the `uv sync --verbose` command:

Sorry if this isn't a problem with `uv`, I wasn't sure whether to post the issue here or on [yggdrasil-engine](https://github.com/Unleash/yggdrasil-bindings/tree/main/python-engine).

Hm this does seem off, thanks for the report! cc @konstin

I think this is because the `WHEEL` file included in the wheel reports `py3-abi3-macosx_11_0_arm64`, but the actual wheel tag is, like, `cp39-abi3-macosx_11_0_arm64`. I don't think we include `py3-abi3-{platform}` in the set of supported tags.

(That mismatch represents a bug in `yggdrasil-engine`, though not clear to me yet if we should accept `py3-abi3-macosx_11_0_arm64` too.)

From reading https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/f215c5e5175dc6deda4535a7c5bee010c4a9f002/src/pip/_vendor/packaging/tags.py, I don't think pip accepts that tag either. So it seems like we shouldn't?

That's a bug in their build system, you can see the mismatch between `WHEEL` tag and tag on the wheel file at https://inspector.pypi.io/project/yggdrasil-engine/1.0.0/packages/8a/b6/d28ae545685159c1747a420e6c628b4566b8f2162448e7d36ee3da38958c/yggdrasil_engine-1.0.0-cp313-abi3-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl/yggdrasil_engine-1.0.0.dist-info/WHEEL#line.4
