# Ability to specify package data to be included in distributed package

---

_Issue opened by @butterlyn on 2024-10-20 13:30_

Ability to specify package data to be included in the distribute package built with `uv`.

Equivalent within setuptools: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html#package-data
Equivalent within Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#include-and-exclude

This is controlled by your build-backend. uv currently defaults to `hatchling` and if that's what you're using, you can configure it via https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#file-selection
