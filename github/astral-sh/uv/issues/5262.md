# docs(style): Navigation bar is not properly covered by the footer

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-21 17:30_

Not only does the navigation text obscure some of the footer text, the navigation links are responsive through the footer.

Do you think you should report this upstream? I don't think we do anything custom here.

Probably — just noting it for now before investigating.

_Comment by @zanieb on 2024-07-22 23:15_

I can't reproduce this now. Can you?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-22 23:41_

I don't see it, no.
