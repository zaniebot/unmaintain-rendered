# No clear way to upgrade transitive dependency using uv

---

_Issue opened by @mesropt on 2025-06-23 10:49_

I have a primary dependency `python-pptx~=1.0.2`, which has a transitive dependency on `xlsxwriter==3.2.3` and which is currently yanked, so I want it to be upgraded.

Both `python-pptx` and `xlsxwriter==3.2.3` are locked in my `uv.lock` file.

How can I upgrade `python-pptx`'s transitive dependencies to the latest versions? I tried `uv add python-pptx~=1.0.2 --upgrade-package python-pptx` but it doesn't upgrade the transitive dependencies of python-pptx.

What about:

```
uv lock --upgrade-package xlsxwriter
```

I want to upgrade all transitive dependencies of a package without having to specify them explicitly.

Running `uv remove python-pptx` and then `uv add "python-pptx~=1.0.2"` does result in the desired upgrade of transitive dependencies, but I’m wondering if there is a simpler or more idiomatic way to achieve this.

No, currently we don't have a way to specifically select the transitive dependencies of a specific package for upgrade. There are options to update a specific package, all packages or, with external services such as dependabot and renovate, update each updateable package separately.

That makes sense now. Thanks for the clarification!
