# Warn on ignored `[sources]` in `uv.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-07-16 13:29_

I thought we already warned for ignored `uv.toml` fields, but given:

```toml
[sources]
anyio = { git = "https://github.com/agronholm/anyio" }
```

Then `uv add anyio --config-file ../uv.toml` doesn't warn.
