# Download Progress Bar for Large Files

---

_Issue opened by @AidinHamedi on 2024-03-26 09:54_

I would like to request a feature for the `uv` package: a download progress bar for large files during installation. This would enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback on the download status, especially when installing sizable packages like `torch` using the command `uv pip install torch`.

I'm open to something like this but we need it to work with highly concurrent downloads.
