# How to set the UV's python as default python binary?

---

_Issue opened by @gphg on 2025-02-05 12:17_

### Question

The project is great. I want this as substitution for `python` as shell default, by following method:
```sh
# Normally this is on .bashrc or .zshrc
alias python="uv run"
```

This is the user level: between project and root-ish.

# The question is: Is that method approved?
I can't think any better. Perhaps the developers or ones that has more experiences has way better solutions?

### Platform

MINGW64_NT-10.0-19045 3.5.4-395fda67.x86_64 x86_64 Msys

### Version

uv 0.5.28 (ee2bdc21f 2025-02-04)

There's https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#installing-python-executables but that's different, we don't have a `uv run` equivalent for `python`. We may someday, but it's controversial :)

Tested and it works on Windows too! All I have to do is add `~/.local/bin` or `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` into `%PATH`.
