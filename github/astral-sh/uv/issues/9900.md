# Feature Request: Command to Install All Dependencies Listed in pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @dimanu-py on 2024-12-14 22:30_

I've been using uv and really enjoy it, but I've noticed a missing feature that other package managers like pdm provide: a command to install all the dependencies listed in the pyproject.toml file.

When I clone a project, the first step is usually installing all dependencies. With pdm, for example, I can simply run `pdm install`, and it automatically creates a virtual environment and installs all the required dependencies. Additionally, this can be filtered to install only specific types of dependencies (e.g., production, dev).

I was expecting a similar feature in uv, but I couldn't find a way to install all dependencies directly from the pyproject.toml file. Having such a command would make project setup much easier and faster.

I think adding this command would improve the user experience for managing dependencies in projects.

Thank you for considering this!

Are you looking for `uv sync`, maybe?

@charliermarsh I believed so when reading the documentation. But after some tries I didn't manage to make it work as I expected, thus I open the issue.

Maybe I am using it wrong, this is what I tried:
- Clone a one of repositories that was setup with uv and had some dependencies:
    <details><summary>Current pyproject.toml file here</summary>

    ```text
      [project]
      name = "python-template"
      version = "0.1.0"
      description = "Python template for projects"
      readme = "README.md"
      requires-python = ">=3.12"
      dependencies = []
      
      [dependency-groups]
      test = [
          "coverage>=7.6.9",
          "doublex>=1.9.6.1",
          "doublex-expects>=0.7.1",
          "expects>=0.9.0",
          "pytest>=8.3.4",
          "pytest-watch>=4.2.0",
          "pytest-xdist>=3.6.1",
      ]
      lint = [
          "mypy>=1.13.0",
          "ruff>=0.8.3",
          "yapf>=0.43.0",
      ]
     ```
- Go to the folder in my terminal, no .venv folder is yet created
- Run `uv sync`
- The virtual environment gets created, but no dependencies are install

`dependency-groups` are not included by default, you should try `uv sync --all-groups`

Or, change your `default-groups` declaration.

@j178 thanks for the help, that tag fixed the problem.

Turns out that with the version I was using that command didn't exist and had to upgrade uv 👍
