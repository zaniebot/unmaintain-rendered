# Support `--seed-packages` in `puffin venv`

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-01-09 17:37_

It should be opt-in since we don't need it for Puffin itself, only if you want to use Puffin _just_ for virtualenv creation in other contexts.

The option is a shortcut for `puffin venv && puffin pip-install pip wheel setuptools`.
