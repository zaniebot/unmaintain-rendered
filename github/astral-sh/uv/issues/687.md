# Should we show absolute or verbatim URLs for editable installs?

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-18 15:48_

Right now, we show the verbatim URL in the installation recap.

What's the difference? :)

Right now, we show `black @ ../black`, instead of like `black @ /Users/crmarsh/workspace/black`.

I think we should always show the resolved url in the messages, to disambiguate what is happening. Sometimes (e.g. when running through an ide) the current dir or the set of env vars can be unclear, plus you often get clickable links with full urls. We should especially make sure we show the resolved url in error messages.

I think resolved makes sense to me!
