# could you use releases rather than git hashes for Cargo.toml deps?

---

_Issue opened by @sthen on 2025-10-19 10:33_

### Summary

Providing OS packages for uv (and also ruff) is rather painful because in many cases, builds must be done without network access.

The current situation where rs-async-zip, pubgrub, reqwest-middleware, etc are fetched from github using hashes means that they need patching to use a separately downloaded checkout. e.g. https://github.com/openbsd/ports/blob/master/devel/uv/patches/patch-Cargo_toml

Please would it be possible to stick to tagged releases instead?

### Example

_No response_
