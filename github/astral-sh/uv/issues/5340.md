# Should `uv init` write an empty `dev-dependencies` section?

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-23 15:55_

It seems noisy, the user can add this with `uv add --dev foo`?

```
❯ uv init
warning: `uv init` is experimental and may change without warning
Initialized project example

❯ cat pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "example"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
dependencies = []

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = []
```

I'm fine either way.

It seems weird to write a non-standard entry by default if it's empty. I'd prefer to omit it.

Looks like the PR didn't get picked up by GitHub's thingy, this should probably be closed :smile:
