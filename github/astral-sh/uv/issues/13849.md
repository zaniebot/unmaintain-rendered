# uv installed python3.9.7's python3-config won't run

---

_Issue opened by @krupan on 2025-06-04 19:39_

### Summary

The version of python3.9.7 that uv installed under my `~/.local/share/uv/python` directory comes with a python3-config shell script and the first line of that shell script is this:

```
"exec" "$(dirname $0)/python3.9" "$0" "$@"
```
Which basically says, run this script with the python interpreter.  However, the rest of the script is in shell syntax, not python, so it errors out with a syntax error.

I tried a python 3.9.0 installed by uv and the python3-config does not have that line.

I have built python 3.9.7 from source and the included python3-config also does not have that line in it.

### Platform

archlinux, Rocky Linux 9

### Version

0.6.17 and 0.7.8

### Python version

Python 3.9.7
