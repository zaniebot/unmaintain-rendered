# Gitlab CI example should quote varaibles to avoid version parsing as integer

---

_Issue opened by @AKuederle on 2025-05-27 11:45_

### Summary

In the Gitlab CI example (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/gitlab/) the variables are not quoted and hence, parsed as integers. This causes issues with version numbers with trailing 0 (e.g. Python 3.10, or a future uv 0.10), as the 0 is removed in the when inserted into the template string.

Currently:

```
variables:
  UV_VERSION: 0.5
  PYTHON_VERSION: 3.12
```

Save version:


```
variables:
  UV_VERSION: "0.5"
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.12"
```

### Platform

Linux

### Version

0.7

### Python version

all Python
