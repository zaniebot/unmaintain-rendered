# Pyproject.toml - deprecated fields, "uv pip install" fails while "pip install" not

---

_Issue opened by @chemelli74 on 2025-07-22 15:49_

### Summary

Trying to install a PR via "uv pip install" fails:

while using just "pip install" not.

Something I'm missing or uv needs a dependency update ?


### Platform

Linux Alpine v3.21.3

### Version

uv 0.7.1

### Python version

Python 3.13.3

This is an error from the Poetry build backend, which that package is using — not uv. It seems like a problem with that package?

I bet the version used is <2.0 and is 2.0 that deprecated some fields and moved them around in pyproject

Just as further reference:

I was pointed to my pyproject build system setting:

```
[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
```

Updating to

`requires = ["poetry-core>=2.0"]`

kinda of works, but it needs `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match`

What's your index configuration look like?

If you're using an index without the Poetry version you need, it makes sense you need to use `unsafe-best-match`. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#packages-that-exist-on-multiple-indexes
