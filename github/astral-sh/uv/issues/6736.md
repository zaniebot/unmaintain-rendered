# Need to activate venv for nvim to recognize venv

---

_Issue opened by @AlphaSeekr on 2024-08-28 01:55_

Nvim doesn't recognize venv unless it is explicitly activated. Is this an expected behaviour?

Hi! We'll need way more details to help out here. This sounds like a nvim configuration problem?

I am using lazyvim config.  code completion doesn't recognize packages I have added. If I activate venv explicitly then it works.  Not sure what other info do you need.

@pdadi74 I think this is the default behavior for most IDEs.  Check out [venom](https://github.com/rafi/neoconf-venom.nvim) for automatic venv discovery with python.
