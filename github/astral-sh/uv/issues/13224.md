These are a part of the `cargo-dist` installer, which is why they're generic.

We definitely could make them "branded" if it's important.

I believe a few of these were originally intended as debugging/testing options, but they ended up being useful for particular workflows people had.

I'd prefer not to leak the uv vs cargo-dist distinction the user, cargo-dist should be an implementation detail while the installer looks like a part of uv proper.

I think this is more of a "fix it when we move off cargo-dist" thing, than something we should invest in before then.

I'm a fan of renaming this for the same reasons that @konstin mentioned.
