# `uv sync` is installing dev-dependencies.

---

_Issue opened by @pspino on 2025-08-04 20:51_

### Summary

I have the following pyproject.toml:

```
dependencies = [
    "fastapi",
    "uvicorn",
    "pydantic",
    "pandas==2.3",
    "pyyaml==6.0.2",
    "spacy==3.8.7",
    "torch==2.7.0"
]

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "pytest==8.4.0",
]
```

when I do `uv sync`, I noticed that `pytest==8.4.0` was installed along with the other dependencies. This should not have happen since it is located in the dev-dependencies.

If I am not mistaken, the `--dev` option is there to properly install those dev-dependencies.

I have uploaded the dump from `uv sync --dry-run -v` for reference.

This is intentional, as documented at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/#syncing-development-dependencies and https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#default-groups

then this part should be updated in the documentation -> https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--all-groups
This implies that not all groups are to be sync be default

thank you for your time !

We don't sync all groups by default. See the documentation I linked please.
