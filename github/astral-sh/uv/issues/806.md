# Improve `requires-python` incompatibility message

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-01-05 22:20_

e.g. in the following test case

https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/blob/88adba83a01357dec22bc7e2a0d79ab53e589d5c/crates/puffin-cli/tests/pip_install_scenarios.rs#L2232-L2233

we say "there is no version of Python available matching >=3.10" but there may be such a Python version available we are just not resolving with it. We should adjust the language to be more correct, include a note about the current Python version, and perhaps hint at resolving with another Python version in `pip-compile` cases?
