# uv pip install does not respect the python version specified in pyproject.toml

_Issue opened by @Julfried on 2025-02-14 11:29_

### Summary

I recently encountered an issue when installing one of my wheel files using `uv pip install`. In the `pyproject.toml` file I specified: `requires-python = ">=3.10, <3.13"`

However when I try to install the wheel file in a venv with python version 3.13, it just installs with no warning. Pip on the other hand aborts installation and emits an error message: `ERROR: Package 'uv-test' requires a different Python: 3.13.2 not in '<3.13,>=3.10'`.

A minimal working example. Create a new folder:

1. Run: `uv init`
2. Run uv venv --python 3.13
3. Change the python version in `pyproject.toml` to: `requires-python = ">=3.10, <3.13"`
4. Run uv pip install .

### Platform

Windows 10

### Version

0.5.31 (e38ac4900 2025-02-12)

### Python version

3.13.2

I believe this is a side-effect of us ignoring upper bounds on Python versions https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/resolver-internals/#requires-python

Does it fail if the virtual environment is below the range?

Indeed, with python 3.9 it emits an appropriate error message:
```
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because the current Python version (3.9.21) does not satisfy Python>=3.10,<3.13 and test-uv==0.1.0 depends on
      Python>=3.10,<3.13, we can conclude that test-uv==0.1.0 cannot be used.
      And because only test-uv==0.1.0 is available and you require test-uv, we can conclude that your requirements are
      unsatisfiable
```
Would it be possible for uv to at least emit a warning in such cases? This could help avoid unexpected behavior for users who want to use uv as a drop in replacement for pip?
