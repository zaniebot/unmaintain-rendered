# uv pip compile with --find-links and --generate-hashes does not generate hashes for wheels (.whl)

_Issue opened by @mescanne on 2024-05-28 08:46_

Working with uv and pip-compile I've noticed that pip-compile will generate a hash from the .whl file (found using -f), while uv pip compile will not include the hash from whl.

I'm happy to provide a more detailed example if it's useful.

Thanks!
