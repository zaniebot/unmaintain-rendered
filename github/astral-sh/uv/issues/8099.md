# `uv init` should generate a skeleton test suite

---

_Issue opened by @paveldikov on 2024-10-10 16:09_

What it says on the tin, really. Just like we have `src/myproj/__init__.py::hello()`, why not also have `tests/test_placeholder.py::test_hello()` and maybe even `tests/conftest.py`?

I don't know if we want to select a test framework yet.

No need to import anything, maybe just generate the `tests` folder and `test_hello.py` with a docstring in the file.

This should be the same whether someone was using pytest or unittest.

I think this might be better suited as an **opt-in** configuration in user level uv.toml (See: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8098) with the default behaviour being no skeleton test suite.

Agree with @chrisrodrigue, and that is what I had in mind.

Although `uv` may well want to ship its own test framework implementation in future, realistically test case _discovery_ is a pretty ossified interface -- I can't imagine a new test framework implementing something that is radically different from `pytest`. (excluding `pytest`-isms such as fixtures, parametrize [sic], etc. In any case the aim here is to give people a fundamental setup for simple 'run `hello()` and `assert` test cases, and they can grow the complexity however they see fit)

I started playing around with `uv` today as we are currently evaluating to make the switch from `poetry` to `uv` in our project.  

I've played around with the different `uv init` options and was missing the `tests` folder or basically a equivalent folder structure of what i get from poetry:

```shell
❯ poetry new --src foobar-delete-later
Created package foobar_delete_later in foobar-delete-later
❯ tree foobar-delete-later
foobar-delete-later
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── src
│   └── foobar_delete_later
│       └── __init__.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py 
```

It would be nice to just add a tests/__init__.py as we probably can agree, that we all implement unit tests regardless of which framework we implement them in
