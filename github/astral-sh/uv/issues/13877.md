# [Question] Where does uv install python

---

_Issue opened by @monchin on 2025-06-06 03:32_

### Question

I noticed that [the comments](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0.7.11/crates/uv-cli/src/lib.rs#L4757-L4766) shows where uv install python by `uv python install`, and I just want to ensure whether I'm right

1. If env var `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` is set, install python under `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`;
2. If  `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` not set, then check if env var `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set. If it is set, install python under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/uv/python`;
3.  If `XDG_DATA_HOME` is not set either, install python under `$HOME/.local/share/uv/python` on Unix and `%APPDATA%\uv\data\python` on Windows

Could anyone tell me if I'm understanding correctly? It should be `$UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` rather than `$UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR/uv/python`, right?

And I found it seems that the default installation path on windows should be `%APPDATA%\uv\python` according to my own windows PC's result, please check whether the comment is wrong.

That sounds correct. An easy test is:

```
❯ uv python dir
/Users/zb/.local/share/uv/python
❯ UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/tmp/foo uv python dir
/tmp/foo
❯ XDG_DATA_HOME=/tmp/foo uv python dir
/tmp/foo/uv/python
```

Thank you very much! And seems comments about windows path is wrong, please confirm it.
