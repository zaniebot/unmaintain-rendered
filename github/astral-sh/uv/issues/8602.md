# `uv pip install -e .` Editable install at src/ level, not project root

_Issue opened by @mychiffonn on 2024-10-27 05:07_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
Probably a question, since I'm new to `uv` moving from `pip`.

 Usually I do `pip install -e .` so that I could import things across modules. `pip` install `.egg-info` at the project root. However, `uv pip install -e.` installs at `src/` level. I need access to folders with Python code that are sibling-level with `src` for modules inside `src`
 
My issue would be resolved if either of the following is achieved:
- A way to mirror `pip` behavior to install at the project root
- A way to access sibling directories of `src`

`uv pip install -e .` and `pip install -e .` should be equivalent. Can you provide a bit more context on your situation? Like, are you creating a new project or working on some existing project?

I'm working on a project [here](https://github.com/chiffonng/capstone), but a minimum example would be:
1. Working on an existing project (with .python-version, pyproject.toml and `src/`; `uv` is installed globally)
2. This workflow was executed at the project root

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml -e .
uv sync
```
and `uv` install `.egg-info` inside `src/`. I confirmed that `pip` install `.egg-info` at project root level.

## Project structure:
```
project/
------ data/
------ src/
----------- dir1/
------------------ module1.py
----------- module2.py
------ pyproject.toml
------ .python-version
------ uv.lock
```

With the current status with `uv`, `src` is not available as a path/dir to import. For example, in module2, I have to do `from dir1.module1 import ....` instead of  `from src.dir1.module1 import ....`

## Other information
- OS: MacOS Sonoma 14.7
- uv: 0.4.27 (36b729e92 2024-10-25)
- `project/src/project-egg.info/SOURCES.txt` includes `src/` paths

```
LICENSE
README.md
pyproject.toml
src/__init__.py
src/module2.py
src/dir1/__init__.py
src/dir1/module1.py
```

I believe `uv sync` will remove the installation you did with `uv pip install` because your project is not setup to be "packaged" by uv. You should define a build system or set `tool.uv.package = true` per https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#build-systems

Generally, I would not recommend mixing `uv sync` and `uv pip install`.
