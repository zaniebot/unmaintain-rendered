# Increase or adjust scope of default HTTP timeout

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-23 17:07_

Our current HTTP timeout is not sufficient for some large packages e.g. `torch`

- #1920 
- #1912 

Increasing the timeout has a downside for people that have network problems while downloading smaller packages, e.g. it will wait longer before surfacing a problem.

What does pip use for a default timeout?

I would expect that a server only sends an HTTP Timeout response if the connection is idle for too long, which makes me wonder if increasing the timeout solves the problem or only hides the root cause.

Yeah good point, I wonder if we're setting the wrong timeout? We shouldn't be enforcing this timeout when data transfer is actively occurring.

FWIW the default in PIP is 15 seconds https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/main/src/pip/_internal/cli/cmdoptions.py#L294, so I'm not sure uv's 30? second default is at fault.

Could it be that we need to reduce the number of parallel requests? It could also be that they timeout because some cpu intensive task is blocking the main thread, esp. with something large like pytorch.

It seems like the next steps are to:

1. Determine what exactly the timeout we are configuring applies to
2. Create a simple MRE
3. Determine what is happening with the request when the error is raised

See https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2237

It looks like we're using a deadline for the full request not a read timeout as desired. We need this functionality to be added upstream.

Hi @zanieb! When can we expect this to be fixed? 


`huggingface/datasets` CI is quite consistently failing because of this issue (I'd assume) as of yesterday (e.g., check the "Install dependencies" step of [this](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/actions/runs/8692786216/job/23838173446) CI run).

@mariosasko - How often are you seeing this? We'll ship the HTTP timeout change soon (this week for sure), but I'm still wondering if there's something else going on here and would use `huggingface/datasets` to investigate if it's at least somewhat frequent.

---

_Comment by @mariosasko on 2024-04-16 01:04_

@charliermarsh It's pretty consistent, e.g., see the first two commit's CI runs in https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/6811 (it's more likely to happen than not based on recent CI runs). 

PS: Not sure if this info is valuable, but both Windows and Ubuntu GH runners are susceptible to this issue

OK thanks. I'm gonna do some testing using that CI workflow.

So the first issue I ran into is that Windows sometimes fails with pytest missing, because the "Install dependencies" step silently fails:

```

```

We can make that _not_ silent by changing the shell configuration (so that it exits as soon as one command fails, rather than proceeding). But I'm not sure why it's failing in the first place. 503 hitting that static endpoint?
