# `uv init` fails when path contains non-ASCII characters

---

_Issue opened by @zsdadisscy on 2025-10-24 08:35_

### Summary

When I try to create a virtual environment in my path, uv throws an error because the path contains non-English characters. I hope uv can support more characters. 
Sincerely thank you for considering this suggestion.

Can you share a reproducible example? uv does support non-ASCII paths, but it requires that package and extra names follow the rules from the PEPs, but that shouldn't restrict your paths.

I'm so sorry. I figured out the problem. My path contained non-ASCII characters, and when I used uv init , it was written to pyproject.toml , which violated the rules. I've since used uv venv instead.
I'm so sorry I filed this issue without much research and wasted your valuable time.

Oh that's a bug actually, uv init should not do that:

```
$ mkdir püthon
$ cd püthon/
$ uv init 
error: Not a valid package or extra name: "püthon". Names must start and end with a letter or digit and may only contain -, _, ., and alphanumeric characters.
```

We should at least show a better error message.

Thank you for your careful observation, UV will become better because of you

@konstin -- What improvement do you want to make to the error message? Tell them to provide a different name?

---

_Comment by @konstin on 2025-10-29 11:50_

Something like this:

```
error: The current directory (`püthon`) is not a valid package name. Please provide a package name with with `--name`
```
