# `uv self update` should support `--dry-run`

---

_Issue opened by @jmknoble on 2024-12-12 00:04_

I want `uv` to tell me whether it thinks it needs an update, before I actually tell it to update.

The most straightforward pattern for this would seem to be supporting `--dry-run` (which `uv lock` already supports).  `uv self update` doen't currently support that:

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.5.7 (3ca155ddd 2024-12-06)
$ uv self update --dry-run
error: unexpected argument '--dry-run' found

  tip: to pass '--dry-run' as a value, use '-- --dry-run'

Usage: uv self update [OPTIONS] [TARGET_VERSION]

For more information, try '--help'.
$ uv --dry-run self update
error: unexpected argument '--dry-run' found

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
$ 
```

Possible alternatives:

- `uv self list-updates` (clunky?)
- `uv self update list` (ripe for human error)
- `uv self update --list` (ditto)
- `uv self list` (better, more like `uv python list`, may need `uv self install` too? (and maybe `uv python update` should be a command as well?))
- `uv self versions` (different name, same action as `uv self list`, no real precedent though)

Makes sense, I honestly thought this existed.

I started looking into this. Unfortunately `fetch_release` is not public (https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/blob/1ce5efa7b73e16437bc757c6ca21963ddf18fc45/axoupdater/src/release/mod.rs#L91) and `is_update_needed` only returns a `bool` (https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/blob/1ce5efa7b73e16437bc757c6ca21963ddf18fc45/axoupdater/src/lib.rs#L302) so we can't say what version we'll update to. But... better than nothing.
