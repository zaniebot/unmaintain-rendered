# `uv run <script>` ignores inline script metadata for scripts with no file extension

---

_Issue opened by @Julian on 2024-11-27 19:45_

PEP 722 inline script metadata seems like it's ignored if the script does not have a `.py` file extension. Here's a short reproduction, showing it doesn't work :

```
⊙  chmod +x; cat foo
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "jsonschema",
# ]
# ///
import jsonschema

~/Desktop 
⊙  uv run ./foo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/julian/Desktop/./foo", line 8, in <module>
    import jsonschema
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jsonschema'

~/Desktop 
⊙  mv foo foo.py

~/Desktop 
⊙  uv run ./foo.py
Reading inline script metadata from `./foo.py`
Installed 5 packages in 16ms
```

`uv run --script` should cover this, see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7396.

Aha. Thanks for the link, that does seem to do it. Though I guess it seems a bit confusing to me at first glance (specifically I'd have expected separate commands for `uv run <command>` and `uv run <somefile>` so that it's never ambiguous which is meant, and the extra argument then wouldn't be needed. But closing, as indeed that works.
