# minor inconsistent formatting of version specifiers with `uv add`

_Issue opened by @ChannyClaus on 2024-08-21 23:28_

say you have a `pyproject.toml` that looks like the below:
```
[project]
name = "formatting"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "numpy >=2"
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
which, looks a bit off with the space between `numpy` and `>=2`. if you run `uv add 'pandas>=2'` on this, you get:
```
[project]
name = "formatting"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "numpy >=2",
    "pandas>=2",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
it would be nice if `uv` formats the dependencies here consistently.
