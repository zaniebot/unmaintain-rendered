# Feature request: `uv describe` showing metadata and entry points of any pypi package.

---

_Issue opened by @zsimic on 2024-08-12 14:30_

It would be great if `uv` provided a command that could briefly describe any pypi package reference, similar to `uv pip show`, but virtual environment agnostic. The entry points of the package (when present) should be shown, this would be awesome info for tools such as `pickley`.

The fields shown would be similar to `uv pip show`, with no `Location:` nor `Required-By:` (since those are venv-specific). I propose showing the following fields:

- `Name`: canonical pypi package name
- `Version`: the version the pypi reference resolved to (latest by default)
- `Summary`: the one-liner summary from pypi package metadata
- `Requires-Python`: if defined, the minimum python (as stated in package metadata)
- `Requires`: from metadata `Requires-Dist:` (similar to `uv pip show`), optional
- `Entry-Points`: packages declared console entry points (when present)

Additionally, a `--format json` output would be supported as well.

Some example runs would be:

```
~: uv describe cowsay
Name: cowsay
Version: 6.1
Summary: The famous cowsay for GNU/Linux is now available for python
Requires-Python: >=3.8
Requires:
Entry-Points: cowsay
```

Similarly for:
- `uv describe https://github.com/VaasuDevanS/cowsay-python.git`
- or `uv describe cowsay~=6.0`

Example with multiple entry points:

```
~: uv describe awscli
Name: awscli
Version: 1.33.40
Summary: Universal Command Line Environment for AWS.
Requires-Python: >=3.8
Requires: botocore, colorama, docutils, pyyaml, rsa, s3transfer
Entry-Points: aws, aws.cmd, aws_bash_completer, aws_completer, aws_zsh_completer.sh
```

Example output for a library (that has no entry points), the `Entry-Points:` field could be shown either empty, or missing altogether (probably cleaner if missing altogether)

```
~: uv describe requests
Name: requests
Version: 2.32.3
Summary: Python HTTP for Humans.
Requires-Python: >=3.8
Requires: certifi, charset-normalizer, idna, urllib3
```

Console scripts aren't the only "entry points". If this is implemented in some form (yes, please :D), then please show all entry points, for _all_ entry point groups, that the package might provide. Regular old `pip` already does this. `pip show -v black` (though I don't use `black` these days) provides a good example of the info that should be exposed (entry point group names, entry point names, where each one points, what extras each depends on if any):
```
> pip show -v black
...
Entry-points:
  [console_scripts]
  black = black:patched_main
  blackd = blackd:patched_main [d]
  
  [validate_pyproject.tool_schema]
  black = black.schema:get_schema
...
```

Any pytest plugin also serves as a good example of a non-console-script entry point.
