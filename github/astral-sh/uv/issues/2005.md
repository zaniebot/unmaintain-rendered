<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
The command `uv pip list` **when run outside of a virtual environment** _or conda installation_ does not list any system level packages.
```
$ uv pip list
error: Failed to locate a virtualenv or Conda environment (checked: `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `CONDA_PREFIX`, and `.venv`). Run `uv venv` to create a virtualenv.
```
Platform: Windows 11 (64 bit)
Version: uv 0.1.11 (32e5cacdd 2024-02-26)

Yeah, we now have the capability to list packages in a system environment, so we can support this.
