# How can I run custom scripts like npm run dev with uv?

_Issue opened by @HateRainbow on 2025-03-27 22:07_

Hello,

I'm currently working with the uv package and I'm trying to replicate functionality similar to npm run dev in a Node.js environment. Specifically, I want to define and run custom scripts from my pyproject.toml file, similar to how you would use npm run to execute commands line that you don't have to re-write in a JavaScript project.

Looks like you want #5903.
