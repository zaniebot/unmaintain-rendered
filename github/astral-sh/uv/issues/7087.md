# Poetry's lock file compatibility

---

_Issue opened by @skhaz on 2024-09-05 15:34_

Recently, I noticed that support for adding dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file was added, which is excellent, thank you very much.

However, in almost all the projects I work on, and there are quite a few, we use Poetry.

For example, I could install with UV and add the `uv.lock` file to Git, but the other team members are not interested (no way) in migrating to UV.

That said, the only way I could use UV professionally would be if UV, for example, gave up its own lock file and had a compatibility layer with Poetry.

Or even better, if someone created a PEP to specify a lock file for everyone to use, since it seems that just having the dependencies in `pyproject.toml` doesn’t seem to be enough.

What do you think?

Sounds like you're looking for https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/

It's in progress and we're engaging heavily.

We won't be supporting Poetry's format though.

That PEP sounds great to me. Poetry is very slow, and having this compatibility between teams would be fantastic. Thank you.
