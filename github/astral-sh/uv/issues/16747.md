# "Access is denied. (os error 5)" during .venv updates and database write errors for Python installed via uv

---

_Issue opened by @Cmastris on 2025-11-15 17:03_

### Summary

- uv: uv 0.9.8 (85c5d3228 2025-11-07)
- OS: Windows 10 Home; Version 22H2; OS Build 19045.6456; x64
- Installation method: as detailed in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer (standalone installer via PowerShell run as admin); apparently succeeded
- Installation dir: C:\Users\[my-user]\.local\bin
- uv executable permissions: all allowed for "SYSTEM", "Administrators", and my user (default after installation; no manual modification)
- The specific contents of `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` don't seem to be relevant, as I've encountered these issues for various packages and Python versions
- Antivirus software (may or may not be relevant): Avast Free Antivirus
- Possibly related: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7382 and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/15968

Hi there. I really like the idea of uv, and I want to love it, but unfortunately, I've been plagued by issues with basic usage since installing (and reinstalling at least a couple of times).

There are two primary symptoms, but I'm including both in this issue because I strongly suspect they have the same root cause (an installation/permissions issue):

1. Commands which involve modification of the project's /.venv/ files (created via `uv sync` or another uv command and then modified by another uv command, e.g. manual `pyproject.toml` modification or `uv add` -> `uv lock` -> `uv sync`) fail with an `Access is denied. (os error 5)`.
2. Upgrading to a newer patch or minor version of Python 3 via uv (e.g. manual `pyproject.toml` & `.python-version` modification -> `uv lock` -> `uv sync`) resulted in a bizarre bug which caused a fatal error in my locally run Django application due to an `attempt to write a readonly database` error, every time I attempted a write action (e.g. new contact message). I'm very confident that this isn't a Python/Django bug, because I've since tried installing one of the same Python versions (3.13.9) via the Python website/Windows installer, and the previous errors are no longer occurring for the same actions. Likewise, I previously tried upgrading Python by a single patch version via uv (3.11.9 -> 3.11.10, with nothing in the release notes that would obviously explain the issue in .10) and then encountered the error. What *does* confuse me is that version 3.11.9 of Python installed via uv (a few days ago, while encountering the issues with other versions of Python) was working fine, and likewise worked fine every time I reverted to it after encountering the issues above. As far as I could tell, this wasn't a version which was already installed elsewhere on my system, but perhaps I missed something.

Now that I'm aware of these issues, and for anyone else encountering the same, there are a couple of workarounds for each of the above, respectively:

1. Delete the project's /.venv/ directory before updating the environment, i.e. before running `uv sync` or another command which updates the local virtual environment. uv seems to have no issues writing to a new/clean directory, but the errors occur if it tries deleting/replacing any existing files.
2. Install Python outside of the uv ecosystem, where it can later be picked up by uv to be used in a virtual environment etc.

I appreciate that this is probably a fantastically difficult (impossible?) issue to debug, particularly considering there seem to be relatively few people affected by it (unless they've just given up and used something else, which apparently I'm a bit too stubborn to do...). With that said, given the headache it has caused me over the past week or two, if it's not feasible to replicate/fix then would it be possible to document these somewhere as known issues? (Or if not, at least this issue is documentation in itself!)

Thanks.

Are there any Python processes still running when you get the error, including e.g. through an IDE? Which files are specifically affected, can you copy the full error message and ideally verbose output (`uv sync -v`)? And finally, do you regularly switch between admin and non-admin terminal and applications?

### Package update/removal error

Here's a full example starting from a fresh directory (running Git Bash as an administrator)...

Initiating a project and adding a new package seems to work fine:
```
Cmast@LAPTOP-3GSD60QD MINGW64 ~/Documents/dev/uv-test
$ uv init
Initialized project `uv-test`

Cmast@LAPTOP-3GSD60QD MINGW64 ~/Documents/dev/uv-test (main)

Cmast@LAPTOP-3GSD60QD MINGW64 ~/Documents/dev/uv-test (main)
$ uv sync

```

However, the OS error is encountered when I try to update the package:

Interestingly, my tests using a test db work fine:
```

$ py manage.py test --failfast

```

I then reverted all file changes, deleted the .venv, ran `uv sync`, and re-tested the contact form, which worked again.

> Are there any Python processes still running when you get the error, including e.g. through an IDE?

```
Cmast@LAPTOP-3GSD60QD MINGW64 ~/Documents/dev/web/django_photo_gallery/photo_gallery (main)
$ ps -ef | grep python
(django-photo-gallery)
```
I ran all of the above in the same Git Bash window, so Python shouldn't have been running except while I was running the local server.

> do you regularly switch between admin and non-admin terminal and applications?

I always run Git Bash as an administrator, and I ran PowerShell as an administrator for the uv installation per the instructions. Otherwise, I run applications (VS Code, but not using the built-in terminal; Chrome; File Explorer, but not with the .venv directory open; and maybe Notepad in this case) as a regular user.

I think a reasonable debugging step would be to disable Avast and Windows Defender temporarily and see if you can reproduce? It's possible they're scanning these files preventing us from mutating them?

**TL;DR:** Thanks for nothing, Avast. Both issues were resolved after uninstalling Avast (and using Windows Defender/Security instead). As you suspected, Avast was evidently **silently** preventing the files from being mutated :no_mouth:. I will not be reinstalling it...

So, I tried uninstalling Avast (leaving Windows Security/Defender enabled). After that, I navigated to my test repo, deleted the existing .venv, and ran `uv sync`. I then modified the pyproject.toml dependency (incremented pytest by a minor version), ran `uv lock`, and then ran `uv sync`. No issues. To double check, I then removed the dependency from pyproject.toml, re-ran the above, and still no issues. Issue #1 solved.

I then switched back to my Django project repo and tried incrementing the Python patch version to 3.13.10. This version couldn't be found by uv when I tried `uv lock`, so I upgraded uv (`uv self update`; 0.9.8 -> 0.9.15) and tried again. No issues that time, so I then ran `uv sync` to start using the new version installed via uv. Finally, I tried replicating issue #2 by running the local server and submitting a contact message (i.e. modifying the db). No issues! Issue #2 solved.

Technically, I did introduce another change as part of this when I upgraded uv. However, considering nobody has been working on this and given that issue #1 was solved without the upgrade, I'm pretty sure that was all Avast's doing.

That's my issue sorted, but **would you consider adding a note about this in the docs** somewhere? Perhaps a new item in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/troubleshooting/build-failures/? Something like...

### Access is denied

If you receive an `Access is denied` error or similar when running uv commands that attempt to modify or delete files, or you encounter similar file/database modification errors using a version of Python installed via uv, then this may be a result of your security/antivirus software silently preventing these actions. Consider temporarily disabling this software to check if this resolves the issue. If so, switching to alternative software or modifying the settings may resolve the issue. As an alternative, you can work around these issues by installing Python directly and/or by manually deleting and rebuilding the project's virtual environment when updating the project dependencies.


Thanks for your help with this.
