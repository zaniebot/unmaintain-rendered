# How can I run uv run in a specific environment?

_Issue opened by @lskbr on 2025-02-06 14:27_

### Question

I have some docker images that run an installation program that installs a Python module.
Docker is a bit picky with virtual environments. I could call the python used in the environment directly or run the activate in the same line. But it seems like a good usage for uv run.
In a Dockerfile:
```
RUN uv  venv py11 --python 3.11
RUN uv run --venv /py11 ./component_installer
```
I'm using bash now:
```
RUN bash -c "(source /py31/bin/activate && uv run ./component_installer)"
```

Is there anything equivalent to this --venv option (that does not exist) but shows up in Perplexity search :-D
Is there another way for doing this?

Thank you.

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Version

uv 0.5.29

You can use `uv run -p /py11`

`--no-project` is useful if you _might_ be in a project directory.

```
❯ uv  venv py11 --python 3.11
Using CPython 3.11.11
warning: The requested interpreter resolved to Python 3.11.11, which is incompatible with the project's Python requirement: `>=3.12`

❯ uv run -p ./py11 python --version

Thank you very much. I'm already using it, and it is working like a charm.
