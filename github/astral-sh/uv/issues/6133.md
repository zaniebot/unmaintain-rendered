# Parse registry URLs lazily

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-16 01:08_

Right now, we parse the URL in `File` to pass a `UrlString` to `FileLocation`. I think we should consider just storing the string, and parsing the URL when we try to fetch the file? The vast majority of `File` that we deserialize never get requested.
