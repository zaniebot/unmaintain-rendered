# Show currently active dependency group on terminal

---

_Issue opened by @alelom on 2025-04-24 15:26_

### Summary

It would be nice to show on the terminal the currently active dependency group, similarly to what venv/virtualenv/conda etc do:

```
(dev) user@machine:~/git/projectname$  
```

This naturally wouldn't represent the environment per se (being `.venv`) but it would give clear indication of what dependency group is active.

Unfortunately we don't actually "know" which groups are active -- that isn't tracked after the install. And what would we show if there are multiple groups?
