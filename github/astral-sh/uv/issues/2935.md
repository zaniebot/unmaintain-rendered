# fallback for unrecognized commands

---

_Issue opened by @kb- on 2024-04-09 15:21_

Some commands such as `uv pip list --outdated` are still unsupported  
For a better drop-in replacement, it would be great to fall back to pip (and print an info message)

uv 0.1.29 (365cb16fd 2024-04-04)

Sorry we're not going to fall back to pip, it's not aligned with our user experience goals.

We can, however, add dedicated messages for unsupported flags as in #1139.
