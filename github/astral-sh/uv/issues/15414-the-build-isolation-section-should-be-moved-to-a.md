# The "Build isolation" section should be moved to a dedicated location

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-08-21 13:34_

There's a ton of content here (`uv/concepts/projects/config/#build-isolation`). We should probably move it, but I'm not sure where to yet. We'll want to retain a link in the project configuration section regardless.

It's sort of a "Managing dependencies" concern, but that page is huge too!

I think one solution is to create a top-level "Dependencies" concept page with sub-pages.
