# `uvx --from <path>` does not respect changes in subsequent invocations

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-03-12 14:15_

The environment is cached and not invalidated and we don't use an editable install by default.

The solution is `--with-editable <path>` which is quite verbose.

Perhaps we should just use an editable install by default here? Alternatively, we should not cache a local path?
