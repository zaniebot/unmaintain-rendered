# venv: --copies?

---

_Issue opened by @gkze on 2024-03-01 06:41_

Got it to compile on Nix (was a pain because of `openssl-sys` :) ). Now the problem is the venv being constructed with symlinks instead of copies. Would it make sense to have a `--copies`/`--symlinks` _a la_ `venv`? Or symlink the core installation and write installed packages to the venv instead of the system directory?

I am mounting my home directory to devcontainer to reuse my user configs, and I have a venv dedicated for my user. Without `--copies` to create a self contained venv, the user-wide venv may not find the python through the symlink, or symlinked to different version in the devcontainer.

We're now supporting `uv venv --link-mode copy`, which will copy the installed packages, even though we're still symlinking the python interpreter.

Is this still an issue because we're not copying the interpreter? Should we respect `--link-mode` for the interpreter too?

I'm trying to resolve an issue where `.venv` in subfolders are not aromatically detected by vscode and saw that comment https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/14592#issuecomment-895945452

I'm not sure this is the source of my issue, but I wanted to try a copy with the interpreter included

I used uv to bootstrap python for an old embedded armv7 platform that had no python3 or package manager. My goal was to create a venv folder that was portable enough such that I could deploy it to this platform multiple times without internet or needing the uv binary installed.

I tried forcing it by copying the interpreter into my venv folder but it seemed like some libraries were still linked or missing. I eventually set my `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` to install in my project directory and created a new venv so it looked like this
```
project_dir
|- cpython-3.12.7-linux-armv7-gnueabihf/
|- venv/
|- my_python_script.py
```

This is the closest I could get to a portable project when bootstrapping with `uv`. If it's possible to build a venv that has copies of the interpreter and its libraries together I would be forced to sing uv's praises from the mountaintops.

This is also in line with my proposal in #11773

If copied, would the interpreter binary function on its own without the rest of the files in an installation?

This would be an enabler for creating layouts. More on those here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11746
