# Normalize optional dependency group names from pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-10-30 22:21_

Follow-up to #239 which does not support cases where the pyproject file has unnormalized names for dependency groups. The user's input is normalized and all comparisons should be between two normalized values.
