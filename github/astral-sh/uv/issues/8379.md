# uv tree --quiet doesn't show the tree

---

_Issue opened by @bluss on 2024-10-20 08:44_

Just a thing I noticed, that,

```
uv tree -q
```

has no output. I think it's expected it shows the tree (and no superfluous status output like resolving etc)

uv 0.4.24

Yeah `uv tree` and `uv pip list` should both show output.
