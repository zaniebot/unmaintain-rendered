# add a method for creating constraint file while using uv sync

---

_Issue opened by @Devpmin on 2025-07-04 06:49_

### Summary

in poetry we usually add a constraint file from the poetry lock file. but in uv im supposed to export it to a requirement.txt and from there a constraint.txt for later runtime installs of main projects. we should be able to create a constraint file from the uv.lock file direclty. which is not supported right now or am i missing something?

### Example

_No response_

`requirements.txt` and `constraints.txt` use the same format, you can use `uv export --output-file constraints.txt`.
