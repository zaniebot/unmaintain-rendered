# Informing the UV project of vcpkg integration

---

_Issue opened by @nunokaeru on 2024-09-14 17:18_

Hello @charliermarsh and the team behind `uv`.

I love your project, so I decided to help out by creating a vcpkg port over at https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg. So we can use UV in C++ projects for managing our python dependencies 😄 (usually C++ projects really need an easier language to write scripts in).

I hope this increases the adoption of uv by other ecosystems.

Here is the Pull Request in question: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/40986
