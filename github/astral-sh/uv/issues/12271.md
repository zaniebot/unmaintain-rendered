# Sync --frozen does not install python version

---

_Issue opened by @eruvanos on 2025-03-18 10:37_

### Question

The following command is executed by our GitHub action before running the tests.

`uv sync --all-packages --quiet --frozen`

The command fails with:
```
error: The current Python version (3.[12](...).3) is not compatible with the locked Python requirement: `==3.13.*``
```

I expected that uv downloads the right Python version if necessary.

### Platform

runs-on: github-arm

### Version

0.6.7

try with env var `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS: 1`

Are you activating a Python environment by other means in a previous step? Can you share a minimal workflow that reproduces the problem?

I removed the install command in my workflow and it just works now.
I am not able to reproduce it again. I am sorry.
