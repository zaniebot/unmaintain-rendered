# Dependency specifier format in docs and `pyproject.toml` don't match

---

_Issue opened by @paduszyk on 2025-09-01 19:36_

I've noticed a tiny formatting inconsistency in formatting of dependency version specifiers when added with `add-bounds` option.

In docs:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/9be016f3f8fdc3ac7974ed82762aa3364f6e8f2b/docs/reference/settings.md?plain=1#L744-L745

whereas in the `pyproject.toml` the **whitespace** between lower and upper bounds is not found.

This behavior is not the case of the `requires-python` option. If I declare `requires-python = "~=3.13.7"`, then in `uv.lock` I get `requires-python = ">=3.13.7, <3.14"` (so the whitespace is found).

Whitespace is ignored when parsing version specifiers, so I'm impartial to whether we have a space or not, but I agree we should be consistent about it.

Most (if not all) examples from PEP 440 use whitespaces:
