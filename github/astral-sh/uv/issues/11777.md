# Create a statically linked binary for python projects

---

_Issue opened by @kishaningithub on 2025-02-25 10:23_

### Summary

If i run something like `uv compile` my python project should produce a statically linked cross-platform binary.

This is inspired from [deno compile](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/compile/) which creates statically linked cross-platform binaries for Javascript/Typescript.

### Example

- New command called `uv compile` which produces a statically linked binary just like [deno compile](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/compile/)
- An alternative design option would be to use `uv build` to create binaries in addition to whl and zip which it is creating now
