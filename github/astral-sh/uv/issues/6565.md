# Docker documentation should cover pinning with sha256

---

_Issue opened by @Ravencentric on 2024-08-24 03:16_

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/ already recommends pinning by tag but it should also mention pinning by sha256 which is a more secure way of pinning. The package page (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pkgs/container/uv) should also be exposed somewhere because currently it's very hard to find

You can get the sha256 by using e.g. `docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.3.3`. What would exactly be the ask here? Keeping the docs up to date with specific docker hashes?

I believe this can be made easier to discover by enabling `packages` view in the repo settings, and/or putting a link in the docs like you said.

I'm just asking the docs to talk about pinning by hashes, which is the recommended practice over pinning with tags (which is already covered in docs)

Fine with mentioning this in a tip or something. Pinning to a version is already more than most people do — if you're in a serious production environment you should already have internal best practices around using SHA pins. As noted, we shouldn't try to keep this synced to the latest SHA — we should use something that's clearly a dummy example.
