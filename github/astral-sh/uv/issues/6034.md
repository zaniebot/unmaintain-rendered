# Improve resolver conclusion when only a single version is available

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-12 12:23_

From https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6028

e.g.

```
  ╰─▶ Because only typing-extensions{python_version < '3.13'}<4.10.0 is available and altair==5.4.0 depends on
      typing-extensions{python_version < '3.13'}>=4.10.0, we can conclude that altair==5.4.0 cannot be used.
      And because only altair<=5.4.0 is available and you require altair>=5.4.0, we can conclude that the requirements
      are unsatisfiable.
```

The last line is correct but can be quite hard to parse. Maybe it should say

> And because you require altair>=5.4.0 and no newer versions are available, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.

or 

> And because you require altair>=5.4.0 and no other versions are available, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.

or

> And because you require altair>=5.4.0 only altair==5.4.0 could be used, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
