# Error During `uv sync` Command Execution in Docker Build

---

_Issue opened by @nimaxin on 2025-01-15 23:35_

Encountered an error while running the uv sync command during a Docker build step. The error suggests an issue with parsing uv.lock due to an invalid ABI tag in a wheel filename.
```bash
