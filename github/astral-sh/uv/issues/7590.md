What's detecting the malware? There's no malware, it's just "suspicious" to some antivirus to download binaries.

you confirm it's a false positive ?

I'll try to send it to Bitdefender, may be they can whitelist it, I can't deactivate antivirus in production environment.

ps: they say suspicious but thay say "Malicious Content" at the same time with a signature. My tittle is a little too much maybe :)

We get frequent reports of false positives and nothing should have changed here.

The installer script is the same as the previous release except the version numbers

```diff

so, I close the issue :) thanks for the quick answer, I'll try another method to use it. (downloading exe files or compiling it)
