# Tensorflow doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

_Issue opened by @younver on 2024-11-25 15:05_

Salute, I've been trying to solve this issue for a while, but couldn't manage to resolve it even after digging through my project like a minefield. I'd really appreciate any help!

```
$ uv sync
error: distribution tensorflow==2.8.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform
```

current pyproject.toml:
```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = "<3.11,>=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "fastapi==0.115.5",
    "uvicorn==0.32.1",
    "pydub==0.25.1",

Have you read the PyTorch documentation? https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/pytorch/

This has been fixed on `main`.

Hi. I am still having issues with this:

`$ uv add skfolio

error: _Distribution tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem==0.37.1 @ registry+https://pypi.org/simple_ can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform`

`$ uv version
uv 0.5.18 (27d1bad55 2025-01-11)`

This is the project file:

`

@pventura-mam -- Does using `--python 3.12` work?

---

_Comment by @pventura-mam on 2025-01-15 17:01_

`uv venv --python 3.12
Using CPython 3.12.8
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: .venv\Scripts\activate`

`uv sync
  x No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  `-> Because tensorflow==2.10.1 has no wheels with a matching Python version tag and your project depends on
      tensorflow==2.10.1, we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.`

This seems to be a totally different thing, so maybe, just for this case, I should use `uv pip -r requirements.txt` that works just fine.

What do you think?

I followed the steps to install `torch` on my Mac M1. But I am still getting issues. Following is the `pyproject.toml` for your reference:

```toml

[project]
name = "book-recommender-ai"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "django>=5.2.5",
    "djangorestframework>=3.16.1",
    "hf-xet>=1.1.8",
    "ipykernel>=6.30.1",
    "ipython>=9.4.0",
    "langchain-chroma>=0.2.5",
    "langchain-community>=0.3.28",
    "langchain-core>=0.3.75",
    "langchain-huggingface>=0.3.1",
    "langchain-openai>=0.3.32",
    "matplotlib>=3.10.5",
    "numpy==2.1.0",
    "pandas>=2.3.2",
    "seaborn>=0.13.2",
    "torch>=2.7.0",
    "tqdm>=4.67.1",
    "transformers>=4.55.4",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = [
  { index = "pytorch-cpu", marker = "sys_platform != 'linux'" },
  { index = "pytorch-cu128", marker = "sys_platform == 'linux'" },
]
torchvision = [
  { index = "pytorch-cpu", marker = "sys_platform != 'linux'" },
  { index = "pytorch-cu128", marker = "sys_platform == 'linux'" },
]

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch-cpu"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"
explicit = true

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch-cu128"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128"
explicit = true

```

Then when I do `uv sync`, I get the following error:

```sh

Resolved 172 packages in 1.74s
error: Distribution `torch==2.8.0+cpu @ registry+https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're on macOS (`macosx_15_0_x86_64`), but `torch` (v2.8.0+cpu) only has wheels for the following platforms: `win_amd64`, `win_arm64`; consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels
```

P.S: I am running the terminal with Rosetta enabled to make the terminal run like on a x86_64 environment.

Using `pip3 index versions torch` to find out the versions available to your Intel Mac,

```
torch (2.2.2)
```

and it looks like 2.2.2 is the last version available to Intel Mac.
