# When I click `Docs ⌄` from the blog I'm taken to the ruff docs, but I was looking for the uv docs

1. Go to https://astral.sh/blog
2. Click here:

3. End up on ruff docs: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/ 🙁


This happens because I google "uv python" , which gives me this blog post "https://astral.sh/blog/uv", I go to click docs as either the uv docs or being an old timer and associating clicking with opening a menu, and I end up with the ruff docs.
