# Help add supporting uv in renovatebot

---

_Issue opened by @staners2 on 2024-03-21 06:18_

I open issue for supporting `uv` in `renovatebot`. Help me push this issue to release in prod and supplement with useful information that will simplify support for `renovatebot`

P.S. Renovatebot - bot supporting upgrade dependencies. Get pull requests to update your dependencies and lock files.

Let me know if you need something concrete or feel free to point renovatebot maintainers over here.

I read through the issue and am not sure what else to provide.

I was looking into whether Renovate supports uv lockfiles and saw that support for uv was added (https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/30756).

So this issue can probably be closed unless there's something else you need.

Thanks! There's also https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/30909 but we can close this.
