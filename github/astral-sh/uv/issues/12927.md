# uv-installer.sh fails to download uv-build with 404 error behind proxy

---

_Issue opened by @the-Fitz on 2025-04-16 20:02_

When running the `uv-installer.sh` script to download a specific version of `uv-build`, it fails to download the package with a 404 error. This issue occurs on both Linux and macOS devices that are behind a proxy. However, the issue does not occur on a macOS device that is not behind a proxy.

Interestingly, when using the latest download command `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, the installation is successful, even behind a proxy. This suggests that the issue is specific to downloading a specific version of `uv-build`.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Run the `uv-installer.sh` script to download a specific version of `uv-build` (e.g. `0.6.12`) behind a proxy
2. Observe the 404 error and failure to download the `uv-build` package

**Expected behavior:**

The `uv-installer.sh` script should successfully download the `uv-build` package and complete the installation, even behind a proxy.

**Actual behavior:**

The `uv-installer.sh` script fails to download the `uv-build` package with a 404 error when behind a proxy.

**Environment:**

* Operating System: Linux and macOS
* `uv-installer.sh` version: `0.6.12` and `0.6.14` (only tested those, I suspect this is an issue for other versions as well)

**Logs:**

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.6.14/uv-build-installer.sh | sh
downloading uv-build 0.6.14 aarch64-apple-darwin
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404
failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.6.14/uv-build-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
this may be a standard network error, but it may also indicate
that uv-build's release process is not working. When in doubt
please feel free to open an issu
```

**Additional information:**

* The issue occurs on both Linux and macOS devices behind a proxy, but not on a macOS device without a proxy.
* Using the latest download command `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` works successfully, even behind a proxy.
* The `uv-installer.sh` script may not be handling proxy settings correctly, or there may be an issue with the specific version of `uv-build` being downloaded.

The only official distribution for `uv-build` is the `uv-build` package on PyPI. The standalone installers aren't intended to work here -- I think it's a bug that they're present in the Release summary.

I think this is fixed for future releases in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12885.

Thanks! I can confirm that I was targeting `uv-build-installer` instead of `uv-installer`. Switching to `uv-installer` fixed my issue.
