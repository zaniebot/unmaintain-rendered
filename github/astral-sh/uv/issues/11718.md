Did you see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#static-vs-dynamic-metadata? Specifying which fields are dynamic isn't specifically a uv thing (but see comment below about uv's current status on support for dynamic metadata)

Currently, the uv build backend only supports static metadata.

any plan to support  dynamic fields / version?

As someone using `setuptools-scm` for over a decade I really wanted to attempt a more major switch to uv (instead of just making use of it as pip and pip-tools replacement). still, not being able to get the dynamic versioning from git tags seems to be quite a big issue.

I was able to find https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning/ interesting but sadly that seems to be focused on hatchling and I do not want to entry into that domain.

If I am to repace setuptool-scm with something, I don't want it to be poetry or hatchling, it has to be something `uv build` centric.

If someone already managed to get this to work, mention me here with a link. I am very curious to try it.

Yeah, me too I just changed the version to 0.0.0 and on CI, before `uv publish` I bump with `uv version`. That pipeline already extracts the right version number from git tags.

`uv build` works perfectly fine even if you have hatchling in your `pyproject.toml` for building. I use this combination all the time, it's very fast and works great.

Maybe you already knew this, and actually was talking about `uv_build` (the build backend) rather than `uv build` (a command in the frontend). And I'm definitely not objecting to this feature request. I just thought it worth noting for anyone who doesn't realise that you can mix and match build frontends and backends.
