# Option to output `uv tool list` into JSON format

---

_Issue opened by @Coruscant11 on 2024-12-29 13:59_

Hello 🙂 

I am using uv in robotic manners to manage some isolated installations. It's easy to use, fast, works out of the box. Again, thanks for this wonderful tool.

I am currently parsing `uv tool list` output with regular expressions:
```shell
❯ uv tool list
autoflake v2.3.1
- autoflake
black v24.10.0
- black
- blackd
isort v5.13.2
- isort
- isort-identify-imports
pyls v0.1.7
- pyls
...
```

For the context, `uv pip list` is able to output in a JSON format with `uv pip list --format json` :
```shell
❯ uv pip list --format json
Using Python 3.13.0 environment at: test
[{"name":"iniconfig","version":"2.0.0"},{"name":"packaging","version":"24.2"},{"name":"pluggy","version":"1.5.0"},{"name":"pytest","version":"8.3.4"}]
```

It would be great to have the same kind of output format if specified to `uv tool list`.

What do you think?
While `uv` did it for the `pip` subcommand in order to keep the same interface as the original `pip`, most probably this one would need some design first in order to ensure potential forward-compatibility.

So I created this issue first before submitting any pull-request. 🙂 

Cheers!

Hi! Glad you like the tool :)

Loosely a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/411 and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3199

We're interested in JSON output formats, we just haven't added them throughout yet.

Oh nice! So you're waiting for a global design, which will be also used for other subcommands.

Thanks!

Here's a dirty workaround for the time being:

```shell
for f in ~/.local/share/uv/tools/*/uv-receipt.toml; do yq -p toml -o json "$f"; done | jq -s
```
