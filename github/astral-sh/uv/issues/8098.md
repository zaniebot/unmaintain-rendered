# [Feature Request] Fetch project metadata from user level `uv.toml` for `pyproject.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @dpprdan on 2024-10-10 15:48_

In #7718 we discussed to fetch project metadata from user level `uv.toml` to in insert in `pyproject.toml` on `uv init`. 

In particular the `authors`/`maintainers`, `license` and `classifiers` fields come to mind, but possibly others as well, maybe even something like the `[build-system]` table.

(Probably obvious, because configured over inferred, but `authors` from `uv.toml` should take precedence over `--author-from git`/#7756).

I just created another project without explicitly adding `--package` and thus got the default `app` pyproject.toml. It's not a big deal but it's certainly a bit annoying. Would love to be able to change this default in a user-level `uv.toml`.

Would this feature potentially fetch my settings for:
- [tool.mypy]
- [tool.ruff]
- [tool.ruff.lint]

Thanks for all of your hard work on this awesome project, it's very much appreciated!

Also (apologies if it's inappropriate to be asking this here) - I liked the new feature of adding the `--author-from` option to `uv init` and I wondered if that can be set as the default (locally) somehow to save my typing it each time or creating an alias?
