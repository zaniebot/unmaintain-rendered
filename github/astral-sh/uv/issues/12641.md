# Documentation update post PEP 751


---

_Issue opened by @purepani on 2025-04-03 02:41_

Currently on [this page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/layout/#the-lockfile),
The last sentence states 
> There is no Python standard for lockfiles at this time, so the format of this file is specific to uv and not usable by other tools.

This is obviously no longer true, so this should probably be updated.

We should probably say something like..

> There is a recently standardized format for lockfiles: `pylock.toml`. For details on the new format, see PEP 751. Some of uv's functionality cannot be expressed in the `pylock.toml` format, so uv will continue to use the `uv.lock` format. The `uv.lock` format is specific to uv and not usable by other tools. However, support for `pylock.toml` is planned everywhere uv currently supports `requirements.txt` files. For more details and updates on progress, see 12584.

(I guess I should just post this as a PR)

@zanieb I hope it's alright I got the ball rolling on adding a note to the docs based on your suggestion above 🙂
