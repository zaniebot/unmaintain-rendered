# uv fails to install pytorch3d, while pip succedes

---

_Issue opened by @RafailFridman on 2024-08-14 09:15_

I'm trying to install pytorch3d on Mac, following [these instructions.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
I have created an environment and already installed torch:
```
uv venv p3d -p 3.10 --seed
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
I'm running this command:
```
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 CC=clang CXX=clang++ uv pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git" --verbose
```
and get the following:
```

  Caused by: This error likely indicates that git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git depends on torch, but doesn't declare it as a build dependency. If git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git is a first-party package, consider adding torch to its `build-system.requires`. Otherwise, `uv pip install torch` into the environment and re-run with `--no-build-isolation`.

While running the same command, but with `pip install ` instead of ` uv pip install` works:
```
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14 CC=clang CXX=clang++ pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
```

After actually reading the error until the end and adding `--no-build-isolation` I was able to install pytorch3d :)
