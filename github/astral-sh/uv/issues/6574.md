# Support `.tool-versions` as an alternative to `.python-versions`

---

_Issue opened by @TommasoAmici on 2024-08-24 08:25_

For projects with multiple languages/tools, it's possible to have the python version in a `.tool-versions` file which is very similar in spirit to `.python-versions`, but allows defining all versions in a centralized configuration file. It'd be nice if `uv` supported that.

e.g.:
https://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html#tool-versions
https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html#tool-versions

This generally makes sense to me (though the syntax is more flexible, e.g., supports `sub` and stuff, so it's not totally trivial).
