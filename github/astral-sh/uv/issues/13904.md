### Example

_No response_

This is out of the scope of uv, which doesn't look at the source code, and would fit better in a tool like ruff/ty that parse and analyze the source code.

(I don't think it's strictly out of scope for uv, but _will_ require integration with static analysis tooling and it's unclear where the user touchpoint should be)

We have a lot of dependencies and for every dependency we need to perform validations (regulatory requirements).
Having a feature like this could save us a lot of time.
