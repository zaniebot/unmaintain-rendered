# uv tree support for json output

---

_Issue opened by @frlan on 2025-05-03 15:56_

### Summary

I hope I just did overread it somewhere.... 

It would be nice to have the option to also export the graph e.g. inside a nested json (or similar) instead the tree style output.

### Example

_No response_

We don't support this yet but it's been requested multiple times (and we should do it).
