# `uv tool install --reinstall` not working as documented

---

_Issue opened by @dpoznik on 2024-10-10 03:12_

The docs suggest that `uv tool install --reinstall` should reinstall _all_ packages:
```sh
$ uv --version
uv 0.4.20 (0e1b25a53 2024-10-08)

$ uv tool install --help
...
      --reinstall                              Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies `--refresh`
      --reinstall-package <REINSTALL_PACKAGE>  Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies `--refresh-package`
...
```
This suggests that one need not specify a particular package. But in practice, a package name is expected:
```sh
$ uv tool install --reinstall
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  <PACKAGE>

Usage: uv tool install --reinstall --index-url <INDEX_URL> <PACKAGE>

```

`uv tool install --reinstall <PACKAGE>` will reinstall `<PACKAGE>` and all of its dependencies (whereas `uv tool --reinstall-package <FOO> <PACKAGE>` will reinstall `<FOO>`, but not `<PACKAGE>`). Any suggestions on how to make this clearer?

`--reinstall` is not "Reinstall all tools", but it's like "Reinstall everything for one tool".


Maybe this is a clarification.
Here PACKAGE is the tool you want to install:

```
Usage: uv tool install [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE>
```


----


But below, *packages* is all the distribution packages in the installation of *the tool* (the previous single `PACKAGE`).

```
Installer options:
      --reinstall
          Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies
          `--refresh`
```

Perhaps something like the following, wherein instances of "package" have been edited to forms of "dependency" to disambiguate "packages" providing tools from "packages" these tool-providing packages depend on:
```
      --reinstall                         Reinstall all dependencies, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies `--refresh`
      --reinstall-package <DEPENDENCY>    Reinstall a specific dependency, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies `--refresh-package`

      --refresh                           Refresh all cached data
      --refresh-package <DEPENDENCY>      Refresh cached data for a specific dependency
```

It may be even clearer if the second and fourth option were `--reinstall-dependency` and `--refresh-dependency`, respectively. But that would involve more than just a documentation tweak.

Thanks!

Relatedly, does `uv tool` have an equivalent to `pipx`'s [`reinstall-all`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/#pipx-reinstall-all) subcommand?
I find this useful when, for example, upgrading Python.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-10-10 15:16_

You can do `uv tool upgrade --all`. You can even do `uv tool upgrade --all --python 3.13` to upgrade all installed tools to Python 3.13.

Ah, so `uv tool upgrade` is closer in behavior to [`pipx reinstall`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/#pipx-reinstall) than to [`pipx upgrade`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/docs/#pipx-upgrade), which upgrades a tool _within_ its existing environment. Got it. Thanks!

If not already present, it may be worth noting this contrast somewhere in the docs to help folks transition.

\cc @zanieb for opinions on changing the `--reinstall` docs.

`uv tool upgrade --all` does not actually (re)create links in the `~/.local/bin/`.

`uv tool upgrade --all --python 3.13` does recreate them.

I've installed same packages/tools multiple times using `pip install --user package`, `pipx install package`, `uv tool install package`.

After that, pip and pipx packages were uninstalled and some of the uv installed tool links are removed from `~/.local/bin/` by that.

Is there a need to have a way to replay all of the installations for all of the tools with all of the `--with optional-dependency` and `package[extra]`?

At the moment the only thing that gets damaged in mixed environment (uv/pipx/pip) is link in `~/.local/bin/` but maybe something else is installed outside of `~/.local/share/uv/`. Man pages for example?

It is clearly not an everyday operation to install the same package using 3 different package managers but I've just tried to compare pipx, poetry and uv.

I'd love to have a version of `pipx reinstall-all` in `uv tool`. My use case is that after upgrading and removing some Python versions, the venvs for the installed uv tools stopped working. If it was pipx, I would run `pipx reinstall-all` and it would reinstall the packages with new venvs from working Python versions.

An additional note is that some packages were specifically installed with an older version of Python, e.g. `uv tool install --python 3.12 PACKAGE`. In this case, I would expect `uv tool reinstall-all` to reinstall the package with the latest Python 3.12 fix.

I appreciate there's an ongoing discussion about how best to handle this, but I feel this related message is wrong as it stands:

```sh
> uvx --reinstall
warning: Tools cannot be reinstalled via `uvx`; use `uv tool
upgrade --reinstall` to reinstall all installed tools, or `uvx
package@latest` to run the latest version of a tool.
Provide a command to run with `uvx <command>`.

See `uvx --help` for more information.
```
And should read 
```sh
use `uv tool upgrade --reinstall --all` to reinstall all installed tools
```

as:

```sh
> uv tool upgrade --reinstall
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  <NAME>...

Usage: uv tool upgrade --reinstall <NAME>...

For more information, try '--help'.
```

Thanks! That looks like an oversight (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11535).
