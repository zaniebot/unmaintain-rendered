# is run uv sync after uv venv [specify_location] should sync packages on .venv (default environemntt)

### Question

hello 
i run 
```bash
uv venv /opt/venv
uv sync 
```
but **uv** create .venv in current directory and install all packages of this environment. is this expected behavior? 
is there specific option for ***uv sync** to specify the venv location?


### Platform

_No response_

### Version

You could activate with `source /opt/venv/bin/activate` and then run `uv sync --active`. Or you could also run:

```
VIRTUAL_ENV="opt/venv" uv sync --active
```

Or you could set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` to your target directory, but yeah this behavior is intentional — uv is stateless and `uv venv` does not effect the project environment location.

tnx for answering, the stateless answer is very convincing keep up the good work. in the context of my docker 2 stage build, i use to build package with pip to get ride of test and docs for security reasons. is there anything in uv to help me simulate that process ?

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example/blob/main/multistage.Dockerfile is our multistage example. You can also do `uv sync --no-dev` to exclude your development dependencies. If you're trying to exclude additional content that's in your source tree, you'd want something like `uv build && uv pip install dist/<your-project>.whl`? I'm not sure what your pip workflow looked like. If you give more details, I can probably give a clearer answer.

this is my first time switching to uv, before it i use to build python packages using
```
RUN pip wheel --wheel-dir /usr/src/app/wheels \
    -r requirements.txt```
in build stage and then 
```COPY --from=python-build-stage /usr/src/app/wheels /wheels/

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --no-index --find-links=/wheels/ /wheels/* \
  && rm -rf /wheels/
```
copy the wheel content in to my run stage and install them this way i don't have to be concern of test and docs for security and size reasons.

We don't support `pip wheel` (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1681) but you could do something like `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/usr/src/app/.venv uv sync --no-editable --no-dev` then copy that directory over as long as the Python interpreter used matches.
