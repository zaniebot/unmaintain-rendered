# Is there any way I can vote for the functionality that I would like to see in UV?

### Question

First of all, I would like to thank the developers for the UV. I really like using it.

I apologize if I may have angered you with this question, as UV is still under development.

I would like to know if there is any way to "vote" for the functionality that I and other users would like to see?

I see that there is a label "wish", does this mean that you will make such functionality when the time comes, or when the time comes, will you decide whether you will implement such functionality?

By no means am I rushing you, but I would like to vote for some functionality, and patiently wait for its time to come.

Specifically, right now, I would like to support the #5802 initiative. Specifically, I lack the functionality to "compile" a program without unnecessary difficulties (and this is how UV allows you to act in other areas), and transfer it to users' systems.

### Platform
