# Make home assistant work

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-10-26 13:22_

Re https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/issues/181#issuecomment-1780426042, when i merge their requirements we fail because of lack of support of in tree build backends. The other thing we don't support are constraints files, but ihmo it's fine to merge that in.

@konstin - I can't remember, does this work now?

`puffin pip-compile requirements_test.txt` works, but otherwise their setup is too custom to be a good testing ground
