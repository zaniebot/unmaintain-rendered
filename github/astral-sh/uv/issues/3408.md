# Preserve url parsing from `Requirement` parsing to `Dist`

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-05-06 14:14_

Part of #3407:
* Decide which type to store in `PubGrubPackage` and `Urls` and add them. For the first step, we should retain the `VerbatimUrl` and only add the parsed field, like `Requirement` does.
* Use these fields in `Dist::from_url`.
