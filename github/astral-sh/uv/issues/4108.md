# pyproject defined override dependencies  ignored by uv lock and uv sync

_Issue opened by @idlsoft on 2024-06-06 18:29_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

It looks like `uv pip install` and `uv pip compile` read 
```
[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = ...
```
from `pyproject.toml` but `uv lock` and `uv sync` don't.


Is that intentional?

Probably just not implemented yet!

Worth noting that we may want to explore a different syntax before supporting this in the new API cc @konstin

What different syntax do you have in mind?

I don't have a specific request, just voicing that we should consider if we want something else (as noted by @charliermarsh)
