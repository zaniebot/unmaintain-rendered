# Allow setting the `http-timeout` in the `uv.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @coltonshipley on 2025-08-29 16:23_

### Summary

My org uses a transparent proxy with SSL inspection. In testing just curling the python tar.gz file can take over 30 seconds. UV seems to have a hardcoded timeout of 30s before it tries to extract the file and then it fails. Can this timeout just be increased (or removed completely) or give some sort of an option in cli and uv.toml to adjust this behavior?

### Example

_No response_

You can set the `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT` variable to increase the timeout.

@konstin - Awesome. Thank you! I totally missed that in the docs and it did indeed solve my issues. Is there an option to do the same thing in the uv.toml config file that can be pushed out to users?

We can add a `http-timeout` setting to `uv.toml`.
