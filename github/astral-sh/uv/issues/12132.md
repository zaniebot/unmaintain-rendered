# pytorch can use local file?

---

_Issue opened by @dobet on 2025-03-12 09:55_

### Question

When I was using UV, I found that PyTorch indices are downloaded via URLs such as "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118", but my environment does not support connecting to the `download.pytorch.org` website. How should I proceed?

You could download the URLs you care about into a local directory, then use:

```toml
[tool.uv]
find-links = ["./path/to/dir"]
```
