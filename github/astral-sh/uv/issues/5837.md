# Warn when the active environment differs from one in the working directory

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-06 22:14_

Encountered this:

```
❯ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3 interpreter at: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12
Creating virtualenv at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
❯ uv pip install anyio
Audited 1 package in 3ms
❯ ls .venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages
_virtualenv.pth	_virtualenv.py
```

Very confusing! Of course, I had just activated a different virtual environment and forgot about it.
