# Installing uv through bash script stopped working

_Issue opened by @rodolfolottin on 2024-04-22 19:50_

Hi! I'm currently unable to install uv through the installation step that utilizes curl.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

It gives a 404. `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404`

Closing it in favor of #3196. It's a duplicate.
