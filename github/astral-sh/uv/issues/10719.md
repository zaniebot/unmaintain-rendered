# Hint use of `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` when command is available in `VIRTUAL_ENV`

If `VIRTUAL_ENV` is set and `uv run` fails to find a command in the project environment, we could hint use of  `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` or at least hint why the command is missing?

This comes with the caveat that using `uv sync` will clobber the environment — so I'm not entirely sure we should recommend it. The suggestion may be to add the dependency to your project instead?
