# Python version is installed before checking for project compatibility

---

_Issue opened by @chinise on 2025-01-31 12:18_

### Summary

When python version specified in `.python-version` is not compatible with version specified in `pyproject.toml` uv first installs `.python-version` and then tells
```sh
error: The Python request from `.python-version` resolved to Python 3.8.20, which is incompatible with the project's Python requirement: `>=3.12`. Use `uv python pin` to update the `.python-version` file to a compatible version.
```
So the installation was not necessary. Please first let user know so they can make the decision

### Version
