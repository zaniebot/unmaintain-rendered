# Tree list of dependencies within uv.lock

---

_Issue opened by @dbogdoll on 2025-12-02 09:04_

### Question

Dear all,

is there a way to list all dependencies (incl. their sub dependencies) in a tree structure?
It would help a lot to decide which dependencies are really necessary.

I would like to be to see the actual versions ( as mentioned in uv.lock) and the tree should be based on the actual versions.

Thanks.

### Platform
