# Add support for --relocatable

---

_Issue opened by @yeswalrus on 2024-05-14 18:55_

`--relocatable` was an experimental feature in older versions of the `virtualenv` script. We have a few use cases where it would be helpful to be able to package up a venv and copy it to a different machine, and really the only part of the activate script that we have to change is the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable.
Would it be possible to revive this old flag & useful feature, and just have it replace the `activate` script's `VIRTUAL_ENV='<absolute path>'` with `VIRTUAL_ENV='$(realpath $(dirname $0)/..)'` or something like that?
