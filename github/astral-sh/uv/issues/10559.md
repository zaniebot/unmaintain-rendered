# Question: why does uv.lock record the project's own version ?

---

_Issue opened by @neutrinoceros on 2025-01-13 08:41_

This is perhaps a naive question but I'm wondering why `uv.lock` would need to record the project's own version ?
This behavior is generating friction in projects that have a dynamic version number. I got bitten by it myself: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-pre-commit/issues/35
Any chance this could be relaxed somehow ?

FYI, this has been (and is still being) discussed extensively on https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7533.

thank you, I missed that one ! Let's close this one as a dupe then.
