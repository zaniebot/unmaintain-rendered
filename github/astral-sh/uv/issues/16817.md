# support configuring `--no-install-project` in `pyproject.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-11-22 06:51_

### Summary

my project uses maturin as the build backend, and when uv installs the project with `uv sync`, maturin does not build it in debug mode. for that, i need to run `maturin develop`. however every time i use `uv run`, it reinstalls the project in the wrong mode so i need to run `maturin develop` again for debugging to work.

it would be nice if i could configure uv to never install the current project. alternatively, the `--no-install-project` argument could be added to `uv run`

### Example

i'm trying to set up debug configs for my vscode extension for a language server that's written in rust, see https://github.com/tach-org/tach/pull/860

i mostly have it working, but it breaks whenever i run any command with `uv run` and i have to remember to run `maturin develop` again

It's not intended for `--no-install-project` to be persistent. Why does `uv run` reinstall the package? The logs should indicate the reason the current one is not seen as valid.

Does maturin support configuring debug / release mode via `config-settings`?

I'd also recommend first checking `uv sync -v`, the other option we have is to configure maturin so that it uses debug builds for editable builds. (It's a bigger problem with PEP 517 that we don't have a good way to tell backends whether we want a debug or a release build.)

i think it might just be because i've been tweaking my `pyproject.toml` a lot while i'm trying to get everything set up how i want it.

this is what i had in mind as well, but i'm quite new to maturin and i couldn't find any documentation for configuring its build backend, so i wasn't sure whether this was an issue with uv or maturin. should i open an issue on maturin instead?

It's a good idea to track this in maturin too.

closing this as it turns out this feature was recently added to maturin:

```toml
[tool.maturin]
editable-profile = "dev"
```
