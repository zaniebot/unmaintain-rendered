# Continue partially downloaded package on network error

---

_Issue opened by @clouds56 on 2025-05-09 06:25_

### Summary

When read Stream error, now uv would retry download from start, is it possible to continue download the partial file?
Some package like `nvidia-cuda-*` is large enough to fail when the network is poor

### Example

_No response_

You may be able to increase reliability by lowering the number of concurrent downloads (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#concurrent-downloads)

Yes, I'm using `UV_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=1` and it would fail, ~though I don't think it's network problem~ since I'm using tsinghua mirror and the download speed is always \~11MB/s before it failed (after 100~300MB downloaded).
Inspect with wireshark it is me to send a `[RST, ACK]` to mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn, and then send lots of RST in next 500ms.
I'm not senior network engineer and have no idea what's this about.

So, I thought the simplest workaround is have a model of continuing download.

Update:
It is network problem but not that common.
uv reports

It also happens to me. Can't continue the download after intentionally disconnecting the internet. It really frustrating when downloading huge package like `nvidia-*`.
