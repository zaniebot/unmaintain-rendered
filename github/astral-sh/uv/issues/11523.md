Hm.

Yeah this looks right to me:

```
❯ ls .venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/anyio/__pycache__
__init__.cpython-313.pyc       from_thread.cpython-313.pyc    lowlevel.cpython-313.pyc       pytest_plugin.cpython-313.pyc  to_interpreter.cpython-313.pyc to_process.cpython-313.pyc     to_thread.cpython-313.pyc
```

Are we, perhaps, skipping this step if the requirements are already installed?

Hmm, no, seems to be working.

False alarm... sorry for the noise. It was PyCharm hiding these folders/files...
