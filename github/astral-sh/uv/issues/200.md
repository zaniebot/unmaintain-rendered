# Track and share resolver's in-memory index globally

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-26 13:32_

If we have to do a resolution as part of building a source distribution, we should be able to re-use the existing in-memory index that the resolver has already built up. How can we share this cache across the tree?
