# Document  generate-shell-completion subcommand

---

_Issue opened by @danielhollas on 2024-03-05 00:57_

The `generate-shell-completion` subcommand was added in #1675 but doesn't seem to be documented anywhere. It also doesn't appear in the help output (`uv -h`) --- I guess that's intended?

There's some documentation on it here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#shell-autocompletion

Oh sorry, that's in Ruff, I didn't even realize where we were. (But it operates the same way.)

Oh I did not know! I am using the latest ruff/uv. I think OP might be asking whether it would be the case to add it to the help menu you get when you run `uv` alone?

```bash
uv
The command line interface for the uv binary.

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  pip        Resolve and install Python packages
  tool       Run and manage executable Python packages
  toolchain  Manage Python installations
  venv       Create a virtual environment
  cache      Manage the cache
  self       Manage the `uv` executable
  version    Display uv's version
  help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -q, --quiet                                        Do not print any output
  -v, --verbose...                                   Use verbose output
      --color <COLOR_CHOICE>                         Control colors in output [default: auto] [possible values: auto, always, never]
      --native-tls                                   Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store [env: UV_NATIVE_TLS=]
      --offline                                      Disable network access, relying only on locally cached data and locally available files
      --toolchain-preference <TOOLCHAIN_PREFERENCE>  Whether to use system or uv-managed Python toolchains [possible values: only-managed, prefer-installed-managed, prefer-managed, prefer-system, only-system]
  -n, --no-cache                                     Avoid reading from or writing to the cache [env: UV_NO_CACHE=]
      --cache-dir <CACHE_DIR>                        Path to the cache directory [env: UV_CACHE_DIR=]
      --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>                    The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration [env: UV_CONFIG_FILE=]
  -h, --help                                         Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version                                      Print version
```

Here you don't see `generate-shell-completion` among the option and the same goes for ruff.

EDIT: I am no rust dev but I think I could add those in the appropriate places if you would like a bit of help 😊 I am no expert in shell completions either but I guess you could also contribute those to [`zsh-completions` plugin](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) so anyone has them by default.

It seems `uv --help` and `uv help` should have the same effect.

Currently, only the latter has the `generate-shell-completion` entry.
