# Quality of life - suggest `uv self update` if needed

---

_Issue opened by @strangemonad on 2025-05-01 16:47_

### Summary

When a project requires a new version of uv, the error currently isn't indicative of the solution to the problem.

e.g. 
```
❯ uv sync
error: Required uv version `>=0.6.0` does not match the running version `0.5.24`
```

It would be great if there was at least a message about running `uv self update` 

### Example

_No response_

That's a good idea.

It might also be advisable to give the user a non-intrusive update prompt if the number of days since last update exceeds a certain threshold - since uv isn't updated automatically or via package management I imagine there are many users running on an out-of-date version, blissfully unaware until it presents an issue. Tealdeer/tldr handles this pretty gracefully for its db updates, it could be similarly handled by a single line addition at runtime to the effect of:

> uv [version number] is out of date: run `uv self update` at next convenience

Goes without saying this is probably advisable for executions of installed Ruff as well.

Should be straightforward if anyone wants to give it a try. In `crates/uv/src/lib.rs`, we should check if the current version is lower than the lower-bound version on the target range by going through `Ranges<Version>`. If so, we should show the hint. This code should only run if the `self-update` feature is enabled.
