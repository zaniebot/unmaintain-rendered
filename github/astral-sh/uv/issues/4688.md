# Incomplete message for `uv tool install azure-cli --prerelease=allow`

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-07-01 11:43_

I get the following for `uv tool install azure-cli --prerelease=allow`:
```
warning: `uv tool install` is experimental and may change without warning.
Resolved 143 packages in 400ms
Installed 143 packages in 49ms
 + adal==1.2.7
 + antlr4-python3-runtime==4.13.1
...
 + wrapt==1.16.0
 + xmltodict==0.13.0
Installed: 
```
The part behind `Installed: ` is empty. Same problem for uninstall.

Does it have any entrypoints

It has `azure_cli-2.61.0.data/scripts/` entrypoints, not regular `entry_points.txt`

Ok thanks! Probably missing that. We should also fix the logging in the event that it legitimately has no entrypoints (warn).

Another example (we use data scripts):

```
❯ uv tool install ruff
