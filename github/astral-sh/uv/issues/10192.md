# python-install-mirror in uv.toml

---

_Issue opened by @andreas-vester on 2024-12-27 10:15_

I am getting an error when configuring ``python-install-mirror`` in ``uv.toml`` rather than an environment variable.

```toml
[[python-install-mirror]]
url = "file://c:/tmp"
```

Opening a Windows Powershell, this will give me the following error:
``FullyQualifiedErrorId : ParameterArgumentValidationErrorEmptyStringNotAllowed,Microsoft.Powershell.Commands.InvokeExpressionCommand``

Using bash is basically the same error:
``invalid type: sequence, expected a string``

```bash
uv --version
uv 0.5.12 (351d602d8 2024-12-26)
```

I think you might have set it up incorrectly.
