# (docs): typo on `--build-constraints` (should be singular)

---

_Issue opened by @lmmx on 2024-09-11 23:19_

> `uv build --build-constraints constraints.txt --require-hashes`

```
0.442 error: unexpected argument '--build-constraints' found
0.442 
0.442   tip: a similar argument exists: '--build-constraint'
0.442 
0.442 Usage: uv build --sdist --wheel --out-dir <OUT_DIR> --build-constraint <BUILD_CONSTRAINT> [SRC]
0.442 
0.442 For more information, try '--help'.
------
Dockerfile:20
```

I copied the docs directly so I assume typo there

> uv build accepts --build-constraints, which can be used to constrain the versions of any build requirements during the build process. When coupled with --require-hashes, uv will enforce that the requirement used to build the project match specific, known hashes, for reproducibility.

If I had the bandwidth I would submit a PR to fix but I'm on a Docker build tightrope right now, apologies :heart_hands: I've made a note to check back and submit if someone else didn't tomorrow
