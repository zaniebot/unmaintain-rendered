# uv self update fails with github token error

---

_Issue opened by @Ramesh-kumar-S on 2025-06-13 08:02_

### Question

I am just trying to see how the `uv self update` works, yet it is failing with below error.

```
(UV) [root@testmachine UV]# uv self update
info: Checking for updates...
error: failed to execute installer
  Caused by: Permission denied (os error 13)
(UV) [root@testmachine UV]# 
```

Yet when we do `uv pip install --reinstall uv`, It works seamlessly.

Any reason for that ?


### Platform

Linux 5.14.0-427.40.1.el9_4.x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv-self 0.6.17

The self update uses the GitHub API, which has rate limits. You can pass `UV_GITHUB_TOKEN` for a custom token. `uv pip install --reinstall uv` uses PyPI, which doesn't have those rate limits.

I don't think

>  Caused by: Permission denied (os error 13)

Has anything to do with the GitHub token though, that's an error from your operating system.

Yeah that's definitely a FS error... wait `uv pip install --reinstall uv` works? How did you install `uv` in the first place?

What does `which -a uv` print?

Got same error
```bash
❯ uv self update
info: Checking for updates...
error: GitHub API rate limit exceeded. Please provide a GitHub token via the `--token` option.
```
add `--token` with personal access token fixed it though

We can't do anything about GitHub rate limiting you, unfortunately. We'd need to host our artifacts elsewhere.

There is another error.
```
> uv self update --token <personal access token>
info: Checking for updates...
error: HTTP status client error (401 Unauthorized) for url (https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv/releases)
```

I also have this problem since 2 weeks now, how can always hit the rate limit?

_Comment by @Else00 on 2025-09-24 07:25_

How can I make that it always use the token? there is a file where i can save it so that it automatically loads it?

You can set the environment variable [`UV_GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_github_token).

For the problem caused by `Permission denied`, changing the path to the temporary directory helped me.
```sh
TMPDIR=/var/tmp uv self update
```
