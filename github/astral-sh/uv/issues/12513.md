# Minimal example of FsatAPI and uv

---

_Issue opened by @brunolnetto on 2025-03-27 18:58_

### Question

This may be a simple use case, but is instructive for developers of all levels: in case I use uv within Dockerfile, only installing it with command `pip install uv` and running `uv sync` does not enable an environment neither installs the dependencies. How is the proper way to write a Dockerfile with uv for a FastAPI project?

### Platform

Ubuntu 20.04

### Version

uv 0.5.11
