# Probably wrong python version is used when creating venv

---

_Issue opened by @jfcherng on 2024-08-29 09:29_

On a Windows machine, I have a user-installed Python 3.12 under `C:\Users\jfcherng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python` and uv-installed Python 3.8 under `C:\Users\jfcherng\AppData\Roaming\uv\data\python`. They can be found as the following

```
$ uv python list
cpython-3.12.5-windows-x86_64-none     C:\Users\jfcherng\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe
cpython-3.12.5-windows-x86_64-none     <download available>
cpython-3.11.9-windows-x86_64-none     <download available>
cpython-3.10.14-windows-x86_64-none    <download available>
cpython-3.9.19-windows-x86_64-none     <download available>
cpython-3.8.19-windows-x86_64-none     C:\Users\jfcherng\AppData\Roaming\uv\data\python\cpython-3.8.19-windows-x86_64-none\python.exe
pypy-3.7.13-windows-x86_64-none        <download available>
```

When I create a venv (anywhere such as a random empty directory), it uses uv-installed Python 3.8. I would expect it uses the latest Python 3.12. Currently I must add an extra `--python 3.12`.

## Environments

- `$ uv --version`: uv 0.4.1 (823f23e22 2024-08-30)
- Platform: x86_64-pc-windows
- `uv` binary path:

```
$ which uv
/c/Users/jfcherng/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312/Scripts/uv
```

Setting `UV_PYTHON` env variable to `cp312` is an acceptable solution.
