# `pip-compile` should error if specified extra is not found in any sources

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-10-30 19:51_

Per discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/puffin/pull/239 — `pip-compile --extra <name>` should error if the name is not present in _any_ of the source files i.e. the name can be missing from one but not all. `requirements.txt` formatted files provide an empty set of extra names. `pyproject.toml` files provide extra names in the `optional-dependencies` keys.

Note this behavior differs from `pip-compile` upstream which does not error or warn in this case.
