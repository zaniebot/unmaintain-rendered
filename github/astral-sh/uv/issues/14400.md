# `uv init` why does it think an unrelated dir is a workspace member?

---

_Issue opened by @anentropic on 2025-07-01 18:33_

### Summary

I created a new empty dir `~/dev/myproject`

I `cd` into it...

```
~/dev/myproject
╰─ ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x@  2 pgarner  staff    64  1 Jul 19:12 .
drwxr-xr-x@ 65 pgarner  staff  2080  1 Jul 19:12 ..
```

 ...and run `uv init .` (or `uv init myproject`)

> error: Failed to discover parent workspace; use `uv init --no-workspace` to ignore
>  Caused by: Nested workspaces are not supported, but workspace member (`~/dev/my-other-project`) has a `uv.workspace` table

I don't understand why `~/dev/my-other-project` (which does use uv workspace in its pyproject.toml) affects anything here? it's in a sibling directory path

### Platform

Darwin 23.6.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.7.13 (62ed17b23 2025-06-12)

### Python version

error: Nested workspaces are not supported

Can you share a minimal reproduction please? e.g., in the `/tmp` directory?

never mind, I just found my parent directory unexpectedly had a pyproject.toml in it

some kind of leftovers from a mis-targeted project init in the past
