# Move test package for extra build dependencies into source tree

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-08-04 23:47_

Instead of declaring this weird package structure in each test (see "Write a test package that arbitrarily requires `anyio` at build time"), we should just put a package alongside our other test packages in `scripts/packages`
