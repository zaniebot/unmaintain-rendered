# Move benchmarks to published documentation

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-07 23:08_

I'm not sure we _need_ this, but we should at least have a page in the Reference section for benchmarks. It could link to the repository, but it'd be nice to separate "running the benchmarks" (`BENCHMARKS.md`) from the "benchmark results" (`docs/reference/benchmarks.md`)?
