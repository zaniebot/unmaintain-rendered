# [question] uv or rye?

_Issue opened by @Jordan-Haidee on 2024-07-24 02:52_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
I have noticed that UV is currently experimentally supporting some RYE features, such as:
uv init $\gets$ rye init
uv add $\gets$ rye add
uv sync $\gets$ rye sync
uv python install $\gets$ rye fetch 
rye? uv?
I wonder who will be the ultimate tool for Python developers in the future?❤️
