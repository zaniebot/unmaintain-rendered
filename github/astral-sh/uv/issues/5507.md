# `uv build` command?

---

_Issue opened by @nekitdev on 2024-07-27 10:58_

I've searched through issues in this repository but I couldn't find anything concrete.
What's the progress/roadmap for this command? The only time I've seen it mentioned is in the [blog](https://astral.sh/blog/uv).

Interested as well to switch from Rye to uv, we need build publish command. Any news ?

I think this is a duplicate of #1510 — and yes we intend to do it.

It's here now! I switched all our workflows to `uv build` from 0.4.5. Works like a charm.
