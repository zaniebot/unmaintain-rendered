When trying to resolve a very big project (413 direct dependencies and 673 indirect dependencies).
I can't share the specific requirements.
I'm consistently running out of fds:

```
error: Failed to write to the client cache
  Caused by: Too many open files (os error 24) at path "/Users/yoavalon/.cache/uv/simple-v12/pypi/.tmpPKond8"
```

macOS has a very low open-file limit. Running `ulimit -n 16000` should unblock you here.

if you are running this when building with Docker, there are CLI flags to control the file handle limit during that process.

Unfortunately not much we can do about this — the default is weirdly low.

Going to close. The answer is above for future readers, but if it continues to come up we can add to the docs explicitly.
