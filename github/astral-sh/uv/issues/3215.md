# Disable lock to allow parallel installs?

---

_Issue opened by @fersarr on 2024-04-23 16:22_

This is more of a question: 

We have a script that creates a copy of your venv (like a twin) and the special thing about this use case is that instead of installing `package_a, package_b, etc.` , we install `package_a==version_x, package_b==version_y, etc`. And because we have the full list, we can install them using `pip install --no-deps ...`. So, in this particular use case, we improved the speed of the creation of the twin by running pip in parallel, so that we install a group of packages in each parallel run. I tried to do this parallelization with `uv` but it looks like there's a lock, so there are no speed ups compared to unparalellized `uv`. Or is `uv` already smart enough out-of-the-box to do the parallelization itself given that we are using `--no-deps`?

Yeah, uv already installs in parallel so there'd be no speed-up to (e.g.) splitting the packages in half and then running uv in a separate process for each subset. (This differs from pip, which does not perform a parallel install.) So, yes, uv should already be doing all the parallelization, and you shouldn't need to this package grouping.

(Closing for now since you should just be able to do a single `uv pip install` here, but happy to answer any follow-up questions.)
