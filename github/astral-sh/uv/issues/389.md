# pip-sync error when removing __pycache__

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-11-10 14:52_

There is no context (we should add more), but the cause to be `__pycache__` being different from other installed files

```
Resolved 94 packages in 24ms
Downloaded 94 packages in 5.40s
Unzipped 94 packages in 241ms
error: failed to remove file `/home/konsti/projects/puffin/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip/_vendor/urllib3/util/__pycache__`
  Caused by: Is a directory (os error 21)
```

I guess the RECORD is including a directory? I can't reproduce but that feels wrong!

Found a way to reproduce.
