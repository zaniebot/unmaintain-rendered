# Option to disable all dependency groups in `uv sync`

---

_Issue opened by @mkniewallner on 2025-01-14 12:32_

Let's consider this `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "foo"
version = "0.0.1"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["httpx==0.28.1"]

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["ruff==0.9.1"]
typing = ["mypy==1.14.1"]

[tool.uv]
package = false
default-groups = ["dev", "typing"]
```

If not setting `default-groups`, only `dev` will be included by default, meaning that it's possible to not sync any dependency group by using:

```shell
uv sync --no-dev
```

But when setting `default-groups` as shown above, as both `dev` and `typing` groups are included by default, running `uv sync --no-dev` will install dependencies from `typing` group.

It's probably the expected behaviour, and there's a way to also not install `typing` group by using:

```shell
uv sync --no-dev --no-group typing

# or
uv sync --no-group dev --no-group typing
```

But there's AFAIK no way to completely disable all dependency groups during sync. There is an `--all-groups` option to sync all groups, so maybe having something like `--no-groups` could make sense to have as well? Otherwise, it's easy to forget to add another `--no-group <group>` if adding a new group that would also be in `default-groups` later on.

Although it would be a breaking change, maybe in the future `--no-dev` could also skip all dependency groups by default? I must say that as a user, I was expecting that this would skip all dependency groups, even if set in `default-groups`.

+1 on this request.

No other groups that the defaults should be resolved unless explicitly requested in `default-groups` otherwise if modules are accessible under temporary `index` there is no option to disable such modules and uv will always fail to resolve deps.
