# How to enable tab completion in pdb in a uv environment

---

_Issue opened by @Zhaoyilunnn on 2025-09-23 03:31_

### Question

Hi Team, thanks a lot for building uv, it's amazing.

I am a user switching from anaconda/miniconda to uv. Recently I found one issue that bothers me in a uv-created virtual python environment.

I *think* it is quite easy to reproduce

```
uv venv
python -m pdb <some-test-python-file>

# try to use <Tab> completion in pdb
```

Then the `<Tab>` will output spaces rather than complete variable/function names. I understand there must be some configurations, e.g., maybe try using `.pdbrc`, to solve this issue. 

However, when I use `conda` in the past, I never encounter this issue, seems that the tab-completion feature is out-of-box in conda-bundled python. 

Is there any workaround to easily enable tab-completion of `pdb` in `uv`? 

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

### Version

uv 0.7.2

Is this a readline problem @geofft?

I have the same issue:

```shell
$ uv --version
uv 0.8.17 (10960bc13 2025-09-10)

$ uname -orsm
Darwin 24.6.0 arm64
```
