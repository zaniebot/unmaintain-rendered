# Warn when project options are used with `uv run` outside a project

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-07 13:11_

e.g., `--dev`, `--no-dev`, `--extra`, `--all-extras`, `--no-all-extras`

Maybe , `--no-project`.

These appear to be ignored right now, e.g.

```
❯ uv run --dev --extra foo script.py
warning: `uv run` is experimental and may change without warning
Reading inline script metadata from: script.py
```
