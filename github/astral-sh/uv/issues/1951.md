# Add `--require-hashes` support

---

_Issue opened by @epicserve on 2024-02-24 14:45_

So far, UV is excellent and so much faster! Thank you guys for making it. I'm trying to include it in my [Django Base Site](https://github.com/epicserve/django-base-site/) project.

Before, in my docker file, I had the following:
```
$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r config/requirements/${ENV_NAME}_lock.txt
```

Now, when I tried to switch to UV, the following didn't work:
```
$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/uv pip install --require-hashes -r config/requirements/${ENV_NAME}_lock.txt
```

I got the following error:
```
error: unexpected argument '--require-hashes' found

  tip: a similar argument exists: '--requirement'

Usage: uv pip install <PACKAGE|--requirement <REQUIREMENT>|--editable <EDITABLE>> <PACKAGE|--requirement <REQUIREMENT>|--editable <EDITABLE>|--constraint <CONSTRAINT>|--override <OVERRIDE>|--extra <EXTRA>|--all-extras|--upgrade|--upgrade-package <UPGRADE_PACKAGE>|--reinstall|--reinstall-package <REINSTALL_PACKAGE>|--offline|--refresh|--refresh-package <REFRESH_PACKAGE>|--no-deps|--link-mode <LINK_MODE>|--resolution <RESOLUTION>|--prerelease <PRERELEASE>|--output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>|--index-url <INDEX_URL>|--extra-index-url <EXTRA_INDEX_URL>|--find-links <FIND_LINKS>|--no-index|--legacy-setup-py|--no-build|--no-binary <NO_BINARY>|--only-binary <ONLY_BINARY>|--config-setting <CONFIG_SETTING>|--strict|--exclude-newer <EXCLUDE_NEWER>>

For more information, try '--help'.
```

Taking out `--require-hashes` works.

Sorry if this is a duplicate of #474.

👍 `--require-hashes` is not yet supported but we definitely plan to support it.

(I think this can be merged in #474.)
