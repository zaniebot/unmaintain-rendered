# Feature request: local git dependencies

---

_Issue opened by @patrick-kidger on 2024-04-18 13:48_

`uv` doesn't seem to support local git dependencies:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/7688f464c8377f7d4c67c371f0aa9550bb0b86ac/crates/distribution-types/src/lib.rs#L312

e.g.
```
foo_lib==git+file://../foo_lib#egg=foo_lib-3.1.4
```
It'd be awesome if this was supported, as we have cases in which multiple libraries all sit inside the same git repo, as sibling folders. (In this scenario I think there should probably be no or minimal caching from `uv`, since git already has a copy anyway.)

I should acknowledge that we are able to work around this by spinning up a local server and serving it as a URL dependency:
```
foo_lib @ http://localhost:8000/foo_lib-3.1.4-py3-none-any.whl
```
the main downside is just that this is (I assume) a lot slower.

Thank you for the excellent tool!

pip, poetry and pipx all support installing from a subdirectory with the following syntax:

    pip install git+https://git@github.com/organisation/repository.git#subdirectory=package-directory

But I don't know if this syntax is supported by `uv`.
