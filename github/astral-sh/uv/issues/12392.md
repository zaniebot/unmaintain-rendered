# `uv build` should output information about built artifacts in machine-readable form.

---

_Issue opened by @scolby33 on 2025-03-22 15:58_

### Summary

I would like to use `uv build` as part of a pipeline (in particular, in a GitHub action, but this doesn't matter particularly) and further process the built artifacts. Right now, I have a couple of non-ideal options for this:

1. parse the stderr output from the build invocation and look for the lines starting with `Successfully built `
2. clear the `dist/` directory before running `uv build` and then afterwards use a glob or something to get all the files in that directory, and assume that nothing extra snuck in

It would be good if `uv` could output the paths to the built artifacts in a machine-readable form (JSON? but I don't really care which). Alternatively, perhaps the built paths could be output on stdout, so no parsing is necessary to get the paths. (This would have the classic problem of filenames with newlines being problematic, but I'm not sure if that's really an issue here.)

### Example

These are just examples, I'm not particularly concerned about exact formats
```console
$ uv build --sdist --json
...snip...all current build output on stderr...
[{"path": "dist/foo-1.0.0.tar.gz", "type": "sdist", "successful": true}]  # on stdout
```

or

```console
$ uv build
...snip...all current build output on stderr...
Successfully built dist/foo-1.0.0.tar.gz  # still on stderr
Successfully built dist/foo-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl  # still on stderr
dist/foo-1.0.0.tar.gz  # stdout
dist/foo-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl  # stdout
```

See also #411 — we want to do this everywhere but need to build some patterns to make it maintainable.

Maybe we could use `-q` here (#12300) to just print the file names? cc @Gankra

In the meantime, would it be possible to document/"promise" not to change the output format from `Successfully built {--out-dir}/{filename}`? (I believe currently defined [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/7c57cefaa863cf8d617207c31f6ae9be95e2b11b/crates/uv/src/commands/build_frontend.rs#L1203-L1207))

@scolby33 -- If we change that output, I think we would consider it breaking (so, per our versioning policy, it would only change in a minor (and not a patch) release).

Currently, we print all status and successful build messages to stderr. When adding JSON output, this would print the JSON to stdout, which should not require any breaking changes.

I think we could add filenames to stdout (e.g., always or toggled via `-q`?) without the JSON format.
