# install.sh throws error

---

_Issue opened by @DavidACunningham on 2025-04-28 14:47_

### Summary

While running uv-install.sh I receive the output:


```
downloading uv 0.6.17 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
curl: (23) client returned ERROR on write of 16375 bytes
failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.6.17/uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
this may be a standard network error, but it may also indicate
that uv's release process is not working. When in doubt
please feel free to open an issue!
```

When I navigate to the actual tar.gz file manually and initiate a download, the file is there and downloads correctly.



### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04.1 x86-64, linux 6.11.0-24-generic kernel

### Version

0.6.17

### Python version

Python 3.12.3

Found other duplicate issues. For anyone reading this:

`sudo snap remove curl`
`sudo apt install curl`

The issue appears to be with the snap curl distribution.
