# uv reports PyPy version based on stdlib version rather than `pypy_version`

```

Note that in both cases only "stdlib" version is reported. However, the actual PyPy version (7.3.18) isn't. I think it would be helpful to include that version as well, to disambiguate between different PyPy releases using the same stdlib version.

For comparison:

```py
$ pypy3.10
Python 3.10.16 (e90335a7776c, Feb 06 2025, 19:09:14)
[PyPy 7.3.18 with GCC 14.2.1 20241221] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>> import sys
>>>> sys.version_info
sys.version_info(major=3, minor=10, micro=16, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
>>>> sys.pypy_version_info
sys.pypy_version_info(major=7, minor=3, micro=18, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
$ pypy3.11
Python 3.11.11 (b38de282cead, Feb 19 2025, 06:03:07)
[PyPy 7.3.18 with GCC 14.2.1 20241221] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>> import sys
>>>> sys.version_info

```

This was sort of intentional, but I see the case for a clearer message here.
