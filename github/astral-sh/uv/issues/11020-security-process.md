# Security Process

---

_Issue opened by @schirrmacher on 2025-01-28 14:49_

### Summary

I am working with customers who have high security standards who thought about using your tooling. 

Typically a evaluation criteria for software solutions in the context of security reviews and various compliance frameworks is to have a process for the creation of CVEs or security issues.

It seems your security dashboard is empty: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/security

How can security researchers inform you about security findings?
Do you have a CVE process?


### Example

_No response_

Hi!

I'll publish a `SECURITY.md` file shortly describing our process.
