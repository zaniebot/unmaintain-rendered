# Specify a commit instead of tag with `tool.uv.sources`

---

_Issue opened by @cthoyt on 2024-10-23 08:14_

On https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/, it gives an option to specify a git repository with a tag, but not a specific commit. Is this possible?

e.g., I would like to do


```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
wonderwords = { git = "https://github.com/mrmaxguns/wonderwordsmodule", commit = "5dfa455554e7c225a59c865d706c4293ca2c132e" }
```

Because this package https://github.com/mrmaxguns/wonderwordsmodule has made a "release" but not made a tag nor a release to PyPI

You can use `rev`.

```
[tool.uv.sources]
wonderwords = { git = "https://github.com/mrmaxguns/wonderwordsmodule", rev = "5dfa455554e7c225a59c865d706c4293ca2c132e" }
```

Amazing! I can make a PR to the documentation to make this more clear
