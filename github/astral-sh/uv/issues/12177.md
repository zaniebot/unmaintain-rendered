# Cannot detect libc on termux

---

_Issue opened by @Disonantemus on 2025-03-14 20:31_

System: Termux (updated)

```ocaml
$ uname --all
Linux localhost 4.19.113-27223811 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Dec 27 13:00:08 KST 2024 aarch64 Android
~
$ uv --version
uv 0.6.3
```

Because I need a feature not in older Termux version, I did download latest binary from github:

```ocaml
$ ./bin/uv --version
uv 0.6.6
~
$ ./bin/uv python list
error: Could not detect either glibc version nor musl libc version, at least one of which is required
```

But shows that error when I'm doing anything else besides show version, seems **confused** to me.

I'm doing something wrong?
I need to specify: glibc/musl in bash?

Update your Termux package, it might resolves the problem. As I'm today, this is the information I get from replicated the OP:
```
➜  ~  uv --version
uv 0.6.9
➜  ~  uname --all
Linux localhost 5.15.149-android13-8-o-00979-gfa10b73804e6 #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Feb 28 11:32:54 UTC 2025 aarch64 Android
➜  ~  uv python list
cpython-3.12.10-linux-aarch64-none    /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python3.12
cpython-3.12.10-linux-aarch64-none    /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python3 -> python3.12
cpython-3.12.10-linux-aarch64-none    /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python -> python3.12
➜  ~  which python
/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/python
```
Both of Python and uv are provided by Termux Package. And yeah, it is several versions away from latest one.

Thanks, now I have the same version, but I think the problem is: some python (tool) packages, are not pure python and use external packages that aren't in `Termux` and don't install, ex: that need many `tree-sitter` packages or need and updated python version (like `python 3.13` ).

I assumed the problem with libc has been solved.
