# Installing dependency with `--frozen` adds the dependency with no minimum version

---

_Issue opened by @egeres on 2025-03-11 10:26_

### Question

First of all, a massive thanks to the Astral team for all the quality work they have provided for the Python environment. High quality tooling is an essential part of what makes a great programming language and I believe they are pushing the boundaries of what is possible in Python. I'm extremely excited of the things that will come in the future and very happy to see such talented developers working together in such an interesting project, thank you so much ❤

# Question

When I add a dependency with `uv add <package> --frozen`, it will be added to the `pyproject.toml` without specifying the minimum required version:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "rich",
]
```

Instead of the usual:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "rich>=13.9.4",
]
```

Is this a design choice or a limitation that comes from avoiding creating a virtual environment? (I'm assuming if you don't create a virtual environment it might not be feasible to calculate the dependencies interactions and requirements?)

### Platform

Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.6.5

Thanks for the kind words :)

I believe this is generally intended because with `--frozen` we avoid resolving and installing the dependencies. To add a minimum version, we'd have to perform a resolution, and `--frozen` is often used when you _can't_ or don't want to resolve for whatever reason. I might suggest adding `--no-sync` instead of `--frozen`, if you just want the bound?

It looks like `--no-sync` was exactly what I was looking for!!! Thank you 🙌🏻
