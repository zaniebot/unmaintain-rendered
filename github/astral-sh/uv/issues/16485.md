# Logging is unclear when packages are excluded by release date

---

_Issue opened by @ncoghlan on 2025-10-28 15:06_

### Summary

Due to a copy-and-paste error, I was attempting to pin `mlx==0.29.3` while also having `exclude-newer = "2025-10-11T00:00:00Z"` set. That necessarily can't work because 0.29.3 wasn't published until October 18.

However, the debug output from `uv lock -vvv` was *not* helpful in working out what was wrong, as there was no mention that the date filter was being applied:

```
TRACE Received package metadata for: mlx
TRACE Selecting candidate for mlx with range >=0.29.3, <0.29.3+ with 45 remote versions
DEBUG Searching for a compatible version of mlx (>=0.29.3, <0.29.3+)
TRACE Selecting candidate for mlx with range >=0.29.3, <0.29.3+ with 45 remote versions
TRACE Found candidate for package mlx with range >=0.29.3, <0.29.3+ after 1 steps: 0.29.3 version
TRACE Found candidate for package mlx with range >=0.29.3, <0.29.3+ after 1 steps: 0.29.3 version
TRACE Exhausted all candidates for package mlx with range >=0.29.3, <0.29.3+ after 1 steps
TRACE Exhausted all candidates for package mlx with range >=0.29.3, <0.29.3+ after 1 steps
DEBUG No compatible version found for: mlx
```

### Example

In the above output, I'd like to see a debug message along the lines of:

```
DEBUG Excluding candidates for mlx published after 2025-10-11T00:00:00Z
```
