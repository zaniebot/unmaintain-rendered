# Windows Install - Use winget

---

_Issue opened by @jfmatth on 2025-01-28 15:12_

### Summary

I love UV!  What a great product, thank you.

As a Windows 11 user, I've recently discovered the amazing package manager ```winget``` that is included with Windows now.

Using Winget to install UV allows you to easily keep the .exe updated in a timely manner.

```
winget install astral-sh.uv
```

Installs all the necessary libraries and puts UV in your path

Don't we already have that? Even though it's community-supported.

Dooh, you are correct.  I guess RTFM is in order here.

Thanks @FishAlchemist
