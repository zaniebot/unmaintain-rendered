# uv.lock use different indexes for each package

---

_Issue opened by @joselsegura on 2025-08-11 11:16_

### Question

I want to specify 3 optional dependencies under the "tools" extra name. One of them is not available in my company private repository. I was able to add it using `--index` option, but the `uv.lock` becomes updated, pointing ALL the packages to that private repository instead of the regular Pypi index.

Is there a non-manual way to handle this? Make the uv.lock to get all its dependencies from Pypi, and just the needed ones from the private repository.

### Platform

Linux, Python 3.12

### Version

0.8.8

See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#pinning-a-package-to-an-index

You want an explicit index.
