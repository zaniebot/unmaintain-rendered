# `uv toolchain uninstall` repeats "No installations" message

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-04 17:50_

Can we omit this in most cases? All cases?

```
❯ cargo run -- python uninstall 3.12
   Compiling uv v0.2.21 (/Users/crmarsh/workspace/uv/crates/uv)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.20s
     Running `target/debug/uv python uninstall 3.12`

It's a little more sane with a couple requests:

```
❯ cargo run -q -- python uninstall 3.11 3.12
warning: `uv python uninstall` is experimental and may change without warning.
Looking for Python installations matching Python 3.11 (any-3.11-any-any-any)
No installations found matching Python 3.11
Looking for Python installations matching Python 3.12 (any-3.12-any-any-any)
No installations found matching Python 3.12
No installations found matching the requests
```

It seems like we could adjust it when there's one or make some of the lines tracing output?
