# Support user customize the `toml` config template file for `pyproject.toml` generating

---

_Issue opened by @haiw2sm on 2025-12-13 07:20_

### Summary

Add a template or cache config file for generating the `pyproject.toml` file in workspace may be better for reducing the some basicly unchanged config snippets, i saw the pyproject is a struct object, and has a `dynamic` field in the repository source code, maybe its exist have some deep think.

i tried the following ways to help `pyproject.toml` to generate, such as
- configued the `~/.config/uv/uv.toml`
  maybe only implicitly changed the `{tool.uv.}index`, other `Table` fields had been ignored.
- pointed the commandline parameter `--config-file`
  result is the same to the above the way

maybe the `json, xml, yaml` format config file both are ok, then reference some editors' new file header customizer.

### Example

```toml
[[package]]
keywords = ["hello", "world", "..."]

[[build-backend.targets.wheel]]
packages=["src/foo"]  # for habitual naming package

[[index]]
url= "..." # maybe could be explicitly added or overrided the `pyproject.toml`

# other valid fields ( or future)
others = "..."
```

```json
{
  "labels": ["...supported_toml_table_field", "...dynamic_non_toml_table_field"],
  "[field]":{
      "[sub_field]": {
       ".....": "..."
     }
  }
}

```
