# Adding option to generate uv.lock file without the Development dependencies

---

_Issue opened by @borisgurzhovski-itgma on 2024-12-17 11:23_

Is it possible (maybe add it as future improvement) to add an option to generate an `uv.lock` file which won't include the Development dependencies?
 
Something similar to the `--no-dev` option, that won't install the Development dependencies when runing `uv run` or `uv sync`, but this will generate the `uv.lock` without them.

I am running the version 0.5.6
On a Docker container from python:3.9.20-slim-bookworm image
Command I am running is  `uv.lock` (full command is: `docker run -it --rm --volume "$PWD":/app DOCKER_NAME uv lock`)

Verbose output is:
`DEBUG uv 0.5.6`
`DEBUG Found workspace root: '/app'`
`DEBUG Adding current workspace member: '/app'`
`DEBUG Reading Python requests from version file at '/app/.python-version'`
`DEBUG Using Python request '3.9.20' from version file at '.python-version'`
`DEBUG The virtual environment's Python version satisfies '3.9.20'`
`DEBUG Using request timeout of 30s`
`DEBUG Found static 'pyproject.toml' for: xxx @ file:///app`
`DEBUG No workspace root found, using project root`
`DEBUG Existing 'uv.lock' satisfies workspace requirements`
 
Thanks in advance.

What's the motivation for omitting development dependencies from the lockfile itself?

Hi Charlie, thank you for your reply. 

I think it will be more clear/better overview of the file, if the development dependencies are not in the lock file.
Anyway this is just my perspective.

Thank you for your time.

Got it! I'm going to pass on this suggestion for now as I think it makes sense to lock with the dev dependencies regardless.

How was this implemented, can't find the doc, and It's closed as completed.

My usecase for a lockfile without dev dependencies is to let Gitlab generate an SBOM without them (as dev Dependencies don't make sense in an SBOM after all)

if it isn't actually implemented, how about allowing `uv export` to also export to the `uv.lock` format. (because it doesn't seem to be able to do that rn)

```sh
$ uv --version
uv 0.8.8


$ uv export --no-dev --help
Export the project's lockfile to an alternate format

Usage: uv export [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --format <FORMAT>                    The format to which `uv.lock` should be exported [possible values: requirements.txt,
                                           pylock.toml]
```

Checkout the docs. [I think it's what you are looking for](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/#exporting-the-lockfile).
