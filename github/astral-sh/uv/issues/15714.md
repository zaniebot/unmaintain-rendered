# Allow setting .env file path in pyproject.toml or self-contained script front-matter

_Issue opened by @strangemonad on 2025-09-07 18:07_

### Summary

It would be very convenient to pre-configure projects to load an env file without having to instruct people to set `[UV_ENV_FILE](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_env_file)=... uv .` or `uv run --env-file...`. Instead, the project (or standalone script) could be optionally configured with a default `[tool.uv] env-file=...`

1. This would continue the tradition of making `uv run ...` a convenient and easy entry-point to projects
2. Continue allowing the env-vars and config file settings to match for most options.

**Security concerns**
Since this potentially exposes a security concerns (beyond the existing exposure of executing code) a few different approaches could be taken if the `env-file` setting is set in config:

1. Create a new setting eg `UV_ALLOW_ENV_FILE=NEVER_ALLOW | ALWAYS_PROMPT | PROMPT_ONCE_PER_PROJECT (first time) | ALWAYS`
2. Potentially restrict the path of `env-file` when set in config (e.g. to be contained in the project directory) to prevent exposures like a self-contained script loading `~/.env-secrets`
