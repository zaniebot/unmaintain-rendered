# Enhancement Request: `uv pip install` with explicit venv path

---

_Issue opened by @charlesnicholson on 2024-02-17 16:31_

Thanks for `uv`, it's very impressive! :)

Our build system creates and manages a virtual environment that's used for later parts of the build, and to host editably-installed packages that have console script entry points.

To remove complexity (environment variables, python versions, PATH shenanigans) and potential ambiguity, we try to avoid modally entering the virtual environment via `activate`, and instead invoke `pip` via the venv's python:

`/path/to/my/venv/bin/python -m pip ...`

(We do this on mac/linux and also windows, but I'm just using the non-windows forms here)

Right now, `uv pip` seems to require running inside of a modally-activated venv. It would be very handy if we could give `uv pip` an explicit path to the virtual environment directory, similar to how `uv venv` can be given an explicit python interpreter.

Hi! Thank you :)

You can provide the virtual environment path via the `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable or, if you run `python -m uv`, we'll automatically detect the virtual environment (#1504).

We may consider adding this as a CLI option too, I think there are a couple other similar issues about that.

Thanks for the quick response, and sorry I missed the `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable; if I can set that before spawning `uv` that'll totally work for us. :)

`python -m uv` is interesting and I think even nicer; would it be interesting to have an option like `--seed` for `uv venv` that also installed `uv` into the new venv? That would handle bootstrapping pretty elegantly, I think.

Hm yeah it seems like we should probably stub `uv` into the environment by default so that you can use `python -m uv`. I'm not exactly sure what that would look like.

If the Python `uv` package uses uv functionality by bundling the executable, it might be nice to have a venv-creation bootstrap copy-in the `uv` executable that invoked the `venv` command. That would be nice for pinning versions etc; for a single-file executable like this, we'd version it by just checking it into git.

Ah and here's the other one for the CLI option, going to close this in favor of those https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1396
