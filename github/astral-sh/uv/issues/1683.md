# Trailing slash needed in URL link address in requirements.in when `uv pip compile requirements.in`

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I have a `requirements.in` that contain one line that looks something like:

`-f https://extranet.helloworld.com/public/wheels`

Running `uv pip compile requirements.in` gives error `HTTP status client error (404 Not Found) for url`.
However, if I add a trailing slash to the URL address, i.e.:

`-f https://extranet.helloworld.com/public/wheels/` 

it works fine.

I expected the trailing slash would not be needed.

Do you have a public index that I can reproduce this with?
