# Add support for t/csh Auto-Completion

---

_Issue opened by @PathosV on 2025-03-14 16:35_

### Summary

As of v0.6.6, generate-shell-completion only states support for bash, elvish, fish, nushell, powershell, zsh. Will tcsh/csh be available at some point in the future?

I have team members that unfortunately have not moved onto bash.

### Example

_No response_
