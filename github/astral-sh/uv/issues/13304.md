# "uv download" to create local directory of distributions + ability to install from the same

---

_Issue opened by @mdekstrand on 2025-05-05 16:20_

### Summary

I am looking for options to archive my dependencies' distributions, primarily for bundling reproducible scientific workflows for archival and distribution.

I see some discussion about functionality like `venv-pack` or `conda-pack` (#8653, #6970), but they seem to be primarily about archiving the extracted virtual environment.

I think another solution could provide a lot of the same benefits, including supporting airgapped installs, without the need for solving the various arcane problems involved in bundling and relocating entire virtual environments: the ability to bundle the _distributions_, optionally also including the wheels built from sdists. The basic idea has two parts:

1. A command, maybe `uv download` or a new option for `uv export`, that copies the distributions from the cache into a specified directory, for either the current platform or all locked platforms.
2. An option to `uv sync` that uses the files from the exported directory (possibly just pre-seeding them into the cache).

### Example

Preparing the archive:

```console
$ uv download --all-platforms -o dist/dependencies/
248 distributions downloaded
```

Installing from archive:

```console
$ uv sync --dist-archive dist/dependencies
```

I think the downloaded archive would be in structure the same as a [flat index](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#flat-indexes), so, all that's needed for installing it is a flat index pointing at that directory, right? Can a flat index be specified on the CLI?

Separately, as noted in the linked `pip downlaod` discussion, is it perhaps more appropriate to provide the equivalent of `pip wheel` (or at least a flag for it) since it builds wheels for packages which don't come with a pre-built one.
