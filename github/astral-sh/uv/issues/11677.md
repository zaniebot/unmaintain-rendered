# uv sync --no-default-groups: error Default group `dev` (from `tool.uv.default-groups`) is not defined in `dependency-groups` table

_Issue opened by @JWCS on 2025-02-20 20:11_

### Summary

IMO, --no-default-groups shouldn't error on the pyproject.toml not defining a group. An external user may be trying to only install core dependencies (no extras are included by default), and so use this flag as a common default. Warning at best?

Edit: only happens when explicitly have tool.uv.default-groups defined with a group, that's not defined, which is a sufficiently weird case to warrant this error. When not explicitly defined, no error, which is what I expected. 

### Example

_No response_
