# Stabilize the uv build backend

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-06-26 20:43_

There are no known blockers for this.

This is a blocker for making the uv build backend the default under `--package` / `--lib` in `uv init` (ref https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/14298)

We must do this before 0.8, but it's not breaking.
