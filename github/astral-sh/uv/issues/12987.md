# Update docs for `system` / `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` to mention they only apply to `uv pip`

---

_Issue opened by @edmorley on 2025-04-20 11:51_

The `system` config setting and the `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` env var only apply to the `uv pip` interface (and not eg `uv sync`), however, the docs for these don't mention that - so I suspect some users will get confused? 

See:
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#pip_system
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_system_python

(I only know they don't apply to `uv sync` due to being part of the `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` discussion etc)

Though perhaps the longer term fix is #9431?

Bumping this up.

> I suspect some users will get confused?

I _know_ some users _do_ get confused (including myself):
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12715
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9067
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8126

Even if this will be fixed by #9431, the documentation should be changed before then.

There should also probably be documentation in the "other direction" (`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` doesn't affect `uv pip`)
