# `uv run pytest` vs `pytest`

---

_Issue opened by @oliverangelil on 2025-02-13 19:31_

### Question

I've created a venv called "myenv" and activated it with `source myenv/bin/activate`

I then install dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml` with `uv pip install -e .`

`uv pip list` gives:

> Using Python 3.12.0 environment at: myenv
> Package           Version Editable project location
> ----------------- ------- -------------------------
> aims-mlops        0.1.0   /workspaces/AIMS_course
> iniconfig         2.0.0
> nodeenv           1.9.1
> numpy             2.2.2
> packaging         24.2
> pluggy            1.5.0
> pyright           1.1.393
> pytest            8.3.4
> ruff              0.9.5
> scipy             1.15.1
> typing-extensions 4.12.2

I want to run unit tests next. 
Running `pytest` runs them as expected; running `uv run pytest` created a new env `.venv` and installs all packages in there, and then runs pytest...

What is `uv run pytest` doing? When would I want to execute `uv run pytest` instead of `pytest`?

### Platform

OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

### Version

0.5.31

`uv run` is part of our "project interface" — it manages environments for you. In contrast, `uv pip` is the low-level interface for manual environment management. 

Both are fine, just different levels of abstraction.

Thanks - how can I then run `uv run pytest` without it creating a new .venv? I want it to run within the currently activated `myenv`.

The more you embrace the project workflow, the better your experience will be. I suggest using `.venv` as facilitated by uv. The generally philosophy here is that if you embrace the project workflow, things will "just work", and you don't have to worry about low-level operations like creating a virtual environment or installing a specific dependency. Another way to think about it: if you use `uv run`, you shouldn't ever need to create the environment yourself.

If you want to reuse the active environment, though, you can pass the `--active` flag to `uv run`.

Ok thanks. 

Note that I still find the difference between `pytest` and `uv run pytest` confusing. The latter is for when `pytest` is not yet installed, no?

Do you have a recommended approach to take for uv users?

The latter will always ensure `pytest` is installed. If the environment is up-to-date, we won't install it again. This avoids needing to concern yourself about whether or not the environment is ready or not.

The recommendation is to use `uv run` unless you're in an overhead sensitive context.
