# Support `pyproject.toml` et al in `uv add`

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-16 22:28_

This would be powerful because we could import projects that use other tools... I think? We probably need to resolve the requirements with all extras enabled for that project, then add as optional dependencies where appropriate.
