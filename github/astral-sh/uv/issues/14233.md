# Support sort of wrapper with uv version in-repo

---

_Issue opened by @janario on 2025-06-24 08:58_

### Summary

Feature request, support wrapper script to download uv with version definition in the project repo.

Like some other tools, they usually define in some repo file with which version of binary to use and provide some wrapper capable of downloading and re-using.

This is super useful to unify config and version selection across many different envs:
* ci/cd
* docker
* local
* ...

Feels tools that work with some sort of wrapper:
* [mvnw](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) (maven-wrapper.properties)
* [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) (required_version)
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (.python-version)
* [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#nvmrc) (.nvmrc)
* [kuberlr](https://github.com/flavio/kuberlr) (k8s cluster version)


Proposal: 

Have a `uvw` script capable of reading and some metadata(pyproject.toml, requires-uv=0.7.14) to download and reuse an uv with the exact version of the running project.

This way we would commit uvw and use it to run in different envs (ci/docker/local) ensuring we run with the exact same version.

### Example

```
./uvw sync
./uvw test
./uvw build

./uvw ...

```

./uvw:
* check pyproject.toml and pick up `requires-uv` version
* check if it was already downloaded, re-used it if so
* download the required version and pass arguments over to uv ...

Is this a duplicate of #6662?
