# Confused about status of linux-aarch64-musl

---

_Issue opened by @nbelakovski on 2025-03-18 15:08_

### Question

Please forgive me if I'm misunderstanding something, but according to #6890 there should now be builds for linux-aarch64-musl, but the following command on my M2 macbook gives no results:

`docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.6.7-alpine uv python list --all-versions`

If I run it with `--all-platforms`  and grep for musl I only see x86_64 in the list. Is there something else I need to do to be able to use uv to install python on aarch64-musl?



### Platform

macOS 14 arm

### Version

0.6.7

I think https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12121 only added distributions x86, not ARM.

It seems I may have answered my own question, it looks like python-build-standalone does not yet support aarch64-musl: https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/87

In that case I think #6890 was mistakenly closed and needs to be reopened :(
