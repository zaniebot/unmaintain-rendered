Use `uv remove tortoise-orm`. The square brackets are a extra feature that should be enabled inside of tortoise-orm.

As a usability improvement, it would be an idea to change the uv code that parses the package name to ignore a suffix in square brackets, to help users such as the above.

I suppose we could ignore the extra. But yeah, it doesn't quite make sense to include in this context.
