# uv sync does not respect [tool.uv.pip] settings

---

_Issue opened by @GalOzRlz on 2024-09-22 10:06_

Hello again! I believe this might be another issue, but if i have misunderstood the documentation please let me know.

I have this in my pyproject.toml file:
[tool.uv.pip]
resolution = "lowest-direct"

However I am getting higher resolution results with "uv sync" than what I get with "uv sync --resolution lowest-direct"

Am I missing something?

You need to remove the “pip” part — so use [tool.uv] instead of [tool.uv.pip]. The latter only applies to uv pip commands; the former applies everywhere.
