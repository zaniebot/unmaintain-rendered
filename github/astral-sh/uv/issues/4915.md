# Python discovery error should comma-separate

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-09 05:24_

In:

```
❯ cargo run -- run -vv --preview --isolated --python 3.12.4 python -V
error: No interpreter found for Python 3.12.4 in virtual environments or managed installations or system path
```

It should read: `virtual environments, managed installations, or system path`.
