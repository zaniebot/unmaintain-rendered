# Document `--only-binary` behavior when using unnamed requirements

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-03-22 19:07_

We should highlight all exemptions from `--only-binary` and note differences from `pip` in our compatibility document. Note that `pip` does not necessarily have intuitive behavior here as discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2600#discussion_r1534779844. This is also an opportunity to highlight any behaviors we should change.
