# Benchmark

---

_Issue opened by @ondrej-profant-dtml on 2025-07-14 09:12_

### Summary

Thank you very much for the [existing benchmark](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).

When migrating our organization from PyEnv + Poetry, I noticed an even greater performance difference in PyEnv. I think it would be worthwhile to benchmark this strong point as well, as mentioned.

I'd suggest a Pull Request, but I'm not entirely sure how to compare a global PyEnv installation versus a local uv installation. However, that's likely just my lack of knowledge/uncertainty.

### Example

When I tried it out (just use unix `time` cmd), I found the following results:

| Tool  | Executed in | CPU time |
|-------|------------:|---------:|
| uv    |        3.11 |     1.20 |
| pyenv |       94.40 |   343.14 |

In both cases, the values represent the average of two measurements, in seconds.

What command are you benchmarking there?

_Comment by @ondrej-profant-dtml on 2025-07-14 14:20_

Something like: `time uv python install 3.14` vs `time sudo pyenv install 3.14-dev`

But I am uncertainty about cache and equality of commands. In one case there is a sudo... But for me as end user is important the speed of uv.

Oh, it's very expected that `pyenv` will take much longer to install because it has to build the Python distribution on your machine. I don't think we'd want to show a benchmark for that since we're not doing the same operation, though yeah it's a benefit that uv doesn't do that :)
