# Python version in pyproject.toml or .python-version or both?

---

_Issue opened by @Gabriel-p on 2025-03-14 15:33_

### Question

I don't understand why the same Python version must be stored in two separate files.

What is the user case for this and what is the proper way to handle these files when I need to change the Python version of my project? Must I manually edit both files?

I tried to see if `uv python pin` would lift the version from the .toml file and create a .python-version file but that does not work.


### Platform

_No response_

### Version

_No response_

Typically you would specify a lower bound for Python in `pyproject.toml`; that is, the oldest version of Python that your package supports.

In contrast, `.python-version` specifies which Python version, concretely, to use during development. 

Example:
You want to use a development venv with Python 3.13, but indicate that your package runs with Python 3.10 and newer.
Here, you would have 3.13 in `.python-version`, and `>= 3.10` in `pyproject.toml`.

I hope this helps.

Ohh ok, this clarifies a lot thank you very much.

One more question: is [this suggestion](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8247#issuecomment-2475669567) also not planned? It seems like it would make this a quite easier to understand
