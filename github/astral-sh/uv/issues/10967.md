# Universal resolution docs need adjusting for Python version forking

---

_Issue opened by @edmorley on 2025-01-26 12:51_

The universal resolution docs currently say:

> During universal resolution, all selected dependency versions must be compatible with the _entire_
`requires-python` range declared in the `pyproject.toml`. For example, if a project's
`requires-python` is `>=3.8`, then uv will not allow _any_ dependency versions that are limited to,
e.g., Python 3.9 and later, as they are not compatible with Python 3.8, the lower bound of the
project's supported range. 

(https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/86ec6c86dde57ed222377be633e93e3f6d8937e9/docs/concepts/resolution.md?plain=1#L100C1-L104C28)

However, I don't believe this part is correct, now that the lockfile can contain multiple versions of the same package. 

For example, package `foo` could be listed twice in the lockfile, with foo v2 supporting only Python 3.9+ and foo v1 included for Python 3.8 support. In this scenario it wouldn't be correct to say:
`uv will not allow _any_ dependency versions that are limited to, e.g., Python 3.9 and later`

...since foo v2 is exactly that.
