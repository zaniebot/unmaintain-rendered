# (🎁) add a `show` or `info` subcommand to show details about a package, both locally and on pypi (including extras)

`uv pip show` is buried within `uv pip`, and it doesn't show information for a package that isn't installed

compare that to something like `npm show`, which will show you the details from the package registry:
```console
> npm show basedpyright

basedpyright@1.24.0 | MIT | deps: none | versions: 961
a pyright fork with various type checking improvements, improved vscode support and pylance features built into the language server
https://github.com/detachhead/basedpyright#readme

bin: pyright, basedpyright, pyright-langserver, basedpyright-langserver

dist
.tarball: https://registry.npmjs.org/basedpyright/-/basedpyright-1.24.0.tgz

i wanted this because i needed to know what extras `beautifulsoup4` has, and needed to dig into their source code

I agree this would be very useful. It's also related to #5975 which aligns in the sense it is giving information about the (uv-managed) project itself (rather than one on the registry etc.), when calling `uv show` with no subcommands.
