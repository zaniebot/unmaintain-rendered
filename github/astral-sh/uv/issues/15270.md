Trixie is still relatively new though, I'd say maybe wait a tad longer unless registry size becomes an issue?

We should drop Alpine 3.21 for Alpine 3.22 in 0.9.0 though as python's images are already Alpine 3.22 by default

I remember some packages taking ages to implement support for bookworm when it was new (in that case because of the update to OpenSSL 3.x). I'd recommend against dropping bookworm so soon, there'll probably be plenty of users that can't upgrade yet.

Thanks for the feedback. I'm happy to push it to a future date. We should probably have some sort of policy to determine when it's time to drop it.
