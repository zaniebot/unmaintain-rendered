# Add `uv tool info` (and maybe `uv tool search`)

---

_Issue opened by @martimlobao on 2025-12-11 13:21_

### Summary

I use `uv` as a package manager for things that are hosted on pypi. It would be nice to add some additional functionality to learn more about and search for available tools.

For example, this is what `brew` provides for `ruff`, which is also (obviously) available to install via `uv`:

```bash
❯ brew search ruff
==> Formulae
ruff             ruff-lsp         sqruff           truffle          trufflehog       riff

~
❯ brew info ruff
==> ruff: stable 0.14.8 (bottled), HEAD
Extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/
Not installed
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/r/ruff.rb

==> Options

        Install HEAD version
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula/ruff.json
==> Analytics
install: 10,098 (30 days), 30,482 (90 days), 105,553 (365 days)
install-on-request: 9,949 (30 days), 29,975 (90 days), 102,565 (365 days)
build-error: 0 (30 days)
```

For the info that gets returned, I think at a minimum this should include a description, a website/github/pypi/github page, and the current version. I think the description can also get parsed directly from pypi (e.g. [here](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/#:~:text=Dec%204%2C%202025-,an%20extremely%20fast%20python%20linter%20and%20code%20formatter%2C%20written%20in%20rust,-.)).
