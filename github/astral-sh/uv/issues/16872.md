# Editable mode ignored when reading from requirement-file

---

_Issue opened by @FreeHarry on 2025-11-27 11:18_

### Summary

When executing the command

`uv add --script <script> -r <requirement-file>`

Inside the `<requirement-file>` I have specified a local package to use it in editable mode:

`-e ./scripts/packages/editable_pkg`

I would expect that this package is added in the inline script metadata as editable package:

```
# [tool.uv.sources]
# pkg_name = { path = "./scripts/packages/editable_pkg", editable = true}
```

But when running the command, the editable flag (editable = true) is NOT set:

```
# [tool.uv.sources]
# pkg_name = { path = "./scripts/packages/editable_pkg"}
```

It seems for me like a bug or at least that some info is not evaluated. Or is it intended to not take over the editable flag from the `<requirement-file>`? 

### Platform

Windows 11 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.9.13 (7ca92dcf6 2025-11-26)

### Python version

Python 3.14

There's `--editable`/`--no-editable` on the CLI, but when importing from a requirements file, we should respect that if no CLI flag is set.
