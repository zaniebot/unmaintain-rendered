_Issue opened by @Wim-De-Clercq on 2024-02-28 09:24_

### Reproduce

pyproject.toml:
```
[project]
version = "0.0.1"
name = "my_package"
dependencies = [
    "uv==0.1.11",
]
```
command:
```
uv pip compile --quiet -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```
output:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile --quiet -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml
uv==0.1.11
```
\+ requirements.txt generated.

### info

**_Behaviour_**: The whole output file gets printed on console
**_Expected_**: No output, only a generated requirements.txt
**_platform_**: linux, ubuntu 22
**_uv version_**: 0.1.11

Update: after more debugging, it seems a lingering 0.1.10 install was still installed from cargo.

After removing all PATH changes to include `.cargo/bin` in `.profile` and `.bashrc`, this issue appears to be resolved in 0.1.11 installed via pip.

I will close this for now.
