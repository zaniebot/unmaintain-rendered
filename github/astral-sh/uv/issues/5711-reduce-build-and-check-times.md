# Reduce build and check times

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-01 20:32_

I can update this with some concrete timing information, but `cargo build` and `cargo clippy` times are on the rise as the project grows. This is a tracking issue to improve the situation and discuss sources of slowness.

Anyone is welcome to get involved here, this is a great way to improve the health of the project without deep knowledge of Python packaging.
