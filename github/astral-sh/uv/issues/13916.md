# component-detector support to read uv.lock

### Question

FYI, I'm attempting to add component-dector support for `uv` by reading in the `uv.lock` toml file. It is similar to other implementations. The tool is used to create a graph of dependencies for every build and the graphs are input into another system to produce a list of security vulnerabilities. If you wish to review, here is the pull request:

Great to see uv being integrated into other tooling!

From a quick skim, nothing stands out to me.
