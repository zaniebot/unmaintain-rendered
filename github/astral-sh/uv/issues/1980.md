# `install_git_private_https_pat_and_username` breaks git

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-02-26 09:35_

Running `install_git_private_https_pat_and_username` inserts the user and password for astral-test-user into my keyring:

![image](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/assets/6826232/3507bf99-4003-4130-ba1f-ba2be453cedf)

This breaks my git setup because now _all_ invocations in any repository with a github remote try to use the astral-test-user for github:

```
$ git push
remote: Permission to astral-sh/uv.git denied to astral-test-bot.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

The test suite should not change a developer's user wide settings, especially if that breaks git.

This is annoying... sorry.

The solution is probably to create a temporary [git config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#SCOPES) then configure or disable the [git credential helper](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials) — I don't think we should need one enabled at all this test.

@konstin is this fixed.... or did we just turn the test off?

You're right, we only turned the test off
