# Use override to "unrequire" or remove a downstream dependency

We can currently use overrides to make the version required of a dependency of a dependency more permissive. It would be nice to be able to blacklist one entirely.

Hi!

This is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4422 which includes a solution using overrides to remove dependencies.
