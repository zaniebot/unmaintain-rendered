# How to use uv while being able to constrain exactly where uv installs itself?

### Question

Trying out uv I noticed it put files into `~/.local/uv` and `~/.cache/uv`. The latter can be controlled with `UV_CACHE_DIR` but the former can't be it seems. Based on the weird errors I've been encountering over the past several days, I'm wondering if uv might be modifying other things. Regardless, how can one have complete control over what modify modifies?

### Platform

mac OS and ubuntu

### Version

_No response_
