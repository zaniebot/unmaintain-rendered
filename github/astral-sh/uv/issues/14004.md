# Filter `uv.lock`ed wheel files based on name

---

_Issue opened by @JonZeolla on 2025-06-12 19:56_

### Summary

The best idea I've been able to come up with is to add some kind of a wheel regex filter at lock time to handle filtering on manylinux specifics, etc. since there aren't available markers / constraints for this afaict

In my scenario we use `sam` for python lambda deploys, which requires a `requirements.txt` which we create via `uv export`, and then `sam` hard codes `manylinux2014` (see https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/7860 and https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/7744) but that causes downstream issues, so we're looking to create a `requirements.txt` (and ostensibly keep `uv.lock` in sync) which only contains versions of packages which have wheels build for `manylinux_x_y`, for instance.

### Example

`--filter-wheels manylinux_2_28` or something like that? I'm not sure.

Does this mean you are looking for something like https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#required-environments, but specifically for a manylinux upper bound?

Aha! Yes @konstin that could work, for a manylinux range or upper/lower bound

I have some other situations where I'd like a lower bound

The upstream fixed my issue (https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/8101) but this still makes sense to me to add to `uv` at some point.
