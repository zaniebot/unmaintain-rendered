# Add zip support for uv run

---

_Issue opened by @mraesener-aubex on 2025-05-04 19:35_

### Summary

I've implemented a little tool which kind of just wraps around `uv run` by providing two commands "zip" and "run" with defaults and some options. so you can just do `pytron zip` within a folder and you'll get a `robot.zip` file and then anywhere else you can just `pytron run` the robot.zip again.


this is more or less cloned functionality from rcc.exe which was closed source recently and I think it could be a great feature for uv.

I'm not sure if I'm seasoned enough in Rust yet that I'd give a PR a try - but first I'd like to maybe start a discussion and ask what you guys think about this and if you'd be willing to continue somewhere along those lines.

https://github.com/aubex/pytron

disclaimer: this has nothing to do with "pytron" available on pypi, I just liked the name and didn't bother to check if it's already taken.

### Example

### `pytron zip` - Package Your Project
```bash
pytron zip [directory] -o [output.zip] [--ignore-patterns]
```

### `pytron run` - Execute Python Code
```bash
pytron run [UV_ARGS] [ZIPFILE/SCRIPT] [SCRIPT_ARGS]
```

as an after thought I realized that I didn't check yet how `uv run` handles arguments which are meant to be passed to the invoked script - so this would probably change the syntax here and maybe I implemented something unnecessary.

since I already have this implemented I can also just paste the help texts to maybe make the idea super clear (hopefully):

```bash
pytron -h
Usage: pytron <COMMAND>

Commands:
  zip   Zip files in a directory into robot.zip respecting .gitignore
  run   Run a script - either directly or from a zip archive
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

```bash
pytron zip -h
Zip files in a directory into robot.zip respecting .gitignore

Usage: pytron zip [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]

Arguments:
  [DIRECTORY]  Directory to zip [default: .]

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          Output zip filename [default: robot.zip]
  -i, --ignore-patterns <IGNORE_PATTERNS>
          Additional patterns to ignore (besides .gitignore) These are treated as gitignore patterns Default patterns include ".git" directory Pass an empty string to override all default excludes
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

```bash
pytron run -h
Run a script - either directly or from a zip archive

Arguments are separated using a double-dash (--) or by specifying a script/zipfile path:
  - Arguments before -- or before the zipfile path are passed to uv run
  - Arguments after -- or after the zipfile path are passed to the script

Special flags:
  -h/--help: Show this help message (pytron's help)
  -hh/--uv-run-help: Show uv's help message

Usage: pytron run [UV_ARGS] [ZIPFILE] [SCRIPT] [SCRIPT_ARGS]...

Arguments:
  [ZIPFILE]
          Path to the zip file or script
          If a zip file (.zip), will extract and run the specified script from it
          If a Python file (.py), will run it directly using uv

          [default: robot.zip]

  [SCRIPT]
          Script to run from the zip (if zipfile is a zip archive)
          If running a script directly, this is optional

          [default: main.py]

  [UV_ARGS]...
          Arguments passed to the uv run command
          These appear before the -- separator or before the zipfile path
          Examples:
            --with-pip
            --system-site-packages
            -v (verbose)

  [SCRIPT_ARGS]...
          Arguments passed to your Python script
          These appear after the -- separator or after the zipfile path
          Examples:
            --verbose
            --config=config.json
            -o output.txt

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```
