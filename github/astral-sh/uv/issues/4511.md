# Consider adding `uv new`

---

_Issue opened by @vlad-ivanov-name on 2024-06-25 09:41_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

Given that `uv` is getting more and more project management features, from UX point of view it feels like `uv` should have `uv new` to create a new `pyproject.toml` file. Ideally this should integrate with other uv facilities such as toolchain management and lockfiles

Whoops, sorry -- I did search `uv new` but not `uv init` 😅
