# Clarification on Long-Term Licensing and Free Usage of UV for Enterprise Use

---

_Issue opened by @shaikmoeed on 2025-05-01 18:35_

### Question

Hi UV team,

Thanks for the great work on UV — it's shaping up to be a fantastic tool.

Before considering it for use in a enterprise/production setup, I wanted to ask if there are any plans to change the current MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing model or introduce any paid/commercial tiers in the future.

I understand that licensing can evolve, but having clarity on this would help me (and probably others/organisations) feel more confident using UV long-term at scale.

I've seen a few similar questions come up online, so I thought it might be helpful to raise it here for visibility.

Appreciate any info you can share!

Thanks!

No, we don't plan to change the current MIT/Apache 2.0 licensing model or introduce a paid tier to uv. (We'll likely build complementary, hosted services with first-class uv support, but those would not be "required" nor would they affect uv's licensing.)
