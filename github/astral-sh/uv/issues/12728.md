# Install yields `failed to download`

---

_Issue opened by @LarsKue on 2025-04-07 19:59_

### Summary

Running the standard install command that fetches the install shell script fails for me with:

```bash
$> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
downloading uv 0.6.12 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
curl: (23) client returned ERROR on write of 16375 bytes
failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.6.12/uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
this may be a standard network error, but it may also indicate
that uv's release process is not working. When in doubt
please feel free to open an issue
```

I could not discover an issue on my side. Downloading the archive manually works fine. I worked around the issue now by reassigning the `$_file` variable in the shell script at the appropriate location to my manually downloaded version, so this seems like an issue in the release process as suggested by the error message.

I searched this error in the issues but could not find an existing issue. If this is a duplicate, I'd be happy to close it.

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04

### Version

0.6.12

### Python version

3.12.3

Thanks for the report!

I've never seen this before.

Hi! I have experienced similar problems recently as I tried installing uv after upgrading my Ubuntu to 24.04 (also using Python 12). I was able to install using `curl` after reinstalling the `curl` tool according to #11849 and this [solution](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11849#issuecomment-2691088757)

Basically just doing:
`sudo snap remove curl`
`sudo apt install curl`
