# Building fails if you use README.org vs README.md

---

_Issue opened by @vikigenius on 2024-12-11 18:28_

`uv sync` fails if you use a README.org file instead of README.md

Change in pyproject.toml
`readme = "README.org"`

Error

```
  ╰─▶ Build backend failed to build editable through `build_editable` (exit status: 1)

This isn't a uv issue -- notice that the error comes from hatchling.

For other reasons, I happen to have been just looking at the hatcling docs for this: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/metadata/#readme 

Must be a md, rst, or txt, or you have to manually specify the content-type, in the "complex" tab: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/metadata/#complex.
