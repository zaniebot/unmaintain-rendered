# Add somewhat analog to "sudo !!"

---

_Issue opened by @devitq on 2025-02-16 10:23_

### Description

Suggest to add an analog of `sudo !!` it may look like `uv run !!` and it will rerun latest command in terminal with uv run.

This is a terminal feature, e.g.

```
❯ uv pip install anyio

❯ echo !!

~/workspace/uv                                                                                                                                                                                                 
❯ echo uv pip install anyio
```

So, in a real example, this is already available (or should be depending on your shell)

```
❯ pip install anyio
zsh: command not found: pip
❯ uv run !!
❯ uv run pip install anyio
Requirement already satisfied: anyio in ./.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (4.8.0)
Requirement already satisfied: idna>=2.8 in ./.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (from anyio) (3.10)
Requirement already satisfied: sniffio>=1.1 in ./.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages (from anyio) (1.3.1)
```
