I think this looks right. It looks like you installed ty outside of uv, then wanted to overwrite that install with a uv-managed one?

---

_Comment by @klonuo on 2025-09-03 14:07_

No, ty was installed by uv globally, and I wanted to update as usual

I don't think it could have been, or uv wouldn't have complained it existed.

e.g.,

```
❯ uv tool install ty
Resolved 1 package in 205ms
Prepared 1 package in 695ms
Installed 1 package in 3ms
 + ty==0.0.1a20
Installed 1 executable: ty
❯ uv tool install ty
`ty` is already installed
❯ uv tool install ty@0.0.1a19
Resolved 1 package in 88ms
Prepared 1 package in 629ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 1ms
Installed 1 package in 3ms
 - ty==0.0.1a20
 + ty==0.0.1a19
Installed 1 executable: ty
```

The error you're seeing happens if `ty` exists already

```
❯ uv tool uninstall ty
Uninstalled 1 executable: ty
❯ touch ~/.local/bin/ty
❯ uv tool install ty
Resolved 1 package in 14ms
Installed 1 package in 5ms
 + ty==0.0.1a20
error: Executable already exists: ty (use `--force` to overwrite)
```

I'm not sure how it got there on your system.

Yes it existed I actively use ty on daily bases, I had version a19 and there was new version so I tried to update the same way as usual

Now I tried what you did and it's even more confusing:

It won't upgrade there because you've pinned a specific version at install time.

I found the issue while trying now to update uv: 

```
The current executable is at `C:\Users\klo\.local\bin\uv.exe` but the standalone installer was used to install uv to `C:\Users\klo\AppData\Local\com.Langflow\uv`. Are multiple copies of uv installed?
```

So this program (Langflow) somehow managed to mess with my global uv

That indeed sounds like they're improperly installed uv such that it wasn't isolated.

---

_Comment by @klonuo on 2025-09-03 16:03_

They added their folder in PATH. Didn't cleanup by themselves even after uninstall
