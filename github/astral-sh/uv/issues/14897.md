# uv build failing CI/CD pipeline since last week

---

_Issue opened by @Anon-jCqx on 2025-07-25 15:38_

### Question

I have tried everything to  figure out the source distribution unpack error but nothing seems to work. 

Tried `uv cache clean`  and still no luck.

```
  ╰─▶ symlink destination for /usr/local/bin/python3 is outside of the target
      directory
```


### Platform

_No response_

### Version

uv 0.8.3

Yep, I confirm that too, just happened to me in GitLab CI.  I was just running `uv build`

```
Building source distribution...

This was working before . so I am bit surprised, it started failing all of a sudden. I am new to uv and that's proving an added disadvantage in trying to fix this..

Sorry, but it was working before in a way that was in violation of the Python package specification. You definitely don't want your virtual environment to be included in your distributions.
