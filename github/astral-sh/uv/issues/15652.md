# document that the uv build backend uses `.pth` files for editable installs by default

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-09-03 10:00_

there seems to be some confusion regarding the different methods of installing an editable package. from what i can tell, uv's build backend uses `.pth` files by default instead of import hooks. however the [pyright documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/import-resolution?id=uv) was recently updated to state that passing `{ editable_mode = "compat" }` to uv's build backend is necessary to enable this behavior. as far as i can tell, this is only necessary when using setuptools as the build backend.

i think it would be a good idea to document editable installs [somewhere here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/build-backend/). i saw [this section](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#editable-dependencies) but i think that's only talking about the frontend

The problem described in pyright's documentation to my best knowledge is only a problem with setuptools, other build backends default to `.pth` files. The advice they share is for the case of using uv a build frontend (e.g. `uv sync`, `uv pip install -e .`) with setuptools as backend (`build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"`), if you're using the uv_build backend (with any frontend), or uv with a different build backend, you are not affected. See also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1708#issuecomment-2174463476 and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3898. I proposed some changes to the pyright docs to clarify this: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/pull/10888

This has been fixed in the pyright docs.
