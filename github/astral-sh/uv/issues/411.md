# Add support for a JSON output format for machine readable output throughout uv

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-11-13 13:26_

Our main commands should have a json output format that can be in downstream applications such as auditing, dependabot-like application and our own testing.

See the linked issues for support in a specific command.

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3199 has relevant context for implementing this in the `uv pip` interfaces

Would love to have this for non-interactive terminals! Any idea when this will be implemented? @Gankra

This is gonna take a while and will have to be done piecemeal interface-by-interface.

Some commands like `uv python list` will probably want to just dump a single json object.

Other commands that compile/install packages will probably benefit from a json-lines streaming output, like [the one you can see in cargo/rustc's interface](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages).

It would be helpful to know what commands people specifically need/want this output from to prioritize.

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1442 would be at the top of my list 🙂

`uv pip install` is at the top of my list! When installing large downloads like pytorch, it's really helpful to have some form of machine readable progress.

Is this still planned?

Yep!

If breaking json schemas too often is a concern, perhaps versioning could be added. Stuff like `uv python list --format=json@v2`, this way breaking changes could be avoided.
