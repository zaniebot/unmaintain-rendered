# Improve UX when `uv add` or `uv sync` are run in a directory with no `pyproject.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @edmorley on 2025-04-20 13:06_

### Summary

Currently if `uv add` or `uv sync` are run in a directory with no `pyproject.toml`, the resultant error message is:

```
$ mkdir testcase-uv && cd $_
$ uv add urllib3
error: No `pyproject.toml` found in current directory or any parent directory
$ uv sync
error: No `pyproject.toml` found in current directory or any parent directory
```

To improve the UX for users migrating from pip (or uv's `uv pip` interface), it would help if this error message hinted that the user should probably run `uv init` or else see the uv getting started docs.


### Example

Perhaps something roughly like this?

```
$ uv add urllib3
error: No `pyproject.toml` found in current directory or any parent directory.
To create one run `uv init`, or see: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/
```

We probably want to use the `hint:` or `help:` formatting here. Makes sense though.

So far, we don't link to the documentation because it's not versioned and therefore not guaranteed to be stable.
