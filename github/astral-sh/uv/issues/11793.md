# Workspace parsing logic differ between macOS and windows

---

_Issue opened by @gab23r on 2025-02-26 09:45_

### Summary

I work with a workspace setup, and my repository is structured as follows:
```
albatross
├── libs
│   ├── bird-feeder
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── bird_feeder
│   │           ├── __init__.py
│   │           └── foo.py
│   ├── seeds
│   │   ├── pyproject.toml
│   │   └── src
│   │       └── seeds
│   │           ├── __init__.py
│   │           └── bar.py
|   └── Jenkinsfile  <<<< I have an extra file here. 
└─ pyproject.toml
```

**pyproject.toml**
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["libs/*"]

On macOS the extra file is ignored by default.
On windows I get: 
error: Workspace member `C:\Users\user\dev\albatross\libs\Jenkinsfile` is missing a `pyproject.toml` (matches: `libs/*`)

So on windows I need to explicitly exclude the file like that:
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["libs/*"]
exclude = ["libs/Jenkinsfile"]

This isn't a major issue, but it would be preferable to have consistent behavior across both platforms.
