              Python recognizes 'pydevd_attach_to_process.common' as an importable package[^1],
              but it is absent from setuptools' `packages` configuration.

              This leads to an ambiguous overall configuration. If you want to distribute this
              package, please make sure that 'pydevd_attach_to_process.common' is explicitly added
              to the `packages` configuration field.

              Alternatively, you can also rely on setuptools' discovery methods
              (for example by using `find_namespace_packages(...)`/`find_namespace:`
              instead of `find_packages(...)`/`find:`).

              You can read more about "package discovery" on setuptools documentation page:

              - https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/package_discovery.html

              If you don't want 'pydevd_attach_to_process.common' to be distributed and are
              already explicitly excluding 'pydevd_attach_to_process.common' via
              `find_namespace_packages(...)/find_namespace` or `find_packages(...)/find`,
              you can try to use `exclude_package_data`, or `include-package-data=False` in
              combination with a more fine grained `package-data` configuration.

              You can read more about "package data files" on setuptools documentation page:

                    directory, all directories are treated like packages.

Have you looked at our [build failure](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/troubleshooting/build-failures/) troubleshooting guide?

Does this work with `pip` when you use the `--use-pep517 --no-cache --force-reinstall` flags?

> --use-pep517 --no-cache --force-reinstall
Yes this one work as well: 

` pip install --use-pep517 --no-cache --force-reinstall pydevd-pycharm~=243.24978.54`

Unfortunately this builds without issue on my Windows machine.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2025-02-16 18:15_

For what it's worth, the uv logs show that you're using Python 3.10, not Python 3.9.

So both `uv pip install ...` and `pip install ...` are working?
I've try with clean 3.13 venv setup but again I got printout, So maybe something is off with my machine, can I get some more logs to dig deeper?
