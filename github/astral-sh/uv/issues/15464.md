# Include explicit privacy statement in docs

---

_Issue opened by @abeyerpath on 2025-08-22 22:21_

### Summary

The documentation (and maybe also refs in README.md and/or installer spew) should include a privacy statement and disclosure.

It would be good practice to be explicit about what _isn't_ collected. Also would be handy to head off questions about things like linehaul that might be surprising to some people or prone to trigger audit questions or IDS alerts. (eg #8474)

### Example

_No response_

It'd be great to open an upstream issue in pip requesting this too. We're following them here, and afaik there is no such documentation on their end.

I would have expected that pip would have had that already, but doesn't seem to. There were a few requests around features for limiting or modifying the linehaul data, but no docs. 

I opened a similar https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/13559

That aside I do still believe it would be beneficial (even if just repeating what upstream says) to also have it within uv.
