# Consider requiring explicit `VIRTUAL_ENV` for `uv run` tests

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-09-03 19:34_

Right now, the `uv run` tests set `VIRTUAL_ENV` by default but other project commands do not (#6976).

Following https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6864, this means we'll see some warnings in snapshots. We should considering not setting it by default and instead setting it explicitly in the relevant `uv run` tests.
