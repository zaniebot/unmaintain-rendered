# Improve `pip freeze`

---

_Issue opened by @T-256 on 2024-04-19 14:46_

- [ ] Add `--exclude-seed` as same as pip's default behavior and as opposite of pip's `freeze --all`.
- [ ] Add `--exclude <EXCLUDE>` as same as uv's `pip list`.
- [ ] Add `--format <FORMAT>` as same as uv's `pip list`:
  - [ ] make `freeze` value the default.
  - [ ] new `version` value to avoid using url and editable in output (only `{pkg}=={version}` in output). same behavior as `pip list`.
  - [ ] new `name` value to get only list of pkg names. (urls and editable are revealment).

IMO, by these improvements, `freeze` and `list` would be the same mostly!
