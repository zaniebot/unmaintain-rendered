# Add note to `bench/__main__.py` about requirement inputs

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-15 18:01_

We should have a couple example runs with requirements inputs from the repository.

We should clarify when `requirements.in` should be used vs `requirements.txt` — the failure when the wrong one is given is very confusing.
