# Will uv replace rye?

---

_Issue opened by @zen-xu on 2024-09-05 06:35_

I found that there is a significant overlap between the features of uv and [rye](https://github.com/astral-sh/rye). Since you are maintaining both projects simultaneously, I wonder if rye will eventually be completely replaced by uv.
