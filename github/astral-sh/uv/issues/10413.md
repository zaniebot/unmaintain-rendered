# How do I stop uv from modifying config files

---

_Issue opened by @Pilgrim1379 on 2025-01-08 22:17_

Every time UV updates, it modifies my `bashrc` and `zshrc files with `$HOME/.local/share/../bin/env`. 

How can I stop this? I already have the settings in my config files in a way that works for me.
