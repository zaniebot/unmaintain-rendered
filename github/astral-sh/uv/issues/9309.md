# List available upgrades for tools with `uv tool list --outdated`

---

_Issue opened by @traynier on 2024-11-21 11:03_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

Is there no way of seeing updates for tools?

I currently have ruff 0.7.3 installed.  I can successfully upgrade the tool using `uv tool upgrade ruff`, which updates it to 0.7.4, but would like to see what is available to upgrade first so that I can go and read the release notes (and put it in a script to show me when new versions are available).  I used `uv tool install ruff` rather than just running via uvx so that I can use generate-shell-completion for it (that does not work when running under uvx as starting a command with `uvx ruff ...` does not show shell completion for `ruff ...`)

I am using uv 0.5.3 on Windows, with Powershell 7.4.6

```
> uv tool list
ruff v0.7.3
- ruff.exe
```

My uv installed version of ruff is old, but I would have expected to be able to use --outdated like on uv pip list / uv tree
```
> uv tool list --outdated
error: unexpected argument '--outdated' found

Usage: uv.exe tool list [OPTIONS]
```



I was looking at if there was other ways of doing this, but it appears not.  Oddly, the shell completion for powershell gives --no-upgrade as an option on `uv tool upgrade` :
```
> uv tool upgrade --no-upgrade--allow-insecure-host
--all                         --index-strategy              --no-offline                  --resolution
--allow-insecure-host         --index-url                   --no-preview                  --show-settings
--allow-python-downloads      --isolated                    --no-progress                 --upgrade
--binary                      --keyring-provider            --no-python-downloads         --upgrade-package
--build                       --link-mode                   --no-reinstall                --verbose
--build-isolation             --native-tls                  --no-sources                  --version
--cache-dir                   --no-binary                   --no-upgrade                  -C
--color                       --no-binary-package           --offline                     -f
--compile-bytecode            --no-build                    --pre                         -h
--config-file                 --no-build-isolation          --prerelease                  -i
--config-setting              --no-build-isolation-package  --preview                     -n
--default-index               --no-build-package            --project                     -p
--directory                   --no-cache                    --python                      -P
--exclude-newer               --no-color                    --python-fetch                -q
--extra-index-url             --no-compile-bytecode         --python-preference           -U
--find-links                  --no-config                   --quiet                       -v
--help                        --no-index                    --reinstall                   -V
--index                       --no-native-tls               --reinstall-package

no-upgrade
```

But running it just gives an error:
```
> uv tool upgrade --no-upgrade ruff
thread 'main' panicked at crates\uv-cli\src\options.rs:18:17:
internal error: entered unreachable code: Clap should make this impossible
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

But that appears to be more an issue with the `uv generate-shell-completion powershell` as that option is not listed in the help/documentation?

I think `--outdated` makes sense to add here.

I need to look at why we're panicking there -- that's strange.

@charliermarsh 
In ``uv tool upgrade``, ``--upgrade`` is enabled by default. However, why not remove both ``--upgrade`` and ``--no-upgrade`` from ``uv tool upgrade``? 
After all, it seems odd for an upgrade tool to have a flag that doesn't upgrade or to explicitly mention upgrading.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-21 14:02_

It's a little bit of a pain. We have a common `ResolverInstallerArgs` struct for arguments that are shared across commands, and `--upgrade` is inherited from that.

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-21 14:11_

I'll fix it, it just requires some unfortunate duplication.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-21 14:22_

Cleaned up in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9318, but leaving this issue open since it's about `--outdated`.

Just my $0.02, but I think -n/--dry-run is a better flag for it. It's more in line with how other tools handle it, plus it can be a common flag for other sub-commands as well (e.g. install, uninstall, etc).  
  
Having an option to just list outdated packages would be very useful though, at least for my use-case. I have a script that uses ecosystem-specific tools for various platforms to check for and list all outdated packages. I like to see everything that can be upgraded before actually doing it, just in case it's not necessary or it might take a while and bog down resources.

I also **miss this!**

I have _many_ packages in my `uv tool list`, but some are _very large_ (coqui-tts, parllama, aider-chat) and I don't want to do a **blind** **upgrade** with `--all` (time consuming, slow connection, mobile), please **do this** in any way possible:

~~~
--outdated
-n | --dry-run
--upgradable
--ignore <package>
~~~

Maybe, there is a package to do this?

Any progress on this? I just came across the need to be able to list available updates.
