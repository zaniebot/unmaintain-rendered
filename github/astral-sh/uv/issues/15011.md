# False positive detection by Windows Defender removes uvw.exe

---

_Issue opened by @pansy1110 on 2025-08-01 02:12_

### Summary

### Description  
When manually installing UV by extracting `uv-i686-pc-windows-msvc.zip` to a custom directory (e.g., `D:\Software\uv`), Windows Defender detects `uvw.exe` as a threat (e.g., "Trojan:Script/Phonzy.A!ml") and automatically deletes it. This does not occur when using the official PowerShell install script (`irm astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex`).  


### Steps to Reproduce  
1. Download `uv-i686-pc-windows-msvc.zip` from GitHub Releases.  
2. Extract to a non-system drive (e.g., `D:\Software\uv`).  
3. Windows Defender quarantines/deletes `uvw.exe`.  


### Expected Behavior  
The executable should not be flagged as malicious, as it is part of the official release.  


### Workaround  
- Add `D:\Software\uv` to Windows Defender exclusion list.  
- Manually restore `uvw.exe` from Defender's quarantine.  


### Suggested Fix  
- Sign the Windows binaries with a Microsoft-compatible code signing certificate to reduce false positives.  
- Consider submitting `uvw.exe` to Microsoft for [false positive analysis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission).  


### Platform

Windows 10 x64

### Version

0.8.4

### Python version

Heavy recommendation on signing the executables. Seeing a significant uptick in enterprise antivirus tools starting to yank uv.
Having signed binaries is a significant factor in this.

Hello, 

I'm seeing the same now too, with this last update to 0.9.8, first within winget and also the same issue when using Scoop to install UV.
This is happening on the work laptop, with a rather aggressive antivirus that will wipe anything suspicious from disk immediately.
Main executable uv.exe is fine though, only uvw.exe is removed.

Same here, this got reported as suspicious in a security audit. I'd consider it rather high priority given that it shouldn't be a lot of work to sign executables and that the risk is to lose usage from enterprises.
