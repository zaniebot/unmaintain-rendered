There's evident inconsistent handling for `git+` install and local install. I do not care about other issue, but inconsistent behavior for handling `[tool.uv.sources]` section's `editable` option matters to me. I need a way to ignore the `editable=true` configured in `[tool.uv.sources]` for `uv pip install`.

Also I have some questions:
- Is `[tool.uv.sources]` consideration in `uv pip install` intended or not? I have no clue about it's intended or not, but with my brief thought, it would be more admirable for `[tool.uv.sources]` to be ignored to match `pip install`'s behavior. Of course, introducing argument or any way to ignore it or not may be more helpful.

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04

### Version

uv 0.7.20

### Python version

3.11

For reader's convenience, I attach `pyproject.toml` of open-world-agents repo:
```
[project]
name = "owa"
version = "0.5.3"
description = "Everything you need to build state-of-the-art foundation multimodal desktop agent, end-to-end."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "mcap-owa-support==0.5.3",
    "ocap==0.5.3",
    "owa-cli==0.5.3",
    "owa-core==0.5.3",
    "owa-env-desktop==0.5.3",
    "owa-env-gst==0.5.3",
    "owa-msgs==0.5.3",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
mcap-owa-support = { path = "projects/mcap-owa-support", editable = true }
ocap = { path = "projects/ocap", editable = true }
owa-cli = { path = "projects/owa-cli", editable = true }
owa-core = { path = "projects/owa-core", editable = true }
owa-env-desktop = { path = "projects/owa-env-desktop", editable = true }
owa-env-gst = { path = "projects/owa-env-gst", editable = true }
owa-msgs = { path = "projects/owa-msgs", editable = true }

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
bypass-selection = true
```

I believe it's intentional we respect the `tool.uv.sources` entries in a Git dependency, we consider that an installation from a "source tree". You can use `--no-sources` to ignore them.
