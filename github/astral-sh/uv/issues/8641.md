# Equivalent command to `twine check`

---

_Issue opened by @lengau on 2024-10-28 18:44_

To go along with `uv publish`, it would be great if we could check our wheel files like `twine check`.

Most important would be errors like:

```
Checking rockcraft/dist/rockcraft-1.6.0.post2+gfc6e711.d20241021-py3-none-any.whl: FAILED
ERROR    `long_description` has syntax errors in markup and would not be rendered on PyPI.
line 31: Warning: Cannot scale image!
Could not get size from "https://snapcraft.io/rockcraft/badge.svg":
Reading external files disabled.
```

(Personally this is very low priority for my team as running `uvx twine check` isn't exactly a slow task.)

I'm not opposed to including these checks in uv, but ideally, these checks would already be performed by the build backed: We should error when building the wheel, ideally locally, instead of only failing during a publish run (on CI).

I'm now OK if there's no equivalent feature proposed by `uv`, as I trust `uv` to embed these kind of checks naturally during the upload process.

Is there any evidence that it does perform `twine check` equivalent checks? I've been searching, but I cannot find anything that suggests it does. I too would be glad to replace `twine check` merely for streamlining purposes.

Fwiw, `twine check` seems to only check that a RST readme gets correctly rendered on PyPI, which means it's not applicable to projects with a non-RST readme.
