# completion scripts disables autocompletion of files and folders

---

_Issue opened by @lucharo on 2025-04-02 16:44_

I enabled uv shell completion and I believe it broke my file/folder completion

File/folder name completion works fine for all other CLI tools but not for uv since I enabled shell completion.

I included shell completion with the following line in my `.zshrc`:

```
eval "$(uv generate-shell-completion zsh)"
```

I think this is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8432

I'm not sure why the completions are weird.
