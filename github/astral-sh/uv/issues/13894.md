In my workspace, `uv add p` incorrectly auto-completed to `uv add pyproject.toml`, which doesn't make sense.

It'd be really convenient if `uv add` could autocomplete to valid package names.

Note that this is a hard problem since there a lot of packages on PyPI, so the simple endpoint is slow and changes all the time, and there is no unified search endpoint.
