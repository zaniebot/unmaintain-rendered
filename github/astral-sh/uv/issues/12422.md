# Add flag to disable hello.py generation during `uv init`

---

_Issue opened by @prdai on 2025-03-24 03:38_

### Summary

Currently, running `uv init` automatically generates a default hello.py file as a starting example. However, this behavior might not be desired by users who prefer to start with a clean project structure or have custom initialization requirements. I propose adding a flag (e.g., `--no-sample` or `--skip-hello`) that allows users to disable the automatic creation of hello.py during initialization.


### Example

uv init --no-sample

since 0.6.0, `uv init` generates main.py instead of hello.py, if you don't want `main.py` to be created use `--bare` option
