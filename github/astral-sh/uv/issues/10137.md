# No version of package when using explicit index

_Issue opened by @hongbo-miao on 2024-12-24 03:47_

# Experiment 1

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "1.0.0"
requires-python = "~=3.10.0"
dependencies = [
  "detectron2",
  "magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6"
]

[tool.uv]
package = false

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "myhloli"
url = "https://wheels.myhloli.com"
explicit = true

[tool.uv.sources]
detectron2 = { git = "https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git" }
magic-pdf = { index = "myhloli" }
```
fails with
```
uv sync
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6 and your project depends on magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6, we can conclude that your project's requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

# Experiment 2

If I use same uv and Python version install by

```sh
uv pip install magic-pdf[full] --extra-index-url https://wheels.myhloli.com
Resolved 33 packages in 2.33s

```

it works.

Any ideas? Thanks! ☺️

When you do `uv pip install magic-pdf[full] --extra-index-url https://wheels.myhloli.com` are you sure `magic-pdf` is coming from `https://wheels.myhloli.com`?

Hi @zanieb , thanks for the help!
I just found `uv pip install magic-pdf[full]` actually installed an old `0.6.1` which has Linux version.
I got same error when try to install `0.10.6` by

```sh
uv pip install magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6 --extra-index-url https://wheels.myhloli.com
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of paddlepaddle{platform_system == 'Linux'}==3.0.0b1 and magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6 depends on paddlepaddle{platform_system == 'Linux'}==3.0.0b1, we can
      conclude that magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6 cannot be used.
      And because you require magic-pdf[full]==0.10.6, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
```
