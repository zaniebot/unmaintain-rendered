# Feature Request: In universal resolution indicate or provide option for maximum version of Python

_Issue opened by @notatallshaw on 2024-08-16 03:13_

If I run:

```
echo "docker" | uv pip compile --universal  --python-version 3.10 --annotation-style line -
Resolved 7 packages in 6ms
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile --universal --python-version 3.10 --annotation-style line -
certifi==2024.7.4         # via requests
charset-normalizer==3.3.2  # via requests
docker==7.1.0
idna==3.7                 # via requests
pywin32==306 ; sys_platform == 'win32'  # via docker
requests==2.32.3          # via docker
urllib3==2.2.2            # via docker, requests
```

I know this resolution will work for Python 3.10, but it's not clear if the requirements are even technically valid for Python 3.11, or 3.12, or 3.13, etc.

It would be great if I could provide a range of Python versions it needs to be valid for, or at least if uv told me what range it was able to successfully satisfy for.

I _think_ this might be a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4959, if so please close.
