# VS Code not detecting uv installed python 3.13.0

---

_Issue opened by @kb-cov on 2024-11-09 07:49_

I have been using uv for months without issue on a MAC both in terminal and VS Code.  I uninstalled uv version 0.4.30 by following uninstall instructions and removing all uv related content from my .zshrc file.  I re-installed uv version 0.5.0 and have since updated to 0.5.1 therefore moving the uv and uvx binaries to the .local/bin directory and `export PATH="/Users/kevban/.local/bin:$PATH"` has been added to my .zshrc file.  I have confirmed that .local/bin is in my PATH.  Since doing this I have re-installed both python 3.13.0 and python 3.12.7 using uv however neither Python install shows up in the VSCode interpreter selection menu.  If I create a venv using uv with 3.13 then it works fine and the venv shows in interpreter list but the basic python interpreter itself is not.  I'm sure I'm doing something obviously wrong here but would be great if you could point me in the right direction.  Thanks.

Unfortunately not immediately obvious to me how / why this would be different in 0.5. We moved the location of uv itself, but _not_ the uv-installed Pythons -- they should be in the same place as before?

so the uv-installed pythons are in ~/.local/share/uv/python/ is his what you would expect?   if I manually enter it as interpreter path in VS code then it works fine....but for some reason no uv python installs are appearing in the drop down interpreter selection by default....its listing system and brew python versions, but nothing from uv ?  Maybe a VS code glitch I guess...

Yeah that's where we'd expect the Python interpreters to be stored — they're been there for a long time.

You might want to try `uv python install --preview` which will put versions on your `PATH` and presumably make them discoverable by VSCode? It's still a work in progress though.

Apologies, this is my mistake, I must have previously not noticed that uv-python installs don't appear in the VS Code interpreter list as I normally create a uv venv straight away when working in a new project directory...as you say, this has nothing to do with uv release 0.5.0.  Having read VS code docs it is clear that vs code is not looking for python interpreters in the directory where uv installs python versions (when not using a virtual environemnt)....see below for where VS code looks...I will simply keep adding the uv path manually when not using a virtual environment....sorry for the confusion.

The extension automatically looks for interpreters in the following locations, in no particular order:

Standard install paths such as /usr/local/bin, /usr/sbin, /sbin, c:\\python36, etc.
Virtual environments located directly under the workspace (project) folder.
Virtual environments located in the folder identified by the python.venvPath setting (see [General Python settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_general-python-settings)), which can contain multiple virtual environments. The extension looks for virtual environments in the first-level subfolders of venvPath.
Virtual environments located in a ~/.virtualenvs folder for [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/).
Interpreters created by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), and [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/).
Virtual environments located in the path identified by WORKON_HOME (as used by [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/)).
Conda environments found by conda env list. Conda environments which do not have an interpreter will have one installed for them upon selection.
Interpreters installed in a .direnv folder for [direnv](https://direnv.net/) under the workspace folder.
