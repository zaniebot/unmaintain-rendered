Unfortunately I have no idea what's happening here.

I have been unable to duplicate this issue on my Windows 11 x86-64.
It works fine without any errors.

Only ``uv run ipython --preview`` has this error
```
ipython: error: argument --preview: expected one argument
```

Note: You can't pass the `--preview` flag to `ipython`.

`uv internal error` is coming from the trampoline https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/2cd63f06dc8139adafdabfcbeda1a4250d4c0238/crates/uv-trampoline/src/bounce.rs#L472

and the error is from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/2cd63f06dc8139adafdabfcbeda1a4250d4c0238/crates/uv-trampoline/src/bounce.rs#L299-L318

Interesting, I just tried the above example (with seed) and was unable to replicate on Windows 10 x86-64 both with 0.2.33 and 0.2.35. What does your `pyvenv.cfg` look like?

@samypr100 
here it is.
```yaml
imp_blm_test\.venv on  main [!?⇡] via 🐍 v3.11.9 (imp_blm_test) 
❯ cat .\pyvenv.cfg           
home = C:\Users\me\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311
implementation = CPython
uv = 0.2.24
version_info = 3.11.9
include-system-site-packages = false
prompt = imp_blm_test
```
and here's python I have installed.
```bash

I ran into a similar issue with same/similar error of "(uv internal error) Failed to spawn the python child process..." and discovered that it was caused by inadvertently naming my project script "python" in my `pyproject.toml` e.g.,

```toml
[project.scripts]
python = "my_project.main"
```

If you add this package as a dependency, it generates a `python.exe` that overwrites the "real" one, causing all sorts of chaos. Renaming the script (for example, `mytool = "my_project.main"`) fixed the problem.

Not sure what the best solution here is. Clearly user error in my case but an error/warning (did I miss one?) would be worthwhile or maybe not allow 'uv sync' to overwrite managed executables like 'python'?

@joelvaneenwyk Can you open a separate issue with your finding?

Arguably we should probably not be generating scripts that clobber the ones needed to run scripts, but I do see the same issue with pip 😆. In linux this manifests a bit differently with the error being instead something like `too many levels of symbolic links`.
