# Ignore forks that use a Python version above the `requires-python` upper-bound

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-16 16:33_

We generally ignore upper-bounds on `requires-python` for dependencies, for a variety of reasons. However, we _could_ ignore forks that are above the upper-bound of the _user's_ `requires-python`.
