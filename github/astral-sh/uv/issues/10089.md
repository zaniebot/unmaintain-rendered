# `uv pip install -U` will downgrade already-installed packages

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-12-22 00:35_

If you `uv init packaging`, then change the version to 1000 and install it, then run `uv pip install -U black`, we'll actually _downgrade_ `packaging` unnecessarily:

```
❯ uv pip install -U black
Resolved 6 packages in 93ms
Prepared 5 packages in 0.25ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 0.62ms
Installed 5 packages in 5ms
 + black==24.10.0
 + mypy-extensions==1.0.0
 - packaging==1000 (from file:///Users/crmarsh/workspace/puffin/packaging)
 + packaging==24.2
 + pathspec==0.12.1
 + platformdirs==4.3.6
```
