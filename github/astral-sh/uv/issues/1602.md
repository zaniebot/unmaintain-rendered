# Seeding venv adds setuptools and wheel on Python 3.12

_Issue opened by @henryiii on 2024-02-17 17:13_

If you use `--seed` on a Python 3.12 venv, you still get setuptools and wheel, while both virutalenv and venv have dropped them if using Python 3.12 or newer. This causes `uv venv -p 3.12 --seed` (524ms) to be slower than `virtualenv .venv` (360ms), which is only adding `pip`.
