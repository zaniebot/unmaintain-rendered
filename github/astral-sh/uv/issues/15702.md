# 🐛 Bug: `uv build` fails with invalid Python module path with no clear error message

---

_Issue opened by @DhavalGojiya on 2025-09-05 13:20_

### Summary

## Project Structure

I am working with a Django project where:

- Not using **uv** as project management
- Using **uv** only for backend build

```

electo_premium/
    client/
    newspaper/
    payments/
    pyproject.toml
    manage.py
    __init__.py   # necessary for uv build

````

**Note:** If you are wondering why I am building the whole project as a wheel:  

To use **Apache Airflow**, I need to place my Django source code inside the virtual environment's `site-packages/` folder on the AWS Airflow server so that my Django code is also accessible in AWS Airflow.

For example, this import should work at aws airflow environment:  

```python
from electo_premium.newspaper.models import NewsLetter
```

## pyproject.toml

```toml
# pyproject.toml - content

[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build>=0.8.12,<0.9.0"]
build-backend = "uv_build"

[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-name = "electo_premium"
module-root = "../"  # Go one step backward (Not sure if going backward is even possible)
````

## Command Run

At the same directory where `manage.py` exists:

```bash
uv build
```

## Actual Output

```text
Building source distribution (uv build backend)...
Building wheel from source distribution (uv build backend)...
  × Failed to build `/home/trootech/Production Projects/electo/electo_premium`
  ╰─▶ Expected a Python module at: `/home/trootech/.cache/uv/sdists-v9/.tmpR0ugJW/electo_premium-1.0.0/../electo_premium/__init__.py`
```

## ❌ Problem

The error message seems **invalid/weird** — it is looking for the module at a path containing `/home/trootech/.cache/uv/sdists-v9/.tmpR0ugJW/electo_premium-1.0.0/../electo_premium/__init__.py`, which doesn’t look correct.

## ✅ Expected Behavior

`uv build` should correctly locate the `__init__.py` inside the project and build the package without path resolution errors.

---

### 📝 Notes

* The `__init__.py` file **does exist** inside `electo_premium/`.
* The error message suggests that path resolution may be going one step too far (`../`) during build.

### Platform

Linux 6.8.0-45-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.8.15

### Python version

Python 3.12.7

I'm still getting this with 0.8.22 on windows. It is pretty much the same, barring `module-root = "Source"` in the toml file.

Can you please elaborate more on this?
Mind sharing your pyproject.toml file content and your project structure?

I should have mentioned - I've made a separate issue #16049 which hopefully explains the situation I'm getting this error message for.
