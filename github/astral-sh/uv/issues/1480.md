# Global uv pip install ?

---

_Issue opened by @vitalik on 2024-02-16 11:56_

does uv have some global install option (without venv) ?

like what's the recommended way to use `uv pip install ...` in Dockerfile or github action ?

@vitalik this article has GREAT instructions for implementing `uv` in a Dockerfile, i've followed the steps and it works great. It cut my Docker build time down by 75% on a large project I maintain

PS - thanks for all your work on Django-Ninja, the aforementioned project is a Django-Ninja API!

Thanks @nickmccullum for linking that blog post. 

I'll merge this issue with https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1374 that covers the same question/request.
