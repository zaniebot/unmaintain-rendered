# Drop support for reading executable name requests from `.python-version` files

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-04-01 18:22_

It seems weird to write an executable name to a `.python-version` file, and this causes conflicts with `pyenv-virtualenv` as they write environment names there (see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7935)

I think we should just ignore `.python-version` files if they contain this. Perhaps warn?
