# `uv version --all-packages` option to bump all workspace members

---

_Issue opened by @luqtheiv on 2025-09-16 13:49_

### Summary

Similar to how `uv build` has an `--all-packages` option, `uv version` could provide the same capability. Currently, it only features a `--package` option which is cumbersome for projects with many workspaces if you want to bump them all at once.

### Example

To bump all workspace members' version today:
```bash
uv version --bump minor --package a
uv version --bump minor --package b
uv version --bump minor --package c
```

Proposal:
```bash
uv version --bump minor --all-packages
```

That sounds reasonable to me. I think we could also allow repeating `--package` here.
