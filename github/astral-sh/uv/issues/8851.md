# `uv run /path/to/script.py` should detect if the script is in a project

---

_Issue opened by @ceejatec on 2024-11-06 01:45_

I've got a number of scripts that have associated `pyproject.toml` files to declare dependencies, so I can make use of `uv.lock` files. I'd like to then run them from other directories with `uv run /path/to/script.py`. However, I end up having to run `uv run --project /path/to /path/to/script.py` instead.

My gut says that if a script is located somewhere under a `pyproject.toml`, it's not unreasonable to assume it's intended to be run in the context of that project. I'd like it to behave exactly as though the full `uv run --project /path/to /path/to/script.py` command was invoked, including creating or using `/path/to/.venv` , etc.

There's already a `uv run --no-project` option for doing the reverse.

P.S. I know I could use inline script dependency management here instead, but I feel like it's a little bit limited compared to a full project. In particular, there's no equivalent of `uv.lock`. I've experimented with the `exclude-newer` option, but I can't tell whether that always works predictably. In particular, if I set that to, say, a month ago, then running `uv run` often will start compiling dependencies like pandas, rather than finding a wheel. Does that sound like a bug, or do I have unreasonable expectations here?

Yeah! I just got into the same issue.

It also works if you use something like this, btw
uv run --directory=/path/to/project  relative/path/to/script.py
