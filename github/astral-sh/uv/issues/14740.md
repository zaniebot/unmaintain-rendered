# `uv pip install -r pylock.toml` doesn't work with dependency_groups groups

_Issue opened by @RaczeQ on 2025-07-18 19:58_

### Summary

I try to install dependencies form the lock file generated by the tool PDM.

I got his error:
```
uv pip install --no-deps -r pylock.toml --system

warning: The `--pylock` setting is experimental and may change without warning. Pass `--preview` to disable this warning.
Using Python 3.10.18 environment at: /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.10.18/x64

Related issue in the PDM repository: https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/3574

I'm not sure if it's really invalid pylock.toml that is generated by PDM, or if uv doesn't support dependency_groups in this format yet and the error is misleading.

Yea, we don't support the PEP 751 extensions to markers yet (`extras` and `dependency_groups`).
