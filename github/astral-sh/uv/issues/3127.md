# Dependency resolution regression in 0.1.33

---

_Issue opened by @burgholzer on 2024-04-18 22:06_

Hey 👋🏼 

thanks for all the work on `uv`! We recently incorporated it into all the tools we develop as part of our research (https://mqt.readthedocs.io) and the transition was really smooth! 😎 

However, I believe the latest version (specifically the changes from #3087) might have broken our CI pipelines.
For a production workflow run failing, see: https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-core/actions/runs/8744279279/job/23998070565

I tried to construct a minimal reproducible example from what I could gather. The following is the best I could come up with.

Given the following `pyproject.toml`
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["scikit-build-core>=0.8.1"]
build-backend = "scikit_build_core.build"

[project]
name = "uv_reproducer"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
version = "0.1.0"

[project.optional-dependencies]
test = ["pytest>=7.0"]
coverage = ["uv_reproducer[test]", "pytest-cov>=4"]
```

and a minimal `CMakeLists.txt`
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15...3.26)
project(${SKBUILD_PROJECT_NAME} LANGUAGES CXX)
```

The following chain of commands will error out
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install scikit-build-core[pyproject]==0.8.1
uv pip install '-ve.[test,coverage]' --resolution=lowest-direct --no-build-isolation
```

See below for the complete output.
This is on `uv` version 0.1.33 running on Ubuntu 22.04.
Tested to work on version 0.1.32.
My guess would be that it has to do with the recursive self dependencies that are now resolved differently, for whatever reason.
Interestingly, running with build isolation, i.e.
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install '-ve.[test,coverage]' --resolution=lowest-direct
```
works just fine.

Would be nice to know if this change was intentional and I am missing something or if there is something to be fixed here (at least the scenario above was working in previous versions). Let me know if you need any more info!

The full error log of the `uv pip install '-ve.[test,coverage]' --resolution=lowest-direct --no-build-isolation` command is as follows:

Thanks, I’ll have to look at the changelog to see what’s up. My initial reaction is that there’s probably a real problem with that package? But that (by chance?) we went down a different resolution path in the prior version — probably due to incorporating pip’s heuristics around how we prioritize packages.

Can I ask why you're running with `--no-build-isolation`? And, if intentional, why not install `setuptools`, since it seems to be needed to build some of the requisite packages?

Running with no build isolation can speed up repeated builds and is especially helpful when working with compiled extensions because it does not create a throwaway temporary directory for the build but maintains a set build directory, allowing for much faster rebuilds.

I don't believe installing setuptools is the right solution here as it is not a direct dependency of our project (neither is it in the reproducer).
Note also, that unwinding the recursive self dependencies and replacing the "uv_reproducer[test]" in the coverage extra definition by "pytest>=7" works without any problems.
I would consider this (pytest + pytest-cov) one of the most common setups for measuring code coverage in Python. That combination is pretty much tried and tested.
I am fairly confident that the problem here has something to do with how "--resolution=lowest-direct" interacts with recursive self-dependencies.

I'll take a closer look, but:

> I don't believe installing setuptools is the right solution here as it is not a direct dependency of our project (neither is it in the reproducer).

I don't think this is the right criteria though, is it? If you run with `--no-build-isolation`, you must install all build dependencies of all of your dependencies upfront. Like, would you agree that if your resolution leads to installing `atomicwrites==1.4.1`, and you're running with `--no-build-isolation`, you _must_ install `setuptools` in order to succeed?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-18 23:29_

I think the `pytest>=7.0` is being enforced "too late" due to the order in which we're visiting the requirements. So we try to solve `pytest-cov>=4` before we expand `uv_reproducer[test]`. Presumedly it would end up reaching the same conclusion by backtracking, but it's building older versions than is strictly necessary.

```
Disable isolation when building a modern source distribution. Build dependencies specified by PEP 518 must be already installed if this option is used.

```

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#cmdoption-no-build-isolation

--no-build-isolation means you must install all build dependencies manually. setuptools might be special cased by pip due to legacy reasons, but even that is not required and newer pip is allowed to break here too. Although exact resolver/backtracking behavior is going to be very installer specific. You must manually manage your build dependencies for all packages you resolve if you use it.

In practice this tends to be not bad as build dependencies are relatively uncommon that I normally do,

```
pip install a b c --no-dependencies # build dependencies
pip install requirements.txt --no-dependencies --no-build-isolation
```

No, the build isolation setting is not transitive. It only holds for the current package. At least that's what I've gotten to learn from pip.

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#options just states:

> --no-build-isolation
Disable isolation when building a modern source distribution. Build dependencies specified by PEP 518 must be already installed if this option is used.

In the reproducer above, the only build dependency (scikit-build-core) is installed prior to the main package install.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-18 23:38_

I think we should avoid trying to build this package at all (i.e., I agree that this shouldn't _require_ setuptools), but you _definitely_ need to install all build dependencies for all transitive dependencies that will be built from source, if you run with `--no-build-isolation`. (For example: try running `pip install pytest==4.6.0 --no-build-isolation` in an environment without setuptools.)

---

_Comment by @notatallshaw on 2024-04-18 23:39_

The issue appears to be uv 0.1.33 is selecting an old version of pytest:

```
DEBUG Selecting: pytest==4.6.0 (pytest-4.6.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl)
```

Even though the requirements included a higher lower bound:

```
test = ["pytest>=7.0"]
```

In uv 0.1.32 a much higher version of pytest is selected (that matches the constraints of the lower bound):

```
DEBUG Selecting: pytest==7.0.0 (pytest-7.0.0-py3-none-any.whl)
```

The requirement for atomicwrites was removed for non-Windows platforms in pytest 5.3.0.

Oh, @charliermarsh already beat me to while I was testing and writing the post.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-18 23:43_

Haha yeah. That matches my diagnosis above. Because of the heuristics (which are clearly off a bit), we're fully resolving `pytest-cov>=4` before we even look at `uv_reproducer[test]`, which adds the extra constraint.

---

I would also suspect this to be the case.
I guess most of the errors that pop up with "--resolution=lowest-direct" originate from rather old packages that are being resolved. And if the "pytest-cov" resolution were the only one to take place here, I would totally consider that a package/user error and definitely not an error with `uv`, given that it resolved correctly.
In this case, however, it could (maybe should) be able to detect that a different dependency applies a stricter lower bound and hence, it may only try from that version onwards anyways.

Yeah, there's something for us to fix here. I'll look into it.

```
I don't follow this. My experience using pip is it is transitive and I've just confirmed this. The easiest way is to test this manually by installing library A that has dependency B which depends on some build dependency and avoid installing it yourself. pip will crash here even though A does not have any build dependencies itself. This is a little tricky to pull off with pip as most recent libraries have wheels so you end up needing to look for interesting example or use --no-binary to avoid choosing the wheel.

setuptools is rather special and pip often pre-seeds that one, but that's legacy choice that future pips/python versions may stop doing entirely. I think only recent python versions/pip avoid pre-seeding setuptools.

Yeah. That was totally a misconception on my end based on the fact that up until the most recent versions of pip, setuptools was always special cased. So I guess I never really noticed the explicit dependency there.
Sorry for that.
Your example as well as Charlie's from above perfectly illustrate simple cases for when my assumption from above breaks down. 👍🏻

> Haha yeah. That matches my diagnosis above. Because of the heuristics (which are clearly off a bit), we're fully resolving `pytest-cov>=4` before we even look at `uv_reproducer[test]`, which adds the extra constraint.

As someone thinking about Python packaging resolution for awhile I reallly find the optionality of extras to be very very annoying, it makes writing all resolvers significantly more complex.

Ok, I tested it out on your project, and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3133 should fix it. I think there's a "deeper" fix I want to pursue here for some other pathological cases, but that should be good for now.

Yeah. I can confirm that this fixes all the regressions we were seeing.
Thanks for the extremely fast fix. Keep up the good work 🎉 
It's really cool to follow these developments!
