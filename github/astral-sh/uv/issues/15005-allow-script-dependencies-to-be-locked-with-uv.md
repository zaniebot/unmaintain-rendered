# Allow script dependencies to be locked with `uv pip compile`

---

_Issue opened by @Ian-Costa18 on 2025-07-31 19:33_

### Summary

The [uv pip compile documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compile/#locking-requirements) states:

> uv allows dependencies to be locked in the requirements.txt format. It is recommended to use the standard pyproject.toml to define dependencies, **but other dependency formats are supported as well.**

Missing from those dependency formats are the script metadata dependencies described in [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/).

`uv export --format requirements-txt` does allow the `--script` argument, which comes close to doing the same thing as `uv pip compile`, but the output includes SHA256 hashes as seen in the example below, which are not always wanted.
```
bs4==0.0.2 \
    --hash=sha256:a48685c58f50fe127722417bae83fe6badf500d54b55f7e39ffe43b798653925 \
    --hash=sha256:abf8742c0805ef7f662dce4b51cca104cffe52b835238afc169142ab9b3fbccc
```

### Example

The command `uv add --script .\script.py bs4 selenium tqdm` adds this to the Python script file:
```
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.13"
# dependencies = [
#     "bs4",
#     "selenium",
#     "tqdm",
# ]
# ///
```
Then `uv pip compile .\script.py -o .\requirements.txt` should create a `requirements.txt` file with these contents (or similar): 
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile .\script.py -o .\requirements.txt

Sorry, I don't really understand what you're asking for here?

You want this?

```
❯ uv export --script foo.py --no-hashes

Yeah, I think you're looking for `uv export --script foo.py --no-hashes`.
