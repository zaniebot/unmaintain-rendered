# Stabilize `--torch-backend`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-06-16 21:07_

This is somewhat widely used now, including in the official vLLM documentation: https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/installation/gpu.html?device=cuda#pre-built-wheels. I think we should stabilize it. (Stabilizing here indicates that we won't take it away or make breaking changes outside of our standard versioning policy.)

We may need to add a note to the documentation that `--torch-backend` adds the stable PyTorch pip index, which can break when combining with the nightly pip index:

```bash
export UV_INDEX="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128"
export UV_TORCH_BACKEND="cu128"
uv pip install "pytorch-triton==3.3.1+gitc8757738"
```
