$ uv --version
uv 0.5.26
```

Can you please share a minimized pyproject.toml that reproduces your problem? Without that, we cannot reproduce your problem.

Hi, the `pyproject.toml` I'm using is as follows:
```
[project]
... Various descriptions ...
requires-python = "==3.12.*"
dependencies = [
    "accelerate>=1.2.1",
    "bitsandbytes>=0.45.0",
    "peft>=0.14.0",
    "trl>=0.13.0",
    "unsloth[cu124-torch250]",
]

[tool.uv]
override-dependencies = [
    "torch==2.5.1",
    "xformers==0.0.28.post3",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
torch = [
    { index = "pytorch-cu124" },
]
unsloth = { git = "https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git" }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pytorch-cu124"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124"
explicit = true
```

This works when running just `uv sync` from a previous lock file, but triton doesn't seem to install when using `uv sync -U`. The error reads as follows:

```
error: distribution `triton==3.1.0 @ direct+https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/download/v3.1.0-windows.post5/triton-3.1.0-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl` can't be installed because the binary distribution is incompatible with the current platform
```

I've tried to fix the error by adding `"triton>=3.2.0"` in the project dependencies, which only leads to the error saying triton 3.2.0 doesn't exist...

Oh, I found the error. It seems another one of my libraries depended on `triton==3.1.0` causing the error. 
I fixed it by adding `triton==3.2.0` to override-dependencies!
