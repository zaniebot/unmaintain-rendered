# Request: better error message when there's missing wheels

---

_Issue opened by @thewh1teagle on 2024-12-19 21:36_

Hello!
I'm trying to install [`modelscope`](https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-local-python-environment) on macOS m1 aarch64 using the following command:

```console
uv pip install "modelscope[audio]" -f https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/releases/repo.html
```

and it failed with very long error message:

Summary:

```console
Because kwsbp==0.0.6 has no wheels with a matching Python ABI tag and only kwsbp<=0.0.6 is available, we can conclude that kwsbp>=0.0.6 cannot be used.
And because modelscope[audio]==1.21.0 depends on kwsbp>=0.0.6, we can conclude that modelscope[audio]==1.21.0 cannot be used.
And because we know from (108) that all of:
    modelscope[audio]<1.21.0
    modelscope[audio]>1.21.0
are incompatible, we can conclude that all versions of modelscope[audio] are incompatible.
And because you require modelscope[audio], we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
``
[log.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18203431/log.txt)


Environment:

```console
macOS 14.5 aarch64 m1
.python-version: 3.13
pyproject.toml: requires-python = ">=3.13"
uv 0.4.29 (85f9a0d0e 2024-10-30)
```

It seems like the error happens simply because there's missing wheels. but it's hard to understand it from the error message.
Can we improve the error message so it will be short and informative? Thanks!


Update:
it failed also on WIndows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 x86-64

Reproduce:

```console
uv venv
uv pip install "modelscope[audio]" -f https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/releases/repo.html
```

@zanieb -- Do you think this is done, now that we hint and include tags here?
