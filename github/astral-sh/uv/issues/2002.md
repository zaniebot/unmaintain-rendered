<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

uv 0.1.11 for linux

uv pip fails for this, which works with normal pip
```
uv pip install "git+https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/megablocks.git"
```


Results:
```
uv pip install git+https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/megablocks.git
error: Failed to parse `git+https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/megablocks.git`
  Caused by: URL requirement must be preceded by a package name. Add the name of the package before the URL (e.g., `package_name @ https://...`).
git+https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/megablocks.git
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

We support installing `git+` dependencies, but you have to prefix them with the package name:

```
uv pip install "megablocks @ git+https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/megablocks.git"
```

We'll likely lift this constraint in the future. You can track it here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/313. There are a bunch of similar issues linked to that PR if you're interested.
