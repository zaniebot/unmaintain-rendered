# [Question] Why not publish it on crateio?

_Issue opened by @chatblanc-ciel on 2024-09-03 04:05_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I usually use the Rust language as my primary programming language. Therefore, I prefer to install via cargo rather than the standalone installer.

- Easy to install
  ```
   cargo install uv
  ```
- Easy to manage
  ```
  cargo uninstall uv
  ```

Would you please consider this?

I believe this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6310.
