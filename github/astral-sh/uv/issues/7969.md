# Add "global" configurations in the workspace root instead of each member

---

_Issue opened by @inbalzelig-ugi on 2024-10-07 12:59_

Hi, I have a workspace with many members (the workspace itself is just a wrapper and doesn't have any content). I want to add the same dev dependencies to all members (e.g. pytest, ruff). Can we do that in the root workspace pyproject.toml instead of adding the same dev dependencies in each member?
Also, I will want to add ruff configurations to the pyproject.toml. It will be much easier to do it once for the whole project instead of copying the same configuration for each member.

Thanks
