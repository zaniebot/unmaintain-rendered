# uv does not support Linux fast completion

---

_Issue opened by @pengjunfeng11 on 2025-12-09 06:10_

### Summary

As the title suggests, assuming there is a file named `tool_qa_update.py` in the current folder, when I type `uv run to` and press the `Tab` key, it should support auto-completion to `uv run tool_qa_update.py`.

I can take on the development of this requirement.

### Example

Are you using zsh? In that case this is duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8432
