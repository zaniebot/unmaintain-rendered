Are you sure you installed the right things?
You just installed https://pypi.org/project/ranger/#description
which has no entry point.

If you want this: https://github.com/ranger/ranger
you need to install it with `uv pip install ranger-fm`
If that is the case, you should also consider installing it as an isolated tool with
`uv tool install ranger-fm`, instead of creating a venv manually and installing it there.
