# Shortcut to activate uv-created venv  using uv's discovery mechanism

---

_Issue opened by @ZacCranko on 2025-02-27 16:03_

### Summary

It would be great to be able to do something like `uv env --activate` and have it discover and run the appropriate `.venv/bin/activate` shell script. I'm quite often in a position where I can't rely on a pyproject.toml, so I need to bypass uv's package management mechanisms, but I'd still enjoy being able to use uv for venv related setup tasks (and all the other features elsewhere!)

Many thanks!
