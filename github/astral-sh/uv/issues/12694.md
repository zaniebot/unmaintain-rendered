We need to iron out a few bugs here (#12677). See: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12618.

Can we check whether data descriptors are used and if so, skip CRC validation until the async-zip library supports data descriptors? The field already exists in `rs-async-zip`: https://github.com/charliermarsh/rs-async-zip/compare/main...konstin:rs-async-zip:konsti/data-descriptor

Yeah that sounds like it might be a better approach.
