# Support `uv tool run {package}@latest`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-06 02:36_

We support, e.g., `uv tool run ruff@0.4.0`. We may want to add `uv tool run ruff@latest`. What should the semantics be, though?

I think: implies `--refresh` (i.e. do not use the cache) and `--isolated` (ignores installed tools).

As part of this, we also want to remove `--upgrade` from `uv tool run`...
