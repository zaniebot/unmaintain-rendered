# Support for a single config file

---

_Issue opened by @Stefanhg on 2025-08-07 12:15_

### Summary

Hello,

I would like to request support for adding requirements like Python packages and Python version to your uv.toml file.
It would be nice to contain everything in a single file instead of having to create three files to configure pypi index, Python version and my requirements.

**Reason:** 
Include things in one place instead of spreading them out everywhere just to include two lines in each file.

### Example

# uv.toml
```
[[python-version]]
version=3.12

[[index]]
url = "https://test.pypi.org/simple"
default = true

[[requirements]]
pip
setuptools
pytest
```

After digging more into how UV works, I found an acceptable solution.
The pyproject.toml supports setting `requires-python` which tells the project which Python version it requires.
And according to this comment, UV can be configured for which index to use here:
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4173#issuecomment-2156715078

So this achieves putting all my configurations within pyproject.toml, only annoyance is that in my case I will not be releasing my package so having a version within it makes no sense but thats a minor detail.

Example:
```
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name="myproject"
version="0.1.0

requires-python="==3.13"
dependencies = [
    "pytest==1.2.3.4"
]

[tool.uv.pip]
extra-index-url = ["https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"]
```
