# How to install uv in a custom mounted path without using the local fs at all (avoind copy-link).

_Issue opened by @LuchiLucs on 2024-11-18 08:54_

I tried following the installation configuration [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/installer/#changing-the-install-path) in order to set-up uv in another custom path, but it seems that later, when using its binary, some paths and configurations are still pointing to the local fs, under `/home/user/...`. Like sometimes when I call `uv run` or `uv sync` there is a warning about copy failing and fallbacking to copy-link. That is intented because I mount a remote a fs between my machines in order to share the installation and the envs. I wish uv to be able to install and use only this remote mounted fs whichever the machines I am sshing into. How can I do it?

I think you'll want to set `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and `XDG_STATE_HOME` to a location on your other file system.

Thank you. Is it planned to implement this by dedicated uv envs instead of exporting system/user shared envs?
