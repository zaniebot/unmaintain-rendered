# Add environment variable for build --package

---

_Issue opened by @pedro-avalos on 2025-06-03 18:43_

### Summary

With a workspace, you can build a specific package with the `--package` option. I'd like to also have an environment variable that can be used instead of the option.

For example, `UV_PACKAGE` could be the environment variable name.

### Example

Given a workspace with some package members, say the user wants to only build the CLI component for a monorepo / workspace:

```shell
# the same as `uv build --package=cli`
UV_PACKAGE=cli uv build
```

Could you give an example where the environment variable would be useful but the CLI flag wouldn't be equally useful?

I'm mainly thinking of the [snapcraft](https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft) and [rockcraft](https://github.com/canonical/rockcraft) packaging, but it may come in handy for other packaging tools.

See the [uv plugin for snapcraft](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/snapcraft/stable/reference/plugins/uv_plugin/). The plugin uses environment variables to configure the package. At the moment, I do not believe it supports building just one package in a workspace because it doesn't have custom options, relying just on passing environment variables through to `uv`.
