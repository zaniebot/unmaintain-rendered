# [FR] uv pip compile via lists - show relevant extras

---

_Issue opened by @RonnyPfannschmidt on 2025-07-24 09:35_

### Summary

i recently switched a constraint pinning process from providing a constraints file to using a optional dependency
the reporting changed

```diff

  netifaces==0.11.0
     # via
 -    #   -c internal/data/imposed_package_constraints.txt
 +    #   internal-core

```

it would be a big help for debugging to see if the constraint was introduced directly, or via a requested optional dependency

### Example

```
netifaces==0.11.0
    # via
    #   internal-core[imposed-constraints]
