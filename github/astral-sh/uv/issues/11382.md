# Bad error message when building an empty pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2025-02-10 12:20_

### Summary

Create a new directory and create an empty `pyproject.toml` within it. Then run `uv pip install .`

```
$ uv pip install .
Using Python 3.13.0 environment at: /home/konsti/projects/uv/.venv
error: Failed to parse metadata from built wheel
  Caused by: Metadata field Name not found
```

uv should catch that we're trying to do a setuptools build without `[build-system]`, `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` and error instead of trying a build that setuptools will fail at.

uv should also catch `Name: UNKNOWN` in a METADATA file and show a dedicated error message.

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04 amd64

### Version

uv 0.5.29

### Python version

3.13.0

I've also noticed a recurring non-descript error message that happens when trying to set some of the backend settings like `tool.uv.build-backend.source-includes` and  `tool.uv.build-backend.data`. The only setting that didn't cause this error to be thrown is `tool.uv.build-backend.module-root`.
```
uv pip install --no-build-isolation --offline -e .
```
```cmd
  × Failed to build `albatross @ file:///C:/Users/user/dev/albatross`
  ├─▶ The build backend returned an error
  ╰─▶ Call to `uv.build_editable` failed (exit code: 1)

      [stderr]
      Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<string>", line 8, in <module>
          import uv as backend
      ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uv'
```

Do you mind creating a separate issue for that?
