which commit/PR resolved this issue? wondering what the current behavior is and not finding it here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts (doesn't mention `editable`). [i'm seeing CI errors](https://github.com/janosh/pymatviz/pulls/286) suggesting install is not editable

edit: looks like i needed `uv run --with-editable .[extras]` instead of `uv run --with .[extras]`

`uv run --extra extras` should also work
