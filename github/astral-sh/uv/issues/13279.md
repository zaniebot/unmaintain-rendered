# `uv run` fails with `<(...)` process substitution

---

_Issue opened by @Bobronium on 2025-05-03 20:08_

### Summary

Opening this as a bug report since python supports this:
```shell
~
❯ python <(echo 'print(__name__)')
__main__

~
❯ uv run <(echo 'print(__name__)')
error: Failed to spawn: `/dev/fd/11`
  Caused by: Permission denied (os error 13)
```

### Use case (similar to #6862)

`uv run <(pbpaste)`

### Workaround
`uv run python <(echo 'print(__name__)')`

### References 
`pipx` has the same issue https://github.com/pypa/pipx/issues/1292 with potential fix being https://github.com/pypa/pipx/pull/1293/


### Platform

Darwin 24.1.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.7.2 (481d05d8d 2025-04-30)

### Python version

Python 3.12.7

`uv help run` has this snippet

> When used with a file ending in `.py` or an HTTP(S) URL, the file will be treated as a script and run with a Python interpreter, i.e., `uv run file.py` is equivalent to `uv run python file.py`. For URLs, the script is temporarily downloaded before execution. If the script contains inline dependency metadata, it will be installed into an isolated, ephemeral environment. When used with `-`, the input will be read from stdin, and treated as a Python script.

The issue is that `<(echo 'print(__name__)')` is evaluated to `/dev/fd/XXX` by the shell (in your example, it is `/dev/fd/11`). The string `/dev/fd/XXX` does not end in `.py` and nor is it an URL. Therefore, `/dev/fd/XXX` is treated as the name of the tool; when `uv run` runs `exec` on this path, the file `/dev/fd/XXX` is not executable and you see the permission denied error. 


In addition to your workaround, note also 
> When used with `-`, the input will be read from stdin, and treated as a Python script.

Thus, the following two methods should also work (it redirects `/dev/fd/XXX` to stdin). 

```
cat <(echo 'print(__name__)') | uv run -

uv run - < <(echo 'print(__name__)')
```

All this to say,  the behavior you observe is consistent with the documentation. That said, perhaps `uv run` could be improved to have smarter handling in this scenario...
