# "Narrowed range" logging always shows the initial specifiers

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-02-07 17:10_

I think we don't update the specifiers (somewhat intentionally), and the display implementation uses the specifiers, so even if the range gets narrowed, we show the "wrong" value.
