# Provide a config setting for `--system-site-packages` for venv

---

_Issue opened by @smackesey on 2025-02-28 13:11_

### Summary

`uv venv` supports the `--system-site-packages` flag, but AFAICT there is no setting in the config file that can apply this by default to new venvs. It would be nice to have such a setting.

FWIW, my motivation here is that I use [`usercustomize.py`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-usercustomize) to inject certain globally available logging/debugging functions into every python process during development (amazing how much better you can do than `print()`...). `usercustomize.py` is only discoverable if `--system-site-packages` is enabled. I am generating _a lot_ of venvs, often non-interactively, in the course of development. So I need a way to have a `uv` user-level configuration setting to make sure these venvs are created with `--system-site-packages`.

Are you referring solely to environments created with `uv venv`? Or also environments created automatically with `uv run`, etc.?

Hmm-- ideally also environments created with `uv run`, but even just `uv venv` would help.

This is a specific case of the more general #5737
