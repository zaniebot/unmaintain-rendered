# Add hint that seed packages are disabled by default in `uv venv`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-02-15 19:53_

`uv venv` will not install seed packages like `pip` by default.

We may want to consider showing a hint that says this is skipped for now since people usually get the seed packages by default.
