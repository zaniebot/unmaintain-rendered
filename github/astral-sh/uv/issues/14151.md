# Installing uv with recommended method not working

---

_Issue opened by @gdurif on 2025-06-20 13:10_

### Summary

Following the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), I try to install `uv` but got an error:

```bash
$ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
downloading uv 0.7.13 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
curl: (23) client returned ERROR on write of 850 bytes
failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.7.13/uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
this may be a standard network error, but it may also indicate
that uv's release process is not working. When in doubt
please feel free to open an issue!
```

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS Linux 6.8.0-62-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

0.7.13

### Python version

_No response_

Are you using snap installed curl? You can check this with `which curl`.

Yes, it is snap installed curl (I did not know that even curl was now installed through snap on Ubuntu...).

```
$ which curl
/snap/bin/curl
```

I assume it is a problem ?

Note: for the moment, I manually downloaded the `uv-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` release file and modified the install script to bypass downloading, which works.

yes, snap curl is broken (https://github.com/boukendesho/curl-snap/issues/1). We fixed this in github.com/astral-sh/cargo-dist/pull/28, but the fix hasn't shipped yet. You can solve this with:

```
sudo snap remove curl
sudo apt install curl
```

We've pulled the fix in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/14156, it will be part of the next release.
