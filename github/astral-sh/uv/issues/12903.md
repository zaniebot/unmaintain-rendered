# uv tool run should not perform network request if version is fully frozen

---

_Issue opened by @gsemet on 2025-04-15 20:27_

### Summary

For example when i do a
```bash
uv tool run -- poetry@2.0.0 
```
Once installed, any subsequent execution shall not make any network access. i am able to get a network error when my proxy goes down, while there is nothing to do, since the tool is already installed in the right version.

When using @latest i guess i understand the automatic update, when executing n times the same command line versioned, it would be better to avoid unuseful network connection error.

This is not the `uv tool run --offline` mode, if the tool is not installed it needs to be installed.
It is not `--reinstall`, i do not want the package to be reinstalled if the version is already the right one.

It may be `--resolution=lowest` if we are sure it does not try to perform any network connectivity if there is not need to. And i need my tool and all its dependencies to be at the "latest" of there dependencies at the time it has been installed.

My proposal:

```bash
uv tool run -- toolname@2.0.0
```
when version is a number, install the package. no network check whatsoever if the version already matches.

to force update to later of v2, allow syntax such as @2, @2.0 to perform a network connection to check if any new package 2.0.x is available.

```
uv tool run -- toolname@2

Yeah I think this shouldn't make a network request.

I think I have a similar request (but not exactly the same).

I'd like to always use `uvx run package@latest` to quickly deliver the latest code changes to my consumers, but dependency resolution for my package takes about a minute. I think I'm looking for a way to make the semantics of `latest` mean: check for a new version but if the latest version is still the same as last time, use the cached one without dependency resolution.
