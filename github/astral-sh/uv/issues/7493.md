# Sources paths should be platform-agnostic

---

_Issue opened by @SnirShechter on 2024-09-18 12:05_

Running `uv add <path>` on Windows adds the sources path with backslash (\) Windows-style, which causes it to fail when running on other platforms.

Manually changing to slash (/) makes it work on all platforms.

`uv add <path>` should always use slash (/).

Agreed, I assumed we did this already.
