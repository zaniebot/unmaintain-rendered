# Cannot  download Docker image

---

_Issue opened by @hipertracker on 2024-10-21 21:25_

From the web site: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pkgs/container/uv/292207825?tag=python3.13-bookworm

```
Install from the command line

$ docker pull ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm
```

It does not work:

`Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/astral-sh/uv/manifests/python3.13-bookworm": denied: denied`

I am using macOS 15.0.1 but that problem is not related to OS

Unfortunately this works just fine for me -- I suspect it must be some problem on your local machine?

It was a fault of Docker Desktop for Mac. After reinstallation the problem has gone.

For me, I just had to `docker login  ghcr.io`. Instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry
