# uv sync does not respect UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT

---

_Issue opened by @hongquan on 2024-12-25 04:44_

I set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to an absolute path (I want to have venv folder outside my project). Then I run `uv sync`, but it insists on creating `.venv` folder and install packages to this folder, instead of installing to the folder I provided via `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`.

My environment:
- `uv` v0.5.1
- Shell: Fish v4.0b1
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04

``echo $UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`` does not prove that you have set the environment variable.
Are you sure you've used ``export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`` to make this environment variable accessible to child processes?

Edit:
I'm using Colab, and it's working fine, so I think you haven't set up the environment variables correctly.

@FishAlchemist Thanks, I forgot to export the variable.
