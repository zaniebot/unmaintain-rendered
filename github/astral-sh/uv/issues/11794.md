# Get path to virtual environment for script

---

_Issue opened by @isak102 on 2025-02-26 09:48_

### Question

What I am trying to do is to get the path to the virtual environment for a script, so that I can use that virtual environment in my editor (neovim) so I get autocomplete on 3rd party libraries. `uv sync --script` was recently added in #11361 , and in the output you can see the path to the venv. But I am wondering if there is a command to just get the path to the venv without syncing?

I tried looking around in the docs if this feature is already suppoted but couldn't find anything.

There's not a way to get the path right now.

I'd be supportive of `uv python find --script <name>`, though I think you'd need to sync first? Maybe there's another interface we could do.

I think `uv python find` sounds good. Maybe return an error if the environment has not been created? Or maybe create if it it doesn't exist, but that sounds like `uv sync`.

The "best" solution for this seems like `uv sync --script foo.py --dry-run` with a (not yet implemented) JSON output format?
