# Provide `uv sync --all-dev` for workspace projects

---

_Issue opened by @tonnico on 2024-10-08 11:13_

I would like to install all dev dependencies in the workspaces.

Maybe you have the following structure:

```
.
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock
├── cdk
│  ├── pyproject.toml
│  ├── src
│  │  └── cdk
│  │     └── __init__.py
└── sources
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── README.md
   └── src
      ├── service_a
      │  └── __init__.py
      └── service_b
         └── __init__.py
```

In each pyproject.toml are different `dev-dependencies`.

Currently I can install only the `dev-dependencies` once each project. E.g.

```
uv sync  # installs dev from root only
uv sync --project cdk  # installs dev from cdk only
uv sync --project sources  # installs dev from sources only
```

I can work around this issue with
```
uv sync && uv sync --project cdk --inexact && uv sync --project sources --inexact
```

But a more handy version would be very nice. Something like
```
uv sync --all-dev
```

I think this may be best handled via an `--all-packages` flag to sync an entire workspace, as in: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6935.

`uv sync --all-packages` exists in the next release.
