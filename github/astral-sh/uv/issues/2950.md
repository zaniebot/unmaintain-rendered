# Avoid password in verbose output

_Issue opened by @avelychko12 on 2024-04-09 23:49_

If you run `uv pip install` with `--verbose` it will show you password in url
```
export UV_PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL="https://oauth2accesstoken:my_secret_token@europe-python.pkg.dev/project/pypi/simple/"                                                                         

uv pip install package --system --verbose                                                                                                                                                 0

```
pip will always show you https://oauth2accesstoken:****@europe-python.pkg.dev/project/pypi/simple/
For me, it looks like potential security issue, similar to what sqlalchemy had https://data.safetycli.com/v/51668/97c/
