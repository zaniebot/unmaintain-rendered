# Easily see installed packages when using uv run

---

_Issue opened by @jayqi on 2025-01-31 02:51_

### Summary

I am using `uv run --isolated` to run my library's tests in an isolated environment (as discussed [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9906#issuecomment-2544557551)). Sometimes, the cause of test failures is related to the version of a dependency, so I want to see what uv installs when creating my environment. Unfortunately, in the standard invocation, nothing gets printed out.

When I use the `--verbose` flag, it does print out the packages that get installed, but I also get 8000+ lines of DEBUG statements. 

I would like either a flag or more granular control on `--verbose` to be able to see what packages are installed without all of the DEBUG statements about resolution. 

uv 0.5.24

For reference, this is what I'm running (the templating comes from using Just):

```bash
    uv run --python {{python}} --no-editable --all-extras --no-dev --group test --isolated \
        python -I -m pytest {{args}}
```
