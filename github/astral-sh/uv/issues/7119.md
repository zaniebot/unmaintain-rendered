<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

Using the following requirements.in
```
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
numpy==1.26.4

```
and running
`uv pip compile -p 3.11 requirements.in -o requirements.lock`
gives
` × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of numpy==1.26.4 and you require
      numpy==1.26.4, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.`

When removing the --extra-index-url line, it works fine.

Happened with uv 0.4.6 on Ubuntu x86_64.

You very likely want `--index-strategy unsafe-best-match`. Please see here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#packages-that-exist-on-multiple-indexes.
