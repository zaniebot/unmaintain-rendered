# uv venv watch

---

_Issue opened by @gshotwell on 2025-03-07 14:06_

### Summary

I'm not quite sure about the right interface for this feature. 

I often find myself doing this:
- Create a venv
- Install packages with `uv pip install ...`
- Forget to update my requirements.txt file
- Deploy application somewhere that relies on requirements
- Swear and fix my requirements file
- Redeploy

What I'd really like is for uv to be able to watch my requirements.txt file and automatically add or remove packages as it was updated. 

### Example

- User calls `uv venv watch`
- A background process starts which watches `requirments.txt` file for changes and keeps the packages in `venv` up-to-date with the contents of `requirements.txt`

Is there a reason you are not using `uv add ...`? Are you bound to using `requirements.txt` rather than `pyproject.toml`?

_Comment by @gshotwell on 2025-03-07 15:36_

I am unfortunately, but I suppose I could export it from `pyproject.toml`. That's probably the way to go.

Take a look at [`uv export`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export).

A good starting place may be a command like: `uv export --no-hashes --format requirements-txt > requirements.txt`.

I do wish there was a simpler command to export directly to `requirements.txt` because I've run up against this problem in the past. We solved it by forcing corporate to install uv on our servers.

What's wrong with the hashes? `uv export -o requirements.txt` works

Sorry, bonked the button.

Anyway, I don't think we'll add this. This is the entire intent of the top-level uv commands i.e. `uv add` and `uv run` as a workflow instead of mutating and a live environment with `pip`

Yeah that makes sense, I think we can probably close this.
