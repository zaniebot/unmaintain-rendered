# Allow adding a dependency with no version constraint

---

_Issue opened by @skykasko on 2024-08-22 23:54_

`uv add` adds a lower bound version constraint by default. For example, calling `uv add requests` currently adds the dependency `"requests>=2.32.3"` to `pyproject.toml`.

It's possible to have uv use different upper and/or lower bounds, but I could not find a way to add a dependency without any version constraint at all. For example, I want the dependency `"requests"` added to `pyproject.toml` without any bounds.

The current default behavior is fine, but I think there should be some way to add an unconstrained dependency, either with a global configuration setting that changes the default behavior, or with a command-line option for `uv add`.

Apologies if I missed something in the documentation and this is already possible. (Of course I could edit `pyproject.toml` manually, but it doesn't seem like that should be necessary.)

Thanks for the great work on a fantastic project!

You can use `--raw-sources` to avoid adding a lower bound.

Thanks for the praise.

cc myself #5605 — we should cover this in the project concept documentation if we don't yet.

This is also not covered in the `--raw-sources` reference documentation.

@charliermarsh should we consider an easier name for this too? `--raw-sources` doesn't feel intuitive. Should it just be `--raw`?

That seems ok to me.

Just stumbled over this issue looking for this specific functionality and not finding it in the help. Isn't `--raw` and `--raw-sources` a little confusing? Wouldn't something more specific like `--no-version` be more intuitive?

`--raw` summarizes a number of features, including not inferring a version and not using `tool.uv.sources`. We avoid adding even more features to `uv add` by only using a single flag instead of flags for turning each automatism off manually.

@konstin: There doesn't appear to be a `--raw` option as far as I can tell. Did you mean `--raw-sources`?

```shellsession
> uv add --raw pandas
error: unexpected argument '--raw' found

  tip: a similar argument exists: '--raw-sources'

Usage: uv add --raw-sources <PACKAGES|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>>

For more information, try '--help'.
> uv --version
uv 0.7.3
```

We're renaming `--raw-sources` to `--raw`, it will be part of the next release: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/13348. `--raw-sources` will remain as an alias for `--raw` for backwards compatiblity. `--raw` is easier to understand in this context, so I went with the new option.

That's a good improvement! Could an example of using `uv add --raw httpx` be added to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#adding-dependencies? I believe that page is where I originally saw the example of how to add a version constraint, and got confused because I couldn't figure out how to omit the constraint.
