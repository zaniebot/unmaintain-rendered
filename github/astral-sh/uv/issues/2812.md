# Unable to install Pytorch

---

_Issue opened by @pedrocg42 on 2024-04-03 16:08_

I am using Python 3.11.7 and at the moment I am not being able to install pytorch using the recommended command:

```bash
uv pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

The result is:
```bash
× No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of torch==2.1.2 and you require torch==2.1.2, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
```
I know this is related to some other issues already mention [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2718#issuecomment-2025937721), but I think none of them state this problem in a simple way like this one here. 

In this other [comment](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2775#issuecomment-2032127858) @charliermarsh gives an example of how you would be able to apply some workaround, but I have not being able to apply them. Could you give an example of how to apply them for this specific case?

Thanks in advance! :)

Did you try using `--extra-index-url` instead of `--index-url`?

what platform did you run that on? https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch/ doesn't have anything for (py311, torch2.1.2, macos)

on my machine (macos + arm) py311 seems to be able to install those packages okay from the public pypi registry:
```
$ uv pip install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 torchaudio==2.1.2

No, but I just did and I got the same result. 

I was trying to replicate an issue that happens in a linux machine but now that you mention it I am running this in a macos machine where cuda is not compatible. I will reopen another issue when I run this in a cuda compatible machine. Thanks!
