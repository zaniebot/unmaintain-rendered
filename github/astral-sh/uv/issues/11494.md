# Support Kerberos Authentication to Proxy

---

_Issue opened by @jornfranke on 2025-02-13 22:47_

### Summary

uv uses reqwest to do requests to package repositories. 

Enterprise environments often have a proxy with Kerberos authentication. 

This is currently not supported in reqwest (see https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/953).

uv could it add itself in uv or one needs to add it to reqwest

### Example

_No response_

We're unlikely to add this without upstream support.

I agree with this. 

Hence, I referenced upstream. 

I will also check myself how this can be enabled in upstream or if someone is already working on it.
