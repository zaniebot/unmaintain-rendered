# Allow defining a root for all venvs

---

_Issue opened by @mil-ad on 2025-02-13 12:15_

### Summary

uv recently added `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` which is great but it would also be nice if there was an option, e.g. `UV_ENVIRONMENTS_DIR`, to define the root of all venvs. I guess this is similar to `envs_dirs` in conda except that uv venvs are nameless so you'd need to somehow use the project directory as the key in this root.

Use case: when the projects live on NFS drive, e.g. in Slurm setup, it could make sense to install the venv outside the project and somewhere on the local disk. Hardlinking doesn't work on NFS so uv falls back to copying which is slow. Users can define `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` but they sometimes forget to do so. A root directory allows admins to set it just once.
