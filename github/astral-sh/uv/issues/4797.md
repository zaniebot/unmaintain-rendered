# Use a relative path in `uv pip compile --emit-links`

---

_Issue opened by @oriori1703 on 2024-07-04 09:47_

When running `uv pip compile --emit-links` the lock file always contains `--find-links` with an absolute path.

For example the following:
```sh
echo "test-package --find-links ./wheels"  | uv pip compile - --emit-links
```
Will result in:
```
# This file was autogenerated by uv via the following command:
#    uv pip compile - --emit-links
--find-links /home/user/project/./wheels

test-package==1.0.0
```

The resulting lock file will not be portable between different computers, because the absolute path will be different.

IMO this is less desirable than a relative path.
