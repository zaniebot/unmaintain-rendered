# Feature request: More precise control of no-build-isolation: use same venv or skip build requirement resolution

---

_Issue opened by @JakkuSakura on 2025-03-12 12:22_

### Summary

Inspecting the code, --no-build-isolation not only disables the build isolation, but also disables build requirement resolution. In this mode, we need to manually configure the build env.
This causes confusions like #12128
We are trying to manage deployment without manual intervention, and we come from pip. In pip, the behavior is to install build-backend into the current venv. I think uv should be mimicking it.

While build isolation is the future, Implementing this feature could lower the migration difficulty coming from pip. If you are happy about the request, I'd like to open a PR for it

### Example

```
uv pip install --no-build-isolation --resolve-build-requirement
```

or
```
uv pip install --no-build-isolation --skip-build-requirement
```
