# Centralized location for virtual environments

---

_Issue opened by @callegar on 2024-08-23 09:46_

Apparently, uv wants the virtual environment for a project to reside inside a `.venv` directory in the project itself. Other tools (e.g., poetry,  pdm) let one use a single location for all the virtual environments corresponding to many projects (e.g. `~/.local/share/pdm/venvs`). While there are certainly situations where having everything related to a project self contained in there, in other cases a central location for virtual envs may have advantages (e.g. ease deduplication).

I wonder if this is supported or planned.
