# PYTHONPATH support for `uv` Python Package

---

_Issue opened by @ulucs on 2024-08-06 07:33_

(Sort-of related to, and would fix: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4450)

Python supports a myriad of methods to declare dependency locations, not all of which can be correctly identified by the `uv` Python package. For example, `PYTHONPATH`:

```
❯ PYTHONPATH=$VENV_PATH/lib/python3.10/site-packages python
Python 3.10.14 (main, Mar 19 2024, 21:46:16) [Clang 16.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import uv
>>> uv.find_uv_bin()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "$VENV_PATH/lib/python3.10/site-packages/uv/__init__.py", line 30, in find_uv_bin
    raise FileNotFoundError(path)
FileNotFoundError: /Users/(thats_me)/.local/bin/uv
```

which throws, even though the `uv` package is located in the environment.

## Expected Behavior

`uv.find_uv_bin()` correctly identifies that its binary should be located in `$VENV_PATH/bin` and returns `$VENV_PATH/bin/uv`

## Resonable Other Behavior

`uv.find_uv_bin()` falls back to fetching the binary location from `$PATH`, and gives the responsibility of correctly setting it to the process which populated `$PYTHONPATH`

Forgive my ignorance here, but isn't `PYTHONPATH` just a module search path? I don't quite see how we can "correctly" infer the virtual environment bin path from just the `PYTHONPATH`.
