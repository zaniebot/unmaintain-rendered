# Is there a way to get the virtual environment with the requirements from the script?

### Question

I have a script that have external dependencies and I want to be able to get the environment with those requirements to run an ipython shell for example

jobs/main.py
```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "pydantic",
# ]
# ///

def main():
    pass
```

For example
uv run --with jobs/main.py ipython

Sorry if that was asked before, I couldn't find it?

### Platform

Linux 6.14.6-arch1-1 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.6.5
