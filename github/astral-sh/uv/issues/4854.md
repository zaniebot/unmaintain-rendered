# `uv lock` should tell you whether the lockfile changed

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-07-07 09:33_

Currently, alternating between `uv lock --exclude-newer 2024-07-01 --upgrade`, `uv lock --exclude-newer 2024-07-02 --upgrade` and `uv lock --exclude-newer 2024-08-01 --upgrade` with a `transformers` requirement produces the same output each, even though the first produce use the same lockfile while the last one changes it. We should indicate whether the resolution changed.
