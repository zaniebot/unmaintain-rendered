# uv pip without venv

---

_Issue opened by @combiz on 2024-02-28 10:55_

We often use docker-based dev containers. In these, we typically skip creating a venv; with pip we can install the packages and freeze them without one. With uv, working with a venv seems to be enforced -- is this the case?

```
$ pip freeze
absl-py==2.1.0
agate==1.7.1
[...]
$ uv pip freeze
error: Failed to locate a virtualenv or Conda environment (checked: `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `CONDA_PREFIX`, and `.venv`). Run `uv venv` to create a virtualenv.
```

I ran into the same issue, and as a work arround I had to create and activate a virtual env within the docker file with code that looks like the snippet below. Maybe it can serve you too.

```docker
ENV VIRTUAL_ENV=/bin/venv
RUN uv venv $VIRTUAL_ENV
ENV PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"
```
