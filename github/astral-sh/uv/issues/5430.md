# Add `--isolate` or `--standalone` or similar flag to `uv run`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-07-24 22:14_

We want the ability to run outside of the base environment (e.g., `uv run -p foo --isolate` to run in a dedicated, standalone environment for `foo`, to enforce package isolation boundaries). Perhaps this will even be the default someday.
