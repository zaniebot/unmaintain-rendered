# Can't create virtual environment on ARMv7 Linux Musl

---

_Issue opened by @patrick-5546 on 2024-09-19 01:47_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

This is what I get trying to create a virtual environment:
```console
$ uv venv
  × Could not detect either glibc version nor musl libc version, at least one of which is required
```

Someone else also observed this issue here: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1438, but it was not fixed by #1427

I used the installation script to install version 0.4.12

I wonder if we didn't port the fix when we added the code again?

My situation may be a bit of a unique case, as I am running Linux on an ARM processor on the DE1-SoC FPGA. Here is some more information about my system
```console
$ cat /proc/version

Looks like there isn't a pre-built python binary that can run on my system, as the gnu versions require glibc >= 2.17, and there is no musl version

```console
$ wget https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20240909/cpython-3.11.10+20240909-armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-install_only_stripped.tar.gz
...

$ tar -xzf cpython-3.11.10+20240909-armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-install_only_stripped.tar.gz

$ ./python --version
./python: /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.17' not found (required by /home/root/Downloads/python/bin/../lib/libpython3.11.so.1.0)
./python: /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.16' not found (required by /home/root/Downloads/python/bin/../lib/libpython3.11.so.1.0)
```

Update

As a workaround, I was able to compile Python 3.8.20 from source (albeit with some failing and skipped tests) and use that to create a virtual environment

```
uv venv --python /usr/local/bin/python3.8
```

I think we can merge this with the musl issue then? ref #6890

The issue you linked is for apple silicon which is armv8, this issue is for armv7. Is support not planned for this?

The issue I linked discusses static musl builds in general, but yeah it's for aarch64 (though not apple silicon specifically? I don't know where you got that from). You can track armv7 musl support in https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/229
