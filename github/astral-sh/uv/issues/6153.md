This command needs a longer doc comment for reference documentation.

This might be unrelated to the issue. Have you considered providing usage instructions for shell-completions, similar to pixi?
https://pixi.sh/latest/#autocompletion

Or simplify it into a Starship way, output the auto-completed string, and then execute it.
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
```
```
> starship init powershell
Invoke-Expression (& 'C:\Program Files\starship\bin\starship.exe' init powershell --print-full-init | Out-String)
```
Invoke-Expression:

Starship:
https://starship.rs/

No, but we should document it similar to pixi.
