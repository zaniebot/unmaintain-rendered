# Should installed distributions use canonical or specified path?

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-06-02 21:34_

Right now, if you create a symlink, and `uv pip install` the symlink, then `uv pip freeze`, we list the canonical path (with symlinks resolved). Is this preferred? Or should we use the user-provided path? The latter is more complex as we still need to normalize it.

Perhaps use the canonical path for now, and then in the future the behaviour could be configurable.

Yeah, let's leave it as-is for now. Issue will continue to exist for users to find if it comes up in practice.
