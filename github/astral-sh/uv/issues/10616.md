# Read configuration, lockfile, etc. via a Python API

---

_Issue opened by @itsmatthu on 2025-01-14 23:05_

we'd like to read and operate uv configuration and lockfiles from Python code.

Instead of using Json or Toml parser directly on those files, is there any proper way to do stuff like this in Python project.

like `import uv.dependencies` or `import uv.configurations`.

I don't think we'll support this via Python API anytime soon, but we are thinking about adding a CLI command for the configuration.

Thanks for the information, we will reconsider our related use cases. hope it would support feature like this in the future.

We expect to have a Python API someday, but we can iterate much faster with a single public API right now.

@zanieb which one you mean, is it in the plan already?

Sorry I don't follow. We plan to do something like this eventually, but it's so far out that we don't know what it will look like.
