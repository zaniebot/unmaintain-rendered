# How to manage two uv environments under one project?

---

_Issue opened by @wzr0108 on 2025-09-04 02:59_

### Question

Because of code compatibility reasons, my training and inference require two different environments.
How can two environments correspond to different `.toml` files, and how to specify the environment when installing Python packages?


### Platform

Linux 5.15.0-107-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.7.4

uv currently doesn't support handling two separate venvs automatically, but you can use the `uv pip` interface and e.g. `uv pip install my-project[train]` in one venv and `uv pip install my-project[inference]` in the other.
