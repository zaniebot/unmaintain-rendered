# Operation Timeout on Pip Install

---

_Issue opened by @PeterParker on 2024-02-16 22:57_

On an internet connection with slow downloads a `uv pip install` often seems to lead to a timeout.

Here is an example error message:

```
20.82 Resolved 163 packages in 20.61s

320.0   Caused by: Failed to extract source distribution: request or response body error: operation timed out                                                
320.0   Caused by: request or response body error: operation timed out
320.0   Caused by: operation timed out
```

I am running `uv==0.1.2`.

Is there a way to increase the timeout to allow for slower downloads?

We currently have this hard-coded to 5 min https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0bfce353fba9f4a44d748c1d492a2efebaabd528/crates/uv-client/src/registry_client.rs#L85

I agree a setting seems important. Probably `UV_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` or `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT`?

This is really frustrating since I couldn't able to install pytorch. I hope it will be fixed soon
