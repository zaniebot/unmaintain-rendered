# uv export in a monorepo with workspaces: allow exporting dependencies for a subset of packages

---

_Issue opened by @totternessZB on 2025-10-29 21:04_

### Summary

A project that I work on at my job is structured as a monorepo. Some of the projects within the monorepo are for automated testing and are never deployed in production. Our security check currently includes dependencies from these, which can be a waste of our time. Our security tool operates on requirements.txt files. 

Right now, we can export all of our dependencies for the workspace with `uv export --all-packages ...` or export requirements for a single package like `uv export --package [desired-package-name] ...`

I would like to be able to do something like:
`uv export --package [desired-package-1] [desired-package-2] ...`
`uv export --all-packages --except [excluded-package-1] [excluded-package-2] ...`
or
`uv export --package [desired-packge-1] --package [desired-package-2] ...`
(I trust y'all to make good judgement on exactly how to implement it)

In short. If a monorepo has N packages in the workspace, I'd like to be able to simply export the collective requirements for X of the packages where 1 < X < N. If there is already a way to do this and I just missed it, please let me know 👍 

Version: 0.9.6
Operating system: Mac / Linux 
Command(s) ran: see 2nd paragraph and the commands I'd like to run above
Command output: not relevant

hey, using uv 0.9.5 here.
`uv export --help` shows a bunch of options that look like what you need. For example the --package or the --only-group ones.

> hey, using uv 0.9.5 here. `uv export --help` shows a bunch of options that look like what you need. For example the --package or the --only-group ones.

--package allows you to export the dependencies for exactly 1 workspace package. This flag cannot be used to export, for example, the dependencies for exactly 2 workspace packages.
--only-group allows you to specify a specific dependency group to install, which is a different thing than specifying which packages within my monorepo are being exported.

I think we should allow multiple packages here. I just did it for `uv sync`, but we can do it here too.

Thank you, @charliermarsh! Looking forward to making use of this when the next release drops 👀
