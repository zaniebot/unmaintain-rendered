# Storage locations too scattered. Docs need a dedicated section explaining this. 

---

_Issue opened by @w-hc on 2025-05-22 22:41_

### Summary

Hi I use an NFS setup and optimizing storage allocation vs speed is a priority.  

UV uses quite a few directories that can grow large over time. `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `UV_PYTHON_CACHE_DIR`, etc and how they interact with `UV_LINK_MODE`. 

A suggestion is to dedicate a page in the docs to describe the storage strategy and all locations and all the environment variables we need to set. Right now the docs explain things piecemeal. 

With the current docs, I can do this by browsing https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/ but I believe a dedicated doc page is helpful for users to understand UV's caching strategy and having the peace of mind that they aren't missing anything.

uv overall prioritizes speed over disk usage. It writes uses the cache a lot, but it's also fine if you remove the cache (e.g., `uv cache prune`).

uv uses the XDG specification as basis for deciding where files go: Cache for everything transient, `~/.local/share` for permanent data such as Python interpreters and scripts, config home for the user-level `uv.toml`, the bin home for launchers. The one special trick uv pulls is that installations into a venv are hardlinked (that's the link mode) from the cache. This allows fast installation, while the cache can still be removed without breaking venvs.

thanks @konstin for the help. I really like UV. Just saying that the docs can use a page to focus on storage.

I drafted a page for this at #13976, but haven't had a chance to finish it.
