I think we need to set meta titles for every page, like:

```yaml
---
title: "Docker | uv"
description: "Using uv in Docker."
---
```

Separately we need to change the favicon to Astral since IIRC it has to be shared between Ruff and uv.

I changed the favicon. I don't know if the site titles will also get corrected based on my changes.
