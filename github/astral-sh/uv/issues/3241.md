# Supports the installation of new Python versions that do not exist locally

_Issue opened by @boringplay on 2024-04-24 14:46_

To install new Python versions similar to pyenv, use:
```
pyenv install -v 3.7.2
```
At present, `uv` only supports the installation of Python versions that have already been installed locally.
