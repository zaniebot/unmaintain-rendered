# `conflicts` schema definition in schemastore seems incorrect

---

_Issue opened by @mickvangelderen on 2025-02-03 11:30_

### Summary

https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pull/4224#issuecomment-2630683734


The following passes validation:

```toml
[tool.uv]
conflicts = [
    [
        { conflict = { Extra = "cpu" } },
        { conflict = { Extra = "cu124" } },
    ],
]
```

but UV expects:

```toml
[tool.uv]
conflicts = [
    [
        { extra = "cpu" },
        { extra = "cu124" },
    ],
]
```


### Platform

### Version
