# Request to Reintroduce HTTP Support for Git URLs

---

_Issue opened by @kubotty on 2025-02-21 02:45_

### Summary

Hi,

Support for HTTP (not HTTPS) as a Git URL was discontinued starting from version 0.6.2 of uv. However, we are still utilizing this in our internal server, and we would like to continue using it.

We would like to request the reintroduction of this feature. Alternatively, if there is any workaround or alternative solution, please let us know.

### Example

_No response_

I think this might've been an oversight.
