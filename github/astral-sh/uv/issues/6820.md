# refactor `ExcludeNewer` to avoid accidentally exposing "local date" input

---

_Issue opened by @BurntSushi on 2024-08-29 16:34_

Basically, see: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6562#pullrequestreview-2269422424

Right now, we are relying on `ExcludeNewer` in `uv-resolver` to have different implementations for `Deserialize` and `FromStr` in order to avoid allowing "local" dates in the `[tool.uv]` section. That seems very easy to accidental mess up, so we should either at least add a comment or change the code to make this harder to mess up.
