# Where is the difference between ``complete uv`` and separated ``uv_build``?

---

_Issue opened by @FishAlchemist on 2025-07-01 14:01_

### Question

I've looked at the documentation on the main branch, and I only know that **uv_build** is built into **uv**.
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/3774a656d7c864370408b8c253909af3b83296d5/docs/concepts/build-backend.md

I want to confirm: Is **uv_build** fully compatible with any configuration of the **complete uv** of the same version? 
This includes reading environment variables and behaving the same as **uv** when installing packages.

Can a note be made in the documentation regarding the differences between **uv_build** and the **complete uv**?

`uv_build` can't do much, from a user perspective it's really just the value you put in the `build-system` table. `uv_build` doesn't install packages, it can only build a package in an environment prepared by a build environment. It does react to the same environment variables as uv, e.g. for logging, but it reads only the few environment variables it needs for its limited functionality.

`uv` and `uv_build` for the same version are built from the same rust crates, except `uv_build` dependency tree is a subset of that of `uv`, so it's more portable and smaller. Does that answer your question? I'm having a hard time explaining the differences as one is a subset of the other, but also as a user, you should only need to interact with `uv` expect for the two lines that have `uv_build` in them.

So, can I assume the following three points are correct?
*  `uv_build` only reads the content of `[tool.uv.build-backend]` and the configuration information required for the build.
* Regarding environment variables, `uv_build` only includes those necessary for building packages, and its behavior is consistent with `uv`.
* Do not read `[tool.uv]` and `[[tool.uv.index]]` because they are almost exclusively related to project management and installation.

My main goal is to avoid mistakenly assuming `uv_build` has the same rich functionality as `uv`, apart from the CLI.

yes that's correct.
