# Deploy Azure Devops pipeline extension to use Python service connections

---

_Issue opened by @VBA-N7 on 2025-07-18 08:26_

### Summary

Hi everyone,  

In my company, we use Azure DevOps and rely on [service connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops) to centralize credentials, for example when uploading to Artifactory.  
In this case, I’m specifically referring to our internal PyPI repository.  

Currently, the only way to upload to a PyPI repository using a service connection is through the [Twine task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/twine-authenticate-v1?view=azure-pipelines).  

It would be great to have a dedicated `uv upload` task in the pipeline that supports service connections.  

Alternatively, it would also help if `uv` could use a `.pypirc` file generated by the [Twine task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/twine-authenticate-v1?view=azure-pipelines).  

**In short:**  
I’m trying to use the `uv publish` command, which handles everything perfectly—except for integrating with service connections or any artifact produced by a service connection that `uv` could consume.

Thanks for your future answers !

Does AzureDevOps also expose credentials through an action that is not tool specific? uv supports different forms of authentication, including credentials in the URL and keyring, but it does not read from other tool's configuration files such as `.pypirc`.

I'm using JFrogGenericArtifacts@1 task. This task is so big for nothing. 
```yaml
- task: JFrogGenericArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    command: 'Upload'
    connection: 'Artifactory connection service'
    specSource: 'taskConfiguration'
    fileSpec: |
      {
        "files": [
          {
            "pattern": "dist/*.whl",
            "target": "$(uploadPath)"
          },
          {
            "pattern": "dist/*.tar.gz",
            "target": "$(uploadPath)"
          }
        ]
      }
    failNoOp: true
  displayName: 'Upload package to Artifactory'
```
