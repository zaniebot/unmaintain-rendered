# Tools break (understandably) after upgrading system Python

---

_Issue opened by @akx on 2024-10-24 06:38_

I ran a long-overdue `brew upgrade` on my system yesterday, and since `python@3.12 3.12.4 -> 3.12.7_1`, I knew I'd have to nuke my venvs (which is related to #1495 – since my venvs are in `~/venvs`, I don't need to hunt them around my project folders...) since the base interpreter is gone.

`uv tool`s also break (though `pipx`-installed tools haven't broken! I suppose `pipx` doesn't fully resolve a symlink Python executable and just uses `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12` instead of `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.7_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3.12`?), and `uv tool list` doesn't make it perfectly easy to recover:

```
$ uv tool list
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/akx/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/jupyter-core/bin/python3`
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/akx/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/pre-commit/bin/python3`
Python interpreter not found at `/Users/akx/Library/Application Support/uv/tools/segno/bin/python3`
```

Happily, I have Fish shell history to help me, so I knew to `uv tool install segno --with qrcode-artistic` and `uv tool install pre-commit --with pre-commit-uv` (and get rid of Jupyter, that was just for testing).

```
$ uv tool list
pre-commit v4.0.1
- pre-commit
segno v1.6.1
- segno
```

## Ideas:

* `uv tool reinstall-all`? Looks like tools' `uv-receipt.toml`s contain the requirements, so `uv` could just Do The Thing.

I believe this is a duplicate of #1640 (which we are attempting to address in #8419 via #8481)

There's also some related issues
