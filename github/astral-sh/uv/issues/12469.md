# uv error happening forrr only one individual on the team `RuntimeEor: Error getting the version from source "uv-dynamic-versioning"`

_Issue opened by @adiberk on 2025-03-25 18:18_

### Summary

Everything seems to work fine but one of my co-workers started seeing this error after our migration to uv

I am not sure if I should be posting this issue here or not - so I apologize in advance

We don't run any build or anything in this project, we simply install dependencies and use that generated env to run our code. (And I am more than happy to remove the hatch build information if that helps, I had it there during earier iterations of uv)

This looks like a `pip install` error, not a uv error.
