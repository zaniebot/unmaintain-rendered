# insufficient retrying around transient errors during `uv sync` (os error 104 in this case)

---

_Issue opened by @jgehrcke on 2024-10-12 11:19_

With uv 0.4.20 while running `uv sync --locked` I saw this:

```

The log does not reveal if any retry was attempted. Such transient errors should certainly be retried for a small-ish number of times, up to a reasonable deadline.

As I have thought and talked a lot about the relevance of retries around transient errors in distributed systems and CI: once we improve the retrying logic it would be great to have explicit logs indicating those error and retries, leading up to success.

I believe we already have this.

_Comment by @konstin on 2024-10-12 15:39_

If we did retry, we show "Request failed after 3 retries" in the error chain, so this error failed our retrying and was not retried as it should have been.

Currently, we only show individual retries with eventual success with `-v`, but we can certainly bump that to a warning (<https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/ad638d7fa394303f09d8bd0e8bde474702dff606/crates/uv-client/src/base_client.rs#L402-L413>)

I'm confused, I don't see "after 3 retries" in the error message?

_Comment by @konstin on 2024-10-12 16:03_

there's was a _not_ critically missing in that sentence

I see this error occasionally, and need to rerun uv, if it is retrying it would be a better user experience to include how many times it tried in the final user error message, this would allow the user to be more empathetic to uv when it happens ("hey, at least it tried!").


---

_Comment by @notatallshaw on 2024-10-12 16:08_

Oh, with context of the *not*, as I reported in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3514#issuecomment-2341462736, I also occasionally get this error and there is no mention of a retry.

_Comment by @konstin on 2024-10-12 16:08_

I agree that there should be messaging about retries, but iirc the problem here specifically is that that code path isn't in our retry logic at all (streaming or range requests, at least that what it's look likes from the logs, this needs a proper investigation of course), so what's missing is hooking this into our retry logic, which will then also print proper feedback about retries.

Sorry to harp on about this, but currently I've migrated my works dev environment tooling to uv, I took a look at migrating our build tooling to uv yesterday and faced this error several times.

Our build tooling has a lower tolerance for errors because it's more difficult to recover from, so I've put migrating on hold for now. 

I'm not in a rush, I can revisit this in the future, but I imagine it will cause other users not to migrate to uv, and they won't make a GitHub issue about it.

Let me know if there's anything useful I can run to help. I can't reproduce it consistently, but I'm happy to try a few times a week.

I'm not clear where the error originates so I'm trying to get better traces with #8285.

_Comment by @notatallshaw-gts on 2024-10-21 14:50_

I see that PR landed so I ran my build setup with `ENV RUST_LOG=uv=trace` and set uv to 0.4.25, and I got the error immediately.

FYI, I _suspect_ the network issue on our end is the firewall decides it needs to do a security scan of the package, it kills the network connection, after the security scan is complete the same requests work for, at least a few more days, but at some point it falls out of the firewall cache (most our builds are cached so we don't normally make this network request). Compared to uv, it appears pip's timeout/retry mechanism will wait long enough for the security scan to complete.

Find below as much as the end log as I could fit in this post, if you need me to attach the entire log I will need to make a request to access gist (it is blocked by default).

I am following this with keen eyes. Thanks for the efforts here @konstin and also @notatallshaw for providing quick feedback.

Another one from within GitHub Actions CI:

```

This was `uv sync --locked` with `0.4.28`.

Instead of `Connection reset by peer (os error 104)` here we instead see `stream closed because of a broken pipe`. This is just another variant of a transport error. Transient. A little bit of retrying would have auto-healed this in all likelihood.

This week my company made a change to their network security stack meaning I am unlikely to be able to reproduce this error again. So apologies, I see there was an additional PR that landed that gives more info but I am not likely going to be able to trigger it.

_Comment by @jgehrcke on 2024-11-13 14:17_

@konstin @charliermarsh I'd love to help here, retrying around transient errors is a passion of mine but I have no Rust experience. Meh.

What do we think about prioritizing this relative to other things?

We keep seeing this in CI every now and then. Of course, an outer retrying watchdog thingy can always do the trick, but now that `uv` is still so young it would be cool to show to the world that we take "best-best-best-effort retrying" serious :-) :heart:

Thanks again for all the great work you're doing.

I spoke too soon, here is an error I got today where I am testing migrating our build system to use uv (and fortunately I am leaving trace logs on until I think we are ready):

Thanks for the verbose logs. We must still be missing a site or two.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-18 17:16_

(I'll try to debug today.)

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-18 20:19_

Oh interesting -- that failure is actually in fetching the _metadata_, not the wheel itself.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-11-18 20:47_

I think the issue @notatallshaw-gts is experiencing is that we aren't retrying on body errors when fetching `.metadata` files.

---

_Comment by @notatallshaw-gts on 2024-11-18 20:55_

Yes, I think I mentioned it appeared to be the metadata before (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/3514#issuecomment-2341724943), of course, no idea if others have the same issue, but I'm seeing it on a very popular corporate firewall (Palo Alto).

Yeah I have a reproduction, we just don't seem to be retrying those, but it looks like we _should_ be so still trying to understand why.

Thank you @charliermarsh!

FYI, I still got an error on 0.5.3  but I was running docker build without `--progress=plain` 😞, so I only have the last few lines and didn't see if retried or not. I'll open a new issue if I am able to catch it again with more context.
