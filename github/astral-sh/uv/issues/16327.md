# h11 0.14.0 dependency has a critical security vulnerability

---

_Issue opened by @kwmlodozeniec on 2025-10-16 07:19_

### Summary

One of the dependencies in the source, sub dependency of httpcore, h11 0.14.0 has a critical vulnerability.

Link to the CVE [https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj)

Issue has been patched in 0.16.0 so it might be worth considering bumping that if possible.

We have uncovered that during our regular security scan when building uv from source.

It seems the earliest version of httpcore that calls for h11>=0.16.0 is 1.0.9 [https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/1.0.9/pyproject.toml](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/blob/1.0.9/pyproject.toml)

and in turn the oldest httpx version that starts calling for httpcore==1.* is 0.25.1 onwards [https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/0.25.1/pyproject.toml](https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/0.25.1/pyproject.toml)

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04.3

### Version

uv 0.9.3

### Python version

Not relevant

This is a Rust project, we're not using the Python package h11.

Can you link to where this scanner claims that uv would be using the Python package h11, could it be that the scanner didn't differentiate between test fixtures and actual dependencies?

I cannot share a link as this is one of our internal systems. However, I have had a look through the sources and I can see you are correct, that library is used in tests. I guess this issue can be closed on this basis.
