# List where packages where installed from (sdist/wheel)

---

_Issue opened by @Rogdham on 2025-04-23 08:44_

### Question

Hello, I would like to find which packages were installed from a sdist and which from a wheel. Or alternately, given a Python version (and OS, etc.), which packages are available as wheels on a given index URL.

### Context illustration

For example, I'm building an application using Python 3.12. I have set up CI building the application etc.

Now I want to upgrade to Python 3.13. Some dependencies don't have a wheel uploaded on PyPi for Python 3.13 (some of them because I need to upgrade them beforehand).

I would like to have a way to know, when upgrading to Python 3.13, which dependencies will break on the CI side because they cannot be installed from a wheel (e.g. I don't have the build toolchain on the CI to build C extensions).

### Related

I can see that with `uv pip list --outdated`, a column `Type` (`latest_filetype` in JSON format) seems to give the info:

```
# uv --version
uv 0.6.16
# uv venv
Using CPython 3.13.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
# uv pip install ruff==0.9.0
Resolved 1 package in 620ms
Prepared 1 package in 379ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.9.0
# uv pip list --outdated    
Package Version Latest Type
------- ------- ------ -----
ruff    0.9.0   0.11.6 wheel
```

However, if the package is in its last version, I cannot find how to display the info:

```
# uv --version
uv 0.6.16
# uv venv
Using CPython 3.13.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
# uv pip install ruff
Resolved 1 package in 101ms
Prepared 1 package in 402ms
Installed 1 package in 2ms
 + ruff==0.11.6
# uv pip list --outdated
# uv pip list
Package Version
------- -------
ruff    0.11.6
```

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04

### Version

uv 0.6.16

One option to test this is installing the packages with `--no-build`, which errors instead of building source distributions, showing the offending package.

I don't think we can display this with `uv pip list` in general, because I don't _think_ we can tell if a package was installed from source or from a wheel -- since all source distributions are first built into wheels?

Oh, I was under the impression that you could, because of the output of `uv pip list --outdated`, but maybe I'm completely wrong here? In which case, do you know what does the `Type` column refers to?

```
# uv pip list --outdated    
Package Version Latest Type
------- ------- ------ -----
ruff    0.9.0   0.11.6 wheel
```

It works for `--outdated` because in that case, we hit the server to fetch the list of available versions / files, and the `Type` refers to the type that would be used when installing the `Latest` version. So `Type` refers to `Latest`, not the installed distribution.
