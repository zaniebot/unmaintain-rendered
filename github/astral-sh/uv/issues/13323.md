# Global cache for all users on a machine like `/uv`

---

_Issue opened by @Ruhrozz on 2025-05-07 06:54_

### Summary

It would be a great feature to be able to use the same cache for every user. I imagine something like /nix/store for downloaded from pypi packages

### Example

_No response_

@Ruhrozz 
you can set UV_CACHE_DIR

see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-cache-prune--cache-dir

We're tracking this in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5611

There are some complexities to the sharing the cache across users though.
