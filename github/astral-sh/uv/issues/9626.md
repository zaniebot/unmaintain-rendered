# uv monorepo tooling support

---

_Issue opened by @gracevivi523 on 2024-12-04 01:21_

Hi team, we are exploring the use of `uv workspace` for our python monorepo. In our setup, the monorepo contains multiple internal libraries and some depend on each other, for example:
- `library A` depends on `library B`, which depends on `library C`

Each library has its individual version defined in its `pyproject.toml` file, each library needs to be built and published to our internal package index. When I change the code and bump the version of `library A`, I also need to bump `library B` and `library C` to reference the updated version of `library A`.

I am wondering if there are any plans for `uv` to support monorepo tooling like `pants` which can 
- Track dependencies changes in a monorepo.
- Build **ONLY** affected packages (e.g. `library A and B and C` in this case) 
- Handle automatic version bumps for impacted packages

Alternatively, are there any existing workarounds in `uv workspace` that can achieve this functionality? I see there are a few issues that mention monorepo, but I do not see a working solution yet.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response!
