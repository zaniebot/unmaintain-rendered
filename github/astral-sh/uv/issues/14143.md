# Wishlist: let `uv tool install --reinstall` remember how a tool was installed

---

_Issue opened by @callegar on 2025-06-19 08:24_

### Summary

Suppose that for some reason you want to install a newer point release of python via uv: `uv python install 3.13.5` and that you want that to substitute for the previous minor release, so that you also do `uv python uninstall 3.13.4`.

In principle, this should be a painless operation, since CPython is ABI compatible across minor-releases even at the C-API level.

*CPython’s Application Binary Interface (ABI) is forward- and backwards-compatible across a minor release (if these are compiled the same way; see [Platform Considerations](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable-abi-platform) below). So, code compiled for Python 3.10.0 will work on 3.10.8 and vice versa, but will need to be compiled separately for 3.9.x and 3.11.x.*

However, all tools installed with `uv tool` will break, because the current version of python is specified via a symlink to the minor release, not to the release (e.g. there is not a link to some managed python 3.13, but to the specific 3.13.4). Nonetheless, uv tool will report that nicely. For instance saying `uv tool list` might end up saying:

```
warning: Broken symlink at `/home/user/.local/share/uv/tools/retext/bin/python3`,
was the underlying Python interpreter removed?
```

also suggesting how to fix the problem:

```
hint: Consider recreating the environment (e.g., with `uv venv`) (run `uv tool install retext --reinstall` to reinstall)
```

The problem is that to use the hint, one actually needs to remember *how the tool was installed* (e.g. the extras - stuff that goes in brakets as in `uv tool install package[extra] --reinstall` and the stuff on the `--with` parameter). Would be great if one could say: `uv tool install package --reinstall --keep-setup` or something similar.

Even better would be to have a shorthand doing that for all the tools.

#13954 will resolve the issue of the Python interpreter breaking.

I think we could consider retaining options during `uv tool install <package> --reinstall`, I'm not sure. A simple elucidation of the existing behavior is:

```
