# Recovering from a partially deleted .venv

---

_Issue opened by @jaraujo98 on 2025-11-26 19:51_

### Question

I have a project with fairly large dependencies (`.venv` folder is several 10s of GB large). I accidentally ran `rm -r` on my project root, but thankfully the first directory it started cutting away at was `.venv`, so I managed to catch it in time and save my project. However, part of `.venv` is now missing. When I run `python` I get some warnings saying editable modules cannot be resolved, but other than that `python` seems fine. I tried `uv sync`, but it exits cleanly, so it seems that `uv` is not detecting the environment corruption. I also tried `uv sync --refresh`, but it also did nothing. Can this be fixed with a single call to `uv sync`, or will I have to recreate my environment from scratch?

### Platform

Linux 5.15.0-151-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.8.22

`uv sync` will only look at the `.dist-info` directories in the environment (which is kind of like the metadata that indicates a package is installed), so if those are intact, it won't be able to detect that a given package is missing. Unfortunately I can't think of a great way to recover from a "partial deletion" here.

Ok, good to know! Is the recommended way to recreate the environment to

```
rm -r .venv  # Yikes...
uv sync
```

Or is there another one?

That's the recommendation. We use hard links from the cache into the environment on Linux so creating the virtual environment should be very fast after deletion unless your cache is on a different file system.
