# Has uv considered providing management for switching global Python versions?

_Issue opened by @Autumn-one on 2024-10-24 17:30_

At present, if uv seems to be not good at managing global python versions, and pyenv provides global python version switching functionality through shim, do uv have plans to provide similar functionality?
