# Add a garbage collection command for the cache

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-01-23 05:40_

As of PRs like #1037, we store entries in the cache in a common archive, with cache buckets symlinking into the archive. We should clean up old cache entries periodically by looking for directories in the archive with no links pointing to them.

(This would be different from `puffin clean`, which deletes the cache entirely.)
