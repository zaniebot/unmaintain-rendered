# uv pip install doesn't work in TF memory card

---

_Issue opened by @Word2VecT on 2025-03-12 03:57_

### Summary

When I use

`uv venv`
`uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

within a project stored on **memory card**, I encounter the error 

> error: Operation not supported (os error 45).

However, everything works fine when the project is located on my local storage.

Can you follow this portion of the "Before posting in the issue tracker?"

Sorry for my carelessness.

What file system does this memory card use? uv uses features such as symlinks and hardlinks that the filesystem may not support.

Tagging this as "error messages" because we need to show more context which operation is not permitted.

**ExFAT**, and it doesn't support symlinks as I know [https://superuser.com/questions/232257/does-or-will-exfat-support-symlinks](url)

It's a huge work for me to change it to NTFS, is there any other solutions? thanks.

And I tried change the `--link-mode` but didn't work.

#14404 appears to have fixed this in 0.7.19, but also #17115 should fix the underlying issue.
