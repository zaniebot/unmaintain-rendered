There's `rye.astral.sh`, there's `astral.sh/ruff`, and then there's `astral.sh/uv` which points to this github repo. Any plans for standardization? I'd love to see landing pages at `astral.sh/<tool>`, and the corresponding docs at `docs.astral.sh/<tool>`

Yes. we'll need a landing page for uv (created https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5974). I don't know if we'll add Rye to the Astral website — we've taken over stewardship of the project but I'm not sure it's a "product under our brand".
