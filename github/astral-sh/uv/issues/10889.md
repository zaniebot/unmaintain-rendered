# Document how to specify subdirectory in git urls

---

_Issue opened by @mickvangelderen on 2025-01-23 08:05_

### Summary

Currently [the documentation mentions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#git): 

> A subdirectory may be specified if the package isn't in the repository root.

From this sentence it is not clear **how** to actually specify the subdirectory. Only while writing a PR to add a `--subdirectory` parameter to `uv add` (which turns out to be unnecessary) I found out that the subdirectory should be specified in the URL as a fragment: `<url>#subdirectory=<subdirectory>`.
