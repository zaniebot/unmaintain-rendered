# Feature request: `pyproject.toml` formatting and validation

---

_Issue opened by @gorewilliams on 2025-07-31 19:35_

### Summary

Add support for:
1. Formatting `pyproject.toml` to a consistent style (ordering, wrapping, indentation)
2. Validating `pyproject.toml` against [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) and tool-specific schemas/semantics

### Motivation
`pyproject.toml` has become the single source of truth for modern Python projects (build system, dependencies, tool configs). It therefore deserves fast, accurate validation and formatting.

### Related discussions
1. Feature request for uv to support `pyproject.toml` formatting: [uv#6308](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6308)
2. Interest in `pyproject.toml` validation: [ruff#7839](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7839)

### Existing tools
1. Formatting tool: [pyproject-fmt](https://github.com/tox-dev/pyproject-fmt)
2. Validation tool: [validate-pyproject](https://github.com/abravalheri/validate-pyproject)

### Potential UX
A Ruff-style interface:
```bash
uv format
uv check --fix
```
Or a single, simpler command that handles both formatting and validation:
```bash
uv pretty
```
Or maybe even auto-format on `uv sync`..?
I’d love to hear your thoughts :)

It's unlikely we'll tackle this in the near-term, though it is interesting.

For (2), Ruff has a lint to validate pyproject.toml: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/invalid-pyproject-toml/

@konstin that's awesome! I was not aware of that at all, thx!
Adding a formatting rule to Ruff (alongside the existing validation rule) would be cool.
