# Add Windows unit test coverage to `uv-interpreter` discovery

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-05-21 17:26_

Follow-up to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/3266

Our mock interpreters only work on Unix, so we don't have good Windows test coverage for interpreter discovery behavior. We should build a mock interpreter utility for Windows.
