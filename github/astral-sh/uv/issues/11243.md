# When will 3.12.9 be available to install?

---

_Issue opened by @peterbe on 2025-02-05 13:02_

### Question

Yesterday (Feb 4, 2025), Python 3.12.9 came out. [Changelog here](https://docs.python.org/release/3.12.9/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-12-9). 
I know it's been possibly less than 24h hours, but it's not available yet. 

```
❯ uv python install -n 3.12.9
error: No download found for request: cpython-3.12.9-macos-aarch64-none
```

It's not desperately urgent, but I'm curious how this works. 

### Platform

Darwin 24.3.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.5.28 (Homebrew 2025-02-05)

We'll aim to publish these today. We need to build them over in https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone, then cut a release here.

I'm sorry if this is a dumb user question, but I see 3.12.9 on https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20250205
but still coming up empty on 
```
❯ uv python -n list | rg 3.12.9

```

Have you upgraded uv? The available Python versions are coupled to the uv version.

```
❯ brew upgrade uv && uv python -n list | rg 3.12.9

...

cpython-3.12.9-macos-aarch64-none                   <download available>
```

I did not know that. I live in Node (but Pythonista at heart!) and I'm pretty sure `fnm` (the Node equivalent) reads available Node executables from a remote list. 

Perhaps this knowledge gap/assumption could be considered an improvement to the `uv python` CLI for the next person, just like me, who doesn't realize they have to upgrade `uv` to get new versions.
