D:\+AI\uv\312>uv venv
error: Request failed after 3 retries
  Caused by: Failed to download https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20251007/cpython-3.12.11%2B20251007-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-install_only_stripped.tar.gz
  Caused by: error sending request for url (https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20251007/cpython-3.12.11%2B20251007-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-install_only_stripped.tar.gz)
  Caused by: client error (Connect)
  Caused by: invalid peer certificate: UnknownIssuer

这里给大家提供一个解决方法，事实上 我用浏览器下载上面这个文件，一点问题也没有，为什么出错呢？很可能是延迟太高，解析太慢，uv给的超时时间太短了。
先从这里找到一个最快的代理 https://github.akams.cn/
我炮制了这样一个链接 [https://jiashu.1win.eu.org/https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download](https://jiashu.1win.eu.org/https:/github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download)
然后
D:+AI\uv\312>set UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=https://jiashu.1win.eu.org/https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download
D:\+AI\uv\312>setx UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR "https://jiashu.1win.eu.org/https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download"
就解决问题了。

There's a problem with a proxy, I presume? You might want to search for other TLS / UnknownIssuer issues. You may want to use `--native-tls`.
