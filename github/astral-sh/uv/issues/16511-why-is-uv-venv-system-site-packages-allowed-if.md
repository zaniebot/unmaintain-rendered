Some users have asked for this feature, since it's used in some of their existing workflows and other tools support it: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1483.

It's off-by-default, so it doesn't cause problems, you have to explicitly use the flag if you want to use it. We don't recommend using it, and the large majority of our users don't use it, but some users can't do without it.

Alright, live dangerously, I partake.
