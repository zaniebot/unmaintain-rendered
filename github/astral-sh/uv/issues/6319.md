# Install python releases from offline registry

---

_Issue opened by @DataOps7 on 2024-08-21 11:40_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

When running `uv python install` allow to specify a registry other than `python-build-standalone` on GitHub.
I want to allow users to use `uv` to manage Python versions but we're working in an offline air-gapped network.

Thanks!

We do support a proxy URL for this (`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`) -- does that help? Could you serve them on `localhost`? What if it could accept a `file:` URL?

Accepting a folder like conda [custom disk-based channels](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/create-custom-channels.html) would be the easiest way how to use this on an air-gapped system.

I think `file://` for MIRROR is probably the move here?

Yeah. We probably need to modify the “download” code a bit to handle that.

Making "fetch" sound like a better name again 😭 haha

I'm currently using self-compiled Python binaries on a air-gapped Debian system to create venvs with different versions for my various projects, along with accompanying "global" venvs I use to create project venvs with, so my workflow is like this:

```
$ git init new_project
$ activate_py12 # activates "global" ~/python/venv-3.12
$ cd new_project
$ python -m venv .venv # project now has a local 3.12 venv
```

I expected that when I install `uv` in my "global" 3.12 venv I would be able this installation as Python version in `uv` when passing `system` or `only-system` as my `python-preference`, but that does not work, it still only finds the Debian system Python v3.11. How can I convince `uv` to use the version and interpreter in the currently running (v)env?

For some commands, like those that create a virtual environment, we don't look for interpreters _in_ virtual environments. Instead, you should add the interpreter to your PATH. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/python-versions/#discovery-of-python-versions
