# Add a configuration like `default-groups` for optional dependencies

---

_Issue opened by @etienne-monier on 2025-04-28 12:09_

### Summary

Hi,

there is a `default-groups` configuration to specify the dependency groups to sync by default.

That would be great to have such configuration for optional dependencies.

In my situation, I've got an optional dependency to include by default in dev mode, as is includes packages for a currently developed feature.

Thanks a lot for your incredible work!
