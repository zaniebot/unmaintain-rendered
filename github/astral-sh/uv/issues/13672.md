# Allow bypassing SSL verification in uv installation script

---

_Issue opened by @eegli on 2025-05-27 07:50_

### Summary

When installing uv via the [standalone installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) behind a corporate proxy, curl might fail due to self-signed certificates.

The remote installation script can be fetched by adding the `-k` flag:

```sh
curl -kLsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

However, the script itself has no option to disable SSL verification:
> $ curl -kLsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
downloading uv 0.7.8 x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate in certificate chain
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

Downloading `install.sh` and modifying `downloader()` sure works but I'd rather rely on the remote script for installation. [Configuration options for the installer](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/installer/) already exist. I'd be great to have the script accept another option to allow insecure connections. 

If this is something you agree to support, I'm happy to look into it.

Not a direct answer, but does setting `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` to the a file containing your corporate proxy's cert or CA cert (in text / PEM format) work? e.g.

```
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=~/Downloads/corporate-ca.pem 
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

The environment variable will get inherited by all the curl processes.

In general, I would sort of think it's good practice for your corporate systems to set up validation for your internal certs to work by default instead of needing you to use `--insecure` :)

Why not just use `CURL_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1`?

I'm not sure `CURL_SSL_NO_VERIFY` is a thing - could not find any info related to it online.

Without certs - getting them is another story :) - **insecure installation works** by creating a temporary `.curlrc` ([see docs](https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/configfile.html)):

```sh
echo insecure >> ~/.curlrc
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
rm ~/.curlrc
```
Which installs uv successfully:
```sh
$ which -a uv
/c/users/xxx/.local/bin/uv ✅
```

The whole point of using the installer script is enabling self-management of uv via `uv self update`. However, I noticed that even with the installer script, this does not work:

```sh
$ uv self update -v
DEBUG uv 0.7.8 (0ddcc1905 2025-05-23)
DEBUG No receipt found; assuming uv was installed via a package manager
error: Self-update is only available for uv binaries installed via the standalone installation scripts.
```

Interestingly, I have a valid `uv-receipt.json` in `~/.config/uv`. Not sure what's going on there. Could be related to MSYS2, see #12686 or #6774. I will check if I have dangling uv artefacts somewhere on my system.

Appears that `axoupdater` always tries to load the receipt from `%LOCALAPPDATA%/uv/uv-receipt.json` on Windows. Supporting MSYS2 is quite tricky.

I think that environment variable worked for me in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/15081266958/job/42398176409?pr=13306 where I was facing the same problem? Maybe I'm wrong 🤷‍♀

Interesting. Would you mind opening a new issue for that one so we can track it separately?

Or, weigh in on https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12686 since it seems like the same problem?

Closing this as a workaround for insecure installations has been found - the discussion about MSYS support already exists.
