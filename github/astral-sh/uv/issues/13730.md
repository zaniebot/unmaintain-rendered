# Editable installs not activated after installing in Google Colab

---

_Issue opened by @thewh1teagle on 2025-05-30 13:02_

### Summary

The problem:
it doesn't find the package that I just installed

```console
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'phonikud_tts'
```

To reproduce

```console
!pip install uv
!git clone https://github.com/thewh1teagle/phonikud-tts
%cd phonikud-tts
!uv pip install --system -e .
```

```python
import phonikud_tts
```

### Platform

Colab

### Version

uv 0.7.8

### Python version

3.11



By the way, is there a way to install it to the system with something like `uv sync --system`?

The workaround is re-initializing the `site` module after installation:

```python
import site

for sitepackages in site.getsitepackages():
    site.addsitedir(sitepackages)
```

`phonikud_tts` uses an editable install through a `.pth` file, which is loaded by the `site` module at Python startup. In Google Colab, Python startup happens before the installation, so we need to manually re-initialize the module to load all (new) `.pth` files.

Thanks, it helps!
