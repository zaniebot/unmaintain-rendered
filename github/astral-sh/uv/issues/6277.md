# Add `uv init --from-project <path>` to import from other tools

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-20 21:21_

As previously discussed for `uv add -r pyproject.toml` but without any of the controversy about what to do with extras. We can copy all of the dependencies as reported by the build backend.

I'll look into this tonight unless someone beats me to it.

I have no idea why I closed this.

Is this up for grabs? 

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-21 15:37_

Yes!

You can use `SourceTreeResolver` to get the metadata. But one challenge is... we probably need to preserve extras rather than resolving them. For example, if the user's `pyproject.toml` has:

```
[project.optional-dependencies]
foo = "bar"
```

Then in the project we create, we'd _also_ want to create a `foo` extra with `bar` in it.

I'll take a look soon. 

> we'd also want to create a foo extra with bar in it.

This makes sense, a similar PR would then resolve #6164 right?

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-08-21 15:53_

Yeah, it's possible that we want to skip #6164 for now since it brings up some confusing questions, like what does `--extra` mean in `uv add --extra baz -r pyproject.toml`. So let's start with support here in `uv init`.

What is needed to get this merged/released? It will help converting a lot of users  from Poetry to UV, at least for companies which have large number of repo's.

Shameless plug (in case someone stumbles over this issue here and `--from-project` is still WIP): I wrote a script to migrate our Poetry monorepo project to `uv` (keeping versions pinned). I doubt it will work immediately on other projects, but could be a good start.
