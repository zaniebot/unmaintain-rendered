# `uv add panel` issue, panel not installable

---

_Issue opened by @panas2567 on 2025-05-28 09:21_

### Summary

`uv add panel --native-tls` fails with the message:

```bash
uv add panel --native-tls
Resolved 36 packages in 180ms
  × Failed to download `panel==1.7.0`
  ├─▶ Failed to extract archive: panel-1.7.0-py3-none-any.whl
  ╰─▶ unexpected BufError
  help: If you want to add the package regardless of the failed resolution, provide the `--frozen` flag to
        skip locking and syncing.
```

Tried:

(the `--native-tls` flag is present everywhere)

- `uv add panel==1.6.0`
- `uv add panel --no-binary panel`
- `uv pip install panel`
- installing in a new and plain python `venv`

all of the tries above failed with the same result.


### Platform

### Version

0.7.3

### Python version

I tried this locally, but `uv pip install panel` passes for me.

Hello, thanks for the reply!
On RHEL9?

On my Mac, `uv add panel` looks good as well. 
Looks like issue with the package/environment then, right?
Also, `pip install panel` on the RHEL9 VM fails as well.

I tried on a debian container, which should be no different given that panel is a universal wheel.

```
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:debian bash -c "uv venv && uv pip install panel"
```

Looks like it might be an issue with a low disk space. I'll confirm this and close the issue eventually.

Related to curl, rhel. Not `uv` directly.
