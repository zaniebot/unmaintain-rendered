# Support `--no-install-project` when adding a dependency to a project with `uv add`

---

_Issue opened by @BaoNguyen6742 on 2025-08-19 02:58_

### Summary

When I add a new dependency to my project, it automatically run `uv sync` and then try to build the package. This is usually fine but if my project is big, it wastes a lot of time since I don't need to build the package right then and just need to add the new dependency.

I can run `uv add <package> --no-sync` and then `uv sync --no-install-project` and it do just what I want, but I hope that `uv add` also support --no-install-project and preferably all of `uv sync` options so that it would reduce the amount of command to run if I want to modify the `uv sync` options when I run `uv add`

I think that's reasonable.
