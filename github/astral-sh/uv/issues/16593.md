# Check if a package exists

---

_Issue opened by @DhruvSrikanth on 2025-11-04 17:09_

### Question

Currently, when I want to verify if a package is installed (happens in various different common scenarios), I use something like `uv pip list | grep <pkg_name>`. Is there a `uv` native way to do this?

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

_No response_

Just realized I could use `pip show` through `uv`
