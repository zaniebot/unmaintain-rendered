# Automatically update versions in pyproject.toml

---

_Issue opened by @smortezah on 2025-08-19 17:18_

### Question

Is there a way to automatically update versions in pyproject.toml?

By default, `uv sync -U` will update uv.lock, but not pyproject.toml. I'm aware this is by design; however, it would be great to have such an option for uv sync.

### Platform

_No response_

### Version

_No response_
