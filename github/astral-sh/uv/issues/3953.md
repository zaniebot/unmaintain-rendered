# Problem with `/` vs `\` when using cygwin on windows

---

_Issue opened by @JackDyre on 2024-06-01 00:00_

I am on Windows 10 and use Cygwin as my preferred shell/terminal. The problem is that cygwin uses `/` unlike windows.

Creating a venv works just fine:
```
riley@EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42 /cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network
$ uv venv test_venv
Using Python 3.12.3 interpreter at: C:\Users\riley\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe
Creating virtualenv at: test_venv
Activate with: source test_venv\Scripts\activate


riley@EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42 /cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network
$ source test_venv/Scripts/activate


(test_venv)
riley@EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42 /cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network
```


But I am unable to do any pip commands in the venv:
```
(test_venv)
riley@EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42 /cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network
$ uv pip list
error: failed to canonicalize path `/cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network/test_venv\Scripts\python.exe`
  Caused by: The system cannot find the path specified. (os error 3)
```
```
(test_venv)
riley@EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42 /cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network
$ uv pip install numpy
error: failed to canonicalize path `/cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network/test_venv\Scripts\python.exe`
  Caused by: The system cannot find the path specified. (os error 3)
```

the only way i can use uv on my windows machine is in command prompt.

Is there a way to add support for forward slashes on windows machine for linux-emulating terminals like cygwin?


Oh also just to clarify, `EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42` is the name of my device, it is not a printer. I changed it as a joke a while ago

On Cygwin, where is the Python located? I assume `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe` is wrong, and that it's at `test_venv/bin/python`?

I am not sure what you mean "on cygwin" but `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe` is the correct path to python in the venv. The real python installation is at `C:\Users\riley\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe`. 

Trying to use `uv install` outside of a venv results in the following error:
 
```
riley@EpsonPortableOfficePrinter1090E42 /cygdrive/c/Users/riley/Documents/GitHub/tic-tac-toe-neural-network
$ uv pip install numpy
error: No Python interpreters found in virtual environments
```

Does the same happen if you try to use the dedicated cygwin python package (via cygwin package manager) rather than your windows native one? I believe this can happen when you mix subsystems (e.g. using python.exe from your native windows inside cygwin) likely due to `os.sep` being different than what cygwin would expect.

I did not know of its existence. I will look into it and try it.

Apologies for taking so long to follow up on this, I managed to get the cygwin python package up and working, and verified that `python` in cygwin refers to the 3.9 installation from the cygwin package and not my 3.12 system installation.

When i tried to install uv onto the cygwin python package using `python -m install uv`, and it failed with [this](https://pastebin.com/rNjPrDBM) huge output dump that I have no clue how to interpret. My guess is that it has something to do with `Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable`. I assume that has to do with the cygwin python installation and has nothing to do with uv

Anyway I installed uv back onto my 3.12 system installation and now all of the issues i originally had with uv not working in cygwin have been resolved.

Assuming the failure to install uv on the cygwin python is an issue with cygwin and not uv, this can be closed

It looks like the install failed because it tried to build from source, rather than using a wheel. That might be a cygwin issue, but I'd have to test myself to understand what wheels cygwin can support.
