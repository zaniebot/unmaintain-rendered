# uv suggests incorrect install command when Python downloads are set to manual and version request is a range

_Issue opened by @cls-oi on 2025-12-09 18:17_

### Summary

As of #14522, uv prints the following hint when Python downloads are set to 'manual' and the version request is a range:

```
A managed Python download is available for >=3.13, <3.14, but Python downloads are set to 'manual', use `uv python install >=3.13, <3.14` to install the required version
```

Of course, if we go ahead and run the suggested command:

```
$ uv python install >=3.13, <3.14
-bash: 3.14: No such file or directory
$ rm '=3.13,'
$
```

I think that's because here:

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/0dd71f438208a5f5c5083dae769deebdb12db57b/crates/uv-python/src/installation.rs#L191-L195

... `request` is a `PythonRequest::Version(VersionRequest::Range(...))`, in which case maybe it should be quoted.

### Platform

Windows 11 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.9.7

### Python version

_No response_

It seems reasonable to quote conditional on it being a range?
