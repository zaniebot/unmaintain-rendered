# Feature request: Publishing crate docs

---

_Issue opened by @abhiaagarwal on 2024-06-18 17:48_

Hey there,

Thanks for the awesome set of crates. I'm interested in using the uv crates as a dependency resolver for internal use. I noticed that the crates are very well-documented, but the docs themselves aren't published.

I understand you don't want to publish the crates to crates.io since you're working fast and don't want to commit to consistent versioning, but would you be open in publishing the crate docs on github pages instead (or your static provider of choice). That way, we don't have to pull the uv tree ourselves and run `cargo doc` if we want to poke around the various crates.

Thank you!

We're pretty interested in this if someone wants to contribute!

For selfishish reasons, I think this would be a great idea, because it would give us a feedback loop to improve our docs. (Which I think could use a lot of improvement.)

I can write a quick CI job @zanieb, where exactly do you want it to be published?

And @BurntSushi you say that, but I've personally been thrilled with the quality of documentation for the internal crates!

I'm down to set up GitHub Pages for now! We can push the docs to a dedicated branch?

@zanieb I was planning on adding it to your release strategy, the "modern" way is to publish an artifact of static html files that github pages will deploy from instead of a separate branch. I've heard horror stories where your git history can blow up with the separate branch strategy.

Oh that sounds nice! I didn't know about that 🫨

We're publishing to crates.io now, so these are available.
