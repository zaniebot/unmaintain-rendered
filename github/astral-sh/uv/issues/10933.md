_Issue opened by @mickelindahl on 2025-01-24 10:26_

### Summary

Here 

https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/tutorial/

It states that when running

A project witht he structure 

numbers
  ├── pyproject.toml
  └── src
      └── numbers
          ├── __init__.py
          └── py.typed

Should be generated. In infact this is not true. The structure is completely different (see image)

That's just a docs issue -- this should be filed in Ruff instead. That's the output of `uv init --lib`.
