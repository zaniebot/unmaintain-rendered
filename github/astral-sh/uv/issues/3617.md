Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

Hey team, I have the following `uv.toml` file: 
```
[pip]
find-links = ["file:///home/mkirchner/development/"]
```

When I try to run `uv pip compile requirements.in` I get the following error: 

```
error: Failed to parse `uv.toml`
  Caused by: TOML parse error at line 2, column 15
  |
2 | find-links = ["file:///home/mkirchner/development/"]
  |               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
unknown variant `file:///home/mkirchner/development/`, expected `Path` or `Url`
```

I'm not exactly sure if this is a bug in the parsing or user error on my end, but regardless I can't get it to work. I cannot find much documentation about the `uv.toml` file. Any ideas?

I suspect it's just a bug. Will take a look!
