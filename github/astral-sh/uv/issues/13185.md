# Should I remove old builds before publishing?

---

_Issue opened by @Gabriel-p on 2025-04-28 19:35_

### Question

When I run `uv build` the two files `tar.gz` and `whl` are generated inside the `dist/` folder.

When I then run `ub publish -t pypi-...` it shows:

    Publishing 4 files https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
    ...

i.e., it wants to also publish the two files that were generated **in the previous build** that are still sitting there in the `dist/` folder (hence the "4 files"). I need to manually remove the old files from `dist/` before running `uv publish`.

I didn't have to do this with `poetry` , it only published the latest build no matter how many old builds were stored still in that folder.

Am I doing something wrong?

### Platform

elementary OS 8

### Version

0.6.6

Yes, with `uv build` you need to manually remove old builds, we intentionally don't remove other files in the `dist` directory so you can build different packages or multiple versions.
