# Suggest `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in resolver platform tag hint

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-01-16 22:53_

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10696#issuecomment-2597052942

We should suggest changing the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` version when the "best" tag differs from one of the available tags by OS version.

For implementation, see

Do you still need help with this? If so, I'd be happy to pick it up.
