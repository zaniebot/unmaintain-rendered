# `uv add` should support adding dependencies without updating the environment

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-07 15:13_

e.g. `uv add --no-sync`

The same for `uv remove`.

`--frozen` does this, unless you're describing something else.

I want to update the lockfile, but not install into the virtual environment.

Why?

What if I don't have a virtual environment and I'm just trying to modify the declared dependencies in an automated script? Why have all the overhead of installing the project to a virtual environment?

(This came up when writing documentation — we could wait until someone asks for it before adding but I do think it makes sense)

It's reasonable! Just wary of adding too many flags here.
