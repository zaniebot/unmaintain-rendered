# Is there a way to specify a glibc requirement via uv?

_Issue opened by @Ryang20718 on 2025-07-02 06:47_

### Question

We use bazel and we're currently in the process of upgrading all of our platforms to ubuntu 22. 

when we build python with deps, i.e cryptography, we hit issues when building on ubuntu 22 for an ubuntu 20 docker image.

Thus we need to work around this by pinning a wheel file ourselves to work around this

What do you pin the wheel file to? How are you building and installing, i.e., what are the uv commands that are being used?

i.e we just pin the whl file https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/67/85/caba91a57d291a2ad46e74016d1f83ac294f08128b26e2a81e9b4f2d2555/cryptography-45.0.3-cp37-abi3-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl like this

we build via bazel, but we use uv to generate the pip lock file.

```
uv pip compile
    --generate-hashes \
    --emit-index-url \
    --no-strip-extras \
    --python-version=3.10 \
    --output-file=<output_file> \
    requirements.txt
    
```

I believe the glibc version is defined by [manylinux](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) in that case?

You can set the [`python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#pip_python-platform)
