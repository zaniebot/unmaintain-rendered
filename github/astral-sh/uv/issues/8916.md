# uv self update to 0.5.0 loses uv

---

_Issue opened by @hutcho on 2024-11-08 04:14_

After `uv self update` uv not found.
I had to reinstall uv using installation instructions to get it working again.
Windows 10. I think i was on 0.4.29 previously but could have been 1 or 2 versions before that. I update frequently and this has never happened before.

It looks like a bug in the updater library we use. We're investigating. Thanks for the report!

The self update should be fixed now.

The upstream issue is at https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/issues/210
