# Build a dependency tree and get all wheels

---

_Issue opened by @danijar on 2025-12-28 20:19_

### Summary

For deployment, we would like to build one package in our monorepo and all its local dependencies, resulting in a `build` folder containing the wheels for all those packages.

It seems like this functionality is currently not exposed via the uv cli but similar functionality is used internally already:

- `uv build` puts only the wheel of the present package into the `build` folder, not any dependencies.
- In a workspace, `uv build --all` builds all dependencies and places all wheels into the `build` folder, but that is too much in a large monorepo.
- `uv sync --no-editable` already builds the present package and all its dependencies and installs them into the venv, but it doesn't place the wheels into a folder for the user to access.

### Example

_No response_
