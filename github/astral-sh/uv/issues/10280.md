# Jupyter Lab Formatter Installation

---

_Issue opened by @deadb0d4 on 2025-01-02 21:21_

Hi, I'm enjoying uv so much these days. Here is my version:
```
$ uv --version
uv 0.5.13 (Homebrew 2024-12-27)
```
I was wondering if it's possible to install jupyter lab code formatter? In a gist, these commands do _not_ result in the plugin being loaded:
```
$ uv pip install jupyterlab-code-formatter
...
$ uv run jupyter labextension enable jupyterlab_code_formatter # version with s/_/- won't work either
...
$ uv run jupyter labextension list
JupyterLab v4.3.0
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/share/jupyter/labextensions
        jupyterlab_pygments v0.3.0 enabled OK (python, jupyterlab_pygments)
$ uv pip list | grep jupyter
jupyter-client            8.6.3
jupyter-core              5.7.2
jupyter-events            0.11.0
jupyter-server            2.15.0
jupyter-server-terminals  0.5.3
jupyterlab-code-formatter 3.0.2 # So it's installed, but settings/jupyter doesn't show it
jupyterlab-pygments       0.3.0
```
and my advanced json settings in the jupyter lab doesn't show settings for the formatter as in https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab_code_formatter.

Thanks for any help in advance!

So, this does seem to work for me. But the possible issue is that the environment you're using in `uv run jupyter` is not the same as the environment that you're using in `uv pip install`?

For example, this series of commands does work for me:

```shell
> uv init foo
> cd foo
> uv add jupyter
> uv add jupyterlab-code-formatter
> uv run jupyter labextension enable jupyterlab_code_formatter
> uv run jupyter labextension list
JupyterLab v4.3.4
/Users/crmarsh/workspace/uv/foo/.venv/share/jupyter/labextensions
        jupyterlab_pygments v0.3.0 enabled OK (python, jupyterlab_pygments)
        jupyterlab_code_formatter v3.0.2 enabled OK (python, jupyterlab_code_formatter)
        @jupyter-notebook/lab-extension v7.3.2 enabled OK
        @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager v5.0.13 enabled OK (python, jupyterlab_widgets)
```

Huh, sorry, it works for me as well. Not sure if it was important for the formatter installation to stop jupyter lab first? Anyway, thanks so much for the help, I'll close.
