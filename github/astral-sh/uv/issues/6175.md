# When creating a venv pay attention to preferred Python version set via PY_PYTHON

---

_Issue opened by @dalito on 2024-08-17 21:37_

As of `uv 0.2.37 (15dfb660a 2024-08-15)` the environment variable `PY_PYTHON` is ignored. On my windows system I have 3.12 set as default version via the environment variable `PY_PYTHON` but have also 3.13.0rc1 installed. If I run `uv venv` a Python-3.13rc1 env is created.

```cmd
C:\Users\david\MyProg\temp>echo %PY_PYTHON%
3.12

C:\Users\david\MyProg\temp>uv venv
Using Python 3.13.0rc1 interpreter at: C:\dev\Python313\python.exe
Creating virtualenv at: .venv
Activate with: .venv\Scripts\activate

C:\Users\david\MyProg\temp>py -m venv .venv_py
C:\Users\david\MyProg\temp>.venv_py\Scripts\activate
(.venv_py) C:\Users\david\MyProg\temp>python --version
Python 3.12.5
```

**Feature request:** 

Read the preferred Python version for the virtual env from the env var `PY_PYTHON` (at least on Windows). This variable is used by the launcher and documented in the Python documentation under [customizing-default-python-versions](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#customizing-default-python-versions).

Interesting, somehow I've never heard of `PY_PYTHON`. \cc @zanieb

I just discovered "pin" and thought that `uv python pin 3.12` might configure uv to create a 3.12 venv by default afterwards but it doesn't. Then I found #4972 which seems to address this use case already.
