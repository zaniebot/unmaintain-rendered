# build-backend: build fails if the package (top-level module) name is different than the project name

---

_Issue opened by @pantheraleo-7 on 2024-12-07 10:36_

Since the build-backend is in preview, I was trying it out. if the project name is defined as "xyz" in the `pyproject.toml`, uv expects the directory `src/xyz/` to be present, but that may not always be the case (most popular example would be `scikit-learn` and `sklearn`).

This is more of a question than a bug(?) report. How to overcome this? Is there any field that can be defined in the toml? Passing `--directory=src/abc` to `uv build` works but I don't think that's its intended use?

_from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/11325#discussion_r1954457990:_
> Another approach could be always using direct path for module_root (i.e. src points to src/__init__.py)

by that approach, `build-backend.module_root = "sklearn"` would build [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).

I see we have:

```
[tool.uv]
build-backend.module-name = "xyz"
```
