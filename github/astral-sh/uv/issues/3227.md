# Investigate universal wheel selection with `--python-platform`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-23 22:21_

> uv pip compile requirements.in --python-platform=macos also fails for open3d because the ARM64 wheels are only available for MacOS 13.0+ (or universal for 10.15+) while uv specifies MacOS 11.0 for ARM64.
