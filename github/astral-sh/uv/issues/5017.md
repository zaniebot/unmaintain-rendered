# `uvx` should warn or error when an executable outside of `--from` is used

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-07-12 16:25_

As mentioned at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/4997#discussion_r1675091857

e.g. in this invocation:

```
uvx --from fastapi fastapi
```

`fastapi` is actually provided by a `fastapi` dependency `fastapi-cli`. If a user later runs `uv tool install fastapi` it will fail saying no executables are available. We should try to have a smooth transition from `uv tool run` to `uv tool install`. If the invoked executable does not belong to the `--from` package, I think we should _at least_ warn and maybe hard-error unless some opt-in is given e.g. `--include-from fastapi-cli`.

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4994 for more discussion on the opt-in flags.
