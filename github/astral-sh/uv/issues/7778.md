# In case VIRTUAL_ENV is different from .venv UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT should be created automatically

_Issue opened by @avoutsas67 on 2024-09-29 10:40_

Hi all, 

If I understand correctly, the current behaviour of **uv add** when `VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT` is different than `.venv `is to raise a warning and create a .venv environment where the dependency will be created. 
`warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv-py312` does not match the project environment path `.venv` and will be ignored
Using Python 3.12.6 interpreter at: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12
Creating virtualenv at: .venv`

I believe it would be more intuitive and more efficient when the `VIRTUAL_ENV` is different from .venv that the `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` is set automatically to `VIRTUAL_ENV` by **uv init**. This will remove an extra step in setting up a project.

If a users wants to use a different environment from the one set in `VIRTUAL_ENV` then they could explicitly set the `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`.

Thanks for considering this request.

Achilleas

We intentionally don't support using the "active" virtual environment for a project.

More context in #6834 which links to much more discussion.

@zanieb So how can I use my cpu-based-venv without removing the other one?

Unfortunately, this doesn't allow me to keep all virtual environments at one place under `~` dir. 

Currently `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` only allow me to configure for one project.

I usually name project environments with the same name as project and keep them under one folder in `~/uv_environments`.

@adhadse that's tracked in #1495 

@sglbl we don't really support that yet. You can hack it with `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` but there's not a way to define multiple persistent environments. We're thinking about it, but there can be 2^N environments (N = number of groups + extras + resolution modes) for each project and we don't want to just store every combination ever created.

@adhadse for this specific use case, I use `direnv` and export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT in my `.envrc`. I don't know if this is something that could help you

Right now, I'm not interested in fiddling with this issue. I'm going with how uv does it. I'll come back to it later once I start using uv  with more and more projects.
