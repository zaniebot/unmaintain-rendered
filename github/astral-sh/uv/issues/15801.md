# `mypyc` support in `uv` build backend

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2025-09-12 03:25_

### Summary

https://github.com/ofek/hatch-mypyc exists to let one compile code with https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc. It does this through a [build hook](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/plugins/build-hook/reference/).

`mypy` has an outstanding feature request for `pyproject.toml` support: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13901

In the meantime, it would be cool if the `uv` build backend supported `mypyc`.

### Example

_No response_
