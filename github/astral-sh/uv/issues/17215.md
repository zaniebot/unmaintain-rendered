# How to make uv inherit global package?

---

_Issue opened by @fighterhit on 2025-12-22 13:27_

### Question

Since PyTorch is already installed on my global system, I don't want to install it again for each UV virtual environment. How can I inherit the global package when creating a UV environment?

### Platform

ubuntu24.04

### Version

0.9.15

@zanieb, would `--system-site-packages` work in this case?

@fighterhit

I'm also new to uv, but I think `--system-site-packages` might help. You can try creating your virtual environment with:

```bash
uv venv --system-site-packages
```

This should give the virtual environment access to system site packages at runtime, so your globally installed PyTorch might be available without reinstalling.

After creating the environment, you can test it:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"
```

I'm not sure if uv handles this differently than pip, so it may or may not work as expected. If you try it, let us know what happens, whether it works or if you run into issues. That would help clarify if this is the right approach or if there's a better way.

Yes, `uv venv --system-site-packages` is probably the most direct and correct way to inherit the global site-packages. Note though that `--system-site-packages` doesn't affect `uv pip list` or `uv pip install`, it only affects the actual runtime import behavior.

Docs here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--system-site-packages

However, to take a step back: installing a single version across multiple environments is generally very cheap/fast with uv, since uv doesn't actually re-install the distribution each time. If you're using a single PyTorch version, I'd definitely recommend having uv manage it instead of trying to manage it globally 🙂
