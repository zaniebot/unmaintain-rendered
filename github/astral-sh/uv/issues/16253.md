# uv does not distinguish between 3.14 and 3.14t while creating virtual environment

_Issue opened by @DhavalGojiya on 2025-10-11 14:15_

**Description:**
After changing the Python version from 3.14t (Free threaded python) to 3.14 using uv python pin, uv sync does not remove the old virtual environment or create a new one with the updated Python version.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```powershell
PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> cat .python-version
3.14t

PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> uv sync
Using CPython 3.14.0
Creating virtual environment at: .venv

>>> sys.prefix

PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> uv python pin 3.14
Updated `.python-version` from `3.14t` -> `3.14`
PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> cat .python-version

>>> sys.prefix
'D:\\Dhaval-WebDev\\Test\\venus\\.venv'
```

**Expected Behavior:**
After changing the Python version from `3.14t` (Free-threaded Python) to `3.14` using `uv python pin`, `uv sync` should:

1. Remove the old virtual environment created with `3.14t`.
2. Create a new virtual environment `.venv` using Python `3.14`.

**Actual Behavior:**
`uv sync` doesn't do anything; it thinks everything is up to date.

**Extra Context:**  
If we manually delete the `.venv` and then run `uv sync`, it correctly creates a new virtual environment using the updated `.python-version` → `3.14`.  
At that time, there are no issues.

Also noticed:

```powershell
PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> cat .python-version
3.14t

PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> uv sync

````

Here, `uv sync` says `Using CPython 3.14.0` - shouldn't it say `Using CPython 3.14t`?

A request for 3.14 is currently considered compatible with a 3.14 free-threaded interpreter.

Ok, so this needs to be addressed, right? Since the runtime environments are different for both versions - especially when testing GitHub Actions with multiple Python versions locally - it’s unable to create the 3.14t environment, but that’s the one I actually want.

What do you mean? In this case, you can just request `3.14t`?

Uv is not removing old virtual environment and creating the new one. 
This is what the issue was created for.
```
PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> uv python pin 3.14
Updated `.python-version` from `3.14t` -> `3.14`
PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> cat .python-version
3.14

PS D:\Dhaval-WebDev\Test\venus> uv sync

In that case you're going from 3.14t -> 3.14, but in your last message you said you could not create a 3.14t environment that you want?

What I mean is, I can create a virtual environment with any version I want using uv.
But if I already have a virtual environment with Python 3.14, and I want to create a new virtual environment for project using 3.14t, I first need to remove the .venv/ folder before reinstalling, and then run uv sync again - as you can see in the first message log.

If you see the first message ( long output written by me), I think you find the issue.
I am also not sure, that is it really an issue or is just uv behave like this.

Because as per my knowledge If you change `.python-version` file and then again run `uv sync`, uv will first delete `.venv` folder and re create a requested python versions virtual environment that satisfies (`.python-version`)

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16537 would address this

I think the following PRs:

- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16536  
- https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16537  

addressed this issue.

> Here, `uv sync` says **Using CPython 3.14.0** — shouldn't it say **Using CPython 3.14t**?  

This one is also covered, right?  
Can we close this issue, @zanieb?
