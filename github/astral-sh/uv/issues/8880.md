# Add support for updating dependencies in project

---

_Issue opened by @diachkow on 2024-11-07 08:20_

I am looking for something similar to the [`poetry update`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#update) command that is able to update the listed dependencies to the maximum possible version that meets the requirements from the `pyproject.toml` file.

I'm now running uv version `0.4.29` and couldn't find anything like this in uv docs/uv --help.

Having this feature will make it easier to maintain long running projects and stay up-to-date with the latest package versions for our web app

If you're using project-specific commands, there's actually an ``--upgrade`` parameter that can update the lock file to the latest version.

Thank you! Seems that is what I was looking for. I was trying to search by `update` through the docs, but it happened to be `upgrade` not `update` 🤦‍♂️
