# Is there a way to get --target to only install missing packages?

### Question

For Complicated Reasons, I have need to create a python distribution with some extra packages, and install a further subset of python packages into a different folder. Currently, I have the following:

```bash
python_ver=3.12.9
uv python install ${python_ver} --install-dir .
cp -ar cpython-${python_ver}-* my-python-dist  # no way of specifying exact directory, see uv#11933

uv export --no-default-groups > requirements-core.txt
uv pip install --break-system-packages --python my-python-dist requests

uv export --only-group dev --only-group test > requirements-dev.txt
uv pip install--python my-python-dist --target extra-python-packages json-schema-for-humans  # pulls in requests
```

This all works quite well, *except* for the fact that the packages installed into extra-python-packages include everything that's already installed into my-python-dist, apparently not taking anything already installed there into account- e.g. requests is an indirect dependency of both requirements files so is already installed in my-python-dist but gets installed again into extra-python-packages. Ideally I'd like to be able to avoid that - is there a way of doing that?

```
$ uv pip install --break-system-packages --python my-python-dist requests
Using Python 3.12.9 environment at: my-python-dist
Resolved 5 packages in 108ms
Installed 5 packages in 23ms
 + certifi==2025.1.31
 + charset-normalizer==3.4.1
 + idna==3.10
 + requests==2.32.3
 + urllib3==2.3.0
$ uv pip install --break-system-packages --python my-python-dist json-schema-for-humans --target flibble  # reinstalls requests and everything else!
Using CPython 3.12.9 interpreter at: my-python-dist/bin/python3

 + markupsafe==3.0.2
 + marshmallow==3.26.1
 + mypy-extensions==1.0.0
 + packaging==24.2
 + pygments==2.19.1

 + pyyaml==6.0.2
 + requests==2.32.3
 + typing-extensions==4.13.1
 + typing-inspect==0.9.0
 + urllib3==2.3.0
```

Of course, if there's a Better Way of doing all this, I'm all ears.

Currently, uv can't read dependencies from a base environment.
