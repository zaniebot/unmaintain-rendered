# feature request: drop `pip` prefix from `uv` commands

---

_Issue opened by @charles-cooper on 2024-03-17 15:03_

```
$ uv --version
uv 0.1.21
```

i think `uv`'s UX would benefit from being able to drop the `pip` prefix from all commands. examples:
```bash
uv pip install ... -> uv install
uv pip uninstall ... -> uv uninstall
```

while it's neat that `uv` is going for "pip compatibility mode", where all the commands have the same interface, just prefixed by `uv`, i think it's not really necessary.
1. `uv install` is a lot easier to type(!)
2. if there is no `pip`, users don't need to expect that the API will be exactly the same.
3. i don't think exact API compatibility is important, what's more important is that all the same *functionality* works
4. "pip compatibility mode" can be maintained, so `uv pip install ...` always works like `pip install ...`. but after some time, users can graduate to "uv-native" mode

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2494 is an example where the "`uv`-native" API could break compatibility in a good way -- `uv install` could just install from the current directory by default instead of requiring the explicit directory (as in `pip install .`).

We put all these pip-compatible interfaces into a separate namespace because we're going to design a new workflow that is not designed to be pip-compatible. We'll be addressing all sorts of usability concerns there. So, this is on our roadmap but we will explicitly not be moving the existing `uv pip` commands to `uv`.
