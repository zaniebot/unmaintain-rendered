# [feature request] uv toolchain list shows the "type" of toolchain

---

_Issue opened by @baggiponte on 2024-07-03 07:24_

When I run `uv toolchain list` I get this output:

```
cpython-3.12.4-macos-aarch64-none       /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12
cpython-3.12.3-macos-aarch64-none       /Users/luca/Library/Application Support/uv/toolchains/cpython-3.12.3-macos-aarch64-none/install/bin/python3
cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none       /Users/luca/Library/Application Support/uv/toolchains/cpython-3.11.9-macos-aarch64-none/install/bin/python3
cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none      /Users/luca/Library/Application Support/uv/toolchains/cpython-3.10.14-macos-aarch64-none/install/bin/python3
cpython-3.9.19-macos-aarch64-none       /Users/luca/Library/Application Support/uv/toolchains/cpython-3.9.19-macos-aarch64-none/install/bin/python3
cpython-3.9.6-macos-aarch64-none        /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/python3
cpython-3.8.19-macos-aarch64-none       /Users/luca/Library/Application Support/uv/toolchains/cpython-3.8.19-macos-aarch64-none/install/bin/python3
```

Maybe it would be nice to differentiate them by colour/add another colour to denote whether a toolchain is system/uv or something else. Might have a usecase for piping shell commands and other stuff.

If it's going to be processed downstream I think a JSON output format makes more sense than complicating the output. I'm pretty hesitant to add more columns to the table. I'd be curious to see an approach with colors.

As a note, you can also filter by the path starting with `uv toolchain dir` or get a subset of the toolchains with the `--toolchain-preference` option, e.g., `uv toolchain list --toolchain-preference only-managed --only-installed`
