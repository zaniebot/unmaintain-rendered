# Not working in Collab and Kaggle

---

_Issue opened by @dudegladiator on 2024-07-06 09:28_

I run the the following command over kaggle and collab. 

`!pip install uv`
`!uv venv`
`!source .venv/bin/activate`

`!uv pip install thefuzz`
`from thefuzz import fuzz`

Error 
`---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[14], line 1
----> 1 from thefuzz import fuzz
      2 from thefuzz import process
      4 def fuzzy_match_items(item_list, output_items):

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'thefuzz'`

Virtual environment cannot use the virtual environment for all cells just using ``source`` command.

If you need a virtual environment because UV is installed into a virtual environment by default.
You can add ``--system`` flag.
e.g. 
```colab
!uv pip install --system [packages]
```
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md#virtual-environments-by-default
### Flag information in  uv 0.2.21 (ebfe6d8fc 2024-07-03)
```
      --system
          Install packages into the system Python.

          By default, `uv` installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent
          directory. The `--system` option instructs `uv` to instead use the first Python found in the system `PATH`.

          WARNING: `--system` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with
          caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

          [env: UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=]
```

what if the reason venv is used is to change python version?
```
uv venv .venv -p 3.9
```
is there any way to create virtual env with different python version in colab?
