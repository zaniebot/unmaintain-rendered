# Refer to "Python version tag" instead of "ABI" tag where feasible

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-01-15 20:01_

We say "Python version tag" specifically in some places but "Python ABI tag" or "ABI tag" in others. If we can narrow it down to _just_ a version incompatibility that seems easy for users to understand.
