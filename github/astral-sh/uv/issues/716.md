# Remove partial directories during uninstall operations

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-21 02:43_

If you somehow end up with a `.dist-info` that doesn't contain `METADATA` or is otherwise unfinished, we should ensure we remove it (even though it won't have a `RECORD` file).

We're actually not "allowed" to uninstall directories that don't contain a `RECORD` file.
