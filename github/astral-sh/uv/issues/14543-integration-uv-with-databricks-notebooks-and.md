# Integration UV with Databricks Notebooks and Projects

_Issue opened by @castillouparela on 2025-07-10 15:35_

### Question

Hi team,

I'm interested in understanding how UV can be integrated with Databricks notebooks and projects. Specifically, I'm looking for guidance or examples on how to:

- Connect UV with Databricks workflows
- Use UV within Databricks notebooks for data processing or visualization
- Manage versioning or collaboration between UV and Databricks projects
- Could you please share any documentation, examples, or best practices for this integration?

Thanks in advance!

### Platform

### Version
