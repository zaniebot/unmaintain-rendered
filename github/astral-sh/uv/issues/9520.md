# uv run --package <package_name> <executable> only works when inside the directory of package (Workspaces)

As stated in the title, when running `uv run --package <package_name> <executable>`  it will only works if I `cd` into the package directory beforehand. Is there a way to specify, that I want to run something within a workspaces package?

just noticed that there is a --directory flag for that.
