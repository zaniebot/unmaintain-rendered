# Provide a Python native API with bindings to Rust functionality

---

_Issue opened by @pavelschon on 2025-02-25 14:13_

### Summary

I would be great if uv is available also as native python module*), so that all operations with uv could be scripted in python as well, e.g. in DevOps scenarios.

*) Under native module I mean real compiled python/rust module, rather than calling uv binary with `subprocess.Popen`.

### Example

```python
import uv

uv.python_install(["3.11", "3.12", "3.13"])

uv.venv_create("foo")
```

Thanks for linking the issue. Today it's almost a year later, so possibly they shifted prioritites (?)

Anyway, if there would be a programmatic API, then one could build the CLI using argparse/click and therefore don't need uv executable at all :-)

Our thoughts about this remain the same for now.
