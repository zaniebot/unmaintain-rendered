# Missing `latest` tag for uv distroful images

---

_Issue opened by @garysassano on 2024-12-30 02:30_

The `latest` tag is only available for the `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest` distroless image.

The following image is valid: `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.5.13-python3.13-bookworm-slim`
The following image is invalid: `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest-python3.13-bookworm-slim`

You have no way to pull a specific distroful image with the latest uv binary.

Thanks for the report, looking into this.

Ah I thought you meant this was a regression, but this is as intended.

You don't need the `latest-` tag, you can just use `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim` to get the latest version. `latest` just exists for an image that would otherwise have no tag.

Ok, I was able to figure out how to set `latest` when no `UV_VERSION` is passed as a build argument.

```Dockerfile
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.13
ARG UV_VERSION=""
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:${UV_VERSION:+${UV_VERSION}-}python${PYTHON_VERSION}-bookworm-slim
```
