# Doc improvement: add section to Docker integration that demonstrates system level install

---

_Issue opened by @rsyring on 2025-05-23 17:43_

Figuring this out took me way longer than it should have even though the hint was right there in the docs.  I just didn't grok it and repeatedly struck out with both ChatGPT and Claude 4.0.

My suggestion is to add a minimally complete Dockerfile example demonstrating system install to the docs.  Add it right below: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/#using-the-environment and label it "Project install to system" or similar.

You might want to pick a more typical image and environment path than this example.  But what I have here is complete and verified as a starting place.

```Dockerfile
from public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12 as app

# env
env FLASK_DEBUG=0
# System install
env UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/var/lang/
# Optimize startup time
env UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1
# Hardlinks don't work in docker images anyway, so don't warn me or take time trying
env UV_LINK_MODE=copy

# uv install
# grab /uvx too if you need it
copy --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /usr/local/bin/

##  App
workdir /app

# Build / deps
copy pyproject.toml hatch.toml readme.md uv.lock .
copy src/poster/version.py src/poster/version.py
run --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync --frozen --no-dev --inexact

# Source files after the build for better caching/speed when deps haven't changed
copy src/poster src/poster
copy src/lambda_handler.py src

# The lamba runtime environment will use this dotted path as the entry point to our app when
# the lambda function is invoked.  It must be a function, it doesn't handle class methods.
cmd ["lambda_handler.entry"]
```
