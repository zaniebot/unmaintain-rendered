# `uv export` only exports to STDOUT

---

_Issue opened by @TiansuYu on 2024-10-30 12:00_

`uv export` even if including `--directory <some path> --format requirement-txt` only prints out to STDOUT, not in a `requirements.txt` file. 

- python version: `3.11.10`
- uv version: `uv 0.4.28 (debe67ffd 2024-10-28)`
- OS: MacOS

I would expect `uv export --directory <some-path> # without or without --format` to create a `requirements.txt` file in `<some-path>`

I misunderstood here, you should use `--output-file` to specify endpoints.
