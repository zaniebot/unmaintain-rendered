# Use old version of pip

---

_Issue opened by @JhonatanRian on 2024-10-08 15:58_

Is it possible to configure uv to use an old version of pip?

In a legacy project, there are certain libraries that are not installed with a more recent pip version. I can only install them using an old version of pip, such as 21.1.1, for example.

I need to use uv to manage the project, but it always updates the virtual environment's pip to the most recent version, making it impossible to run commands such as: `uv sync` or  `uv pip sync requirements.txt`.

an example of the error when I'm using the most current pip:
```bash
 >>> uv pip sync requirements.txt

```

I checked the documentation to see if it was possible to configure this, but I didn't find anything about it.
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/

Remembering that even if I downgrade pip, uv itself updates it when a command that uses pip is run

For this case, you can try installing an old setuptools version manually, then disabling build isolation (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#build-isolation) before the build.

I work as @konstin mentioned, I needed to install `setuptools` and `wheel` with `pip` manually. like this:
```shell
uv pip install setuptools==56.0.0 wheel>=0.44.0
```
Then I synchronized the requirements packages to pyproject:
```
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

OBSERVATION: For each new environment, it is always necessary to first install `setuptools` and `wheel` manually with `pip` and only then use "pip sync". After this process, the next time you delete uv.lock or .venv, `uv sync` will not break, it is as if it saves the processes performed in cache (I don't know what actually happens).
