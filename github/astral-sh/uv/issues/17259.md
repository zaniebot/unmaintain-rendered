# Unfriendly error message when `uv lock` or `uv sync` with `UV_FROZEN=1` env variable

---

_Issue opened by @kkew3 on 2025-12-30 02:28_

### Summary

I run `uv init` to create a new project, and `uv sync`. Then `uv` report this error:

```
error: Unable to find lockfile at `uv.lock`. To create a lockfile, run `uv lock` or `uv sync`.
```

I also tried `uv lock` but with the same error.

It took me a while to realize that I set `UV_FROZEN=1` many hours ago in the same terminal session, which apparently is the root cause of the issue.

Some more contexts:

My OS: macOS 12.7.6 (21H1320).

`uv sync --verbose` output:

<details>

```
</details>

### Example

I'm not sure how to improve, but at least give some hint that `uv.lock` cannot be created when `UV_FROZEN=1` is set. Currently `uv` points the user to run `uv sync`, but it's the `uv sync` that causes the error!
