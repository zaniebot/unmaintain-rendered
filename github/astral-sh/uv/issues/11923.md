# local building makes uninstallable version version makes lib not install

_Issue opened by @kocsszi on 2025-03-03 13:28_

### Question

Hi 

The below fails with patch version mismatch for some reason. Can I somehow make uv ignore this?

```
uv add vllm
```
```
Resolved 99 packages in 41ms
  × Failed to download and build `vllm==0.2.5`
  ╰─▶ Package metadata version `0.2.5+cu128` does not match given version `0.2.5`
  help: `vllm` (v0.2.5) was included because `sentiment-analysis` (v0.1.0) depends on `vllm`
```

### Platform

Ubuntu 24.04

### Version

0.5.16

We allowed this in a later version. It looks like you need to upgrade uv?

Hi Charlie, thanks that was it. Sorry, I was under the impression I was on latest already.
