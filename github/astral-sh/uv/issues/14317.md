# Running command line script xxxx without prefixing with `uv run xxx`

---

_Issue opened by @fritz-trawa on 2025-06-27 14:20_

### Summary

If I have the following in my pyproject.toml

```
[project.scripts]
bark = doc.bark.__main__:cli
```

with poetry I can run

```
❯ poetry install
... install stuff ...
❯ bark
woof!
```

with uv it seems I can only do
```
❯ uv sync
... install stuff ...
❯ uv run bark
woof!
```

How can I remove the need for prefixing each command with `uv run`?

Thanks

Oh silly me, I hadn't activated the venv

In case someone stumbles over this

```
❯ uv venv
...
❯ source .venv/bin/activate
❯ uv sync
...
❯ bark
woof!
```

works provided you have the following in your pyproject.toml

```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```
