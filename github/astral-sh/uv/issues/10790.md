# Extras listed in `pyproject.toml` even when not found by `uv add`

_Issue opened by @krishsai7 on 2025-01-20 21:05_

When adding a package that doesn't contain extras, `uv` will warn me saying that the extra couldn't be found.

However, the generated `pyproject.toml` will still contain this extra that doesn't actually exist. Is this something that should be expected?

Currently using `uv` `0.5.17` on Windows 10.

Yeah, this is the expected behavior with extras in Python. _Some_ version of `boto3` in your accepted range could have that extra.

Yeah, I think it makes sense to preserve these.
