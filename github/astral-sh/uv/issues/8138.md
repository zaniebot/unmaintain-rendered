<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).

Hi, Y'all!
I'm trying to get familiar with the code base of uv. I found it's useful to show the source location of a log in this process. With the help of @j178, I found add some settings like https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/8137 can make it. Is it good to make the behavior default of extra verbose, or we can add another flag extra-extra-verbose?

some example of the change:
```
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -vv --manifest-path=/where-uv-project-exists/Cargo.toml -- build --wheel -vv
....

I think I'd prefer if this were enabled conditionally somehow -- it's a bit much for `--verbose`. Maybe @konsti has an opinion.
