# The "Project dependencies" and "Dependency specifiers" sections should move into the "Reference"

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-08-21 13:19_

at `uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#project-dependencies` and `uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-specifiers` right now but would fit better in a `uv/reference/standards` section?
