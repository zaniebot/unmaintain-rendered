# modified `.zshrc` must have comment and installer must log about exact modified file.

---

_Issue opened by @PaulVe2024 on 2025-07-16 22:24_

### Summary

Installer must tell about modified files like `.zshrc` and add comment to added line, e.g.

```
#  uv for Python - https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/installer/  <--- THIS OR SIMILAR COMMENT LINE MUST BE ADDED
. "$HOME/.local/bin/env"
```

installer log:
```
% env UV_INSTALL_DIR="/Users/user/opt/uv" sh uv-install.sh 

downloading uv 0.7.21 aarch64-apple-darwin
no checksums to verify
installing to /Users/user/opt/uv
  uv
  uvx
everything's installed!
/Users/user/.zshrc was modified   <--- THIS OR SIMILAR LINE MUST BE IN INSTALLER LOG OUTPUT

To add $HOME/opt/uv to your PATH, either restart your shell or run:

    source $HOME/opt/uv/env (sh, bash, zsh)
    source $HOME/opt/uv/env.fish (fish)
```
