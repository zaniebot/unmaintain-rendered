# RFE: Add `uv build`

---

_Issue opened by @gotmax23 on 2024-08-28 04:08_

It would be great to have a `uv build` command that could be used to build a plain sdist and/or wheel from a source tree.

Would also be great if it mimicked Rye's build command with the option to encrypt your PyPI token with a password.

Sorry, I know these aren't always easy to find.

Yup, thanks. I spent 5 minutes trying to find an existing issue and could not.

Publishing to PyPI is different than the subject of this issue — building dists.
