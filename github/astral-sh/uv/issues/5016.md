# Usage of env variables inside requirements file

---

_Issue opened by @kennycontreras on 2024-07-12 16:02_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I'd like to know if this feature is possible using `uv` inside a Docker container
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#using-environment-variables

I have a requirements file like the following:

```
dbt-core==${DBT_VERSION}
dbt-bigquery==${DBT_BQ_VERSION}
...
```
The env variables are from `--build-arg`s when I create the Docker image. 

I've tried forcing the activation of a venv and also `--system` without much luck. 

`RUN uv pip install --system -r requirements.txt
`

The following example code (without using uv) works without a problem

```
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.10.10

ARG DBT_VERSION
ARG DBT_BQ_VERSION

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

```

I couldn't find anything related in the docs, so I'd like to know if someone has worked on something similar or any ideas to achieve that. 

Thanks.
