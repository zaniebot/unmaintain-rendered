# How to bundle the binary dependency "swig" into pyproject.toml when compiling gymnasium[box2d]?

---

_Issue opened by @Tangent-90C on 2025-05-31 09:13_

### Question

When I installed gymnasium[box2d], it required the binary program "swig". However, I couldn't find a way to bundle "swig" into pyproject.toml. I've tried many methods, but all of them resulted in errors.
I know I could first install "swig" in the environment using `uv tool install swig` and then install the environment based on pyproject.toml. But I hope to install the environment in one go via uv sync so that I can distribute the code without any extra steps.

It's not possible to declare `swig` as an extra build dependency for `gymnasium[box2d]`, but we'll probably support that in the future. (When you added `swig` on line 29, that would include `swig` when building your own package (`rl`), but builds are performed in isolation, so it wouldn't have any affect on the `gymnasium[box2d]` build.)

\cc @Gankra -- I think this is a decent example of a package for which users might want to augment build dependencies? Though haven't tried it myself.
