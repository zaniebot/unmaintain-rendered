# UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY uses inconsistent naming

---

_Issue opened by @asarkar on 2025-11-27 09:41_

### Summary

https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/

While other environment variables that refer to a directory end in `_DIR`, like `UV_CACHE_DIR`, `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` ends in `_DIRECTORY`. This is inconsistent.

This ticket is to introduce a new env var `UV_WORKING_DIR`, and deprecate `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY`.

### Example

Pretty obvious.
