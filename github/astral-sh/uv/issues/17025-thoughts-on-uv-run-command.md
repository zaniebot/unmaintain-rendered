Can you say more please? Maybe provide an example?

My idea is that when using the “uv init example” command to create a project, a main.py file will be generated by default. This way, we can directly run the project with the “uv run” command (currently, running “uv run” only prints the help information) without having to manually enter the main.py file. Only when there is no main.py file in the project should the help information be displayed. This might seem a bit lazy, but I believe it will make uv easier to use.

Although some projects may have multiple entry files, you can also run them using 'uv run ***.py'.

I see, so you're asking for `uv run` to run a "default entrypoint" in a project?

Yes. This is a thought I had during my use of it, and I wonder if other developers would agree.
