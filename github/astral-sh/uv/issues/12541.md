# uv metadata (like cargo metadata)

---

_Issue opened by @heiner on 2025-03-29 00:31_

### Summary

For some use cases, it's useful to have Python package dependencies in a machine-readable form. This could work like `uv tree`, but output a format like json. Cargo has this as `cargo metadata`; it could also be another type of `uv export` format.

We would use this, for instance, to know which parts of a larger monorepo need to be made available for building in an external service.

When developing on Darwin but running in prod on Linux, this would ideally include a way to resolve "as if on Linux".

### Example
