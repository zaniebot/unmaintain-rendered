# `uv run --script` should imply `--no-project`

---

_Issue opened by @offbyone on 2024-11-02 13:59_

I'm running into a variation of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8666

I have some uv scripts that are just generic command line tools, not part of a project. If I run them inside a Python project that uses Poetry, though, I get `error: No `project` table found in: `/Users/offby1/projects/autopub/autopub/pyproject.toml` errors constantly.

I'm using the `--script` shebang:

`#!/usr/bin/env uv --script`

I realize that I _can_ add `--no-project` to it, but really, I think once you're using `--script` there's a good argument to be made that `uv` should assume `--no-project`

We should just stop throwing that error so aggressively. I don't want `--script` to imply `--no-project` in case we want to read things like settings from the project too in the future.

I actually can't reproduce this. Are you still able to? I don't think we discover projects when `--script` is provided, from reading the code.

Agreed, could not reproduce.

I no longer see this either.
