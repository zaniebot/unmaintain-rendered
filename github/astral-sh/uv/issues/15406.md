_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-08-21 13:15_

We should start warning this is deprecated and remove it in a future breaking release.

In the process, we should migrate all mentions of "development dependencies", "development dependency groups" and variations to just "dependency groups". I think this a good first issue for someone to get familiar with the codebase and snapshots.

Sorry, we're splitting conversations now... https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/15557#issuecomment-3229318020

I think explaining that dependency groups are for development only is important. There's a lot of nuance. I don't think it's a good first issue for someone to try to change the messaging there — we should open a dedicated issue for discussion of that.
