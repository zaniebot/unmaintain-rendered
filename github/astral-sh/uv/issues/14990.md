# --project must be passed before "run"

---

_Issue opened by @diegochine on 2025-07-31 10:24_

### Summary

From the docs, the `uv run` usage is:
```
uv run [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

I was trying to run with `uv` a file from a different folder than the one it resides in, meaning I have to use the `--project` option to specify the project (for some reason, it doesn't seem to be able to find `pyproject.toml` automatically). 

Based on the docs, I would do:
```
uv run --project /path/to/dir python /path/to/dir/file.py
```

This does not work, I get a `ModuleNotFoundError` (i.e. the venv is not being correctly activated).
What actually works is:
```
uv --project /path/to/dir run python /path/to/dir/file.py
```

i.e., specifying `--project` *before* `run`.

I am not sure whether this is a bug or just the docs not being clear enough. 

### Platform

macOS 15.5 arm64

### Version

uv 0.8.2 (21fadbcc1 2025-07-22)

### Python version

Python 3.13.5

Unfortunately I can't reproduce this. I ran:

```
> uv run --project ./foo python /Users/crmarsh/workspace/uv/foo/main.py
Hello from foo!
```

Where `foo/main.py` includes `import anyio`, and `foo/pyproject.toml` is:

```toml
[project]
name = "foo"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13.2"
dependencies = [
    "anyio>=4.9.0",
]
```

We'll need a more complete reproduction to help here.

I actually found the issue and it was not related to `uv` at all. My bad. Confirm it works as expected, closing the issue.
