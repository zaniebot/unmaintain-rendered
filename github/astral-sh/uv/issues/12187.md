# uv_build Error when the folder name is capitalized

---

_Issue opened by @NourEldin-Osama on 2025-03-15 13:45_

### Summary

when i run 
```bash
uv build
```
and the
```toml
build-backend = "uv_build"
```

pyproject.toml
```toml
[project]
name = "Transcriber"
version = "0.1.5"
description = "A simple tool to transcribe audio files"
readme = "README.md"
authors = [
    { name = "NourEldin", email = "noureldin.osama.saad@gmail.com" }
]
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "faster-whisper>=1.1.1",
    "openai-whisper>=20240930",
    "pydantic-settings>=2.7.1",
    "python-docx>=1.1.2",
    "rich>=13.9.4",
    "stable-ts>=2.18.3",
    "yt-dlp==2025.1.15",
]

[project.scripts]
transcribe = "Transcriber.transcriber:transcribe"

[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build"]
build-backend = "uv_build"
```

the code for the package is in in `src\Transcriber`

terminal output
```
N:\Transcriber> uv build
Building source distribution...
Building wheel from source distribution...
Error: Expected a Python module with an `__init__.py` at: `src\transcriber`
  × Failed to build `N:\Transcriber`
  ├─▶ The build backend returned an error
  ╰─▶ Call to `uv_build.build_wheel` failed (exit code: 1)
      hint: This usually indicates a problem with the package or the build environment.
```

but if i changed the package folder to `src\transcriber` it works

also this is works when and folder = `src\Transcriber` 
```toml
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

It looks like we expect you to use the normalized name here. You could set:

```toml
[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-name = "Transcriber"
```

Somewhat undecided on whether this should work out of the box -- I think it probably should? What do you think @konstin?

your solution worked, but isn't the expected to work without adding it like when using hatchling?

It probably should, yeah.
