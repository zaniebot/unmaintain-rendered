# `from compression import zstd` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` in Python 3.14.0b2 on Linux

---

_Issue opened by @BioGeek on 2025-07-03 09:32_

### Summary

Python 3.14 [added Zstandard to the standard library](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-pep784) (see [PEP 784](https://peps.python.org/pep-0784/) and https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/132983). 

However, when using Python 3.14 with `uv`, I get a `ModuleNotFoundError`:

```bash
$ uvx python3.14
Python 3.14.0b2 (main, Jun 12 2025, 12:41:01) [Clang 20.1.4 ] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from compression import zstd
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<python-input-0>", line 1, in <module>
    from compression import zstd
  File "/home/j-vangoey/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.14.0b2-linux-x86_64-gnu/lib/python3.14/compression/zstd/__init__.py", line 29, in <module>
    import _zstd
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_zstd'
```

According to https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/issues/646 the `zstd` C library is currently only being built on Windows, which explains why I'm getting this error on Linux.

Yep! We haven't added it yet because we build dependencies from scratch and we didn't want it to block the alphas. It's on the roadmap to add still.
