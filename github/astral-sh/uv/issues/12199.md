# Simple pip aliasing

---

_Issue opened by @vitalik on 2025-03-16 09:31_

### Summary

The more I suggest people to use uv the more I hear they accidentally installed package globally instead of virtualenv because they either copypasted some  "pip install foo" instruction or some super new ai library have `os.system("pip install foo")

why can uv just put alias inside .venv  pip -> uv pip ?


```
$ uv venv --python 3.12
```

```
Using CPython 3.12.7 interpreter at: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

```
$ which pip
/Users/user/.pyenv/shims/pip

🫤
```

```
$ echo '#!/bin/sh' > .venv/bin/pip
echo 'uv pip "$@"' >> .venv/bin/pip
chmod +x .venv/bin/pip
```

```
$ which pip
/private/tmp/myvenv1/.venv/bin/pip
```
```
$ pip install requests
Resolved 5 packages in 12ms
Installed 5 packages in 7ms
 + certifi==2025.1.31
 + charset-normalizer==3.4.1
 + idna==3.10
 + requests==2.32.3
 + urllib3==2.3.0

😊
```

I see there lot of issues reported this - but I still cannot fully understand why approach above would break things ?

If I remember correctly, this was an early discussion
* https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1657

From my personal perspective, I don't think it's a good idea for pip to be an alias for uv pip, because they are not fully compatible.
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/

Speaking of the latest version of uv, do you think any of the previous discussions are now outdated?

Does it solve the issue when some have ```os.system("pip install huggingface")``` inside python code?

If uv wants to get rid of pip - maybe alias inside venv should throw an error like - "hey do not use pip - use uv pip/add)" (when -- seed was not used)

That way people will slowly abandon the mussel memory of using pip

Should uv be trying to solve libraries which have bad code in them? That's not even a good way to call pip, and may result in random errors on different users machines.

Personally, I would rather uv try to push standard dependency management, through pyproject.toml or scripts with in line metadata. Not preempting bad code.

> If uv wants to get rid of pip

I could be wrong, but I don't think that's an explicit goal of astral. Pip will likely remain the core bootstrapping library for the foreseeable future, and in many environments be the packaging installer available to use.

@notatallshaw 

Sure - getting rid of pip should not be the goal

What I see as a problem that uv venv does not seed pip by default 

And once venv initialized there is no way to tell if pip was seeded or not

--- 
Now imagine you are a fresh python developer - some one suggested you to use uv - you initialized it and forgot about it

Next day ChatGPT gives you instructions to run 'pip install foo' - and you got it in global python library (why would you care to read history of all 20 package installers and their behavior)

Thats not good DX - and with LLMs it will keep suggesting pip the same for very long  time
