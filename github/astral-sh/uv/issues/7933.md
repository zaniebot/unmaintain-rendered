I am trying to download quart-cli with the following command `uv add quarto-cli`:

```
yahmed@DLONTE00092 MINGW64 /n/gitrepos/testing/poc/gt-poc (master)
$ uv add quarto-cli

This looks like a bug in `quarto-cli` itself, does this install with `pip`?

I believe it does install with pip but not on my setup, it could indeed be a bug with the package itself
