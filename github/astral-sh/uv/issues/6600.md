# UV --verbose doesn't print out maturin build stdout

_Issue opened by @ion-elgreco on 2024-08-25 11:20_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
I ran uv sync --verbose in our delta-rs repo, but I don't get any stdout of maturin, only get DEBUG stuff from uv self. 

Without verbose:

```
ion@DESKTOP-OB410HS:~/delta-rs/python$ uv sync --reinstall-package deltalake
Resolved 63 packages in 1.94s
Building deltalake @ file:///home/ion/delta-rs/python
⠸ Preparing packages... (0/1) 
```

With verbose
```
DEBUG Requirement already cached: maturin==1.7.1
DEBUG Requirement already cached: tomli==2.0.1
DEBUG Installing build requirements: maturin==1.7.1, tomli==2.0.1
DEBUG Calling `maturin.get_requires_for_build_editable()`
DEBUG Calling `maturin.build_editable("/home/ion/.cache/uv/built-wheels-v3/editable/eb5bde2e6253a7d8/hd5kxfPkwqCgryioauZRN/.tmpXckacG", {}, None)`
```
I would also like to be able to see the build progress of maturin here:
