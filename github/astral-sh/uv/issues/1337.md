# `uv venv` cannot find python in PATH, but it's in PATH

---

_Issue opened by @goudbor on 2024-02-15 20:56_

Downloaded `uv` using `curl` to play around

Ran
```
mkdir testing && cd testing
uv venv
```

`uv` outputs 
```
  × Neither `python` nor `python3` are in `PATH`. Is Python installed?
```

But python3 is definitely within my PATH variable?  Is this a bug?

I'm running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64-bit.

Thanks for the report! Closing in favor of #1335 but I'll be looking into this immediately.
