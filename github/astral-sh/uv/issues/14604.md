# `uvx` does not error when `--from <package>` has a `requires-python` range incompatible with `-p`

### Summary

If you do

```
uv init -p 3.13 example
uvx -p 3.9 --from ./example python --version
```

we'll fail to resolve with 3.9 and resolve again with 3.13 automatically.

I think https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10401 regressed this.
