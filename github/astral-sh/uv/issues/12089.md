# How would I correctly "install" a package located in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages into uv venv

_Issue opened by @michealroberts on 2025-03-10 09:40_

### Question

I'm hoping this is an easy one, and technically it is perhaps not related to uv but rather virtual environments. However, I figured there might be some nice tricks that uv provides that could help ...

I have an awkward situation where a package is not installable by pip (or, uv, rather). Instead, the package comes with a Debian package installation and is located here:

```
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
```

However, I would like the package to be accessible from within a virtual environment.

I'm thinking to try this:

```
export PYTHONPATH="/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages:$PYTHONPATH"
```

However, I'm not confident that this will work at this stage. I will try this, but I was wondering if uv could help manage this out of the box, in someway ... 




### Platform

Darwin 23.5.0 arm64

### Version

uv 0.6.0

You can try using the system interpreter and system site packages with `uv venv -p <path to system python> --system-site-packages`. The latter option should allow you to use the package (even though `uv pip list` currently doesn't see the package).

@konstin Thanks for this Konstin.

So, just to be sure, the command to run here is:

```bash
uv venv -p /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages --system-site-packages
```

🙏

I think it's `uv venv -p /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages`, but it depends on your distro. Try it out - with venvs, you can't break much, `rm -rf .venv` cleans it all up again.

@konstin Hi Konstin, unfortunately, this did not work. I want to install the package into the venv ... the global python interpreter is a different version that required, I need to pull the library located in `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` into the venv ...

Unfortunately, I don't think we can support this across Python versions, packages often contain version-specific modules.
