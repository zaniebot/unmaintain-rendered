# standalone venv creation

---

_Issue opened by @HernandoR on 2025-03-06 05:25_

### Question

My use case here is to install the venv to a shared storage, then run in a different environment.

The running environment **do not have uv**  however when using `uv venv -p 3.10`, the python in the .venv/bin is just symulink to the uv managed python in `uv/python/cpython-3.10**` which is not available in the runing environment.

is it possible to let `uv venv -p 3.10` install the python interpreter in the venv rather than symlink?

### Platform

NA

### Version

NA

Is this a duplicate of #2103?

FYI, this use case of running from a separate environment could be achieved with a [layout](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11746).

Even python is installed as standalone binary in venv, whether this venv is portable is subject to `pyvenv.cfg`'s `home` field, which you may have to ensure to be the same across different environments.

In short, we're interested in this but haven't added support yet.

Ah yeah @Vigilans, based on the limitations you linked, I don't think venvs are suitable for a scenario like this.

A real environment (realenv, renv) containing a full interpreter installation would be needed, and derivative venvs would need to reference the real environment using either `--python` or by locating it on the system PATH.
