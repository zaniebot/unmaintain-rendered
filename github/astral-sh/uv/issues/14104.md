# Respect *_PROXY

---

_Issue opened by @tamis-laan on 2025-06-17 11:03_

### Summary

I'm not completely sure but it seams that the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` as well as `NO_PROXY` are not respected by `uv sync`? This means when behind a proxy we cannot install packages. Or am I doing something wrong?

### Example

_No response_

Yes, we do support these via reqwest (https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/#proxies). It sounds like something else is wrong?
