# UV doesn't crash if there is operation timeout and error

_Issue opened by @fervand1 on 2024-06-07 11:19_

I was trying to execute uv pip install requirements on latest version of uv. If there was a operation timeout error , uv didn't crash and instead just printed the error like below and said all is successful

Shouldn't it have crashed and asked user to re execute the install command here?

That's surprising. Hm. You might be seeing an error that was retried? Maybe it was a pre-fetch that we didn't need? It seems weird that we could fail a request and not propagate the error into a failure unless the request didn't matter for some reason.

@zanieb I am not entirely sure, also I see this randomly obviously for some timeout reasons. If possible i will try to get you more verbose logs when it happens

That'd be really helpful. You can set `RUST_LOG=uv=trace` (or `RUST_LOG=trace`) to increase verbosity.
