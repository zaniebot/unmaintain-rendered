# Question: UV equivalent of "conda develop ."

---

_Issue opened by @killcoder on 2024-11-15 06:28_

Does uv have an equivalent command to "conda develop ."? I've recently started testing uv as a replacement for conda env but straight away it couldn't find local module "assets" even though its in the project folder. 
```
> python .\assets\connections\local_connection.py
...
    from assets.fcc.fcc import fcc
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'assets'
```

Copying the "conda.pth" file created by "conda develop ." into the ./venv/Lib/site-packages folder automatically fixes import errors by appending the current project to the path.

Can you share your project layout and (excerpt) of pyproject.toml?

Hey @killcoder it would not be a 1-to-1 equivalent, but you should be able to install your package in editable (similar-ish to development mode in conda) with `uv pip install -e ...` ref: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/packages/#editable-packages

---

_Comment by @konstin on 2024-11-19 13:54_

In your pyproject.toml, you need to declare a build backend (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#build-systems). For that, the `[project] name` (`UV_Test`) should match the directory with your code (`assets`). The default from uv is:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

With a build backend declared, `uv sync` will do an editable install of your project, and your code should import as you expect it.

Unfortunately, neither of these suggestions have solved my issue. 

```
>uv sync
Resolved 101 packages in 3ms
error: Failed to prepare distributions

...

At least one file selection option must be defined in the `tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel` table, see: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/

As an example, if you intend to ship a directory named `foo` that resides within a `src` directory located at the root of your project, you can define the following:

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/foo"]
```

Adding the required "src/..." folder and updating the pyproject.toml file allowed me to get passed this issue but the original problem still remains. 

```
uv sync
Resolved 101 packages in 3ms
   Built uv_test@ file:///C:/Users/test/UV_Test

Prepared 1 package in 867ms
Installed 1 package in 10ms
 + uv_test==0.1.0 (from file:///C:/Users/test/UV_Test)
```

```
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["uv_test"]
```

should do the trick, you can find more information on project layouts in the hatch documentation.
