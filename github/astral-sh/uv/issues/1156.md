_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-01-28 16:23_

This is probably not relevant for us yet, but I want to track contributing this.

e.g.
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/pull/15765
- https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/pull/22779

I am noticing that uv's `.venv` folder is not detected by vscode.

Oddly, the `.venv` folder produced by `poetry` and `pdm` do get detected and the venv is auto-activated within the integrated terminal of vscode.

Edit: Seems this was a fluke. It's being found by vscode now!

Huh, interesting. There's nothing special about our `.venv`!

I just try it with `VSCodium` but it does auto-activated the venv.

Would be very useful.
is there any workaround for this?

I also had issues on `linux` with that, on my side the problem was that I installed `vscode`/`vscodium` from a `flatpak`.
Installing from a **regular package manager** solved the issues. I just select the python interpreter from `vscode` and it detects all the installed packages in the `.venv` folder.
However I am unable to create from vscode a `.venv` environemnt using `uv`.

What might be nice is smart handling of script dependency metadata.

We added environment detection to `python-environment-tools` which is the backing source for VS Code.

I think there's more to be done for PEP 723 scripts, but I consider that separate from the intent of this issue.
