# GUI Desktop App for uv

_Issue opened by @ttmc on 2024-03-15 16:34_

At some point, Astral will want revenues to help fund everything.

One thing that business users like is GUI desktop apps. They're willing to pay for them, even though they're arguably "just" wrappers around functionality that's available in the CLI. See, for example:

- GitKraken (for git)
- JetBrains DataGrip (for PostgreSQL)
- Docker Desktop (for Docker); you only have to pay if your company is big

FYI in my mind the most comporable GUI tool to something as "uv but with a GUI" would be the Anaconda Navigator. And indeed, it does require payment for companies with more than 200 employees.

I have no idea what astral's future plans are, but there's certainly room for disruption. I used to maintain an Anaconda distrubition with ~5000 active installs across the company, I was surprised I'd often get questions from data scientists and analysists whose primary method to interact with Python environments was via the GUI, as it was not a pleasent tool to use.
