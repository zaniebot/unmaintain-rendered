# Expose requirement parsing api

---

_Issue opened by @brendan-morin on 2025-01-15 01:02_

There exist a few requirement parsing libraries ([requirements-parser](https://github.com/madpah/requirements-parser/#readme), [requirementslib](https://github.com/sarugaku/requirementslib), etc) that can be used to parse python requirement strings. However, I haven't found any of these are particularly well adopted or supported. It would be great to see uv expose an API for its internal requirement parsing.

The use case for this would be non-standard requirements management (let's say I have a _hierarchy_ of requirements files I want to resolve the strictest superset of, or I want to understand the intersection or differences of multiple files, however that may be defined). If uv were to expose its requirements parsing API, we could build tooling for these cases directly on top of it. I didn't see this was exposed today, but please correct me if I missed it.

Thanks. I think we're unlikely to invest in public-facing programmatic APIs in the near future, since it's a lot of work to maintain, but it's something we're thinking about in the longer term.
