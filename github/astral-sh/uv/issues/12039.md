# Do uv workspaces work with VSCode / Pylance?

---

_Issue opened by @Timmmm on 2025-03-07 11:05_

### Question

I set up a simple project with two packages using `uv`'s workspaces feature. It works great and was very easy to set up (yeay Python tooling that doesn't suck!).

Here it is:

[uv_issue.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19125280/uv_issue.zip)

You can run

```
uv sync
uv run main
```

and it works.

The only problem is VSCode / Pylance doesn't seem to understand it, even after I select `.venv/bin/python` as the interpreter. It can't find this import:

Is this supposed to work? 

Maybe related to #9637

### Platform

Linux RHEL 8

### Version

uv 0.6.4

There are two settings I had to get some intellisense and imports working with vscode here. Have you tried `python.autoComplete.extraPaths` and `python.analysis.extraPaths`?

I had to check the following option, but then it works for me:

Given that I can't reproduce it, I assume this is another case of #9637.

Pylance cannot find the correct direct of packages.
try: settings -> search "extra path" -> input ".venv\Lib\site-packages"
