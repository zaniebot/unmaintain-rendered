Are you using managed Python distributions or your system Python?

We use libedit instead of readline (behind the scenes) which may not support this?

I used the managed Python distribution.

Thanks for the pointer! From [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77292123/10702372) and the [libedit manpages](https://manpages.debian.org/jessie/libedit-dev/editrc.5.en.html), I learnt putting `bind -v` in `~/.editrc` solves the problem.
