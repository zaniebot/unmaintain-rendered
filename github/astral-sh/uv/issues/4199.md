# failed to open file `/dev/null/uv/uv.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @misery on 2024-06-10 14:01_

I tried uv in pre-receive hook in gitlab. Seems gitlab misses something here. But it would be nice if uv won't fail anymore.

Tried 0.2.9
```
uv -v venv $VIRTUAL_ENV
 error: failed to open file `/dev/null/uv/uv.toml`
   Caused by: Not a directory (os error 20)
```
