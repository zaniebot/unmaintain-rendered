# python-version should support multiple versions using newline separated string like actions/setup-python

---

_Issue opened by @ssbarnea on 2025-09-03 12:49_

### Summary

With github own `actions/setup-python` the `python-version` argument accepts multiple versions as strings with newline separator, like:

```yaml
- uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
  with:
    python-version: |
      3.12
      3.14
```

This is currently not supported by `astral-sh/setup-uv` which silently accepts the argument and passes it into UV_PYTHON variable as seen in the logs:

```
Added /home/runner/.local/bin to the path
Added /opt/hostedtoolcache/uv/0.8.14/x86_64 to the path
Set UV_PYTHON to 3.10
3.13
Set UV_CACHE_DIR to /home/runner/work/_temp/setup-uv-cache
```

What is even worse is that the setup-uv action reports succeess, but uv is not really functional after

```shell
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ***
    FORCE_COLOR: 1
    PY_COLORS: 1
    UV_PYTHON: 3.13
  3.13
    UV_CACHE_DIR: /Users/runner/work/_temp/setup-uv-cache
+ python3 --version
Python 3.13.7
+ which -a python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3
+ which -a uv
/usr/bin/python3
/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache/uv/0.8.14/x86_64/uv
+ uv --version
uv 0.8.14 (af856fb88 2025-08-28)
+ uv tool install --with tox-uv tox
error: No interpreter found for executable name `3.13
3.13` in managed installations or search path
```

Basically uv silently ignores the unrecognized value of UV_PYTHON until one tries to use `uv tool install`.

Hi @ssbarnea can you please post an example workflow that would make use of this if we would support it?

We aim to be compatible with setup-python as much as possible but some workflows/use cases can and should be solved differently when using uv

I'm a little wary to support this, but there is precedent in the `.python-version` file for multiple newline separated Python version values.
