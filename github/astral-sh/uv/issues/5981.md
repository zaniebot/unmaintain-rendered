# Consider support for alternative for long help for `uvx`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-08-09 22:45_

Right now this tries to invoke the command, but I bet this project is reserved on PyPI. Right now, we suggest using `uv help tool run` instead. At the very least, we should support `uv help uvx`.
