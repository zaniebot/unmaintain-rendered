# Add subcommand that reports project root and workspace root information

---

_Issue opened by @legendre6891 on 2025-05-05 04:40_

### Summary

The feature request is a subcommand (either a new subcommand, or a new sub-subcommand to an existing subcommand) that reports the project root. 

e.g.
```
uv MAGIC-SUBCOMMAND
```

could be functionally the same as(*)
```
$ uv python find --verbose 2>&1 | grep 'DEBUG Found project root: ' | sed -n 's/.*`\([^`]*\)`.*/\1/p'
(path to project root)
```

If the project root is not found, then the command doesn't print anything, but the exit status is set to non-zero value to signal error. 

Similarly, we could have another `uv MAGIC-SUBCOMMAND2` prints the workspace root (or print nothing and have non-zero exit status). 


(*) The cryptic `sed` command simply extracts what's in backticks.



### Example

If we call the MAGIC-SUBCOMMAND `python project-root`, and  MAGIC-SUBCOMMAND2 `python workspace-root`, then one example output might be the following.  (Exact result depends on project layout, of course.)

```
$ uv python project-root 
/path/to/my/workspace/pkg
```

```
$ uv python workspace-root 
/path/to/my/workspace
```
