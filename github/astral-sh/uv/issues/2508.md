Hi, `uv` works very well in venv creation and package installation but I have some questions about the venv reproduction. 

I see there is no `.lock` or `.toml` file when we run `uv venv` or `uv pip install xxx`.  I don't want to use the package list created by `pip freeze`, which lists packages in `package==version` format, compared to the `xxx = "^0.1.7"` format in `poetry`.

So how can we reproduce current venv other than `uv pip freeze`?

Related to #1968 

use `uv pip freeze | uv pip compile - -o requirements.txt` to create lock file for your current environment. then install lock file into new environment.

Yeah we don't support Poetry-style dependencies, which are custom to Poetry and aren't standardized in any way. So if you're trying to convert from PEP 508-style requirements to Poetry-style requirements, I don't think uv can help you. There may be other tools that can facilitate that conversion.
