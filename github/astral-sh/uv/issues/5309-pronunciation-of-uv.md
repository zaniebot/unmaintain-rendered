# pronunciation of uv

---

_Issue opened by @petergaultney on 2024-07-22 20:35_

This is, I'm sure, a dumb question, but would y'all mind putting in the README a 'standard' pronunciation for this tool? I've been assuming it's "you-vee" - but somebody at work pointed out it might be a single syllable, maybe "oove"?

Usually we all collaborate over Slack, but when you're in the office with people for the first time in a while, it feels weird not to know how to talk about the tool we're proposing to integrate into our workflows. :)

We say "you - vee". I'd review a pull request adding an IPA definition.

Thank you! 

I am not an expert on IPA - I _think_ it would be `ju-vi` according to what i'm seeing here. https://www.vocabulary.com/resources/ipa-pronunciation/

i will see if I can make such a PR; maybe this evening.

Also not an expert but `/juː viː/` seems correct
