# Make test suite robust against `UV_CACHE_DIR`

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-09-19 11:26_

Currently, the help tests fail when `UV_CACHE_DIR` is set (https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/10939768235/job/30370759126?pr=7540). We should unset `UV_CACHE_DIR` for the commands those tests run (other tests override the value). Then we can migrate the two remaining usage of `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` in `ci.yml` to https://github.com/astral-sh/setup-uv.
