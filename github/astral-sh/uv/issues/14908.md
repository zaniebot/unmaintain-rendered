# Allow fields that are classified as "project metadata" in `uv.toml` files in projects

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-07-25 21:07_

It's unclear if we should do this, but this issue is for discussion.

We currently categorize fields as [project metadata](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#project-metadata), which are only allowed in the `pyproject.toml`, or [configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#configuration) which is allowed in the `uv.toml`.

While we do not want to read project metadata settings from _outside_ the project (e.g., from a user level `uv.toml`), we _could_ allow reading project metadata fields from a `uv.toml` that is alongside a `pyproject.toml` that does not contain a `[tool.uv]` table.
