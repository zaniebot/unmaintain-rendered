<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

In Windows, i have a global `python` and even if uv is installed with another python, it always use the global one

```
>>> python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable); print(sys.version)"
C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\python.exe
3.10.11 (main, Apr  7 2023, 17:44:36)  [GCC UCRT 12.2.0 64 bit (AMD64)]

>>> python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.executable); print(sys.version)"
C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\python3.exe
3.10.11 (main, Apr  7 2023, 17:44:36)  [GCC UCRT 12.2.0 64 bit (AMD64)]

>>> py -c "import sys; print(sys.executable); print(sys.version)"     
C:\Users\utilisateur\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe
3.12.1 (tags/v3.12.1:2305ca5, Dec  7 2023, 22:03:25) [MSC v.1937 64 bit (AMD64)]

>>> py -m pip install --upgrade pip
Requirement already satisfied: pip in c:\users\utilisateur\appdata\local\programs\python\python312\lib\site-packages (24.0)

>>> py -m uv venv --version
uv-venv 0.1.40 (e8b423de7 2024-05-07)

>>> py -m uv venv 
DEBUG Starting interpreter discovery for default Python
DEBUG Probing interpreter info for: C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\python3.exe
  × Can't use Python at `C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin\python3.exe`
  ╰─▶ Unknown operation system: `mingw_x86_64_ucrt
```

Of course it is easily solvable with `py -m uv venv --python py` so sorry in advance if it is something expected, but I expected uv to take the python it is installed in by default
