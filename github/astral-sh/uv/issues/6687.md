# Path back to using released tl crate dependency?

_Issue opened by @musicinmybrain on 2024-08-27 13:48_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
As required by Fedora’s [guidelines for bundling](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#bundling) – do you anticipate being able to go back to using the released `tl` crate at some point? It looks like all that’s needed is for https://github.com/y21/tl/pull/69 to be merged and released – is that correct? Thanks!

Yes that sounds correct — we'd love to use the released `tl` crate but we also want to deliver that fix to our users.

👍 Correct. I'd love to go back to the released `tl` crate as soon as we can.
