# Uv undo

---

_Issue opened by @SimonVervisch on 2025-12-03 20:15_

### Summary

possible to return to the last 5 environments for example? It would be nice to have a snapshot.

uv undo

> do you really want to change back

> yes
> changes back to the old version

### Example

The issue I had, is that one, is that a new pip install changed versions of other packages. 

I preferred the old version, but I think I cannot look back at that one. 

Thank you

In general, I'd recommend using version control and a lockfile for this purpose. But it's a fun idea!

As prior art conda keeps a full revision history and allows you to restore to any previous revision: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#restoring-an-environment
