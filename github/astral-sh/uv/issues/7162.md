# UV not installing current package

---

_Issue opened by @danieleades on 2024-09-07 09:44_

I'm seeing a change in UV behaviour where the current package is not being installed (either with `uv sync` or `uv run`)

This is causing CI failures

I can work around this locally by manually installing the current package in the virtual environment
