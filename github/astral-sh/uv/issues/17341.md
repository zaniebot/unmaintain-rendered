# `pyside6-deploy` fails with `Failed to canonicalize script path`

---

_Issue opened by @docentYT on 2026-01-06 22:53_

### Summary

I am trying to deploy my PyQt6 app with the [`pyside6-deploy`](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/deployment/deployment-pyside6-deploy.html#pyside6-deploy) command.  I am getting the error:
`Failed to canonicalize script path` regardless of the path to the `main.py` I pass as the argument.

The command works when using a normal venv created by a 'classic' Python distribution.

### Platform

Windows 11 x64

### Version

uv 0.9.18 (0cee76417 2025-12-16)

### Python version

Python 3.13.5
