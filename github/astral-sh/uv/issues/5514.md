Not related directly to the parent issue, but something I noticed.

On Windows, uv won’t update itself if it was manually installed (for example, to `C:/uv/uv.exe`) rather than installed with the PowerShell script.

It would be nice if uv didn’t have this limitation since a lot of companies don’t allow script execution.

(Yeah, `self update` requires that you initially installed uv through the blessed installer path.)
