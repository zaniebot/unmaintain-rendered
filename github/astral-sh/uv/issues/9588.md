# Add repository topic "uv" or similar

---

_Issue opened by @dbohdan on 2024-12-02 22:40_

Some GitHub projects that use uv are tagged with the [topic "uv"](https://github.com/topics/uv). Ruff is the top repo for the [topic "ruff"](https://github.com/topics/ruff). Something to consider is that "uv" is also used for software that works with textures. You may also want to come up with a different, unique topic.
