# Add the option to use custom seed packages when creating a `venv`

---

_Issue opened by @JMuff22 on 2025-09-19 07:02_

### Summary

I have tried to find this in the documentation and in the issue trackers. The closest I have found is the `uv venv --seed` option and https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1404 . 

The problem I am having is that I often create a lot of venvs via `uv venv` and I always have to install the same packages inside the venv for my work e.g `matplotlib` `numpy` etc . I would like to configure`uv` to always install some packages in my venv outside of a project scope. So add configuration to `uv.toml` located in `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` and specify packages there. Perhaps something like 

```toml
[tool.uv.venv]
seed-packages = [
"wheel",
"pip",
"ruff",
"requests",
]

```

I am not use if this would fall under _custom seed packages_ or not. 

Maybe something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12079607/make-virtualenv-inherit-specific-packages-from-your-global-site-packages would be a good alternative solution? 

Thanks!

I would recommend a `requirements.txt` and using `uv pip install -r /path/to/seed-requirements.txt`, potentially as a shell alias that combines `uv venv` and installation.

There's a separate (unfortunately very complex) bug that uv currently can't read the inherited site packages.

Creating a shell alias/function seems unnecessarily complicated. But thanks for the feedback!
