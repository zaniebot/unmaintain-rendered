# Error parsing pyproject.toml with emoji 😮

---

_Issue opened by @iwanbolzern on 2025-01-09 09:00_

uv fails to parse the following pyproject.toml on Windows. The problem seems to be 🔍 in the description:

```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8d in position 181: character maps to <undefined>
```

pyproject.toml:
```toml
[project]

It looks like this is an error in a python tool, probably hatchling or uv-dynamic-versioning, `UnicodeDecodeError` is a python error not a rust error.

True, my bad. It seems the issue comes from hatchling.
