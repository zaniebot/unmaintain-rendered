# `alias` Attribute Not Displayed in CLI

---

_Issue opened by @xosnrdev on 2025-01-16 05:32_

**Description:**  
Using the `alias` attribute for a command does not make the alias visible in the CLI help output. Replacing it with `visible_alias` displays the alias correctly.

NB: If this is intentional or already addressed, feel free to close the issue.

**Example:**  
With `alias`:  

```rust
#[command(alias = "ls")]
List(PipListArgs),
```

CLI Output:  

```bash
Usage: uv pip [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list       List, in tabular format, packages installed in an environment
```

With `visible_alias`:  

```rust
#[command(visible_alias = "ls")]
List(PipListArgs),
```

CLI Output:  

```bash
Usage: uv pip [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list       List, in tabular format, packages installed in an environment [aliases: ls]
```

**Expected Behavior:**  
Aliases should appear in the CLI help output when using `alias`, or the distinction between `alias` and `visible_alias` should be clarified.  

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Add a command with `alias`.  
2. Add a command with `visible_alias`.  
3. Run the CLI help command and compare outputs.

This is good to know! I'm not sure we want to show the aliases in the output in most cases. We're tight on space as-is.
