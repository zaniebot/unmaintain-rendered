# Support an alternative means of specifying python version except .python-version

---

_Issue opened by @trondhindenes on 2025-07-01 14:04_

### Summary

Placing a .python-version file in a folder can have unwanted consequences, as it will be read by tools like pyenv. It would be good if uv had its own way of specifying the python version that would not have a risk of affecting other tools' behavior, such as a ".uv-python", a "uv" section in pyproject.toml or something. 

### Example

_No response_

I think this can feasibly be merged into https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4970, which covers adding some kind of `tool.uv.python-version`.
