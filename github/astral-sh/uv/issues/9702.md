# Package Installation problem after deleted cache folder

---

_Issue opened by @HyperUpscale on 2024-12-07 10:18_

I deleted the cache folder ~\.cache\uv so no normal isnatllations of packages could have been done normally.

with": uv pip install langflow --no-cache-dir" is working ... but not all packages worked

Tried 'uv cache clean' - didnt really make a difference 

So I just removed it 
'rm ~/.local/bin/uv ~/.local/bin/uvx'

and reinstalled it:

'curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh'

that seems to fix it.

Closing due to lack of follow-up.
