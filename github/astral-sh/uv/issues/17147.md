# uv tool installs alpha versions

---

_Issue opened by @willmcgugan on 2025-12-16 13:54_

### Summary

Hello,

I've observed that `uv tool` installs tools from alpha versions of the package.

My understanding is that installing a *package* will ignore alpha versions if not explicitly requested. I would expect similar behavior from `uv tool`. This would allow for testing apps before they are ready for general consumption.

I haven't actually published any non-alpha version of this particular package. I would expect `uv tool` to fail in that case, with a standard error message

### Platform

macDarwin Wills-MacBook-Pro.local 25.1.0

### Version

uv 0.9.15 (5eafae332 2025-12-02)

### Python version

Python 3.13.0

We explicitly allow pre-releases if there are no stable versions available.

This is a special rule in the default if-necessary-or-explicit strategy (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#prerelease): If there a no stable releases, use the latest unstable release. This avoid `uv tool install` from failing when it's clear that the users want the unstable version. This rule was initially inspired by black, which was publishing only prereleases for some time, where users still wanted to install and use black anyway.

Why do you think we should fail in that case?

This is briefly discussed in https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/#pre-release-compatibility

Its the same use case of allowing an app to be installed for a small group of users for testing. Granted, if nobody knows there is something to be installed there at all, then its not likely to be stumbled upon. But this does offer a little protection.

Additionally, by requiring the alpha version, you force the dev to know which version they are testing. An annoyance of testing alphas is that new versions aren't always ready immediately. If you do `uv tool install foo`, you might not get the most recent version until tens of minutes later. I assume caching issues somewhere. And if you aren't paying attention you can be testing an older version.

I would certainly prefer the case of no non-alpha releases not being a special case. But understood if that behavior is documented and depended on.

If is possible for a project to declare that it prohibits tool installs of alpha versions, I would appreciate that. But I wouldn't advocate strongly for it. Feel free to close this issue otherwise...

Usually the gating is that people need to request `foo` specifically in `uv tool install foo`, at least I'm not aware of specific instances when excluding alpha packages would have prevented a specific problem. Once you made the first non-dev release, people won't be upgraded to pre-releases automatically.

You can use `--refresh` to avoid the default 10min PyPI caching. This is independent of the pre-release handling, it applies to fetching from PyPI more broadly.

You can also use `uv tool install foo@latest` which includes a refresh.
