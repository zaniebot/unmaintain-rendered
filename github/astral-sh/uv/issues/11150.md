Sorry this does not meet our standards for a bug report. Please see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9452 and update this with the requested information.

It's possible it's just that you're using `uv env` instead of `uv venv`? e.g.

```
❯ uv env
error: unrecognized subcommand 'env'

  tip: a similar subcommand exists: 'venv'

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
❯ echo $?  # Show the last exit code
2
```
