# requirements found in extra index urls hosted in private s3 buckets backed by cloudfront fail to get downloaded

---

_Issue opened by @Ryang20718 on 2025-06-16 07:29_

### Summary

uv works with the following

```

--extra-index-url https://<private pypi registry>/index/simple/

https://<private pypi registry>/files/tensorrt_cu12-10.7.0.post1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
```

but not the following as it tries to download from an s3 bucket and fails with 403 errors.

```

--extra-index-url https://<private pypi registry>/index/simple/

tensorrt_cu12==10.7.0.post1
```

This works with pip install.

### Example

_No response_

You would need either need `--index-strategy unsafe-first-match`, or to ignore 403 errors from your private PyPI: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#ignoring-error-codes-when-searching-across-indexes. Erroring here is highly intentional; it's a security risk to fall through like that.
