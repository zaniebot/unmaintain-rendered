# `uv pip install` should support remote `pyproject.toml` files

---

_Issue opened by @gboeing on 2025-08-25 04:02_

### Summary

uv pip installing a remote pyproject.toml file via URL is broken, even though installing it locally works fine, as does installing a requirements.txt file either locally or via equivalent remote URL. For example:

If I uv pip install a URL of a remote requirements.txt file it works fine:
```
!uv pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gboeing/osmnx/refs/tags/v1.4.0/requirements.txt
```
As does uv pip installing that same file locally:
```
!uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And I can uv pip install a pyproject.toml file locally:
```
!uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```
*But installing that same file via a remote URL is broken:*
```
!uv pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gboeing/osmnx/refs/tags/v2.0.6/pyproject.toml
```
> error: File not found: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gboeing/osmnx/refs/tags/v2.0.6/pyproject.toml`

I've tested this with multiple URLs on Mac and Ubuntu with uv 0.8.13 and Python 3.13, with the same result.

### Platform

Mac, Ubuntu, and Colab

### Version

0.8.13

### Python version

3.13

I can confirm that we've only implemented the (recursive) remote fetching for `requirements.txt`, and it's missing for all other dependency types.

Doesn't this sometimes require running code in the target project, e.g. if the project has dynamic metadata (or am I misremembering)?

Would this be different from a requirements.txt file with a `.` or `-e .` in it? Intuitively, I see roughly the same feature set for both. I think it's find to reject dynamic metadata for `pyproject.toml`s from a URL and ask the user to use a git dependency instead.

@konstin I agree. As a user, if this works:
```
curl -o pyproject.toml https://example.com/pyproject.toml && uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```
then I would expect this to work too:
```
uv pip install -r https://example.com/pyproject.toml
```

A use case for this, which several of my colleagues and I have run into: for a university course we teach, we might have a Github repo with lots of Jupyter notebooks + a pyproject.toml to define course-wide dependencies. Currently, to run one of these notebooks on Colab, we need a cell at the top like:
```
curl -o pyproject.toml https://github.com/user/repo/pyproject.toml && uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```
Kinda janky. It seems much more elegant to be able to use `uv` directly like:
```
uv pip install -r https://github.com/user/repo/pyproject.toml
```
