# Termux cannot install from git+https url

---

_Issue opened by @joshcangit on 2024-12-16 03:45_

I've tried looking through other similar issues but nothing helps.
I was running this but it failed.
```
> uv tool install git+https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole@master
Updating https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole (master)          error: Git operation failed
  Caused by: process didn't exit successfully: `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/git clone --local /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.cache/uv/git-v0/db/2043889750043101 /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.cache/uv/git-v0/checkouts/2043889750043101/495e7f7` (exit status: 128)

fatal: failed to create link '/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.cache/uv/git-v0/checkouts/2043889750043101/495e7f7/.git/objects/pack/pack-9ae9c0ddf43ca373f2d8c75fa49fe4bc5bc3b6f1.pack': Permission denied
```

Even when I clone and copy the folder directly it still failed.
Likely can't work with single-user only system.

Sorry, I have no idea. Are you on Termux?

Yes, I am using Termux.
It always has some permissions issue with certain files under `.git/` that can sometimes be a problem.

Can this be reproduced in a container or something?
