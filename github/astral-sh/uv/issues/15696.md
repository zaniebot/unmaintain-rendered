# Cannot install uv when HTTPS_PROXY is set on Windows

---

_Issue opened by @fakerms on 2025-09-05 08:34_

### Summary

I use below command:
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

`irm` can use proxy with -Proxy command, but `install.ps1` does not recognize the HTTPS_PROXY env. 

### Platform

Win11

### Version

install issue

### Python version

install issue
