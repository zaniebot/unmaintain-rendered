# Add examples of uv projects

---

_Issue opened by @IsakEd on 2024-09-13 07:08_

While the current documentation provides some examples of, for example, workspace layouts, there are some subtleties and questions that arise regarding intra-package dependencies and possible build configurations. To better understand best practices and to make more informed architectural decisions, it would be very helpful to have access to some more concrete examples and references.

Could you please consider adding more detailed examples of workspace structures to the documentation? Or just adding some links to open-source projects that you feel are using uv in the way it was intended.
