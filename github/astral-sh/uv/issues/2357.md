# `requirements-txt` should respect our `Reqwest` middleware

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-03-11 14:18_

I changed this in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/2350 to make the client lazily initiated due to a significant performance regression for no-op-like invocations. However, if we add more middleware, we want to make sure it's respected. It needs to be lazy.
