# Docs navigation displays "Index" instead of page name in nested nav structure

---

_Issue opened by @FlaviusRaducu on 2025-10-20 22:43_

# Description

While I was reading trough [the docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/), I noticed that some next page navigation buttons were missing the page title and defaulting to "Index".  Please see a few examples below:

**Example 1**
<img width="1920" height="1007" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feec7419-6e52-43b7-89ae-e685acb58a37" />

**Example 2**
<img width="1920" height="1007" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1902885-6a97-4ff4-b682-ca47dee97071" />

# How to fix

I'm not familiar with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) but the issue seems to be with the `mkdocs.template.yml` file; example [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/e0fe38eabbf97dfb84e1aa6c27b4c7a01f540cb3/mkdocs.template.yml#L174). I think we could do something along the lines to fix these issues:
```YAML
 - Guides:
      - Guides overview: guides/index.md
      - Installing Python: guides/install-python.md
```
