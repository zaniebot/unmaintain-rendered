# Editable '-e.' w/o space works in pip, fails in uv

---

_Issue opened by @jensens on 2024-02-27 09:14_

I have a `requirement.txt` like so
```
-c constraints.txt
-e.[test]
``` 
which works with  `pip install -r requirements.txt`, but `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` fails with `error: Expected '=' or whitespace, found Some('.') in `requirements-mxdev.txt` at position 282`
(side quest: why in 282, does it concat the constraints and forgets about the real line number?)

if I change the `requirements.txt` to contain a space after the dot it works
```
-c constraints.txt
-e .[test]
```

The parser doesn't have the mapping back to line numbers implemented: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2012

@konstin - Is this allowed in the grammar, or it "just works"? It seems strange to me.

The requirements.txt doesn't have a grammar, it is effectively pip cli arguments written to a file; The most comprehensive docs we have is https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/. At least all official examples i've seen use a space. I would prefer enforcing the space after `-e` for clarity.

Yeah, I agree.

I just stumbled over it and since it works in pip I reported this. I have no idea how close you plan to have compatibility with pip. It is good to have a clear syntax, so enforcing a space makes sense. 

Anyway, I would at least add a short section to the docs with those things that are meant to possibly break.

Yes, we definitely want to track those differences.

Closing in favor of #2023.
