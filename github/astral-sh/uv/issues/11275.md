# `uv sync` not working when running through ssh on windows

---

_Issue opened by @Chiggy-Playz on 2025-02-06 08:33_

### Summary

I have 2 devices, pc and laptop. PC is the ssh host, and I'm connecting to my pc using laptop. After connecting, I cd to my project's directory, and run `uv sync` but I get the following error:
``error: failed to open file ` C:\Users\Chiggy\AppData\Roaming\uv\uv.toml`: The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. (os error 123)``

Here's the contents of my config file:
```toml
link-mode = "symlink"
cache-dir = "E:/uv"
```

And if I run the same command on my pc manually, it works just fine syncing the packages. 
I think this might be a side effect of ssh and how paths are expanded? since there is a space before the path in the file above where it says "Failed to open". 

### Platform

Windows 11

### Version

uv 0.5.27 (73e9928d4 2025-02-03)

### Python version

Python 3.11.4

Do you have any specific configuration, such as setting the home directory manually, or an `XDG_` variable?
