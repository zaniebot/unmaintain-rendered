# Add .ruff_cache to .gitignore skeleton

---

_Issue opened by @butchergraters0e on 2025-10-11 10:32_

### Summary

Hi! Uv has been awesome and when paired with ruff it's a powerhouse, but I've had that ``.ruff_cache`` folder being tracked by the vcs (not any content inside of it because it has a sub ``.gitignore`` file) a bit too often and I think it would be a great default for uv to include cache folders and other files not meant to be version controlled by any astral tool including from ruff in the default generated root ``.gitignore`` skeleton to prevent tracking altogether.

### Example

How did the folder get tracked? Git only tracks files, so directories should be ignored.
