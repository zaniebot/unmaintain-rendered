# `.python-version` with a directory is not resolved relative to the version file

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-01-12 21:56_

> The parent directory has that .python-version file (which I'm assuming tells uv add to add packages to the correct virtual env). I did try to add a version file to subdirectories to see if it'd allow me to run uv run within child folders
> 
> Ah this sounds like a possible bug where we don't resolve the directory relative to the `.python-version` file, e.g.,
> 
> ```
> ❯ uv venv foo
> ❯ uv python pin foo
> Updated `.python-version` from `3.12` -> `foo`
> ❯ uv python find
> /Users/zb/workspace/uv/example/foo/bin/python3
> ❯ mkdir bar
> ❯ cd bar
> ❯ uv python find
> error: No interpreter found for executable name `foo` in virtual environments, managed installations, or search path
> ```

I also just ran into this bug. My motivation for using a relative path in ` .python-version` is to have a custom conda-based Python environment as a base, since python-builld-standalone python environments are not yet an option for us due to compliance reasons.

Just as you described, it works fine when running uv from the root directory but breaks when running from any child directory.

Regarding the recent development around https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12605 I assume this issue won't be addressed anymore, right?

Thanks for the ping. I actually didn't drop path support as part of that change, but we probably should? I'm not sure.
