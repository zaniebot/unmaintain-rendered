# Caching does not consider URLs (or redirects)

---

_Issue opened by @danielpanteleit on 2025-07-10 08:13_

### Summary

I am using DevPI and noticed missing caching in uv when changing indices, even though the relevant file is served on the same URL and redirects to the same PyPI URL (using the undocumented `mirror_use_external_urls` configuration in DevPI).

You can see below that both indices refer to the same download URL `https://devpi.example.com/root/pypi/+f/436/4d3a37c449f1c/mysql_connector_python-9.3.0-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl` (note: I changed the server domain) which redirects to `https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/18/12/7ccbc678a130df0f751596b37eddb98b2e40930d0ebc9ee41965ffbf0b92/mysql_connector_python-9.3.0-cp313-cp313-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl`.

After that the cache is twice as large as before (~180 MB instead of ~90 MB). So it was downloaded twice and cached twice. Since both indices refer to the same download URL I would expect the first cached version to be reused. In pip this works and it seems to cache the redirection too, but I'm not sure:

From the logs, itt looks like we aren't use the redirect target for the cache entry. I'm not sure if this is intentional, @charliermarsh may know.

We don't cache registry wheels based on the URL at all. Instead, we cache based on (index URL), (package name), (version). Since these are served from different registries, they're treated as separate cache entities. I think the right fix here is to use content-addressed caching for wheels, which we're tracking elsewhere.

Going to merge into #13995.
