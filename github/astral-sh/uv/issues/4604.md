# No error when version specifier doesn't match requirement source

---

_Issue opened by @ibraheemdev on 2024-06-27 22:08_

Similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4603, we should verify the version of a source matches the specifier. For example,
```toml
dependencies = [
    "uv-public-pypackage==0.0.2",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
uv-public-pypackage = { git = "https://github.com/astral-test/uv-public-pypackage", tag = "0.0.1" }
```

Alternatively we shouldn't allow version specifiers there at all.

I added test coverage to at least codify the existing behavior in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/6051.

I think I'll close this as "intentional".
