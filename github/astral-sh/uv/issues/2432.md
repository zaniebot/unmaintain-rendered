# --native-tls has no effect with uv venv --seed

_Issue opened by @jtanx on 2024-03-13 22:33_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

I think this is some sort of regression in the latest version - issuing 

```
uv venv --seed --native-tls .venv
```

With a custom index leads to an Unknown issuer error but if I don't seed it and issue uv pip install on that venv with native tls that works
