# Bitdefender is detecting UV as malware

---

_Issue opened by @wanderleihuttel on 2025-05-20 10:24_

### Summary

Hi everyone

My Bitdefender is detecting UV as malware (Heur.BZC.PYV.Boxter.341.275A94CF). Is this correct or is it a bug? How can I fix this?
I noticed that UV disappeared from my computer, so I tried to install it again and saw the notification in the Bitdefender console.

This happen when I run powershell script:
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

### Platform

Windows 11 x64 24H2 build 26100.4061

### Version

uv latest version  0.7.6

### Python version

_No response_

This is false positive in bitdefender, antivirus software sometimes detects normal programs as malicious, there's unfortunately nothing we can do on the uv side about it.

@konstin Hi! I've seen a few of these AV false-positive type issues filed against uv - would having an FAQ that linked to the top N providers "how to report a false positive" pages help?

e.g. for Bitdefender that appears to be:
https://www.bitdefender.com/business/support/en/77209-343054-resolving-legitimate-applications-detected-as-threats-by-bitdefender.html

Also, when I was working for Mozilla, iirc they used to automatically submit new Firefox release binaries to some AV vendors at time of release to help reduce false positives. (Though this was quite a few years ago, so I'm fuzzy on the exact details.)

An initial DDG search turned up a few resources for this - eg:
https://github.com/yaronelh/False-Positive-Center
(this may or may not be the best resource; just an example :-) )

I opened a complaint with Bitdefender as @edmorley suggested and it seems they resolved it!

@edmorley Thanks for the links! False positives are rare enough that they don't need to be part of the uv docs right now.
