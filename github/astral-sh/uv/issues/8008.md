# Problem upgrading to Python 3.13

---

_Issue opened by @Odud on 2024-10-08 16:40_

I have two alternative versions of python installed as shown below. Both were built from source, but I doubt that's relevant.

```
update-alternatives --display python
python - auto mode
  link best version is /usr/local/bin/python3.13
  link currently points to /usr/local/bin/python3.13
  link python is /usr/bin/python
/usr/local/bin/python3.12 - priority 1
/usr/local/bin/python3.13 - priority 2
```

I created a new project and uv installs version 3.13 in the venv

```
mkdir pytest
test@Pi5 ~ $ cd pytest
test@Pi5 ~/pytest $ uv init
Initialized project `pytest`
test@Pi5 ~/pytest $ uv run python
Using Python 3.13.0 interpreter at: /usr/local/bin/python3.13
Creating virtualenv at: .venv
   Built pytest @ file:///home/test/pytest
Installed 1 package in 0.51ms
Python 3.13.0 (main, Oct  8 2024, 09:19:25) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> exit
```

An old existing project installed version 3.12 as expected as that was the latest version at the time

```
cd albatross/
test@Pi5 ~/albatross $ uv run python
Python 3.12.5 (main, Aug 25 2024, 12:01:22) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> exit()
```

I'm having a problem upgrading this environment to 3.13. uv can see the later version:

```
~/albatross $ uv python list
cpython-3.13.0-linux-aarch64-gnu     /usr/local/bin/python3.13
cpython-3.13.0-linux-aarch64-gnu     /usr/bin/python -> /etc/alternatives/python
cpython-3.13.0-linux-aarch64-gnu     /bin/python -> /etc/alternatives/python
cpython-3.12.5-linux-aarch64-gnu     /usr/local/bin/python3.12
cpython-3.12.5-linux-aarch64-gnu     <download available>
cpython-3.11.9-linux-aarch64-gnu     <download available>

```

I assumed that install was the way to go:

```
~/albatross $ uv python install 3.13
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.13
error: No download found for request: cpython-3.13-linux-aarch64-gnu
```

I thought perhaps it was necessary to uninstall 3.12 before installing 3.13:

```
~/albatross $ uv python uninstall 3.12
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.12
No existing installations found for: Python 3.12
No Python installations found matching the requests
```

An earlier issue #7325 suggested  that the --reinstall option could be a solution

```
~/albatross $ uv python install --reinstall 3.13
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.13
error: No download found for request: cpython-3.13-linux-aarch64-gnu
```

**So I'm looking for further help/guidance TIA**

Regarding the failed `install` command; are you on the latest version of uv?

Regarding the behavior in `albatross`, do you have a `.python-version` file pinning the version to 3.12? Does it have a `requires-python` in the `pyproject.toml` with a minimum version of 3.12?

I was on 0.3.2, and have just updated to 0.4.19. There is no `.python-version` file present and in `pyproject.toml` I have `requires-python = ">=3.12"`

```
 ~/albatross $ uv self update
info: Checking for updates...
success: Upgraded uv to v0.4.19! https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.4.19
```

install now seems to work

```
~/albatross $ uv python install 3.13
Searching for Python versions matching: Python 3.13
Installed Python 3.13.0rc3 in 1.61s
 + cpython-3.13.0rc3-linux-aarch64-gnu
```

Which all looks good, but `uv run python` is still launching 3.12

``` 
 ~/albatross $ uv run python
Python 3.12.5 (main, Aug 25 2024, 12:01:22) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

```

As an experiment I edited `pyproject.toml' to `requires-python >=3.13`

'uv run python' now tries to launch 3.13 but I am getting problems compiling the dependencies - I'll see if I can eliminate these for the moment

We'll use the first compatible version we find for your `requires-python` range. You can use `uv python pin 3.13` in the project if you want to change the default.

Thanks, that makes sense. I guess just updating requires-python>=3.15 will
have the same effect?

Roughly yes, though one changes your required Python version (which can affect consumers of your package) and the other just changes the version you use locally by default.
