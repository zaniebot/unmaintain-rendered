# Consider choosing lowest-matching versions

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-10-19 21:16_

This would also make our tests reproducible in perpetuity

I don't understand why you would want this? Wouldn't it mean you don't get bug fixes without bumping your lower bounds?

I believe that Go does this, and they wrote about it a bunch when making this decision: https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs. It's somewhat interesting.

pnpm also did this but then rolled it back because people were angry: https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/6463

Hm thanks for the links. It would disturb me for this to be the default behavior; it would definitely hurt adoption. The _option_ seems great.

I think it's the kind of thing that is actually slightly more sensible than it might appear on first glance, but certainly not worth going to bat for, especially as a default.

Gonna add this as a setting, I think it's neat.

I absolutely want to have -Z minimal-versions in CI!
