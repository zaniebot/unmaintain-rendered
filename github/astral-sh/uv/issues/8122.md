# support scripts defined in `pyproject.toml`

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2024-10-11 05:09_

pdm supports a `scripts` section in `pyproject.toml` where you can define scripts specific top your project that can be called from the command line [or from vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GabDug.pdm). npm has the same thing in `package.json`.

it would be nice if uv supported this too, perhaps under `[tool.uv.scripts]`
