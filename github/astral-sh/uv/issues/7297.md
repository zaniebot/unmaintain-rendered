# uv run equivalent to python -m

---

_Issue opened by @johnkangw on 2024-09-11 16:24_

Is it possible to add a flag to `uv run` to make it equivalent to what happens when we run `python -m`.  When running pytest using `uv run` it does not work because I have some relative imports I am using in some of the testing files. It works when I use a `python -m` command.
