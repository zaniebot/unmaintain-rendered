# Docs request: showing tests folders in Workspaces layouts page

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2024-08-27 19:42_

I am using `uv==0.3.5` and am looking at adopting Workspaces.

This request is, can we show where tests should go in the workspace layout guides: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/#workspace-layouts

Please document for both root package with helpers (what I am using) and also flat workspace. Thank you in advance 🙏

Also, can you show where to put a `docs/` and `py.typed` files 🤓
