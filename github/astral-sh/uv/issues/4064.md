# Feature Request: Allow `--no-binary` for `uv pip compile`

---

_Issue opened by @notatallshaw-gts on 2024-06-05 19:24_

This request is based on my use case here https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4063

Basically. I want to "allow list" sdists for a small number of packages for `uv pip compile`, the request in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4063 suggests to be able to use `--no-binary` to do this, but `--no-binary` isn't currently supported by `uv pip compile`.

If a different solution or method is suggested for this use case, then this request is defunct.

Now https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/4063 was accepted and implemented, I am requesting `--no-binary` be added to `uv pip compile`

Should be a straight-forward change to copy it over.

Yeah we can add this.
