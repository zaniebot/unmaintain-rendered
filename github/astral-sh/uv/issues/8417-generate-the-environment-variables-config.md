# Generate the "Environment variables" config document from code

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-10-21 16:07_

We now define all environment variables in `crates/uv-static/src/env_vars.rs` and should generate the `docs/configuration/environment.md` file from the doc comments instead of writing the document manually.
