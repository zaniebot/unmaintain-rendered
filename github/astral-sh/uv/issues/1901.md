e.g.

```
❯ uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

      And because torch==0.1.6.post17 is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI and

      And because torch==0.4.0 is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI and torch==0.4.1
      is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI, we can conclude that torch<1.11.0 cannot
      be used.
      And because torch==1.11.0 is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI and torch==1.12.0
      is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI, we can conclude that torch<1.12.1 cannot

      And because torch==1.12.1 is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI and torch==1.13.0
      is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI, we can conclude that torch<1.13.1 cannot
      be used.
      And because torch==1.13.1 is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI and torch==2.0.0 is
      unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI, we can conclude that torch<2.0.1 cannot be used.
      And because torch==2.0.1 is unusable because no wheels are available with a matching Python ABI and you require
      torch, we can conclude that the requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

We should combine all of these incompatibilities into a single range.
