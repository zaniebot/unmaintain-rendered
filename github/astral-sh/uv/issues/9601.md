error: Failed to install cpython-3.12.7-linux-x86_64-gnu
  Caused by: Executable already exists at `/home/jon/.local/bin/python3.12` but is not managed by uv; use `--force` to replace it

Correct behavior IMHO is to pick the highest patch version within the minor version. This matches what happens when you install them one by one.

Install symlink for 3.12.6, then upgrade the symlink to 3.12.7
```
$ uv python uninstall --all
Searching for Python installations
No Python installations found
$ uv python install --preview 3.12.6
Installed Python 3.12.6 in 4.01s
 + cpython-3.12.6-linux-x86_64-gnu (python3.12)
$ uv python install --preview 3.12.7
Installed Python 3.12.7 in 3.91s
 + cpython-3.12.7-linux-x86_64-gnu (python3.12)
```

Install symlink for 3.12.7, then keep it when installing 3.12.6
```
$ uv python uninstall --all
Searching for Python installations
Uninstalled 2 versions in 58ms
 - cpython-3.12.6-linux-x86_64-gnu
 - cpython-3.12.7-linux-x86_64-gnu (python3.12)
$ uv python install --preview 3.12.7
Installed Python 3.12.7 in 3.69s
 + cpython-3.12.7-linux-x86_64-gnu (python3.12)
$ uv python install --preview 3.12.6
Installed Python 3.12.6 in 3.64s
 + cpython-3.12.6-linux-x86_64-gnu
```
