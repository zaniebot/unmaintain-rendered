# Versioned documentation

---

_Issue opened by @nikhil-roots on 2024-11-14 21:13_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

UV is being updated constantly. It would be great to be able to view documentations for previous versions of UV. Right now https://docs.astral.sh/uv/ only points to the latest version, and there isn't a dropdown or a version selector that one can use to view docs for previous versions.

We're interested, it's just a fair bit of work to setup.
