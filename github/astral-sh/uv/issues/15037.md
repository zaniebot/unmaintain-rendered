# `extra-build-dependencies` don't respect index pinning

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2025-08-03 00:49_

It looks like we convert from `uv_distribution_types::Requirement` _back_ to `uv_pep508::Requirement`, which is lossy. We lose the ability to pin to specific indexes, for example.

I think that also means we need separate types for lowered vs. not-yet-lowered wrappers.
