# How to specify different sources for a package depending on the linux distribution version

---

_Issue opened by @mscheltienne on 2025-01-23 16:37_

### Question

I am facing an annoying problem with `wxPython` which provides wheels per linux distribution version: https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/

I'm only interested in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and I am looking for a way to specify which one `uv` should pick-up. Currently, I have this source:

```
[tool.uv.sources]
wxPython = {marker = "sys_platform == 'linux'", url = "https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-22.04/wxPython-4.2.2-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl"}
```

But as PEP 508 markers don't allow differentiation between distribution version, I don't know how I could differentiate between them.
I'm not finding any documentation or information about using environment variables as markers or to expand environment variables within `pyproject.toml` to e.g. do `url = "https://extras.wxpython.org/.../ubuntu-${MY_UBUNTU_VERSION}/wxPython-4.2.2-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl"`, would you have any suggestion on how I could solve this use case?

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS / 24.04 LTS

### Version

0.5.15

You should take a look at the `platform.release()` and `platform.version()` markers in those environments: https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#environment-markers

I did, neither contain the information I was looking for. 

```
In [1]: import platform

In [2]: platform.release()
Out[2]: '6.8.0-51-generic'

In [3]: platform.version()
Out[3]: '#52-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu Dec  5 13:09:44 UTC 2024'
```

Unfortunately the PEP 508 markers are all you have access to, so if the difference you want isn't captured in there, you won't be able to declare divergent dependencies.
