# `requirements.txt` allows editable paths to be quoted

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-15 19:20_

It seems like `requirements.txt` allows you to put editable paths in quotes (single or double). It does _not_ allow quotes elsewhere though:

```
# Ok
-e "./scripts/packages/black_editable"

# Not ok
"./scripts/packages/black_editable"
black @ "./scripts/packages/black_editable"
```

Low-priority, maybe we fix if it comes up.

I was poking into this and found some related compatibility issues, which might or might not make sense for uv to address. I am documenting them here as it might be efficient to batch together the implementation for these.


**Case 1**: Pip treats options similar to shell arguments

```
-c file\ name

# pip: reads `file name`
# uv: reads `file\ name` (including forward slash)
```


**Case 2**: Pip allows splitting requirements in multiple lines by using `\`
```
httpx \
  == 0.0.1

# pip: tries to install `httpx == 0.0.1`
# uv: errors out parsing forward slash
```

**Case 3**: Pip silently ignores some options
```
httpx == 0.0.1 -r ./requirement.txt

# pip: installs httpx and silently ignores `requirement.txt`
# uv: parsing error. (I feel this is the right thing to do here over maintaining compatibility)
```






**Pip's behaviour**

1. Read file content
2. Join lines depending on if they end with a forward slash
3. Strip out comments (both inline and independent)
4. replace environment variables
5. For each line
	a. split line by the first occurrence of ` -`
	b. The first part is treated as requirement definition and second part is treated as options (editable, constraints etc.).
    c. The first part (requirements) goes through a dedicated parser to split version, name, extras etc.
    d. The second part (options) is parsed by treating them similar to POSIX shell arguments.

If the path of the editable package contains spaces, then `pip` requires to put the path into quotes.

```
# Works in pip, but not in uv
-e "./scripts/packages/subdir with spaces/black_editable"
-e "./scripts/packages/pkg with spaces"


# Works in uv, but not in pip (pip cannot find the path, because it stops at the first space)
-e ./scripts/packages/subdir with spaces/black_editable
-e ./scripts/packages/pkg with spaces
```

Since `requirements.txt` supports using quotes and requires it for tools like `pip`, `uv` should do the same to ensure compatibility.
