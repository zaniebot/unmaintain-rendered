# "uv pip install" not installing packages from workspace/path sources

---

_Issue opened by @djcopley on 2025-03-05 21:13_

### Question

Hey everyone, I am attempting to work the uv workspaces flow into my monorepo, but I'm running into some unexpected behavior.

My `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = ["packages/package-a"]

[tool.uv.sources]
package-a = { workspace = true }
package-b = { path = "packages/package-b", editable = true }
```

When I run `uv pip install package-a` or `uv pip install package-b`, I get 

```
No solution found when resolving dependencies:
-> Because package_a was not found in the package registry and you require package_a, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

Does the `pip install` interface not consider `uv.sources` workspace or path? It seems to be considering my `{ index = "alternative" }` sources.

---

For additional context, I'm trying to integrate uv with my existing hatch environment workflow which uses uv pip install for synchronizing its virtual environment.

### Platform

Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64

### Version

uv 0.5.29

Are you looking for `uv pip install .` instead? `uv pip install <package>` doesn't read your `pyproject.toml` at all.

It seems to read it for uv configuration at the very least. It respects the configuration of `tool.uv.native-tls` and `tool.uv.index`. Alternate for `uv.toml` I'm guessing.

Yeah sorry, it will read configuration from there but not "metadata" as split in the reference https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/

Dang. I was hoping `tool.uv.sources` would just be part of the current projects configuration. Am I misunderstanding this help text generated by `uv pip install -h`?:

Yeah so like.. if you do `uv pip install <your-project>` we'll respect sources, but if you're just installing arbitrary packages, we will not.

```
❯ cat pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "example"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13.0"
dependencies = [
    "anyio>=4.8.0",
]

[tool.uv.sources]
anyio = { path = "../foo" }

❯ uv pip install .
  × Failed to build `anyio @ file:///Users/zb/workspace/uv/foo`
  ╰─▶ /Users/zb/workspace/uv/foo does not appear to be a Python project, as neither `pyproject.toml` nor `setup.py` are
      present in the directory

❯ uv pip install . --no-sources
Using Python 3.13.0 environment at: /Users/zb/workspace/uv/.venv
Resolved 4 packages in 13ms
Installed 4 packages in 3ms
 + anyio==4.8.0
 + example==0.1.0 (from file:///Users/zb/workspace/uv/example)
 + idna==3.10
 + sniffio==1.3.1
```

We could consider allowing sources to propagate to installation of standalone packages, but the `sources` table is intended to apply to direct dependencies of the current _project_ not arbitrary packages.

That makes good sense to me and thanks for the response. In my particular case, hatch environments use the `uv pip` interface with custom resolution to synchronize the environment. If it fits within the greater uv environment, I think it would be convenient if project sources were honored. Especially since you can reference workspace items in the `[dependency-groups]` table, and it would be nice for those to still work when `uv pip install --group` drops.
