# calling CLIs globally

---

_Issue opened by @zachvalenta on 2025-01-27 18:48_

### Question

If I have CLI scripts that depended on third-party packages, I will:

* add necessary deps to global user env (`python -m pip install $PKG --user`)
* put the script on `$PATH`

With that, I can call the scripts globally.

I'm trying to move one of these scripts to uv:
```sh
uv add --script qing 'send2trash'
```
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.13"
# dependencies = [
#     "send2trash",
# ]
# ///
import sys
from send2trash import send2trash
for i in sys.argv[1:]:
    try:
        send2trash(i)
    except OSError:
        print("could not find file/dir to remove")
```

I can run it with uv if it's in the same directory
```sh
$ uv run qing
```

But it seems like there's no way to run it globally without adding an alias to my `.zprofile` like `alias qing="uv run path/to/qing"`

Any way to avoid adding this alias?

I think this is roughly a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7242

Dang it, searched through tickets before opening but didn't spot that one. That ticket is indeed more or less what I'm looking for.
