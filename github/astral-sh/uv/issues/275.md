# Worker often fails on first try when there are parallel requests: The script will never generate a response

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-11-01 15:18_

The worker often fails and returns error 500 the first time we request, saying "The script will never generate a response." in the logs. Potentially zip.js is keeping internal state, which would also explain why this only happens with parallel requests.
