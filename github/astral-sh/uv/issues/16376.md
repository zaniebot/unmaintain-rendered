# Allow Script Installation as CLI Tools

---

_Issue opened by @o-murphy on 2025-10-20 13:50_

### Summary

Currently, installing a Python script as a global **CLI tool** with `uv` requires setting up a full project layout and build system — even when dealing with a simple, single-file script. This adds unnecessary complexity for lightweight utilities.

### Proposed Solution

Enable direct installation of standalone scripts as CLI tools using the [`Declaring script dependencies`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies) mechanism.

### Example Usage

#### From a local script

```bash
uv install tool myscript.py
```

#### From a remote source (e.g. GitHub / GitHub Gist)

```bash
uv install tool https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<gist-id>/raw/<file-name>.py
```

### Benefits

* Simplifies distribution and reuse of small, dependency-aware scripts.
* Reduces the need for boilerplate project setup.
* Aligns with `uv run --script` behavior, providing a consistent experience for both one-off execution and persistent installation.

### Notes

This feature would make `uv` an even more powerful replacement for tools like `pipx` when working with lightweight, single-file utilities.

👍 I think this is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7242.
