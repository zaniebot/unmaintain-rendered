# Add MSRV build to CI

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-10-22 13:11_

Similar to the job we have in Ruff: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/7dbd8f0f8e725d05cc1d15e6ef1c6cc2ed2b2090/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L226. I don't think we need to run the test suite, just confirm that uv builds.
