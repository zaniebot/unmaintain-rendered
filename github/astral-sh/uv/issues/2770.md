<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
Hello, I am trying to do `uv self update` but I get:

```console
info: Checking for updates...
error: failed to installer (status: exit status: 1)
```

I am on Ubuntu 22.04 and my `uv --version` is 0.1.26. I don't know if it could be some proxies or something with my work computer or something? Anyhow, I could not find a solution so I thought I try and ask here.

I can reproduce this on ubuntu 23.10 and in `docker run --rm -it ubuntu` after installing curl:

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.1.26/uv-installer.sh | sh
downloading uv 0.1.26 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
installing to /home/konsti/.cargo/bin
  uv
everything's installed!
$ uv self update
info: Checking for updates...
error: failed to installer (status: exit status: 1)
```

Looks to be working on macOS

```
❯ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/download/0.1.26/uv-installer.sh | sh
❯ uv version
uv 0.1.26 (7b685a815 2024-03-28)
❯ uv self update
info: Checking for updates...
success: Upgraded `uv` to v0.1.27! https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.1.27
```

It's now fixed upstream. I'll update once a new release has been cut.
