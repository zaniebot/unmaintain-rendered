# Specify installation order for some packages

---

_Issue opened by @hongquan on 2025-08-11 03:54_

### Summary

[urllib3-future](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3-future/) is meant to shadow [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/), so it provides the same import module name as `urllib3`.
My project indirectly depends on both (one via [niquests](https://pypi.org/project/niquests/), one via something I don't remember). I am happily to let `urllib3-future` overwrite `urllib3`. But because *uv* install packages in parallel, sometimes, _urllib3-future_ is installed after _urllib3_, sometimes before.

Is there any way to tell `uv` to install `urllib3-future` after `urllib3`?

### Example

_No response_

Unfortunately we support anything like that, no. The closest thing is that we now warn (IIRC) if two packages try to shadow each other. You would _probably_ need to use two separate dependency groups or extras, and install them in order.
