# i686 release build fails with LLVM out of memory error

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-03-24 15:44_

We're using a machine with 16 GB of RAM and it spuriously fails to build on release pull requests with an LLVM error. See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/actions/runs/14039048836/job/39304306163

```
   Compiling uv v0.6.10 (/home/runner/work/uv/uv/crates/uv)
rustc-LLVM ERROR: out of memory
Allocation failed
error: could not compile `uv` (bin "uv")
```

We increased to 32 GB of RAM to workaround; see https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12430/commits/ae880c6d48671fbe84d304d3f86b9666ee89ad54

The workaround does not work. The failure is because the 32bit compiler attempts to allocate more than 4GB of memory.

Also trying https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/12436/commits/7a9d9fb9af0ad48d1d9ffde462add51336964845; which uses some flags to attempt to reduce memory usage
