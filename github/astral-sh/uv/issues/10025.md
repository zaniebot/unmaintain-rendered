# sync with token-based authentication

---

_Issue opened by @zkurtz on 2024-12-19 11:04_

I can install a package from a private repo at a specific git commit [as documented](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#git-authentication) using my personal access token.

However, when a teammate then tries to spin up my project with `uv sync`, it just hangs as previously reported [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#git-authentication). This makes sense, as the `uv.lock` does not (and should not) include my access token.

Although you've clarified that you don't support *interactive* authentication, might there already be a way for a user to configure environment variables so that `uv sync` would just work?

Short of that, my current workaround for someone else to set up a venv consistent with mine is kinda ugly:
```
uv venv

# for each private repo do
uv add git+https://${TOKEN_VARIABLE}...

# now that ^^ are already installed, we can pick up all the other deps specified in `uv.lock`:
uv sync
```
