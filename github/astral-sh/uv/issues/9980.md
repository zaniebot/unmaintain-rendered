# Speed of uv-managed python

---

_Issue opened by @arogozhnikov on 2024-12-17 19:08_

Thx again for the tool. I think having uv-managed python is very convenient, and I'd be happy to have this level of control which is less independent on OS, and more straightforward than using deadsnakes.

When I benchmark speed of uv-managed python vs deadsnakes (setup: ubuntu 22.04, python 3.11) on production workload, I observed that distribution from deadsnakes is 1.5-5% faster. My observation is in line with Itamar's remarks here: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/uv-python-production/ , though he used different test setup.

I wonder if this gap can be reduced (and is this due to older glibc?)

Using older versions of build tooling is the primary difference I would presume, though I can't say for sure without trying it out. It's tough to balance the backwards compatibility goals with performance in this instance though.

Wouldn't this also be improved by https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/9788?

Probably, yes! @arogozhnikov can you test on the a distribution for a newer microarchitecture?

Should also be improved in https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/tag/20250106
