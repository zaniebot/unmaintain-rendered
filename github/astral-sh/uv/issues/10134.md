# Is it possible to use jfrog remote repository to install python

_Issue opened by @shireenrao on 2024-12-24 00:57_

Is there a way to configure where python is getting installed from? It would be great if there was a way to tell uv to use a [jfrog artifactory remote repository](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/remote-repositories) to install different versions of python similar to how one can set the index-url either in the pyproject.toml or uv.toml file for pip packages.

There is [`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#python-install-mirror)
