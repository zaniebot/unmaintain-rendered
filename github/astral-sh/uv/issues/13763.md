# uv venv creates virtual environments with broken/misconfigured pip

---

_Issue opened by @JZhou3083 on 2025-06-01 23:22_

### Summary

### Description

When creating a virtual environment with uv venv, the pip installation is either:

Missing entirely, or

Symlinked incorrectly (pointing to a global pip instead of the isolated venv pip).

This does not happen with python -m venv, which correctly configures pip inside the virtual environment.

### Steps to Reproduce


1. Create a virtual environment with uv:

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Check pip location: 

```bash
which pip
```
Observed behaviour: 
Points to a global path (e.g., ~/.local/bin/pip) 

3. Compare with python -m venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
which pip  # Correctly points to .venv/bin/pip
```

### Platform

Ubutu 22.04 subsystem on WSL2, Windows 11, 

### Version

uv 0.7.5

### Python version

Python 3.12.10

This is correct behavior! We don't include pip in the environment by default. You can run `uv venv --seed` to include pip.

Thanks for the clarification. I missed that in the documentation — my apologies for the oversight.
