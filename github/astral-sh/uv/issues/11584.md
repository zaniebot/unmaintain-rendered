Can you try adding a build system to your `pyproject.toml`? For example:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

By default, we treat projects without a build system as "virtual" such that they don't get installed in the environment; only their dependencies are included.

I added this

```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

got a new error, I did a uv sync.

```
(asr) sh1man@sh1man-ubuntu:~/PycharmProjects/asr$ api
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/sh1man/PycharmProjects/asr/.venv/bin/api", line 4, in <module>
    from src.api.run import make_app
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'
```

That looks like a problem with your project, rather than a problem with uv. How is your project structured? It's very uncommon to include `src` in the import path like that.
