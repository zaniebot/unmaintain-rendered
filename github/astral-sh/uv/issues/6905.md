# uv python list not showing pypy correctly

---

_Issue opened by @inoa-jboliveira on 2024-09-01 02:41_

Using uv 0.4.1 on Windows 11

uv python list only shows pypy 3.7, not recent versions such 3.9 and 3.10

```
$ uv python list
cpython-3.12.5-windows-x86_64-none     <download available>
cpython-3.12.4-windows-x86_64-none     C:\Python312\python.exe
cpython-3.11.9-windows-x86_64-none     AppData\Roaming\uv\data\python\cpython-3.11.9-windows-x86_64-none\python.exe
cpython-3.10.14-windows-x86_64-none    <download available>
cpython-3.9.19-windows-x86_64-none     <download available>
cpython-3.9.13-windows-x86_64-none     C:\Python39\python.exe
cpython-3.8.19-windows-x86_64-none     AppData\Roaming\uv\data\python\cpython-3.8.19-windows-x86_64-none\python.exe
pypy-3.7.13-windows-x86_64-none        <download available>

$ uv python list --all-versions | grep pypy
pypy-3.7.13-windows-x86_64-none        <download available>
pypy-3.7.12-windows-x86_64-none        <download available>
pypy-3.7.10-windows-x86_64-none        <download available>
```


At least it is able to install more recent versions, meaning it is likely just an issue with list
```
$ uv python install pypy@3.10
Searching for Python versions matching: PyPy 3.10
Installed Python 3.10.14 in 13.21s
 + pypy-3.10.14-windows-x86_64-none
```

Slightly related:
Also any pypy install fails on Windows on paths that contain non ascii characters as noted here https://github.com/pypy/pypy/issues/5000 . I will open a different issue for this
