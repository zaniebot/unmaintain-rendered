# When installing, check that the installation fits with the `.dist-info/METADATA`

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-11-13 12:20_

When installing, we should for each wheel we install check:
 * All requires dist entries are fulfilled (part of the `InstallPlan`)
 * The requires python entry matches the current python version

I expect this will catch some bugs

This will also be required for #129, since if a package is installed, we should look up its dependencies from the virtualenv so make sure they too get installed.
