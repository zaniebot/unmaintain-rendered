# Editable install of tools 

---

_Issue opened by @ollebompa on 2024-07-25 07:25_

Hi!

I have been trying `uv` out recently and it's fantastic! Thanks for the great work so far.

I'm trying to install a tool with `uv tool install` from a local directory and I would like it to install in editable mode. Is there a way to do this like you can with `pipx`, for example?  `uv tool install` (or `uv tool run`/`uvx`) does not accept an -e/--editable option it seems. 

If this is not possible to do today, I suggest it as a future feature.

I don't believe this is possible today but certainly something we can consider.

I think we should support this, yeah.
