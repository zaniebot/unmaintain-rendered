# How to make uvx prioritize local wheels from --find-links instead of PyPI?

---

_Issue opened by @pratica0044 on 2025-10-16 03:47_

### Question

I want uvx to prioritize local wheels specified with `--find-links` over PyPI ones,  
but currently PyPI versions are preferred when the same package name exists on PyPI.

Using `--no-index` works for the main package but fails to resolve dependencies from the local wheel folder.

Is there any way to make uvx prefer local wheels while still resolving other dependencies from PyPI?

### Platform

Windows 11

### Version

uv 0.9.3

You can use a `uv.toml` file like this:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "local-packages"
url = "/home/ferris/packages"
format = "flat"

[[index]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
```

Thank you! It worked perfectly when I ran:

```bash
uvx --config-file uv.toml mypkg
```
