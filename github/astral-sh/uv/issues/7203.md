# Custom task runner

---

_Issue opened by @dbrtly on 2024-09-08 23:19_

`npm run build`

npm allows developers to specify the meaning of `build` in package.json. 

This reduces/eliminates the need for a Makefile/justfile/etc. 

`uv task my_task` or `uv my_task` could execute a task defined in pyproject.toml.
