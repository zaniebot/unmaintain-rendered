# Install of pydevd_pycharm doesn't work

---

_Issue opened by @david-banon-tecnativa on 2025-06-13 10:58_

### Summary

When installin pydevd_pycharm using uv, the package doesn't work and throws an issue. However, installing with regular pip does not.

How to replicate:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/pydev_test
python -m venv /tmp/pydev_test/.pip
python -m venv /tmp/pydev_test/.uv
```
Place this file on /tmp/pydev_test/
```python
import pydevd_pycharm
pydevd_pycharm.settrace('localhost', port=12345, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)
test = "test"
print(test)
```
For pip:
```
source /tmp/pydev_test/.pip/bin/activate
pip install pydevd pydevd_pycharm
python main.py
```
For UV:
```
source /tmp/pydev_test/.uv/bin/activate
uv pip install pydevd pydevd_pycharm
python main.py
```

If a pydev debugger is running, pip version successfully connects to debugger.
but the uv version throws this error:
```

I can't reproduce this, for me `pip install pydevd pydevd_pycharm` also fails to `import pydevd_pycharm`. Looking at the package, I assume this is a problem with their setuptools build system.

I noticed this issue as well.
In my project I didn't make any changes to the dependencies, but when I had to update my Dockerfiles after 3.12.11 was released, this started happening, so I reverted images back to 3.12.10 and this issue persists.

Thanks for the workaround! ... **EDIT:**
**the workaround didn't work for me.**

The thing is that I tried an older version of pydevd_pycharm that I know for sure worked for me in the past, and even the latest version of pydevd_pycharm and regardless of the version, it doesn't work for me anymore.

Somehow I suspect that it'd be worth trying to downgrade uv and try again because I did also run 'uv self update' since. So I tried with uv versions 0.7.0 and 0.6.7 as well and the issue is identical. 

To be honest I'm not sure what the issue is, but I'm experiencing the same issue and it came out of nowhere.
If you need more context let me know.

Could you try clearing the cache for the package? My best guess is they are including something of the build environment in the packages, so you're now always getting the cached wheel of the broken build.

> Could you try clearing the cache for the package? My best guess is they are including something of the build environment in the packages, so you're now always getting the cached wheel of the broken build.

I tried running uv cache clean after uv sync and before installing pydevd_pycharm. Same with just pip seeded into the venv. Didn't help.
pip cache purge
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall pydevd-pycharm==252.18003.35

No matter if I use pip or uv pip or clear cache or not, it doesn't work.

I tried the --only-binary option:
uv pip install pydevd-pycharm --no-cache --reinstall --no-deps --only-binary pydevd-pycharm --python /venv

python -V : Python 3.12.10 ; which python : /venv/bin/python
Using Python 3.12.10 environment at: /venv
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because all versions of pydevd-pycharm have no usable wheels and you
      require pydevd-pycharm, we can conclude that your requirements are
      unsatisfiable.
      hint: Wheels are required for `pydevd-pycharm` because building from
      source is disabled for `pydevd-pycharm` (i.e., with `--no-build-package
      pydevd-pycharm`)

The latest version: pydevd-pycharm==252.21735.39 has the same issue.

Is there a pydevd_pycharm repo where I can open an issue?

This version of pydevd_pycharm worked for me:
pydevd-pycharm==**251.23774.444**

python version, uv version, had no effect.
