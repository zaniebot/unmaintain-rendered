# Windows trampoline that works on stable rust

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-01-26 16:02_

Our current windows launcher require nightly rust and a lot of unsafe just to avoid panics. Puffin on the other hand works on stable rust and doesn't use any unsafe. It would be great to have a stable rust mostly-safe trampoline, even if the resulting binaries are slightly larger.

@konstin - I think you linked to the wrong issue.
