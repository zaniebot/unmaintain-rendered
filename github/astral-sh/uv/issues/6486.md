# `uv add` adds a depencency even if there is a failure during installation

_Issue opened by @tjquillan on 2024-08-23 02:29_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

When running `uv add` fails to install the package, it is still added to the dependency array of `pyproject.toml` causing future invocations of `uv add` to fail as well.

# Reproduction Steps
1. Run `uv add pytorch` in a blank project
  * This will fail notifying you that `Exception: You tried to install "pytorch". The package named for PyTorch is "torch"`
 2. Observe that the `pyproject.toml` added it to the dependencies array despite this failure.
 3. When you then attempt to run `uv add torch` as instructed, it will fail in the same way as `pytorch` is now in the dependency array.

I think it _probably_ makes sense to remove the dependency here. We already remove the dependency if _resolution_ failed.
