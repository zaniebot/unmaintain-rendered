# Make hashes optional in HTML entries

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-02-16 06:15_

i'm running devpi and don't have fragments at all which results in

```
 uv pip install --extra-index-url <devpi> <package>
error: Received some unexpected HTML from <devpi>/<package>
  Caused by: Unexpected fragment (expected `#sha256=...`) on URL:
```

(not truncated, there is nothing after `URL:`)
