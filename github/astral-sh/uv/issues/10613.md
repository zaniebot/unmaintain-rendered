# `uv run --python 3.13  python` hangs and nothing happens on macOS

---

_Issue opened by @peterbe on 2025-01-14 20:06_

```
❯ uv --version
uv 0.5.18 (Homebrew 2025-01-11)

❯ uv run --python 3.13  python


...just hangs and nothing happens...
```

I know I know, this could be a user-error but the point is that it's making it very hard to figure out how to solve this. 

```
❯ uv run --python 3.12 python
Python 3.12.8 (main, Dec  6 2024, 19:42:06) [Clang 18.1.8 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

...works fine. 

Something's not right with 3.13, and I'm not desperate to use it, but I'd love it if there was a timeout or some way to gain insight into what it's getting hung up on.

What's the output of `which python`, `uv python find 3.13`, `RUST_LOG=trace uv run -v --python 3.13 python`, `uv run -v --python 3.13 which python`

From https://gist.github.com/peterbe/b4dd64b935fe3d72194f823c9cd76a48 it looks like it runs fine and doesn't hang. Am I misreading?

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-01-14 20:47_

Just fyi, we do support `uv python install --preview --default` to add `python` to your `PATH`.

Ha! Yeah.

That's different from about 40 minutes ago when I wrote this issue :)

No idea what changed in that timespan. 

It's still curious that it *did* hang without any sign of life or errors or warnings.

Close or shall we worry about that odd lack of no-feedback-hanging? ...for the sake other people coming up against the same trouble some day.

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-01-14 20:51_

I'm a bit confused about how it _could_ hang. Let's close for now but feel free to re-open if you encounter it and can get logs or a reproduction.
