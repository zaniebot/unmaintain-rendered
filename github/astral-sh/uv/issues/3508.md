# Explore using a dev drive for windows CI

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-05-10 14:40_

We observe that windows is much slower on any io operations, e.g. just downloading and unpacking the python versions takes 1.5min. We should explore using using a VHDX virtual harddisk as described in https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/752#issuecomment-1847036770 to see if this solves the performance bottleneck in github actions.

FYI there are some details here where this was reccomended for pip to do: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12055

Ultimately pip maintainers are very conservative about adding new features, but you might find the post informative.
