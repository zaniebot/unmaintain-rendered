# Add a concrete example to `required-environments` hint

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-09-18 21:08_

We say "consider adding your platform to `tool.uv.required-environments` to ensure uv resolves to a version with compatible wheels" but I don't think this is friendly enough considering how often we see this reported in the issue tracker. We should show an example of how you should configure the `required-environments`.

Hello, Can I pick this one up?


Update: 
It looked easy, so I created a merge request.
