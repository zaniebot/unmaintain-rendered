# For some python implementations uv expects a different `site-packages` path than it creates

_Issue opened by @kvelicka on 2024-03-04 12:56_

`uv` version: 0.1.13, installed from `pip`.

Below is a snippet from a `ubuntu:22.04` based docker container where I'm unable to use `uv` to install into its virtualenv. I'm installing `pip` in the log below but this doesn't seem to be related to the package being installed.

```

Thanks! This is the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/2095 but I'll keep it open since it's useful to have a concrete example.
