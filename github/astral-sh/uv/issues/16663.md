# Multiple `--with-editable` gives resolve conflict

---

_Issue opened by @tpgillam on 2025-11-10 10:39_

Using uv 0.9.8.

Suppose I have three packages, which I'll call `a`, `b` and `c`. In their respective pyproject.toml's , there is a dependency chain `c -> b -> a`.

Assume that I have local versions of each of these packages in some directory. Within `c` I can do either:

```console
$ uv run --with-editable ../b python ...
$ uv run --with-editable ../a python ...
```

and this works as expected.

However, I run into a problem if trying to use local versions of both of them simultaneously:

```console
$ uv run --with-editable ../b --with-editable ../a python ...
  × Failed to resolve dependencies for `b` (v0.1.0)
  ╰─▶ Requirements contain conflicting URLs for package `a`:
      - file:///path/to/a (editable)
      - git+https://github.com/OuOrg/a.git@shashashashasha
```

In the above, `a`, `b` and `c` are private packages within our organisation, with dependencies encoded via git SHAs. But I suspect I could construct a reproducible example using pypi packages -- let me know if this would be useful.

The `--with-editable` entries get resolved together, and `../a` does conflict with the declared Git dependency. I'm not certain how we should handle this. I think you'd need to use overrides?

The behaviour - very roughly - I expected, was something like:

1) collect a set of paths given from `--with-editable` arguments
2) each path should correspond to a particular package; so we get a set of packages
3) then when we resolve, every time we come across a package that's in this 'special set' of packages, we ignore the dependency and use the editable one

--- 

Just to justify why the behaviour above would be useful: sometimes we need to make a change in both `a` and `b` simultaneously, and then test that it has the desired impact in `c`.

We do need some better support for replacing URL dependencies with local checkouts, we lacking a notion of priorities in URL, where e.g. a CLI override URL can replace a transitive URL. See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/settings/#override-dependencies for the workaround with overrides.
