# Use relocatable virtual environments by default

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-06-12 13:38_

We should probably use relocatable virtual environments by default, instead of having users opt-in. Especially in projects.

A bit of an alternative to https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/13989, but probably not making that one useless.
