# FORCE_COLOR wins over `--color never`

_Issue opened by @aberres on 2024-10-14 11:27_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

```
❯ uv --version
uv 0.4.20 (0e1b25a53 2024-10-08)
```

The following call uses color codes. As coloring is explicitly disabled, I would expect no colors.

`FORCE_COLOR=1 uv pip compile pyproject.toml --color never`

I ran into this when converting a legacy CI pipeline to use `UV`. Piping the `uv` result into the next tool leads to funny results. Only using `-o` helps to get rid of the colors.
