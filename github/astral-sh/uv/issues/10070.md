# Add an option to not create the activate* scripts in venvs

_Issue opened by @gdamjan on 2024-12-21 03:01_

Reason: appeal to authority :D

… and there seems to be an agreeing sentiment.

I do think that activating venvs is a bad practice, and confusing too, so what I'd want to do to my personal projects is have a setting in [tool.uv] activate-scripts=true/false in `pyproject.toml` so that uv venv/sync doesn't create them, and I'd want to train my users to use `uv run`.

Additionally, I should be able to configure that in ~/.config/uv/uv.toml to force the default for projects that don't specify it in their own pyproject.toml.

Sort of compelling. I'm not sure it's a _project_ setting, i.e., it seems more like a _user_ setting? I'd be confused if some repository I cloned wouldn't let me activate the environment.

I like this personally. Took a look through the code and might try to work it in the morning (so long as my 9 month old doesn’t have other plans) Never written more than a small coding challenge in rust, but I’d permanently have this setting on so it feels like a nice quality of life bump which is good motivation to learn. If I do have the time, I’ll probably put up a draft pretty quickly in the morning to make sure I’m not entirely off base. 

Does uv have a concept of settings that are global/user only but not local/project? An example doesn’t come to mind right now. Personally, there are quite a few options I’d find odd to be set at the project level that (as far as I can tell) uv would have no problem with you configuring in pyproject.toml. My thought would be to add an override flag to `uv venv` to flip the scripts back on if a dev really wanted them in a project that choose to disable them by default.

yeah I know, I'd still want to enforce that to **my** users :D

but I'd be satisfied with just per-user setting.

@zanieb Please let me know if I'm off base with the change in that PR. Like I said, first time in a large Rust project so I won't be offended if you tell me I broke something.

Looking at adding `activatable` (default true) to the installer options for the next step. Would that make sense to you?

@zanieb @charliermarsh any chance one of y'all can take a look at this and let me know if I'm on the right track?

Draft PR is linked above and has further detail on it.

I haven't gone through developing the configuration option yet as that does seem like it will be a bigger ordeal and I wanted to make sure the first piece was viable. Also, I'm open to other names for the option if you'd prefer to avoid the `--not-` prefix. Could probably be `--activation-scripts/--no-activation-scripts` instead of `--activatable/--not-activatable`.

@nathanscain yeah we'll look at it — most of us are on vacation this week.
