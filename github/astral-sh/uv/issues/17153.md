# Is there a clean way to achieve incremental builds?

---

_Issue opened by @dograt on 2025-12-16 21:23_

### Summary

I've recently migrated to `uv`, and am almost a big fan of it. I have a C++ library that I'm binding with `scikit_build_core` and nanobind. 

Before switching to nanobind, I could run `pip install -e .` repeatedly, and get incremental builds. Now with `uv`, I get a full rebuild each time. This has dramatically slowed down development speed for myself and my team. Is there a way to change this behavior?

### Example

_No response_

Seems like enabling `no-build-isolation-package` for my package is the way to do this. Incremental builds now work with `uv sync --reinstall`, but it took some finagling.

The annoying thing is that I now need to duplicate my `[build=system] requires` entries in a my pyproject.toml's `[dependency-groups]`, under a `build` group. Is there a way to avoid this duplicativeness?

```
[dependency-groups]
# Only add build group here to build with build isolation for incremental builds, otherwise the build dependencies
# aren't ready after uv sync
build = [
    "scikit-build-core"
]
...
[build-system]
requires = [
    "scikit-build-core"
]
build-backend = "scikit_build_core.build"
```


It took a while to figure this out, since the documentation doesn't mention incremental builds, and it's not immediately obvious that turning off build isolation is the way to achieve this, nor is it obvious that `uv` doesn't automatically register the dependencies from [build-system] requires, and requires the above duplication.

Any additional context would be appreciated

I'm not familiar with how exactly scikit-build-core handles C++ caches, but e.g. with Rust, maturin uses a cache directory in the project root (`target`) to get incremental recompiles when building the package. It could also be that scikit-build-core uses a cache key that contains the temporary build environment, and then invalidates the build cache. Looking at the build logs or verbose logs of scikit-build-core should say more about this. These are on the side of the build backend (scikit-build-core), uv doesn't really have control here. I'd avoid running without build isolation, it has its own problem and should only be used when there are no other options.

Unfortunately, it seems that turning off build isolation is [the only way to achieve this.](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core/issues/1115)

Thanks for engaging with upstream, it's best if we discuss this together with them!

```
[build-system]
requires = [
    "scikit-build-core"
]
```

At least we could implement this: when `--no-build-isolation`, we install build-system.requires in current venv?
