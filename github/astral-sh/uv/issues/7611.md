# Missing libraries lead to some installed Python versions listed as not installed

---

_Issue opened by @bluthej on 2024-09-21 07:16_

## Summary

I had a missing library (`libcrypt.so.1`), which was required by some Python versions but not all (e.g. 3.7 needs it but not 3.8 or 3.9).
As a consequence, `uv python list` listed CPython 3.7.9 as not installed but available for download although I had already downloaded it with `uv python install 3.7`.

## Suggestion

This comes down to the fact that my Python 3.7 install was not functional because of the missing library, and I think that's fine that `uv` only lists working interpreters, but this led to confusing behavior from `uv` for me (see the section below). I would suggest adding some feedback for the user at some point in order to make this kind of issue clearer, for instance I can think of 2 options that I think would be nice:
- Just after downloading a Python version, immediately check that it works (like `uv venv` seems to do) and issue a warning with the error message when something goes wrong => in my case I would have known just after install that I was missing a lib
- In `uv python list`, list all Python interpreters found, but have some kind of check mark to inform the user of which ones are working and which ones aren't

## Current behavior and steps I took

I installed Python 3.7 with `uv python install 3.7` and it worked, but then when I tried using said version to create a venv with `uv venv --python 3.7`, `uv` could not find a 3.7 install.
And when I ran `uv python list` I had a line:

```shell
cpython-3.7.9-linux-x86_64-gnu        <download available>
```

So I tried to rerun `uv python install 3.7` but then it said:

```shell
Found existing installation for Python 3.7: cpython-3.7.9-linux-x86_64-gnu
```

which was kind of confusing.

After looking into `~/.local/share/uv/python` I saw the 3.7.9 install was there, so I ran `uv venv --python 3.7 -v` this time, and this is where the extra info made it all clear: I was missing `libcrypt.so.1`, which was tripping up some CPython versions, but not all (for instance 3.8 and 3.9 worked just fine). After installing `libxcrypt-compat` everything worked fine.

I think this is something that can potentially happen on all platforms but for the sake of completeness here's my setup:
- `uv 0.4.14`
- Arch Linux x86_64 (Kernel: 6.10.10-arch1-1)
