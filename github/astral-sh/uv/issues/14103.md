# `uv python install --preview` does not allow keeping existing Python launchers

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2025-06-17 10:43_

I have an existing pyenv Python launcher in `~/.local/bin` that I would like to keep. Currently, preview uv Python installs have the option of either failing, due to there already being a non-uv managed Python, or overriding the existing launcher, but it doesn't have an option to not change it.

```
$ ls -l .local/bin/python3.10
lrwxrwxrwx 1 konsti konsti 47 Apr  1  2024 .local/bin/python3.10 -> /home/konsti/.pyenv/versions/3.10.14/bin/python
```

```
$ uv python install --preview 3.10
Installed Python 3.10.18 in 1.02s
 + cpython-3.10.18-linux-x86_64-gnu
error: Failed to install cpython-3.10.18-linux-x86_64-gnu
  Caused by: Executable already exists at `/home/konsti/.local/bin/python3.10` but is not managed by uv; use `--force` to replace it
```

Hm good point, thank you! Wdyt we should do?

This feels like less of a bug and more of a feature request? though I think it should block stabilization.

Instead of an error, I'd only show a note that say that we skipped creating the link and that you can use `--force` to change that.

Hm, but what if this is in an automated context and you're using `pythonX.y` afterwards? I think you'd want an error instead of surprising behavior.

We've coupled `uv python install` to installing shims, but it's unclear whether a user wants or needs them or is just having a separate install step before using `uv run`. pyenv for example separates the install steps and the bin links steps through `pyenv global` (or in this case, requiring the user to `ln -s` themselves).

Is there a specific problem if the `pythonx.y` is a system Python that is not our managed Python?

If we want to ensure our Python is the top Python in an automated context, we also need to ensure that `which python3.x` returns our Python, and there isn't a higher Python in `PATH`.

In either case, there should be a way for a user to install a Python version without requiring to forcibly replace existing Python launchers.

For tools, we warn in this case — we should do the same for Python.

I agree with this, I'm not contesting that.
