# Docs mention example code that doesn't exist

---

_Issue opened by @hutch3232 on 2025-04-03 14:09_

https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/be3d5dfa84876c903bf98c1a76a97989c27e7247/docs/reference/cli.md?plain=1#L8822

Was hoping to see how to use the `--check-url` argument to `uv publish`.

I saw in this issue: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11836
that the `--publish-url` and the `--check-url` are different with the inclusion of `/simple`. Maybe an example could show that?

Thanks for the amazing tool!
