# Allow private server URL to be used for `uv self update` without explicit version number

---

_Issue opened by @rzuckerm on 2025-12-29 19:31_

### Summary

I would like an environment variable that I can use to force `uv self update` to use release artifacts from a private server without having to explicitly set a version in `UV_DOWNLOAD_URL`.


### Example

I have a private file server that periodically caches the certain release artifacts from public GitHub. These are stored in this structure: `<server-url>/github/<org>/<repo>/releases/downloads/<version>/<artifact>`, which mirrors the structure of public GitHub (`https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/downloads/<version>/<artifact>`).

I would like this server to be used when a user runs `uv self update` instead of public GitHub. I have tried setting these environment variables:

- `UV_INSTALLER_GHE_BASE_URL`
- `UV_INSTALLER_GITHUB_BASE_URL`

However, these environment variables are being used for GitHub APIs. Since our private file server is not a GitHub server, `uv self update` fails.
