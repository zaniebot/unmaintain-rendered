Windows defender immediately flags it as malware and quarantines/deletes https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?name=Trojan%3AScript%2FWacatac.B!ml&threatid=2147735503

Also Chrome download fails immediately:

There tends not to be much that we can do about this. It happens sporadically.

Can the binary be signed or must it be inside of the package like an MSI to be signed?

I am unsure, but cloning the repo and compiling it locally might solve the problem. Windows seems to hate anything downloaded over the internet.

It seems enough people have reported it as a false positive and it no longer is flagged. I suppose there is a very short window after every release in which this would happen.

It would be worth it to somehow postpone the PyPI release for a few hours after the GitHub release to greatly reduce the number of affected users.
