# `cache clean` -> `cache clear`

---

_Issue opened by @nschloe on 2024-02-22 14:10_

I believe the syntax

```
uv cache clean
```

is a bit misleading. This command doesn't _clean_ the cache (tidy it up), but _clears_ it (remove completely). It should be

```
uv cache clear
```

We probably used "clean" because of [the `cargo clean` command](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-clean.html), but I agree `clear` feels like it maybe makes more sense from first principles! (And Python devs won't necessarily be familiar with cargo)

Yarn and npm also use “clean”.

Precedents from some of the other Python packaging tools:
- `poetry` has a `poetry cache clear` command: https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/cli/#cache-clear
- `pdm` has a `pdm cache clear` command: https://pdm-project.org/latest/reference/cli/#clear
- `hatch` has a `hatch clean` command, but it removes all build artifacts (so does something a little different to what our `cache clean` command does, IIUC): https://hatch.pypa.io/1.9/cli/reference/#hatch-clean

It may be worth considering what we want the command to be in the long term and the brute force deleting (it does tidy it up ;)) is just the implementation behavior for now

Perhaps it makes sense to add a `clear` alias for now.

I think `clean` makes enough sense that we don't need to bikeshed alternatives. I'd prefer not to introduce aliases unless there's a strong motivation (i.e. we do this in `uv pip` when we've chosen a different name than `pip`)
