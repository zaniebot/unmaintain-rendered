# `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR` variable is removed after 0.9.0

---

_Issue opened by @birnevogel11 on 2025-10-16 16:23_

### Summary

Sorry to interrupt you. I check the env `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`. It exists in 0.8.x, but it's removed in 0.9.x

```
$ uvx --from uv==0.8.0 uv python install --help | grep mirror -A2 | head -2
      --mirror <MIRROR>
          Set the URL to use as the source for downloading Python installations [env: UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=]
```

```
$ uvx --from uv==0.9.0 uv python install --help | grep mirror -A2 | head -2
      --mirror <MIRROR>                                        Set the URL to use as the source for downloading Python installations
      --pypy-mirror <PYPY_MIRROR>                              Set the URL to use as the source for downloading PyPy installations
```

But the document still provides the env var https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_python_install_mirror.

Do you have a plan to keep it or to remove it? Thanks.

It actually is still supported, it's just no longer in the `--help`. I think we need to fix the `--help`. We have no plan to remove it.

@charliermarsh  Thanks for the quick reply. I try to use it in this situation. For example, the command works in 0.8.x but not for 0.9.x

```bash
UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=<internal-mirror-for-python-build-standalone-repo>

uv tool run -p 3.12 --from black black --help
```

Then it still tries to download from public GitHub. Can you help to check?

I'll take a look.

Above, I think you need `export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR=<internal-mirror-for-python-build-standalone-repo>`? Just confirming.

This appears to be working for me:

I did not try in this way. Thank you. Let me try to run in this way.

_Comment by @birnevogel11 on 2025-10-16 17:36_

It works with `export UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_MIRROR`. Sorry for the stupid error. I will close the ticket. Thanks for the support!
