# uv tool install not working with Git Credential Manager for private GitHub repository

---

_Issue opened by @daviewales on 2024-08-23 00:41_

**OS**: Windows 11
**command invoked**: `uv tool install git+https://git@github.com/example/private-repo.git`
**uv --version**: `uv 0.3.1 (be17d132a 2024-08-21)`

Error message:

```
error: Git operation failed
  Caused by: failed to clone into: AppData\Local\uv\git-v0\db\1ac2ec12aa800fea
  Caused by: process didn't exit successfully: `git fetch --force --update-head-ok https://git@github.com/example/private-repo.git +HEAD:refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (exit code: 128)
--- stderr
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/swsphn/github-tools.git/'
```

`pipx` is able to install this repository.
It triggers Git Credential Manager to authenticate me in the browser. (For some reason it does this multiple times, but eventually works.)

`uv tool install` appears to attempt unsupported direct password authentication, and does not trigger Git Credential Manager.

Thanks for the report. Can you use SSH credentials instead of HTTPS? Or authenticate prior to the command and use a [Git credential store](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store)? Our supported authentication schemes are discussed in the documentation: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/authentication/#git-authentication

I don't think we'll support interactive authentication anytime soon.

Thanks. I'm using [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager), which is supposed to be the best way to manage git credentials on Windows. (Windows and `ssh-agent` don't play well.) Do you call a local git binary, or do you roll your own git support? I believe (could be wrong!) that pip and pipx use the local git binary, which automatically knows to talk to Git Credential Manager.

OK.... I just tried this again, and `uv` triggered the Git Credential Manager prompt, which allowed me to authenticate in the browser. It then successfully installed the package from the private repository.

So, I guess it works after all. I'll report back if the issue occurs again.
Until that, maybe it was just a temporary glitch somewhere.
Closing for now as I can't reproduce it.
