# Adding Secondary Importable Directory To A Project

---

_Issue opened by @AyhamSaffar on 2025-03-24 01:58_

### Question

Is it possible to be able to import from the project directory as well as the package directory when using the [uv package structure](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/init/#packaged-applications)?

The use case looks something like this:

```
project_directory
├── src
│   └── package
│      ├── __init__.py
│      └── file.py
├── tests
│   └── integration_tests
│      └── test_package.py
│   └── unit_tests
│      └── test_file.py
│   └── pytest_fixtures.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

Where I have the following in my `pyproject.toml`:
```
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/package"]
```

I would ideally like to be able to include the following in both `test_package.py` and `test_file.py`:

```python
import package
from tests.pytest_fixtures import *
```

Previously, I had a flat source directory which allowed this.

```
project_directory
├── package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── file.py
...
```

With the following in the `__init__.py`

```python
from .file import my_dict
```
However MyPy and Ruff didn't seem to respect the  `__init__.py` when I tried the following in `test_file.py`:
```python
import package
package.my_dict
```

I would assume that on some level, the `package` directory is not seen as a Python library with this non-standard directory structure.

Unfortunately, relative imports like `from ..pytest_fixtures import *` dont seem to be a solution either as turning `tests` into a python module is tricky.

Any help would be really useful!

### Platform

Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64 GNU/Linux

### Version

uv 0.5.13

This seems loosely the same as https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8964 — this isn't something uv controls right now.

Turns out pytest has the [conftest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/fixtures.html#conftest-py-sharing-fixtures-across-multiple-files) workaround that solves this. Thanks for the help anyway.
