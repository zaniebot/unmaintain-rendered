# Add a `uv sync --check` flag

---

_Issue opened by @liiight on 2025-03-20 12:29_

### Summary

I would like to have the ability to check if an environment is synced without actually syncing it.
I am aware that there is currently a `--dry-run` flag and I am currently using it like so:
```shell
uv sync --dry-run | grep -qo "Would make no changes"
```
But that feels a little awkward and flaky. A proper `--check` flag that would return a relevant exit code would be great. 


### Example

```shell
uv sync --check
```

This seems reasonable to me.

(On the larger side for a first issue, but it should be pretty straight-forward)
