# UV migration environment

---

_Issue opened by @q1165600785 on 2025-03-06 14:38_

### Summary

My idea is to use UV to configure the environment and required packages in a place with a network, and then package and migrate them to a computer without a network, similar to the Conda Pack feature. Does UV have this feature

### Example

_No response_
