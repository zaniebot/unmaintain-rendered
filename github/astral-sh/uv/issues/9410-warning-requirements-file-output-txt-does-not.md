<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->


Command to reproduce the error:

```
% uv --version
uv 0.5.4 (c62c83c37 2024-11-20)

% echo '' > output.txt && echo 'scikit-learn==1.5.0' | uv pip compile --output-file output.txt -
```

Result:

```
