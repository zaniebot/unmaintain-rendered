# RISC-V64 musllinux binaries

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2025-09-29 11:00_

> I use cibuildwheel to build MarkupSafe, configured with `build-frontend = "build[uv]"`. I'm currently enabling `riscv64` builds, and cibuildwheel fails for `musllinux_riscv64` builds because uv is not available there. I've added an override to use `build` without uv there, but it would be nice if uv binaries were available for that combination.
