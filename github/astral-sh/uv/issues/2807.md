# Feedback wanted: wrapper for pixi+uv for local and containerized python

_Issue opened by @liquidcarbon on 2024-04-03 14:35_

Hello and thanks for your work!  This is a non-issue kind of issue, more of a discussion / show & tell.

Curious to learn about what's your view and vision for using [Pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) and uv together?  It seems to me like they complement each other, and belong together.  So I started a pet project.

[Pup ](https://github.com/liquidcarbon/puppy) is a single script that transparently wraps around Pixi and uv.  Think of puppy as a recipe for using Pixi and uv together (or just as their fur baby, if you're so inclined).

I've been thinking about how I want to organize my python work going forward, and the wishlist converged around the following design criteria.  Essentially, we're looking at a two-tiered environment.  The outer tier is managed by Pixi; the inner tier by uv.

- base python should be:
  - not system python
  - non-invasive, isolated from any existing python, easy to setup and tear down without leaving a trace
  - easy to swap versions (up or down as needed)
  - bring along tools needed for other languages
- environments should be
  - super easy, oneliner-easy, to create, use, modify, freeze, take down
  - reside in the same folder as the base python rather than all over
  - easily ported to other machines or containers
- the whole thing
  - should work on Linux and Windows
  - should support Conda and PyPI
  - should be easy to recreate without relying on memory or Bash history


[Here's a HuggingFace app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/liquidcarbon/pup-fileserver), built with `pup`, showing you the file structure you get.  Container base is `debian:latest`, and the python end can be constructed with the same `pup` commands you would use locally.

If you'd like to give it a try and offer feedback, it would be much appreciated!
