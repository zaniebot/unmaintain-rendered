# Treat `.whl` filenames as files rather than package names

---

_Issue opened by @senysenyseny16 on 2024-09-11 20:39_

Unable to install package inside docker, in normal environment the same package installs without problems.

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/io python:3.10 /bin/bash

pip install uv

root@2610453f5764:/io# uv pip install package_name-1.0.0.dev56+g18c683a2-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
error: Failed to parse: `package_name-1.0.0.dev56+g18c683a2-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl`
  Caused by: Expected one of `@`, `(`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `~`, `!`, `;`, found `+`
package_name-1.0.0.dev56+g18c683a2-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```

I think you need `uv pip install ./package_name-1.0.0.dev56+g18c683a2-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl`.

Thank you, it really works. But why?

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2024-09-11 20:45_

We don't consider an identifier like `package_name-1.0.0.dev56+g18c683a2-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl` to be a file name, since we avoid basing that parsing logic on the current state of the filesystem. By adding `./`, it's clearly a relative path.

We can probably improve this though.

Gonna re-open because I want to fix our logic here.
