# Fail to automatically activate the venv

_Issue opened by @ArcticOc on 2024-10-11 20:13_

Hi,

After running `uv run hello.py`, it seems that uv failed to automatically activate the venv in the current project. But uv did find this venv. Only after manually activating it using `source .venv/bin/activate` can the venv be correctly recognized.

```zsh
arc in WordCloud via v3.9.6  
➜ uv python find                                                   [ 04:53:17 ] 
/Users/arc/Research/WordCloud/.venv/bin/python3

arc in WordCloud via v3.9.6 
➜ uv run hello.py                                                  [ 04:53:21 ] 
Hello from wordcloud!

/usr/bin/python3

arc in WordCloud via v3.9.6 
➜ source .venv/bin/activate                                        [ 04:56:20 ]

/Users/arc/Research/WordCloud/.venv/bin/python3                                                                                                                           
```

This is by design -- `uv run` can't activate the environment persisntely, since it can't modify your shell. So the command you run within `uv run` has access to the environment (i.e., in `uv run hello.py`, `hello.py` has access to the environment), but subsequent commands won't.

Thanks, I get it.
