# Allow `uv init` to use `cookiecutter` and `copier` templates

---

_Issue opened by @baggiponte on 2024-07-03 07:23_

I have been using the package management `uv` features, albeit in preview. Amazing product, responsiveness and pace of development 🚀

PDM has a great feature: the `pdm init` command can take `--cookiecutter` or `--copier` optional argument to initialise a project (including scaffold) using a template [ref](https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/template/). I don't know how to reproduce that in `uv` - I don't know what template engine there is in Rust, maybe Armin's minijinja? Would be a slick feature.

Agreed. Scaffolding from community templates would be a nice (but not critical) next step. No comment on cookiecutter vs. copier vs. other.

Add perspective as an interested user, tracking this and #9754:

I think project template generation is a big win, and should be closely integrated with `uv init` to make it a natural part of the project. It could be argued that such a system already exists, it just has one trivial template. That's the UX experience, and the only thing beyond that I'm interested in *as a user* is the quality of the template library. (Aside: `uv` should take advantage of the best project template library it can find. The only one I could find is https://www.cookiecutter.io/)

That said, my developer mind keeps coming back to "tools", and the idea that every lifecycle stage (init, lint, build, test, publish) essentially has a specific tool associated with it (whether internal or external), and there are levels of mappings between those tools and build lifecycle:
- global default (what uv does out of the box)
- user defaults (in ~ somewhere)
- project settings in pyproject.toml

Having a simple way to set those mappings (edit config files, or a `uv` sub-command like `uv default build hatch` where hatch is installed by `uv tool`) would go a long way to generic tool support.
