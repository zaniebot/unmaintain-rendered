# Tracking issue: Make sure universal resolution has great error messages

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2024-07-09 10:33_

Explaining a resolution error for a failed universal resolution is more complex than for regular resolution: A error may now be constraint to a specific fork, and the derivations may only happen due to the markers and requires-python bound of this fork. We need to check, fix and add tests for conflicts in universal resolution.

@konstin: "The error messages are as good as the regular error messages, with the exception of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5046 which we should at least understand"

@BurntSushi: "One weird thing: the dependency relationship between `a==1` and `a==1{marker}` is exposed in the error messages themselves. If you know that, and you read the error message, it makes sense." (Let's create a separate issue for this.)
