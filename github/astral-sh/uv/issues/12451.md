# allow multiple installations of a tool with different names in the bin folder

---

_Issue opened by @jabbera on 2025-03-24 20:18_

### Summary

When installing a tool I'd like to be able install multiple versions at the same time and to control the target name of the link created in the bin folder IE:

uv tool install tox # creates: ${UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR}/tox
uv tool install tox --with tox-uv --target-bin-name tox-uv # creates {UV_TOOL_BIN_DIR}/tox-uv. tox command doesn't not have the tox-uv plugin

### Example

We are currently moving to uv from not having uv and loving it. Being able to run multiple versions of a tool would be great. It would make it easier to test upgrades and tools with plugins! Thanks for listening.

An example of how this is supported in `pipx`: https://github.com/pypa/pipx/pull/445

Duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6365, I think.
