# Installation is restricted due to regional limitations.

_Issue opened by @lsp84ch83 on 2025-03-05 11:36_

### Summary

The uv install command utilizes GitHub's download address, but in regions or countries where GitHub is blocked, this often results in timeouts. Even if uv performs exceptionally well, it becomes unusable under such circumstances. It is hoped that the download links can be optimized or accelerated to address this issue.

### Example

`uv venv test --python 3.8.20                                                                      ✔

Have you considered setting up a GitHub proxy or mirror? We support proxy URLs here: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/environment/#uv_python_install_mirror
