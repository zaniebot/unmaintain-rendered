# `uv x` as alternative to `uvx`

---

_Issue opened by @chrisrodrigue on 2025-02-19 22:43_

## Proposal 

uv currently ships two different binaries with each release, `uv` and `uvx`. According to the documentation, `uvx` is an alias for `uv tool run` and the two commands are exactly equivalent. The `uvx` binary appears to be implemented as an executable shim.

I would like to propose that `uv x` be provided in place of (or in addition to) `uvx`. 

## Rationale

Precedence for this has been set with `uv v` which is an alias for `uv venv`. 

```console
C:\Users\Chris>uv
error: 'uv' requires a subcommand but one was not provided
  [subcommands: run, init, add, remove, sync, lock, export, tree, tool, python, pip, venv, virtualenv, v, build, publish, build-backend, cache, self, clean, version, generate-shell-completion, --generate-shell-completion, help]

Usage: uv [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
```

## Pros

Removal of the shim would simplify the build and installation of uv and marginally reduce the size of the release assets (~150 KB for the x64 Windows archive). 

## Cons

A single <kbd>Space</kbd>

## Example

```console
C:\Users\Chris>uv x
Provide a command to run with `uv x <command>`.

See `uv x --help` for more information.
```

It seems very unlikely that we would remove the `uvx` binary as it would be a disruptive breaking change — I don't see a compelling reason. It seems fine to provide `uv x` as another alias, but it's just more for people to get confused about.

That's a fair point... although I would be surprised if many users have opted for `uvx` over the more explicit `uv tool run` in scripted workflows. Users preferring the `uvx` alias could just add it to their `.bashrc` or make their own `uvx.cmd` shim in `.local\bin`

(Also, the change would only be breaking if the installation script explicitly removed the shim from the previous uv release. The shim should theoretically work forever right?)

I don't think I've seen much evidence of this. I see `uvx` used pretty widely.

It'd be breaking for people using uv in ephemeral environments, like CI or containers.

I feel like I might be doing something wrong, but

- https://github.com/search?q=%22uv+tool+run%22&type=code — 1K files
- https://github.com/search?q=%22uvx+%22&type=code — 21K files

(Without a trailing space, the second is 4M files with a lot of false positives)

oof... yeah, this could be a painful change. So much for line 2 of the [Zen](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python)!

You guys have been very good about not having many breaking changes. I would hate to see an influx of issues and bad PR as a result of something silly like this.

Windows exists. And in a professional environment is the most used OS.

UV is there to make the life of people easier. Not to make them create their own `uvx.cmd` command. You can create your own command and implement your way of work if you want. 

Your assumptions on how people use `uvx` give me the impression that you do not use it or have explained someone else, that is not a techie, how to use it. 

Not to mention that I would stop using it if a subcommand called `x` gets such a preferente treatment. I boycott everything named `x`.

I explicitly list tools as development dependencies in `pyproject.toml` and install them in the virtual environment of my project.

`uvx` seems like an homage to `pipx` and `npx`. But I would argue that the intent of `uvx` is less clear. From the documentation:

>### [Running tools](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools)
>The `uvx` command invokes a tool **without installing it**.

But then just a few lines down, it says

>**Tools are installed** into temporary, isolated environments when using `uvx`.

Either a tool is installed or it is not. Which is it?

Clearly, tools are installed somewhere, but where? Will this abstract location just grow in size forever with tools that I tried out a single time? Why would I want this?

To me, this seems like a package management anti-pattern. But it is here to stay, since removing it would be a breaking change.

`uvx` is mainly for non technical people. 

This will revolutionize how people consume Python programs. It is for "the mass", not for developers. 

Where packages are installed is clear. And how to handle the cache is clear too. Have a look to the documentation.

>Where packages are installed is clear

It isn't. Tools are installed in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\uv\tools`, but I'm not talking about `uv tool install`, I'm talking about `uvx`.

The documentation clearly says that `uvx` invokes a tool without installing it. Yet the output of the `uvx` command clearly signifies that a package was installed. The installation location is `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\uv\cache\archive-v0\R5Go42aFFFox0OFmAOrJ_\`. 

```console
C:\Users\Chris>uvx ruff
Installed 1 package in 80ms
```

Files were installed—copied to the file system—which is contrary to what the documentation says. I don't have a problem with it, but other users could see this as a violation of trust.

I would suggest at least updating the documentation to state that the files are installed to a cache. In-memory execution is a real thing and that isn't what's happening here.

Even something like `uv pip compile <(echo bottle)` writes files to the cache. I think it's OK to say nothing is installed if the "installation" is just into the cache, especially since in certain environments (e.g. Dockerfile) the cache directory is often on ephemeral storage.

Why not have `uvx` be a symlink to `uv` and uv detects that it has been invoked as `uvx` (args[0]) and so use `uv tool run` ? It is for instance what busybox is doing, or vim with view/vimdiff/rvim/…

---

_Comment by @zanieb on 2025-11-20 14:25_

`uvx` is basically a symlink, it just needs to work cross-platform.

I took a look at the documentation to see if we should clarify that `uvx` installs into a temporary instance and immediately found >3 instances of us saying that's what happens. If someone has a specific spot the language should change, please open a pull request.
