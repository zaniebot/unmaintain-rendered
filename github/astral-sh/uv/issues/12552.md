Do you mean this feature?

Nice, this works for **uv** now, but I still haven't found **uvx**:

```shell
(datasci) werner@x13dai-t:~$ uvx -h 
pyenv: uvx: command not found

The `uvx' command exists in these Python versions:
  3.11.1/envs/dftd4
  3.11.1/envs/gpt_academic
  3.11.1/envs/test
  dftd4
  gpt_academic
  miniforge3-24.11.0-1
  test

Note: See 'pyenv help global' for tips on allowing both
      python2 and python3 to be found.
```

After I installed it with `pip install uvx`, the following command still failed as suggested [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#shell-autocompletion):

```shell
(datasci) werner@x13dai-t:~$ uvx --generate-shell-completion bash
error: unexpected argument '--generate-shell-completion' found

  tip: a similar argument exists: '--generate'

Usage: uvx <--generate <GENERATOR>> <COMMAND>

For more information, try '--help'.
```

The uvx on PyPI isn't the one from Astral. You got that wrong.
uvx on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/uvx/

By the way, it seems like ``pip install uv`` already includes both ``uv`` and ``uvx``.

But `pip install uvx` will install the above package, as I have done.

Really.

To clarify, only the package named ``uv`` is official, while ``uvx`` is a third-party package.

I saw that this package has been moved to [here](https://pypi.org/project/uvenv), as stated in the **Deprecation Warning**:

Anyway, I have understood the correct way to enable the [**shell autocompletion**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#shell-autocompletion) for the original/official `uv` and `uvx`. Thank you very much for your quick reply and help.
