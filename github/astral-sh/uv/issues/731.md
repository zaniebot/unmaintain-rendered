# Support `--find-links` html pages for jax

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-12-26 13:17_

The [jax CUDA installation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#pip-installation-gpu-cuda-installed-via-pip-easier) says:

```shell
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

We don't support find-links and the page doesn't work as an index, the format is slightly different:

```console
$ cargo run --bin puffin -q -- pip-install --index-url https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html jaxlib
error: Package `jaxlib` was not found in the registry.
```

I don't know if we want to or should support that, i'm filing this because jax is an import ML libraries.

Probably more invasive than the change to support HTML.

Can we merge this into the existing find-links issue?
