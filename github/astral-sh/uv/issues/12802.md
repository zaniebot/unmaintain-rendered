# `uv pip install` should show list of versions when required version doesn't exist

---

_Issue opened by @samuelcolvin on 2025-04-10 10:15_

### Summary

To get the list of available versions of a package with pip I use the hack (for example)

```bash
pip install mcp==123
```
(Or `pip install <package>==<version that doesn't exist>`)

and thereby get the list of available versions:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mcp==123 (from versions: 0.9.1, 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.2.0rc1, 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.3.0rc1, 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.4.1, 1.5.0, 1.6.0)
```

This is also useful when the user is genuinely trying to install a version that doesn't exist.

`uv` doesn't include the list of versions:

```
➤ uv pip install mcp==123
  × No solution found when resolving dependencies:
  ╰─▶ Because there is no version of mcp==123 and you require mcp==123, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

It would be great if it did.

FYI, the officially supported command to do this for pip, rather than relying on the output of an error which may change at any point in the future, is `pip index versions`:

```
 $ pip index versions mcp
WARNING: pip index is currently an experimental command. It may be removed/changed in a future release without prior warning.
mcp (1.6.0)
Available versions: 1.6.0, 1.5.0, 1.4.1, 1.4.0, 1.3.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.0, 1.1.3, 1.1.2, 1.1.1, 1.1.0, 1.0.0, 0.9.1
```

The next version of pip is removing the [experimental warning](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13219) and adding a [json output](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/13194).

Hi, i am interested on this issue. So basically we would like to do:
1. Add a new command to support `uv pip index versions <package>`
2. Show error contains available version when package's version is not exists(Optional)

Let me know if this sounds good to you.
Thanks
