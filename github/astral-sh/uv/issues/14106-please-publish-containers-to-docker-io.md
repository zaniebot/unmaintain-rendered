# Please publish containers to docker.io

---

_Issue opened by @ardigan6 on 2025-06-17 12:57_

### Summary

Google Cloud is an also-ran by market share, so probably 70-90% of downloads are coming from AWS or Azure.

docker.io hosts on AWS, so this is much faster for the majority of users and probably more reliable than ghcr.io, which had a long outage last week.

Would be great if you'd publish to both places, and thanks for your work on uv!
