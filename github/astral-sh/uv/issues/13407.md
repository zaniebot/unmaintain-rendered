Is the directory you are using called `backend` or `mybackend`? Ideally, could you share a Git repository that shows the problem? Not with your entire code, just with the files needed for the error to happen.

just empty dirs with file structure i give
.
├── mybackend
│   └── __init__.py
└── pyproject.toml

the all content of pyproject.toml is
[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build>=0.7.3,<0.8.0"]
build-backend = "uv_build"

[tool.uv.build-backend]
module-root = "./"
module-name = "mybackend"

[project]
name = "mybackend"
version = "1.3.1a1"
description = "mybackend SDK"
dependencies = []

It works with `module-root = ""`, we should accept `./`, too, though.

i use module-root = "", and i find that if the source code dir named like nBk tCk  also raise the Error: Expected a Python module directory at: `tCk`, can't i use capital letter in source code dir?
