# pip.conf/pip.ini and Artifactory compatability

_Issue opened by @Muhtasham on 2024-02-23 10:51_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->

Thanks for another great package!

Wanted to ask anybody tested if `uv` also honors `pip.conf/pip.ini` and plays nicely with Artifactory?

Hi!

We don't read `pip.conf` or `pip.ini` (and probably won't since we're a separate tool). The next release will play nicely with Arficatory though (see #1709)
