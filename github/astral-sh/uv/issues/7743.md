# Feature Request: Read from `.env` file in a project

---

_Issue opened by @pythonweb2 on 2024-09-27 17:57_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with uv.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `uv pip sync requirements.txt`), ideally including the `--verbose` flag.
* The current uv platform.
* The current uv version (`uv --version`).
-->
If a machine with multiple projects pulls dependencies from multiple indexes, right now you would have to either `export` the index URL for each project before running command, or pass in the index URL via CLI arguments.

It would be nice if uv first tried to read from the `.env` file inside of a project, and then from the system environment variables, so if I had a file like this

`.env`
```
UV_INDEX_URL=asdf.
```

Then running `uv add` or `uv sync` would read from that file in my project directory.

I think this is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/1384.

Oh sorry about that, I searched the issues for .env but did not see that one.
