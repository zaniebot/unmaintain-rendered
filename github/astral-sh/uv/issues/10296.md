# How to move a package inside a uv workspace?

---

_Issue opened by @kesitrifork on 2025-01-04 11:35_

I am trying to move a workspace package, but running `uv init` or `uv sync` gives errors. So how would you best move around a package?

```
$ uv init
error: Project is already initialized in `/Users/xxx/packages/pipeline` (`pyproject.toml` file exists)
$ uv sync
error: Failed to generate package metadata for `pipeline==0.1.0 @ editable+apps/pipeline`
  Caused by: Distribution not found at: file:///Users/xxx/apps/pipeline
```

Can you share how your package looks like, from where you're moving it and what eventual layout you want to have?
