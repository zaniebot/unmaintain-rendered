# Refactor the Changelog for use in `report_dry_run` 

---

_Pull request opened by @EliteTK on 2025-12-08 22:11_

## Summary

Remove duplication in `report_dry_run` by making `Changelog` support both local and remote dists. This is in support of #16653 and will form a new basis for #16981.

This also involved refactoring `InstallLogger` and its implementations to support dry run logging.

Additionally includes some minor refactoring in `SummaryInstallLogger` and a fix to `InstalledVersion`.

See https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/compare/tk/dry-run-refactor for an alternative approach (although obviously comes with some caveats).

## Test Plan

There are already quite a few tests which cover the output and they pass. Manual testing was used to ensure styling stayed consistent.
