# Update packse to 0.3.54

---

_Pull request opened by @konstin on 2025-11-27 14:52_

Add https://github.com/astral-sh/packse/pull/293 for https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16824#discussion_r2556176057

Beware of https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta/issues/833 when working with packse for the time being (i.e., `cargo binstall cargo-insta@1.42.1 --force`).

Windows adds an extra hint, I need to change the packse scenario do use fictional platforms instead.

I'm removing this test for now in https://github.com/astral-sh/packse/pull/299, this is too complex to fix rn for a single test case and it's blocking packse updates.
