# Allow missing executables in tool install target when `--with-executables-from` is used

Closes https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/17069

I think it's a little too confusing otherwise

Do you have one in mind? I specifically want one where the executables are from an existing dependency of the parent which has no executables.

Something that depends on pytest maybe? Otherwise we could model something in packse.
