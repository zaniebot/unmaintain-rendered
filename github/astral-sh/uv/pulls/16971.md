# Adjust release script to handle uv-trampoline lockfile changes

---

_Pull request opened by @samypr100 on 2025-12-03 15:21_

## Summary

Given `bump-workspace-crate-versions.py` will bump all crates, we also need to update uv-trampoline lockfile references to those new versions (for uv-static, uv-macros) after https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/16950.

## Test Plan

Ran release script manually and verify uv-trampoline lockfile is up to date after the changes from bump-workspace-crate-versions.py
