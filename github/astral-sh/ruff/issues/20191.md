# Regarding externally maintained GPL library from which parts of the Software is derived

_Issue opened by @rahulmohang on 2025-09-01 07:42_

Hi, 

The 'https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/2820' mentions a derivative work of or direct inclusion of parts of GPL library. Won't this affect the license of the package?

Our general stance is that independently implementing rules (as opposed to copying, directly adapting, or directly including source code) does not create a derivative work or introduce those kinds of license obligations. The intent is to implement compatible APIs, rather than reuse or adapt the underlying source code. The situation is a little different for tools like pyupgrade, where we did directly port logic (e.g., tokenization helpers) at one point or another. I think that line was added to the license before we'd established a clear policy here, so it should probably be removed. I can do a pass over the license to draw a clearer distinction.
