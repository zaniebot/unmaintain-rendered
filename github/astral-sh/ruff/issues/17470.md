# feature request: mouseover for rules in configuration files

---

_Issue opened by @beauxq on 2025-04-18 19:05_

Thank you for the mouseover tooltips for rules in the comments of code:
```python
# noqa: B011
```
If I put my mouse over the `B011`, I get a tooltip with details about the rule.

Can we also have this feature for rules in `pyproject.toml` and `ruff.toml`?
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = ["B011",
```
I would like to be able to put my mouse over the `B011` in this pyproject.toml and see the same information.

Ooh, that does sound cool. I don't think the ruff server/extension currently runs at all in TOML files, but I also don't know how difficult it would be to change that!

Merging this with the issue in the extension repository.
