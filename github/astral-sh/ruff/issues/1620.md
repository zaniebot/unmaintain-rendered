# PT006 missing a few fixes

---

_Issue opened by @edgarrmondragon on 2023-01-04 02:56_

Currently supported:

- `"param1,param2"` -> `("param1", "param2")`
- `"param1,param2"` -> `["param1", "param2"]`
- `("param1",)` -> `"param1"`
- `["param1"]` -> `"param1"`

Missing fixes:

- `("param1", "param2")` -> `"param1,param2"`
- `["param1", "param2"]` -> `"param1,param2"`
- `("param1", "param2")` -> `["param1", "param2"]`
- `["param1", "param2"]` -> `("param1", "param2")`

The first two should only apply when all the sequence elements are string literals, and the last two should preserve each element's expressions.
