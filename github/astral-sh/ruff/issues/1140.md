# Add support for PEP634: `match` and `case`/structural pattern matching

---

_Issue opened by @ashb on 2022-12-08 12:36_

I'm trying out ruff on a greenfield project (loving it so far! Thank you for it!) where I get to use all the latest python goodies, and I've discovered that it doesn't seem like ruff (v0.0.169) likes `match`/`case`:

Simple example:

```
ruff - <<EOF
name = "abc"
match name:
    case "def":
        print("def")
    case _:
        print("default")

EOF
Found 1 error(s).
-:2:8: E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Got unexpected token 'name'
```

(Replace `ruff` with `python` and it'll run fine, of course.)

This syntax was added via https://peps.python.org/pep-0634/ in Python 3.10

I'll won't be able to get around to attempting a PR for this before the New Year, if someone beats me to it I owe you a drink of your choice!

Close as duplicate of #282 - sorry I clearly massively failed in searching (I think I was looking for case match and not "pattern matching". I wasn't aware that is what it was called in python until I went to find the PEP for it)
