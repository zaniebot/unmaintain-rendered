# Feature request: numpydoc rules

---

_Issue opened by @njzjz on 2023-11-01 22:26_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

See https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html.

It would be nice if ruff implemented some of numpydoc rules that are not supported by pydocstyle, such as `PR10`

```
    "PR10": 'Parameter "{param_name}" requires a space before the colon '
    "separating the parameter name and type",
```

Yes I especially like the GL07 rule that has no equivalent in the DOC rule set.
