# D402: Discrepancy with pycodestyle behavior with `noqa` annotation

---

_Issue opened by @dalcinl on 2023-02-01 16:03_

Here you have a minimal reproducer

```py
# file: code.py

def starmap(*args):  # noqa: D402
    """Equivalent to `itertools.starmap(...)`.

    Blah Blah Blah.
    """
    return True
```

```
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.239

$ ruff --select=D402 code.py 
code.py:2:5: D402 First line should not be the function's signature
Found 1 error.

$ pycodestyle --version
2.10.0
$ pycodestyle --select=D402 code.py 

```

As the issue happens in a multiline docstring, I cannot just place the `noqa` annotation in the actual offending line. Therefore, I guess the pycodestyle behavior is kind of sensible.

Ruff associates the error with the docstring, not the function, and so wants it at the end of the docstring, like this:

```py
def starmap(*args):
    """Equivalent to `itertools.starmap(...)`.

    Blah Blah Blah.
    """  # noqa: D402
    return True
```

Flake8 respects this too (just tested it!), so hopefully that works for you!
