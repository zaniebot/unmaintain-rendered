# Rules B009 cause autofix error

---

_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-03 15:57_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select B009 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
class AdminFieldsetMixin:
            if description not in getattr((fl := fieldset[name]), "description"):
                fl.description += "\n" + description
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/5112199.py:2:35: B009 Do not call `getattr` with a constant attribute value. It is not any safer than normal property access.
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/5112199.py`, the rule codes B009, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
