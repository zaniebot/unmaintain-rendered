# Invalid JSON schema on ruff lint settings

---

_Issue opened by @mash180sx on 2024-08-20 07:01_

Is there any reason I get this error in my pyproject.toml file, using VS Code?
It seems it's related to the corresponding JSON Schema.

```toml

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py312"
src = ["src/backend"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
ignore = []
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N"]
per-file-ignores = {"__init__.py" = ["F401"]}
isort = {known_first_party = ["app"]}
```

You can hover the error to get an explanation

The issue seems to be that you use `know_first_party` with underscores instead of `known-first-party`
