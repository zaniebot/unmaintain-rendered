# Allow `sections` to override `local-folder` files

---

_Issue opened by @TerryRPatterson on 2024-05-26 00:07_

At the moment, imports having an import level greater than zero are always classified as a local folder import, even if they match a pattern specified in the sections configuration.

It would be nice if the sections check had higher priority than local folders.

I have a couple of imports which need to be in a different section to call out that they are wrappers around optional deps.

Do you mind providing a concrete example? Aren't relative imports always within the same package? How would they belong to a different section?

Sure, I have a custom section defined:
```toml
[lint.isort]
section-order=[
    "future",
    "standard-library",
    "third-party",
    "first-party",
    "local-folder",
    "extra-types",
]

[lint.isort.sections]
extra-types=['.types.extras.*']
```
and when applied to this file:

```python
from .types.path import Path
from .types.pyobject import PyObject
from .types.string import String
from .types.struct_reference import StructReference

# Types wrapping optional dependencies 
from .types.extras.secret import Secret
from .types.extras.url import Url
```

It wants to sort the `.types.extras` import into the middle of the local-folder section.
