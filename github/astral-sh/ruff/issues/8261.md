# Formatting of call argument split on operator reduces readability

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-10-26 19:29_

The following code is formatted the same with `black`, `black --preview`, and `ruff format`:

```python
if True:
    # Limit the number of items displayed per rule to between 10 and 200
    max_display_per_rule = max(
        10,
        200
        // len(
            set(all_rule_changes.added_violations.keys()).union(
                all_rule_changes.removed_violations.keys()
            )
        ),
    )
```

Moving the operator onto a new line makes it look like an argument in the function call.

Perhaps the following would be clearer?

```python
if True:
    # Limit the number of items displayed per rule to between 10 and 200
    max_display_per_rule = max(
        10,
        200 // len(
            set(all_rule_changes.added_violations.keys()).union(
                all_rule_changes.removed_violations.keys()
            )
        ),
    )
```
