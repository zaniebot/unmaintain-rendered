# Add `logger-objects` to `G` rules documentation

---

_Issue opened by @AbdealiLoKo on 2023-08-22 09:45_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

I was trying to use the `G` rules in ruff for the first time. I have not used flake8-logging-format in the past

```py
# cat /tmp/try.py
import logging
logging.warning(f'Exception when setting up readline: {"123"}')
logger.warning(f'Exception when setting up readline: {"123"}')
```

On running ruff on this:
```sh
# ruff /tmp/try.py --isolated --select G
/tmp/try.py:2:17: G004 Logging statement uses f-string
/tmp/try.py:3:16: G004 Logging statement uses f-string
Found 2 errors.
```

But when I add a import on top to actually import my `logger` variable:
```py
# cat /tmp/try.py
import logging
from myapp import logger
logging.warning(f'Exception when setting up readline: {"123"}')
logger.warning(f'Exception when setting up readline: {"123"}')
```

`ruff` is not catching the `G004` rule for `logger.warning` anymore.
```sh
# ruff /tmp/try.py --isolated --select G
/tmp/try.py:3:17: G004 Logging statement uses f-string
Found 1 error.
```

From reading previous issues ...
My understanding is that the heuristic assumes that any variable that ends with `logger` should be considered as a `logging.Logger`
But I was not expecting that to change if I import `logger` from another module - this behavior seemed like a bug

tried the versions:
 - python 3.7.16 and 3.10.10
 - ruff 0.0.285

Can you try adding my_app.logger to logger-objects? https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#logger-objects

Yep - that got it working 👍 
It was not clear to me that I could configure it :)

Would be nice if that was documented in https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/logging-f-string/ as configurations that can affect this rule ?

Yeah, we can add a note to the various rules. Good idea.
