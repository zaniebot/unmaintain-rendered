# Make throwaway variable (`_`) pattern configurable

---

_Issue opened by @Jackenmen on 2022-09-08 15:29_

There are cases where `_` cannot be used to mark a throwaway variable and it would be great if ruff allowed configuring it. This is common in projects that use `gettext` for example, as `_` is used for translating strings there. One of the ways unused variables are marked in such projects is using `__` (double underscore) but it probably would be a good idea to just make it configurable with a sane default to appeal to more uses.

Notably, pylint allows configuring the dummy variable pattern with a regex:
