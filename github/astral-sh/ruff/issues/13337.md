# RUF001 gives a false-positive with an emoji

---

_Issue opened by @RubenVanEldik on 2024-09-12 07:42_

I tried to find if there were any existing issues, but I couldn't find anything. 

I think I found a small false positive in RUF001. The ℹ️ contains the smaller unicode letter \u2139 which looks a lot like the letter "i". So when pasting the emoji ℹ️ into my code I got a Ruff error that my code includes an ambiguous unicode character.

I can circumvent this by pasting the full unicode version of the emoji (`\u2139\ufe0f`), but this doesn't improve readability. Nor do I think that there is a chance that people conuse the emoji ℹ️ with the letter "i".

Is this intended behaviour, or is this indeed a small false positive? If it's a bug I would be willing to look into it! :)

Thanks. Yeah this seems off. We try to match VS code's behavior. I would have to look into it how they solve it, possibly by looking at grapheme clusters rather than characters.

Just in case someone else (like me) is having trouble reproducing this: I had to surround the emoji in quotes in the playground example before actually getting a Ruff diagnostic emitted (before that only the underlying _editor backend_ for the playground emits a warning.)
