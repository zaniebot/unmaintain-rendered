# Warn about options conflicting with the formatter

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-09-25 09:10_

Show a warning to `ruff format` if the users use any options or lint rules that conflict with the formatter. Add a note to the documentation for each option that conflicts with the formatter.
