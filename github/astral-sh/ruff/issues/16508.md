# Auto-fixes for PD `use-of` rules

---

_Issue opened by @allen-pattern on 2025-03-04 19:40_

### Summary

Almost of the pandas rules have auto-fixes but many of them could be added relatively trivially. PD003-PD009 in particular are simply changing the name of the method.

Interesting, it seems like this was previously implemented in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/2741, but we didn't have the ability to flag fixes as unsafe at that point. I think we could reconsider adding this now!
