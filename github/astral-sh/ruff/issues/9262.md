# RUF006 now triggers on assignments to globals

---

_Issue opened by @hauntsaninja on 2023-12-23 19:04_

Since https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9060, ruff now complains about:
```
import asyncio

consumer_task: asyncio.Task

class Something:
    @classmethod
    async def start_async(cls, something):
        global consumer_task
        consumer_task = asyncio.create_task(something.consume_messages())
        return something
```
Similar issue applies to assignments to nonlocal

Filing as per https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9060#issuecomment-1868345123
