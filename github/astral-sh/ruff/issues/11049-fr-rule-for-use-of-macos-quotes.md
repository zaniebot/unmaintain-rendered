# FR: rule for use of macOS quotes

---

_Issue opened by @ofek on 2024-04-19 21:33_

I would love for the characters `“`, `”` and `’` to be forbidden in code comments and docstrings. I have to always write scripts to check for these in CI or be on heightened alert during code reviews. The auto fix would be completely safe as well.

In future, it would be spectacular if I could apply the same logic to Markdown files directly.
