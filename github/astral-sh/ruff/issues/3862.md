# False positive: PYI015

---

_Issue opened by @pmmmwh on 2023-04-03 10:46_

## Reproduction

```pyi
from typing import TypeVar

from typing_extensions import ParamSpec, TypeVarTuple

_T = TypeVar("_T")
_P = ParamSpec("_P")
_TV = TypeVarTuple("_TV")

```

### Current Behaviour

On autofix, `TypeVar` will be replaced by ellipsis:

```pyi
_T = ...
_P = ...
_TV = ...

```

### Expected

Keep the original code untouched and should not report them as issues.

Perhaps the implementation should also whitelist `TypeVar`, `TypeVarTuple` and `ParamSpec`?
