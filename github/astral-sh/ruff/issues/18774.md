# [flake8-return] RET501 can delete comments

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-06-18 23:57_

### Summary

`RET501` can delete comments if they are inside parenthesis with the `None`, in which case the comments should be moved, the fix should be unsafe, or the fix should not apply. [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/91804551-f2a0-4796-a15f-31768c38f342)
