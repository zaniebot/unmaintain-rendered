# Stabilize `quote-style: preserve`

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-12-18 09:53_

Stabalize the new `quote-style` `preserve` and decide on its final semantics (does it preserve the quotes of multiline and docstrings)?

See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7525 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8822
