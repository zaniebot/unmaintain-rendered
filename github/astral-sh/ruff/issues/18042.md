# SIM905 fix for `rsplit` is reversed

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-05-12 12:36_

### Summary

The list produced for `rsplit` by [`split-static-string` (SIM905)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/split-static-string/) is the reverse of what it should be.
```console
$ cat >sim905.py <<'# EOF'
print("a,b".rsplit(","))
# EOF

$ python sim905.py
['a', 'b']

$ ruff --isolated check sim905.py --select SIM905 --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ cat sim905.py
print(["b", "a"])

$ python sim905.py
['b', 'a']
```

This is because the fix is implemented with Rust’s [`str::rsplit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.rsplit) and [`str::rsplitn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.rsplitn), which return iterators over the string in reverse, unlike Python’s [`str.rsplit`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rsplit).

### Version
