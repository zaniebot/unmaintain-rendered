# [New Rule Request][Django] No `first()` without `order_by()`

---

_Issue opened by @tylerlaprade on 2024-01-22 20:56_

Many of my bugs in Django are from doing `.first()` on an unordered QuerySet, which arbitrarily gives me one of the records. I would like `.first()` to be flagged as an error unless it is chained with `.order_by()` (not necessarily consecutively, but in the same statement). I searched for an example of a similar rule in flake8 but couldn't find any.
