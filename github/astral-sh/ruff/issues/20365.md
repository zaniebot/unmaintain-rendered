# ruff check files count?

---

_Issue opened by @GeeCastro on 2025-09-12 15:40_

### Question

A while ago ruff added a message output validating things worked. There were conversations about adding a files count. Is there any plan for this?

@zanieb said he'd be interested

I'd be supportive of this change. It looks like the tracking issues and PRs have all been closed, so I don't think there is any work ongoing. As pointed out in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10424 we also report the number of files checked in `ruff format`, so this would be more consistent too.
