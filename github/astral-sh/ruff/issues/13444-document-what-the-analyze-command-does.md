# document what the `analyze` command does

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2024-09-22 02:17_

it's mentioned in the changelog for the 0.6.7 release, and [here](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#analyze), but i can't find any documentation explaining what the command actually does

maybe `ruff --help` explains it? but i'm on my phone so i can't check atm. i think it should also be explained in the docs
