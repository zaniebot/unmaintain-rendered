# Treatment of obsolete items

---

_Issue opened by @ya7010 on 2025-03-15 10:23_

### Question

I noticed that ruff's rules are not referenced correctly in pyproject.toml and have updated the JSON Schema Store. https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pull/4569

There are already obsolete items and rules, is it possible to keep them in the JSON Schema?

I have marked them obsolete manually, but it should be possible to automatically generate obsolete settings in JSON Schema.

### Version

_No response_

I'm not sure I understand your issue. Can you give me a concrete example of something that isn't working with today's schema?

This is what I encountered.

https://github.com/python-pendulum/pendulum/blob/76422468575b5817f7a58f3d05c26b480bf671a9/pyproject.toml#L86

"TCH" is currently unavailable.
However, older projects still specify it, so using JSON Schema will result in an error.

Yeah, that makes sense. We're aware of this issue and it isn't just specific to rules (although that's where it's most apparent).
