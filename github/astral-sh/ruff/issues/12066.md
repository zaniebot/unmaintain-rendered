# Check MANIFEST.in

---

_Issue opened by @bersace on 2024-06-27 10:04_

Hi,

Thanks for ruff, it's great.

What do you think of implemented [check-manifest](https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest) ? This way, we could go all-in with ruff to all linting in Python project. :rocket: 

Regards,
Étienne

Yeah, I could see how Ruff does something like this once we have multifile analysis (a good understanding of the dependencies).
