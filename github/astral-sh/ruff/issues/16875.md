# Add rule to flag when a documented argument does not exist

_Issue opened by @rhshadrach-8451 on 2025-03-20 16:54_

### Summary

Apologies in advance if this is already somewhere on the issue tracker, I searched for quite a bit but could not find it.

When there is a documented argument that does not exist, from what I can tell it doesn't violate and of the docstring rules.

```python
def foo() -> None:
    """Do foo.

    Args:
        bar: Bar.
    """
    pass
```

It would be helpful if there was a rule to detect this, especially when refactoring.

If I understand correctly, this would be covered by the (unimplemented) `DOC102` and/or `DOC103` discussed here https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12434
