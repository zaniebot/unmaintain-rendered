# Sort statistics by number of errors

---

_Issue opened by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-03-26 18:34_

IMO, `ruff check --statistics --select=ALL .` should be sorted from the highest to lowest number of errors.
On a new codebase, it would help to know which rules to prioritize.

Seems reasonable, I actually thought this was how it worked already but I guess not!
