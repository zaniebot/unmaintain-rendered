# Require `--preview` flag for `ruff server`

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-03-12 17:36_

`ruff server` is still in an unstable, pre-release state, and this would be made more clear by requiring a `--preview` argument to be passed.

This also enables us to gate unstable or experimental features in the server behind `--preview`in the future.
