# Bug: `ruff rule` shows `PLR6301` as non-preview

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-10-04 07:03_

With `ruff==0.0.292`, it seems `PLR6301` from `ruff rule --all --format=json` has `"preview": False`.  I think it should be `True` per https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/no-self-use/

> This rule is unstable and in [preview](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/).
