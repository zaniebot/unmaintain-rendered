# [red-knot] `Literal[type]` should be assignable to `(object, /) -> type`

_Issue opened by @sharkdp on 2025-04-09 07:51_

Not sure if this is because we have missing support for overloads, or if it's just something that needs to be modeled in the subtype relationships for `Callable`, but it seems like this should succeed:

```py
from typing import Callable

# Object of type `Literal[type]` is not assignable to `(object, /) -> type`
c: Callable[[object], type] = type
```

I think it's overloads because the `__init__` method is overloaded in typeshed.

I think we simply don't have any arm in `is_subtype_of` or `is_assignable_to` handling subtyping or assignability of a class literal or subclass-of type (or, as of yesterday, generic-alias type) to a callable type, at all, so that's the most basic problem. Overloads might still be an issue once that's added, but that's the first thing that would be needed here.

This has been fixed in the meantime.
