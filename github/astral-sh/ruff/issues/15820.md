_Issue opened by @juledwar on 2025-01-29 23:31_

### Description

```
ruff --version
ruff 0.9.3
```

Before:
```
ruff check heliosclient
heliosclient/cli/project.py:313:14: B905 [*] `zip()` without an explicit `strict=` parameter
    |
311 |     """
312 |     vuln_filters = [
313 |         dict(zip(('cvenum', 'reason'), cve.split(":", maxsplit=1)))
    |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ B905
314 |         for cve in vuln_filters
315 |     ]
    |
    = help: Add explicit value for parameter `strict=`

Found 1 error.
[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

After:
```
ruff check --fix heliosclient
heliosclient/cli/project.py:313:80: E501 Line too long (81 > 79)
    |
311 |     """
312 |     vuln_filters = [
313 |         dict(zip(('cvenum', 'reason'), cve.split(":", maxsplit=1), strict=False))
    |                                                                                ^^ E501
314 |         for cve in vuln_filters
315 |     ]
    |
```

Hi! I think this might be related to #8106 (and sort of #9203).

Yes I think they are the same, I didn't see those (pretty old!) issues, sorry.

No problem! It took me quite a while to find them and already knew they existed. GitHub's issue search is pretty rough, so linking here should help others discover the issue.

Thanks for bumping this! I'm gonna close this as a duplicate, but it should still help when folks search as @tjkuson pointed out.
