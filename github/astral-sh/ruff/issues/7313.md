# Consider suggesting using tempfile classes as context managers

_Issue opened by @NeilGirdhar on 2023-09-12 18:42_

Just as in:
```
f = Path.open('x')  # SIM115 Use context handler for opening files
f.close()
```
Ruff nudges the user to use context managers, Ruff should do the same for:
```
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
f = NamedTemporaryFile()  # Should nudge SIM115
f.close()
```
and similarly for the other classes in `tempfile`.

Reopening the issue for now so we remember to stabilise the new behaviour as part of Ruff 0.7
