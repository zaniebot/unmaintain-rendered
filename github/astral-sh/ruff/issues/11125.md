# SIM911 false positive (with bad autofix) on non-`zip` attribute calls

---

_Issue opened by @lukas-folle-snkeos on 2024-04-24 12:51_

## Description
Running the ruff format on `plt.bar(dict_a.keys(), dict_a.values())` is formatted by ruff to `dict_a.items()` which seems to be an issue.

This is the pre-commit config I am using
```yaml
- repo:
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  rev: 21d9bff1d62aaf03230baa6b804b9074255fa9b8 # v0.4.1
  hooks:
    - id: ruff
      args:
        - --output-format
        - full
        - --fix
      types_or: [python, pyi, jupyter]
    - id: ruff-format
      types_or: [python, pyi, jupyter]
```

## Example
```python
from matplotlib.pyplot import plt

dict_a = {"A":1, "B":2, "C":3}

plt.bar(dict_a.keys(), dict_a.values())
```
Resolves this to:
```python
dict_a = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}

dict_a.items()
```
