# feat: Alternative Text Output Format(s)

---

_Issue opened by @hay-kot on 2022-11-28 22:21_

I would like to group the errors in ruff by file and output them in a more structured format Similar to the image below where issues are grouped by file and then displayed in a table like view below the file name. 

**Example**

<img width="790" alt="CleanShot 2022-11-28 at 13 15 02@2x" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64056131/204392314-3fa8408a-bbfe-448a-8d18-e91fed97390b.png">


Obviously this is mostly a personal preference, but I find that much easier to read than the current output. 

I could see this being implement in a two different ways.

1. Add an additional option to `--format` flag that displays an output like above. This is likely the easiest option
2. Accept a template of some kind in either the config file or as a parameter to --format.  Perhaps with a template engine like [tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera). This is the most flexible, but difficult and would add additional dependencies

I'm happy to work on a PR for this if it's a feature you're interest in including in ruff. 

Thanks for all your work on this!

Yeah I'd be happy to support this. It's a bit more ESLint-like. I think a separate format option would be a reasonable place to start -- I don't feel the need to support extensive templating right now. Maybe like `--format grouped`? But we can workshop the name later.
