# CLI: Deprecate `--show-sources` in favor of `--output_format <concise|full>`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-09-13 16:11_

The `--show-sources` / `--no-show-sources` flags should be replaced with `--output_format full` / `--format concise` options. Ruff's default format should change to `full`. These formats would replace the `text` format, which should undergo a deprecation period.

The flags should also undergo a deprecation period during which
- They are hidden from the CLI help menu
- A warning is displayed if they are used
- They are ignored if `--format <..>` is provided

The "full" name is up for debate! Feel free to chime in with suggestions.

In #7349 the default behavior is changed to `--show-sources` / `--format full`.
