Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

```
⊙  ruff --version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   julian@Airm ●
ruff 0.0.280
```

</details>

The following code:

```
def f():
    """
    A really really really really really really really really really really really really really long docstring line.
    """  # noqa: E501
```

Produces:

```
⊙  ruff check --select RUF --select E --isolated foo.py                                                                                                                                                                                                                   julian@Airm ●
foo.py:4:10: RUF100 [*] Unused `noqa` directive (non-enabled: `E501`)
```

but indeed the `noqa: E501` is needed, with removing it giving:

```
foo.py:3:89: E501 Line too long (117 > 88 characters)
Found 1 error.
```

Trying to figure out what's going on here, but oddly I don't get `foo.py:4:10: RUF100 [*] Unused `noqa` directive (non-enabled: E501)` when running that command over that snippet.

What's the output of `ruff check --select RUF --select E --isolated foo.py --show-settings`?

Bizarre, apologies for the noise, I have no idea what I did previously, but now I too don't see an error neither in the reduced example above nor in my original codebase. No idea whether I just didn't save properly previously or what...

Sorry for wasting your time.

Don’t sweat it, you wrote up a very nice + clear issue. Took me two seconds to test it out!
