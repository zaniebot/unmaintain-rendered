# Cannot exclude RUF100 flag on per file basis 

---

_Issue opened by @mmarras on 2023-08-07 10:59_

I just happen to comment out a file completly, I get many `RUF100 [*] Unused "noqa" directive (unused: "YXXX")` flags. In this project, due to ruff pre-commit I am only supposed to do a git commit if there are no ruff errors: so I added `ruff: noqa: RUF100` at the top, but it is not honored. 

MWE (test.py):
```python
# ruff: noqa: RUF100

# class Meta:
#     def mymeta() -> None:  # noqa: D102
#         pass 
```
>> test.py:4:30: RUF100 [*] Unused `noqa` directive (unused: `D102`)

* run: `ruff *`
* version: `ruff 0.0.282`

Maybe related question is should ruff flag these if they are part of a commented line in the first place (two #, whereas one being the first char in a line)? `# def mymeta() -> None:  # noqa: D102`. Yes D102 is unused, but the whole line is unused atm, so duh.
