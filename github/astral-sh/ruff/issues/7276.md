# Docs build succeeds but is not published

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-09-11 17:54_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
The build for release v0.0.288 succeeded at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/6149505080 but the live documentation does not appear to be updated e.g. `extend-ignore-names` is not present at https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#flake8-self from #7018 

@charliermarsh noticed this on the last few releases as well and has followed with a manual trigger of the job which builds from `main` instead of the tag and appears to resolve the issue. However, since v0.0.288 I've merged #7195 which includes documentation changes that should not be published yet.

Suspicious of the deprecation warning for `wrangler pages publish` which is not present on prior builds e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/5813122794 — They may have accidentally changed behavior, perhaps notably with the branch name in  `pages publish site --project-name=ruff-docs --branch ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF}?`

Attempting a manual run with the SHA instead of the tag at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/6150539738/job/16688722576
