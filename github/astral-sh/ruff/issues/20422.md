# UP008 should not apply when the class variable is shadowed

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-09-15 17:54_

### Summary

When the first argument to `super` in a method is a local variable, [`super-call-with-parameters` (UP008)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/super-call-with-parameters/) should not apply, even if the local variable has the same name as the class. [Example](https://play.ruff.rs/02304bc1-1e7f-4fa4-893b-07fc4903489a):
```console
$ cat >up008.py <<'# EOF'
class A:
    def f(self):
        return 1
class B(A):
    def f(self):
        return 2
class C(B):
    def f(self):
        C = B
        return super(C, self).f()
print(C().f())
# EOF

$ python up008.py
1

$ ruff --isolated check up008.py --select UP008 --unsafe-fixes --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ python up008.py
2
```
