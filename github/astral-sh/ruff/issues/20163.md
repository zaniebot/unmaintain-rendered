# rule: same name "as import"

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2025-08-29 21:02_

### Summary

I just saw:
`from logfmter.formatter import Logfmter as Logfmter`

which is the same name. Therefore a rule could be added, which changes it to:
`from logfmter.formatter import Logfmter`

This should be covered by [useless-import-alias (PLC0414)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/useless-import-alias/#useless-import-alias-plc0414)!

ah correct, it just wasn't enabled in my env due to `preview=True` and `__init__.py`.
