# Implement isort option lines_after_imports

---

_Issue opened by @qbedard on 2023-01-27 05:46_

The isort configuration is missing the [lines_after_imports](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#lines-after-imports) option. 😭

I rely on this one. Any chance it can be added?

Thanks for the amazing tool. ❤️
