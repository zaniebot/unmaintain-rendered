# `RUF012` shouldn't complain when type hint is not present

---

_Issue opened by @harshil21 on 2023-06-21 08:43_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

The following snippet produces an error which I think it shouldn't since there is no type annotation for that variable:

```python
# test.py
class A:
    var = ["hey", "there"]
```

This gets particularly annoying in test suites, since adding type hints there (specially in this case) is not required imo.

### Command

`ruff test.py --select RUF --isolated`

```
tests/ruff.py:2:11: RUF012 Mutable class attributes should be annotated with `typing.ClassVar`
Found 1 error.
```

### Version

`ruff 0.0.274`

I think you meant https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5243, since this is #5244.
