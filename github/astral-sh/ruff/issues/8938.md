# `fix_power_op_line_length` preview style

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-12-01 03:25_

Implement Black's [`fix_power_op_line_length`](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3942) style as a preview style in Ruff. 

```python
b = 1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1**1
```

Should be formatted to 

```python
b = (
    1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
    ** 1
)
```

Notice the whitespace around the power op which we currently omit. This likely requires using `if_group_breaks` to only show the whitespace when the group breaks.
