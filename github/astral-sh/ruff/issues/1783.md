<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Incredible tool so far, working on replacing all of pylint in our monorepo with ruff right now, and using the vscode extension.

*Bug:*
Ruff seams to not be able to handle python 3.10 match cases? 
Got it down to a very small working example, even specifying py310 in pyproject.toml or from command line does not work.
This example is just one python file, no pyproject.toml or ruff.toml.

Here is the small code snippet.
```python
import os # should trigger "unused import"

match "x":
  case "x":
    print("x")
```

Edit:
Here is a Dockerfile that re-creates the bug, so it is nothing weird on my machine
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-alpine

RUN pip install ruff
RUN echo "match 'x':"     >> test.py
RUN echo "  case 'x':"    >> test.py
RUN echo "    print('x')" >> test.py
RUN python test.py
RUN ruff --target-version "py310" test.py
```

Fixed as of v0.0.250 which included `match` statement support.

@charliermarsh got this on `Python 3.12.8`
