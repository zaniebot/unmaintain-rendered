# Consider running a 32bit platform in CI

---

_Issue opened by @WhyNotHugo on 2024-08-20 13:26_

There have been several releases which inadvertently broke on 32bit architectures (and the more niche s390x), and this only came up when packaging the release downstream.

This is a feature request to integrate some 32bit system into CI to pick up these issues earlier during development.

Can you share some example bugs?

We now do have a 32bit WASM CI step that at least asserts that Ruff and Red Knot build on a 32bit target. We don't have a step that runs all tests

Recent examples are https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12885, https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12661 and https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10359

I had the impression of having reported a few more, but others are actually on riscv and ppc64le

I'd accept a PR that sets up a 32 job that runs on main
