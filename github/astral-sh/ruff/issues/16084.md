# [red-knot] `T | object = object`

---

_Issue opened by @sharkdp on 2025-02-10 19:30_

### Description

We can generally simplify unions involving `object` to `object`. We already do so for fully-static types, but this is also more generally true for all gradual types. For example, `Any | object` is equivalent to `object`.
