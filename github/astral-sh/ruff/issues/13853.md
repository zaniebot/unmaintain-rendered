# [red-knot] Infer slice expression types

---

_Issue opened by @sharkdp on 2024-10-21 10:14_

Part of astral-sh/ty#244, and also astral-sh/ruff#13689. Infer types for [slice expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#slicings).

- [x] x[1:3] should be inferred as tuple[str, str] if x has type tuple[int, str, str, int]
- [x] y[1:3] should be inferred as Literal["aa"] if y has type Literal["baab"].
