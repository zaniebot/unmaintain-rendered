# Formatter: handle comments, quotes, and expressions inside f-strings

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-09-22 09:23_

This issue is to kickoff a discussion around the formatting for f-strings. With [PEP 701], f-strings changes the behavior with what kind of syntax is allowed:

1. Comments inside f-strings:
```python
# comment 0
f"""
{ # comment 1
    # comment 2
    foo # comment 3
    # comment 4
}"""  # comment 5
```

2. F-strings can be nested within f-strings
```python
f"first {f"second {f"third ..."} second"} first"
```

3. Quotes can be repeated inside nested f-strings (for both strings and f-strings)
```python
f"double quotes {"same quotes in strings" + f"same quotes in f-strings"}"
```

This means that the formatter needs to be updated to possibly handle f-strings on it's own. Currently, it's handled as part of string formatting.
