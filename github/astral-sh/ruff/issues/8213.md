# Rule proposal: Auto-add `-> None` typehint to functions

---

_Issue opened by @intgr on 2023-10-25 12:45_

I want to create a new Ruff rule that auto-adds `-> None` return type hint to functions when no `return <value>` statements are present.

Clearly there are lots of special cases that need to be handled (`yield`, `raise`, `@overload`, `.pyi` files, etc).

What do you think?

I pushed a very eary draft #8212, but no point doing thorough review yet.

This autofix could potentially be annoying for peope who run Ruff after every save/auto-save in their IDE. Because Ruff might add `-> None` to a partially written function when the user isn't finished writing a `return` statement. Is this something I should consider?

Also, maybe it makes sense to allocate a specific range of RUF codes for typehinting-related rules? Or create another rule prefix entirely?

Also, remember that `-> None` isn't required on `__init__` functions unless there are no typed arguments.
