# [red-knot] mdtests - Run single test

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-10-21 20:04_

We should add support for running a single test from a md test suite. 

Today, it's possible  to only run the mdtests from a single file by running `cargo test -p red_knot_python_semantic mdtest_file_name`. However, it's not possible to select a specific test from a markdown file. Running only a single test is useful for debugging, when using tracing, and to see if a test has a different outcome when run in isolation.

`cargo insta` uses the environment variable `INSTA_GLOB_FILTER` for this (see https://insta.rs/docs/advanced/). We could add a `MDTEST_FILE_FILTER` environment variable (glob) and only run tests matching the given filter. 

I'm open to other ideas, especially if they address the shortcoming of environment variables that they are hard to discovery.
