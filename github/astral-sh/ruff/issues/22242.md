# New rule - Reimport detection

---

_Issue opened by @spaceby on 2025-12-29 12:31_

### Summary

I think many people use the automatic import feature.
The feature is very convenient, but sometimes it imports from the wrong place.

Sometimes this problem occurs:


```python
# source.py
value = 'value'

__all__ = ['value']
```

```python
# file_1.py
from source import value  # normal import
```

```python
# file_2.py
from file_1 import value  # reimport. The object is imported from a location other than the one where it was created
```

Reimports are hard to spot and difficult to find using search. 
Reimports complicate refactoring and can cause circular import errors.

I suggest adding a rule that will warn on import if the imported object was not created in the source, is not listed in `__all__` and is not from a library.

`Ruff` can only analyze one file at a time.

Thank you! I think this is a duplicate of #19559.
