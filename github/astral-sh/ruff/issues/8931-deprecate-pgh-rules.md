# Deprecate `PGH` rules

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-11-30 22:20_

See discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7506

We should deprecate this rule category gated by preview mode. Where there exists a similar rule i.e. in Bandit, we should redirect.

We can then remove the category later.
