# [Feature request] multi-line method invocation style / multiline unhug parens (like add-trailing-comma)

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2023-03-24 11:48_

https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1058#issuecomment-1469037727
> `add-trailing-commas` also has [unhug-trailing-paren](https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma#unhug-trailing-paren), [unhug-leading-paren](https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma#unhug-leading-paren) and [avoids arbitrary indentation](https://github.com/asottile/add-trailing-comma#multi-line-method-invocation-style----why). Which is not enforced by Ruff or Autopep8. Even Black only enforces it when magic commas are used:
> 
> ```python
> # This is found acceptable by Ruff, Autopep8 and Black
> print(1,
>       2,
>       3,
>       4,
>       5)
>       
> # This is what add-trailing-commas changes it to
> print(
>     1,
>     2,
>     3,
>     4,
>     5,
> )
> ```
> 
> So Ruff hasn't yet completely replaced it for me, though I'd love to see it get there. Is this the right place or should I open a new issue?

Update:
Both Black and Ruff now formats:
```py
#from 
print(1,
      "looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong",
      2,
      3,
      4,
      5)
      
# to
print(
    1,
    "looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong",
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
)

###

# from 
print(1,
      2,
      3,
      4,
      5)
      
# to
print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

I would still like it as a fixable styling lint rule, as Ruff format still has *some* of the things I dislike about Black and prefer autopep8 for.

I also think that just like https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8279, the following should not be flagged (or split-off) as an improvement over `add-trailing-comma`:
```py
# This is better
print([
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
])

# but add-trailing-comma does:
print(
  [
      1,
      2,
      3,
      4,
      5,
  ],
)
```
