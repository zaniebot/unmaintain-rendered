# Using ruff_linter programmatically

---

_Issue opened by @mavwolverine on 2025-06-13 01:18_

### Question

As part of a gen AI solution, I need to verify the docstrings generated by the AI solution, before actually inserting them.
From what I understand, currently ruff code doesn't have any Python bindings.
I tried writing a rust wrapper library and was able to include and use `use crate::rules::pydocstyle::settings::{Convention, Settings};`
But then I couldn't figure out how to actually validate the rules.
I can use subprocess, but then it is difficult to parse the response programatically.

Is there any way this could be acheived?

Thanks

### Version

It looks like you can set the output format with `--output-format`, and one of the options is `json`, so would that resolve the subprocess parsing issue? From the [full command line interface docs section](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#full-command-line-interface)
