# Remove deprecated `format` option

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-09-25 08:54_

The `--format` CLI option and `format = "text"` options have been deprecated with 0.0.291. 

We should remove these options as part of the 0.1.0 for better error messages when the `format` section isn't valid.
