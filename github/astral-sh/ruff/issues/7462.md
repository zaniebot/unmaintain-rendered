## Input 

```python
if grid is not None:
    rgrid = (rgrid
                .rio.reproject_match(grid,
                                    nodata=fillvalue) # rio.reproject nodata is use to initlialize the destination array
                .where(~grid.isnull())
                )

```

## Format 1

```python
if grid is not None:
    rgrid = (
        rgrid.rio.reproject_match(
            grid, nodata=fillvalue
        ).where(  # rio.reproject nodata is use to initlialize the destination array
            ~grid.isnull()
        )
    )
```

## Format 2

```python
if grid is not None:
    rgrid = rgrid.rio.reproject_match(
        grid, nodata=fillvalue
    ).where(  # rio.reproject nodata is use to initlialize the destination array
        ~grid.isnull()
    )
