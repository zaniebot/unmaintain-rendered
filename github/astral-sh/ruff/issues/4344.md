# W505 not triggered on multi-line docstring

---

_Issue opened by @andyluooo on 2023-05-10 13:03_

I've enabled W505 and set max-doc-length to 72. However, it didn't trigger when I exceed the limit on muti-line docstring. 
For example:
```python
def foo():
    """A VERY-LONG summary that exceed 72 characters."""  # W505 triggered as usual 
    return
```
However:
```python
def foo():
    """A short summary.
   
    A VERY-LONG description that exceed 72 characters.  # Nothing happened
    """
    return
```
I'd like to know if it's a bug or it's as designed. As instructed in PEP 8, docstrings should be wrapped at 72 characters, and Ruff is expected to warn that.

My configuration in .ruff.toml like: 
```toml
select = ["W505", "D", "UP", "RUF100"]

ignore = ["D1"]

target-version = "py311"

[pycodestyle]
max-doc-length = 72

[pydocstyle]
convention = "google"
```
