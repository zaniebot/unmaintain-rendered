Nice. Is this done, or are there more?

So that last `trio` exclusive rule in ruff is `ASYNC105`, however it has also remained `trio` only in the reference `flake8-async` plugin.
>ASYNC105: missing-await
async trio function called without using await. This is only supported with trio functions, but you can get similar functionality with a type-checker.

expanding the rule is dependent on multi-file type checking so I think it can just be left as is for now.

@charliermarsh I don't think you should close this. Currently I updated the rules to match the upstream behavior, but the change is gated behind preview. I think @MichaReiser meant this issue to track the removal of gating which can be released in the 0.6 release (or 0.7 I thought?).
