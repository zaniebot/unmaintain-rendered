# [Documentation] Link to closed issue in ERA001

---

_Issue opened by @JackDyre on 2024-06-30 04:36_

[This](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/commented-out-code/) page on the documentation links to [this](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4845) issue as a known issue with the rule, but the issue is closed. 

I assume the documentation needs to be updated?

Unfortunately I believe some of these false positives still exist, and the issue was closed (IIRC) because we changed the applicability level of the rule.
