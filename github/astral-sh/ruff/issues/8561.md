# should the docs for pre-commit point to the latest ruff?

---

_Issue opened by @raybellwaves on 2023-11-08 14:20_

https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/#pre-commit (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/docs/integrations.md#pre-commit) currently lists v0.0.291 as the ruff version the latest version is v0.1.4.

It would be good to have the latest version listed so users can copy-paste it and get the latest and greatest ruff features.

I imagine this could be fixed with a bot once new versions are released
