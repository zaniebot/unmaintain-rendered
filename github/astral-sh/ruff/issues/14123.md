# Request: Fix to remove docstrings in stubs (PYI021/docstring-in-stub)

---

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2024-11-06 06:19_

I'd like `PYI021` to provide an autofix (even an "unsafe" one is fine by me) to easily remove docstrings that may be generated by other tools. For example, https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/tree/main/stubs/sympy-stubs#remove-doc-comments has a custom script to remove docstrings that could be replaced by Ruff.

I'm leaning towards making this fix unsafe by default, just because it's fairly destructive and the docstring could have contained meaningful text.
