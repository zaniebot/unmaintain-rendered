_Issue opened by @dimbleby on 2023-02-21 17:35_

```
$ ruff .
foo.py::1:3: EXE001 Shebang is present but file is not executable
Found 1 error.

$ chmod +x foo.py

$ ruff .
foo.py::1:3: EXE001 Shebang is present but file is not executable
Found 1 error.
```
Need to clear the ruff cache to get it to notice that this is fixed.
