# `unconventional-import-alias (ICN001)`: Add `import numpy.typing as npt` to default `lint.flake8-import-conventions.aliases`

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2025-03-27 23:04_

### Summary

[lint.flake8-import-conventions.aliases](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-import-conventions_aliases) already has `import numpy as np` but not `import numpy.typing as npt` which you can see in https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/typing.html is part of the numpy import alias convention.
