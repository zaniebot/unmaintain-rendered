# Print a message if a newer version is available

_Issue opened by @beardgans on 2022-09-01 20:00_

👋 Hi there!

I found this feature in the [GitHub CLI application](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/internal/update/update.go) and [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/lib/utils/update-notifier.js).

I think it'll be useful for users who install `ruff` via `PyPi`.
And this will let them know that a new version is available and it's time to update.

Ready-made crate to implement that: [update-informer](https://github.com/mgrachev/update-informer)
