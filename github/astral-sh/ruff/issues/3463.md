# Implement flake8-variables-names

---

_Issue opened by @Cielquan on 2023-03-12 17:21_

# [flake8-variables-names](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-variables-names/)

Forbids ambiguous variable names.

### Error Codes
* [ ] `VNE001` single letter variable names like 'XXX' are not allowed
* [ ] `VNE002` variable name 'XXX' should be clarified
* [x] `VNE003` variable names that shadow builtins are not allowed

VNE003 is already implemented via A001.

I can take a look at this one :eyes:

`VNE001` is marginally covered by Pycodestyle's E741, but it only looks for
 `name == "l" || name == "I" || name == "O"` which could be confused with other letters, so this would need to cover all all single letter use cases for `VNE001`.
