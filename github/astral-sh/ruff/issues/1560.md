# Possibly a false positive for UP007

---

_Issue opened by @rassie on 2023-01-02 20:02_

Here is a bit of code I adapted [from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61753056/partial-update-in-fastapi/71135795#71135795) to make Pydantic model's fields optional:

```python
def convert_to_optional(schema: type[Base]) -> dict:
    return {k: Optional[v] for k, v in schema.__annotations__.items()} 
```

This triggers UP007, proposing to replace `Optional[v]` with `v | None`, which the compiler denies (`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'str' and 'NoneType'`). Since `v` is a value and not a type, I suppose this is a false positive.

That being said: I consider this issue edge-casey and thus simply informative, both for developers and people searching the web for the problem. I'm fully  content with just adding `# noqa: UP007` to that line and be done with it.

Let me see if pyupgrade handles this case correctly.

I think this is actually just a bug.

It looks like pyupgrade avoids these, presumedly for this reason.
