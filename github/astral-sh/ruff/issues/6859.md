# `PT007` docs should link to `parametrize-values-type` config option

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-08-24 19:56_

Currently, `ruff==0.0.285`'s docs for [`pytest-parametrize-values-wrong-type`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/pytest-parametrize-values-wrong-type/)/`PT007` links to [flake8-pytest-style.parametrize-values-row-type](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings#flake8-pytest-style-parametrize-values-row-type).

It should also link to [flake8-pytest-style.parametrize-values-type](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#flake8-pytest-style-parametrize-values-type) as the `flake8-pytest-style` [docs for `PT007`](https://github.com/m-burst/flake8-pytest-style/blob/master/docs/rules/PT007.md) do.
