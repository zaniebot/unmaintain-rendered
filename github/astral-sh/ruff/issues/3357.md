Hi,

See here: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/51794

The TCH code is reporting lots of errors in typing stub files (`.pyi`) - is this right? They're only used by the type checker anyway, perhaps `TCH` shouldn't run for this file type?

My initial reaction is that you’re right. Let me see what the originating plug-in does (though we may want to change it anyway even if they run on pyi files).

I didn't think flake8 ran on cython files to begin with (or at least, [wasn't meant to](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/1482))

Sorry, I might be misunderstanding - we’re talking about pyi stub files here, not Cython files, right?

sorry I'm mixing up things (in pandas I think `.pyi` files are only used to provide annotations for cython files), but the link makes it look like `flake8` is only supposed to run on Python files

running it on a directory doesn't pick up the stub files, but indeed, passing them explicitly, the original plugin would flag them
```console
(.311venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/pandas-dev$ flake8 pandas/_libs --select=TC001
(.311venv) marcogorelli@DESKTOP-U8OKFP3:~/pandas-dev$ flake8 pandas/_libs/lib.pyi --select=TC001
pandas/_libs/lib.pyi:16:1: TC001 Move application import 'pandas._typing.DtypeObj' into a type-checking block
pandas/_libs/lib.pyi:16:1: TC001 Move application import 'pandas._typing.npt' into a type-checking block
pandas/_libs/lib.pyi:16:1: TC001 Move application import 'pandas._typing.ArrayLike' into a type-checking block
```

Ahh ok, got it. Well, I think it makes sense to exclude these rules from the TCH checks, I don't see a benefit in enforcing those rules on stub files.

I can fix this today.

using if `TYPE_CHECKING` in pyi files probably also violates flake8-pyi's Y002
