# Autofix on `FLY002` produces a syntax error

---

_Issue opened by @danparizher on 2023-05-12 18:35_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Code Snippet:
```py
a = "bar"
b = "baz"

c = "x".join([a, "foo", b])
print(c)
```
After Autofix:
```py
a = "bar"
b = "baz"

c = "f"{a}xfoox{b}"
print(c)
```
It looks like the double quote marks are misplaced and create a syntax error

I'm unable to reproduce with that snippet -- is this the entire file?

Yes, it's the entire file. Here's a recording of what I did:

Ohh sorry sorry. This is because we need to release the updated LSP version. I'm in the middle of doing that now but got distracted because we have a different issue with how this release was packaged. All your fixes will be off-by-one until that update is out. I recommend just downgrading for now.
