# Star patterns in `match` statement aren't captured

---

_Issue opened by @dosisod on 2023-02-23 07:29_

The following program:

```python
match [123]:
    case [*x]:
        print(x)

match {"abc": 123}:
    case {**x}:
        print(x)
```

Emits the following errors:

```
$ ruff file.py
file.py:3:15: F821 Undefined name `x`
file.py:7:15: F821 Undefined name `x`
```

Currently using the latest version:

```
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.252
```
