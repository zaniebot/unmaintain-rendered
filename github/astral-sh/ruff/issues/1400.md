# Rule proposal: keyword argument before star arguments

---

_Issue opened by @andersk on 2022-12-27 09:26_

Python disallows `f(kw=a, b)`, `f(**a, b)`, and `f(**a, *b)`, but for some reason it does not disallow `f(kw=a, *b)`, which has an unexpected evaluation order as of 3.5 (python/cpython#100549). We could add a warning for this.
