# new rule: enforce consistent capitalisation of `noqa` statements

---

_Issue opened by @danieleades on 2024-01-21 09:55_

- enforce consistent capitalisation of `noqa` statements
- default to `noqa`, but allow configuring to `NOQA` or `NoQA`

@charliermarsh i'd be happy to take a run at implementing this, but i'd need some pointers. I had a quick look at the repo structure and the docs, but it wasn't immediately clear to me. Are there any similarly-implemented rules i should use as an example?

This would be resolved by #14111, but there was a design problem.
