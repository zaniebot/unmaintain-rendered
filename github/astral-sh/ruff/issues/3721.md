# Big pack of files that cause problems

---

_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-03-24 19:36_

Here I will public packs of broken files(mostly autofix bugs), that I found when fuzzing project.
I know that such issues should be created in separate issues, but I don't really have time to do this(there is ~700 broken files, which most probably have same source of problems), so feel free to do report it if you want.

I will try to provide new pack of  broken files for each release

Command which I used
```
ruff . --fix --config ruff.conf
```
ruff.conf (please comment, if there is better way to test even more rules, or get better coverage of project)
```
select = ["ALL"]
exclude = []
```

A lot of files is minimized, so I suggest to check first the smallest files(a lot of files have less than 1KB ).

Thank you! This is great, no need to file separate issues.

@qarmin can I ask how you generated these fuzzed files? I'd be interested for doing the same for my own linter (elm-review, for Elm).

@jfmengels -- I believe it was done with `cargo-fuzz`, see https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/3507.

https://crates.io/crates/create_broken_files - tool to create broken files

https://github.com/qarmin/Automated-Fuzzer - wrapper on this tool, that automates creating and checking broken files

I used before cargo fuzz, but I was only able to find only one bug with it - https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/3336, all others bug reports comes from this tools

Closing since I managed to report them one by one without too much duplicates
