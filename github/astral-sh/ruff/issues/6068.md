# Formatter: boolean operator should have equal level

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-07-25 11:13_

We format `and` in one line and break the `or`, even though like black we should break both

black:
```python
if not (
    isinstance(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb)
    or numpy
    and isinstance(ccccccccccc, dddddd)
):
    pass

if not (
    isinstance(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb)
    and numpy
    or isinstance(ccccccccccc, dddddd)
):
    pass
```
ours:
```python
if not (
    isinstance(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb)
    or numpy and isinstance(ccccccccccc, dddddd)
):
    pass

if not (
    isinstance(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, bbbbbbbbb) and numpy
    or isinstance(ccccccccccc, dddddd)
):
    pass
```
