# Feature request: undocumented-private-*

---

_Issue opened by @duelafn on 2024-11-17 18:00_

Hello, great project! Our project requires documentation for all items, not just public, but the D100 through D107 checks will only apply to public items (listed in `__all__`). Would be possible to either add new additional checks against non-public items or else a setting that would make D100 through D107 flag non-public items as well?

Thanks!
