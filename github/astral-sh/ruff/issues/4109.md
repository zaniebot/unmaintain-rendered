# Docs request: linking settings with rules

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-04-26 00:56_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

I made https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/4106 because I didn't know how to configure `ruff`'s internal `isort`.  I had just been looking here: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#isort-i.

However, there's a whole `isort` config section here: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort

The request: can we link the settings page in the rules page, for all tools where both pages exist?

It would be nice to include a reference + link to the settings at the top of each rule section.
