# CI: Add CI step to check for unused dependencies

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-03-21 08:49_

Add a new CI job to the [`ci.yaml`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml) workflow that checks for unused dependencies using [`cargo udeps`](https://github.com/est31/cargo-udeps). It will help us keeping the `[dependencies]` and `[dev-dependencies]` sections accurate. 

> Note: You can use [install-development-tools](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-development-tools) to install `cargo-udeps` instead of building it from source.
