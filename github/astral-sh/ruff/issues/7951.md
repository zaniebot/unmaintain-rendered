# Add parentheses around power operations

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-10-13 16:40_

Ours:
```python
self.assertRaises(IndexError, lambda: b[-10**100])
```
Black:
```python
self.assertRaises(IndexError, lambda: b[-(10**100)])
```
We should implement the same rules as black to add parentheses around power operations.

Is this documented anywhere in the style guide?
