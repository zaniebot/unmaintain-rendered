# document pyupgrade min py version determination

---

_Issue opened by @nstarman on 2023-01-17 17:02_

In pyupgrade one can pass the minimum python version for which pyupgrade should find and apply improvements: e.g. ``—py29-plus``. I can't find documentation for how this is done in Ruff's implementation of pyupgrade.

`target-version` is used for that https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#target-version

Thanks!

Yup that's right -- we use `target-version`, which effectively mimics Black API!
