# F401 false positive when import is used in stringified generic subscript

_Issue opened by @sterliakov on 2024-03-30 22:47_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Keywords: `F401`, "unused import", "generics"
This closely resembles #9121 

## Reproducer:

```python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Generic, TypeVar
    
if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from uuid import UUID

_T = TypeVar('_T')

class Base(Generic[_T]): ...
class Derived(Base["UUID"]): ...
```

Output:
```
$ ruff check --isolated a.py
a.py:4:22: F401 [*] `uuid.UUID` imported but unused
Found 1 error.
[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

## Configiration

Ruff settings: reproduces without `pyproject.toml` on default settings.
Ruff version: `0.3.4` installed from PyPI


## Notes

Autofixer removes this import, obviously causing `mypy` error (`name "UUID" is not defined [name-defined]`) later.

We don't currently have any logic to infer whether an arbitrary subscript operations is a generics, but we expose an `extend-generics` setting that you can use to tell Ruff to treat `Base` as such.

Ough, sorry, this ticket is anyway a duplicate of #9298, I'll post my further suggestion there instead and close this.
