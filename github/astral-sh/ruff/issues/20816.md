# nvim autocomplete for `"".<method>` is not working?

---

_Issue opened by @tyoc213 on 2025-10-12 05:21_

### Summary

Autocomplete is not working on my setup?

I see same numbers of errors if I paste my code to https://play.ruff.rs/

But when I try to use autocomplete for a variable I get no plausible completion, and my test case is autocomplete after `"".` hitting ctrl+tab did show autocompletion but didnt show the methods of `string`.

This behaviour is expected or should I get usable methods for autocompletion?

I copied ruff settings from https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#__tabbed_1_2

Ruff only provides formatting and linting. It doesn't provide any auto-completion, neither in the playground or in VS Code. For auto completion, you'd have to use a type checker like Pyright, https://github.com/astral-sh/ty or pyrefly.

My bad,As I saw https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp pointing to just ruff and I always thought an LSP was the same as autocompletion and thought ruff should be completing things.
