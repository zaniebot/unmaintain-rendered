# "Cleanup" markdown test names

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-10-16 06:24_

I don't know if rstest allows to do that but the generated test names are hard to read and the enumerating of the tests also leads to instable identifiers across runs (changing test names can be very annoying when bisecting a test failures).

It would be nice if we could:

* remove the `path` prefix
* remove the index
* remove the `resources_md` prefix
* remove the `md` postfix

Ideally, we would use the markdown title but that's probably not possible.

I think removing the `resources_md` should be possible by using the `#[base_dir = "/path/to/your/files"]` attribute. [dir-test](https://crates.io/crates/dir-test) allows customizing the test names

@MichaReiser , 
I think, Instead of removing `resource_md`, we should remove `resource_`.

Is this modification okay?

@Aditya-PS-05 ahh, the `md` isn't the file extension but comes from `mdtest`. Yes, that looks better

I think this is all done following #13831! (Please reopen if I'm mistaken!)
