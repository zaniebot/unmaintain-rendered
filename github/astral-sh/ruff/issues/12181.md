# [red-knot]: Handle cancellation in main loop

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-07-04 06:33_

The program currently panics when Salsa cancels a pending query. I [reached out in the Salsa zulip](https://salsa.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/145099-general/topic/How.20to.20use.20.60Cancelled.3A.3Acatch.60) to learn out how to use Cancelled::catch correctly.
