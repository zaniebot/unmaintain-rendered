# SIM117 causes space-tab mix

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-26 20:43_

`SIM117` transforms
```python
with open() as fd:
	with open() as fd2:
		foo(
			1,
			2,
			3,
		)
```
(which is indented with tabs only)

into

```python
with open() as fd, open() as fd2:
    foo(
    	1,
    	2,
    	3,
    )
```
(which has a tab+space indentation mixed).
