# Be able to specify supported Python version for `UP`

_Issue opened by @ThatXliner on 2023-02-21 19:33_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

The Pyupgrade rule set doesn't seem to be configurable to what minimally support Python version our project wants. For example, rule `UP007` is "Use `X | Y` for type annotations" which I don't want since I'm supporting 3.8+, which does not support the union syntax.

Sure, I can just ignore the rules that don't apply but I feel like being able to specify Python version is easier. But if you disagree, feel free to close this issue since this is more of an annoyance than a feature request or bug.

We do support this! Via [`target-version`](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#target-version), which you can specify on the command-line or in your `pyproject.toml`.

Thanks for the fast response! I was just looking at the docs when I realized that I missed that.

Another thought, perhaps it could be auto-detected via the package manager's configuration? For example, `[tool.poetry.dependencies.python]` in the `pyproject.toml` tells Poetry the Python version a project supports

No worries! Yeah this has come up before but I haven't started on it at all :joy: It's tracked in #2039.
