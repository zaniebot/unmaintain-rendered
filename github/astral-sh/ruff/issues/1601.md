```py
def test(*args, **kwargs):
    """A summary description.

    Args:
        *args: google-style expects *args, not args.
        **kwargs: google-style expects **kwargs, not kwargs.

    Note:
        https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html
    """
```

> test.py:1:1: D417 Missing argument descriptions in the docstring: `**kwargs`, `*args`

From https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html:

>     If ``*args`` or ``**kwargs`` are accepted,
>     they should be listed as ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``.
