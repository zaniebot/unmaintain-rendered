* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).

-->

Consider

```python
# repro_DOC.py

def my_func(arg: int) -> int:
    """Doer of things.

    Args:
        arg (int): The number to be doubled.

    Returns:
        int: The doubled number.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If arg cannot be multiplied by 2.
    """
    try:
        return arg * 2
    except TypeError:
        print("arg should be an integer")
        raise
```

`pydoclint` correctly detects the exception is re-reraised:

```console
$ pydoclint --style=google repro_DOC.py
Loading config from user-specified .toml file: pyproject.toml
No config found in pyproject.toml.
Skipping files that match this pattern: \.git|\.tox
repro_DOC.py
🎉 No violations 🎉
```

Ruff does not

```console
$ ruff check --select DOC repro_DOC.py
repro_DOC.py:12:1: DOC502 Raised exception is not explicitly raised: `TypeError`
   |
 7 |           arg (int): The number to be doubled.
 8 |   
 9 | /     Raises:
10 | |         TypeError: If arg cannot be multiplied by 2.
11 | |     """
   | |____^ DOC502
12 |       try:
13 |           return arg * 2
   |
```
