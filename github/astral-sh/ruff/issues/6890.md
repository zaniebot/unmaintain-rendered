...quoting the contents of `PY_FILE_TEST_5384603786.py`, the rule codes CPY001, E202, E702, E999, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!

Thanks! Minimal repro although an invalid syntax:

```python
foo;}
```

Using the command:

```
cargo run --bin ruff -- check --no-cache --isolated --select=E202,E231 t.py --fix
```

I'm not sure if this would be considered as a bug as it's an invalid syntax /cc @charliermarsh
