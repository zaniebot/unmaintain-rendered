# PLE1141 fix is suppressed for empty `dict`

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-11-05 21:19_

### Summary

The fix for [`dict-iter-missing-items` (PLE1141)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/dict-iter-missing-items/) is suppressed when the relevant `dict`’s keys are all 2-tuples in its initial binding. This usually makes sense, but it doesn’t make sense when the `dict` is defined as empty. In that case, there is no reason to assume that any keys added later will be 2-tuples, and that is a rare pattern so they probably won’t be, so PLE1141 should allow the fix. If the empty `dict` is annotated to have 2-tuple keys, as in `dict[tuple[int, str], bool]`, though, it is still appropriate to suppress the fix. [Example](https://play.ruff.rs/e6181e08-ba24-4009-a49d-33a13ad03e0e):
```console
$ cat >ple1141.py <<'# EOF'
data = {}
data["x"] = 1
for k, v in data:
    print(f"{k=} {v=}")
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check ple1141.py --select PLE1141 --preview
All checks passed!
```

I think it makes sense to try being a bit more aggressive here, especially since the rule is in preview. We should just double check the ecosystem report to make sure there aren't too many new false positives.
