# [red-knot] Rename `workspace_root` variables to `first_party_root` in the module resolver

---

_Issue opened by @AlexWaygood on 2024-07-15 12:09_

It's going to get confusing as we move towards proper workspace support, which might involve having multiple packages in one workspace, with each package having a different `first_party_root`.
