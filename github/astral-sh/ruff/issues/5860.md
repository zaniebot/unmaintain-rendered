# Feature request: docstring-min-length (pylint)

---

_Issue opened by @NoAchache on 2023-07-18 13:55_

Hello,

Would it be possible to include the pylint parameter: docstring-min-length?

It allows to only force writing docstrings if a function is bigger or equal to the specified min length.

I am really hoping this goes in to Ruff. Without it, things get very noisy since even this function will raise a warning:
```python
def sum(x, y):
    return x + y
```
It's completely self-explanatory.

It's also a way to disable the check of  docstrings all together ^^

Bumping to encourage decision from the maintainers. The Google Python style guide, for instance, uses `docstring-min-length`; projects conforming to it can't transition to Ruff because this is breaking the drop-in behavior.

Could someone explain to me how the length is measured? I don't see an obvious definition for a length if it comes to functions

number of lines in function body

E.g.
`t.py`
```
"""Hello"""

def sum1(x, y):
    return x + y

def sum2(x, y):
    out = x + y
    return out
```

```
pylint --docstring-min-length=1 t.py
************* Module t
t.py:3:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
t.py:6:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
```

```
pylint --docstring-min-length=2 t.py
************* Module t
t.py:6:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
```

Isn't this example indicative of an issue with this method compared to, for example, a complexity measure? Both `sum1` and `sum2` seem equivalent, so it would be unexpected if one required a docstring whereas the other did not.

If the goal is to provide feature parity for pylint users who want to transition while remaining compliant with, eg, Google’s standards, then the goodness of the complexity measure isn’t relevant. Number of lines is what pylint uses.

See: https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#docstring-min-length

Of course short functions are not necessarily less complex, but they tend to be. Or at least, there are a lot of trivial functions which do not warrant a docstring, and they tend to be short. If there are exceptions, the developer can always add a docstring if it feels like it's warranted. 

This would be quite a useful feature - otherwise docstrings become really tedious. Note that we do the same for comments - typically,  the following style of comments is discouraged: 

```python
# Sum x and y 
out = x + y 
```

Because it just adds visual clutter for absolutely no benefit. The same is true in functions docstrings, imo. 

Are you considering working on this feature?

Bumping this issue as I just set up ruff for a small project and it is really amazing and I wanted to set it up for a bigger project but this literally holds me back because we don't want to document really small functions.
I would be down to try implementing it with some guidance if nobody wants to work on it
