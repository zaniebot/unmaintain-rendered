# Smaller line length omits other issues

---

_Issue opened by @pespinel on 2023-10-24 08:41_

I've just seen that extending the line length on the ruff configuration brings "new" issues that are omitted when using a smaller line length:


line-length: 120

line-length: 140

Ruff command: `ruff check .`
Ruff version: `0.1.1`

Also see #8106, where I requested support for showing all autofixes regardless of line length.

I'm going to close this as a duplicate of #8106; thanks for raising!
