# Rule B010 cause autofix error

---

_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-05 14:44_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select B010 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
class GetBodyOptionsRequest(RpcRequest):
			setattr(self, "endpoint¾map", endpoint_data.getEndpointMap())
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/138_IDX_0_RAND_82345615504983930823594.py:2:4: B010 Do not call `setattr` with a constant attribute value. It is not any safer than normal property access.
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/138_IDX_0_RAND_82345615504983930823594.py`, the rule codes B010, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
