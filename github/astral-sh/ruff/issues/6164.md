<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

For example, the following code:

```python
(
    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa %s %s"
    % (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
)
```

is fixed to:

```python
(
    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa {} {}".format(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)
)

```

I have a fix for this, but wanted to make sure this is not intended first.

Hey, thanks for opening this issue. I don't think a rule fix should consider line length, it should be the job of the formatter to break long lines.

@dhruvmanila Thanks for the comment. UP032 is similar to this rule and not raised if the fixed code exceeds the line length limit.

In UP031, ignoring the line length might make sense because a formatter could fix it.
