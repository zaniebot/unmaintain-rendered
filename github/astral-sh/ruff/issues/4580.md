PYI009 seems like a rule that would have a really easy autofix and would be a good first issue for new contributors (just replace `pass` with `...`). This is also a low risk fix since they should be essentially semantically equivalent in this context. Many of the other PYI rules might also have low risk fixes as well that could be added.

I would like to try a first autofix. I'll see if I can give this a go.

PR open, checked a recent PR for required changes. If this works, I can have a look at some of the other PYI rules as well.
