# Formatter: Triage and decide on deviations

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-09-25 12:01_

Triage the [open deviation](https://github.com/orgs/astral-sh/projects/3/views/5?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) issues. Decide on which deviations are intentional (mark as Deviation: Intentional) and as part of which milestone/iteration they need fixing.
