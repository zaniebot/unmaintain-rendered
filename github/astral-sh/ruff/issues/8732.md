# (🎁) `bad-dunder-method-name` config option

---

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2023-11-17 01:12_

It would be logical that there is a configuration for `bad-dunder-method-name` as arbitrary libraries can 'define' them:
```py
from pydantic import GetCoreSchemaHandler
from pydantic_core import CoreSchema


class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def __get_pydantic_core_schema__(  # PLW3201 Bad or misspelled dunder method name `__get_pydantic_core_schema__`. (bad-dunder-name)
        cls, source_type: type[object], handler: GetCoreSchemaHandler
    ) -> CoreSchema: ...
```

Something like:
```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
bad-dunder-method-name-exceptions = ["__get_pydantic_core_schema__"]
```

Also, the error message should reference this config option. (based mode: the LSP should offer to add it to the config)
