<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
I have drafted a [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/Eric-Mendes/private-calls-pre-commit) to make sure there isn't a private function being called outside of the module it was defined. Would it make sense as an optional linting rule? If so I'd be happy to contribute with code.

Is this similar to [`private-member-access`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/private-member-access/)?

Perhaps it could be an extension to that rule, @charliermarsh. My code doesn't check for class private member access. It checks for module private member access. Here's an example of something that should raise an exception:
```python
# a.py
def _foo(*args, **kwargs):
    return "Hello World"
```

```python
# b.py
import a

print(a._foo())  # Raises an exception
```

```python
# c.py
from a import _foo

print(_foo())  # Also raises an exception
```

Have I misunderstood the rule you've mentioned, or am I really onto something here?

Indeed, @charliermarsh. Thanks for pointing that out, I didn't see that issue before.
