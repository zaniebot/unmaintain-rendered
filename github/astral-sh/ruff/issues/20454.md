We've been a bit hesitant to stabilize most of the `pycodestyle`/`E` rules because even when they don't _conflict_ with the formatter, they still overlap with the formatter's functionality. All of these rules have been in preview long enough to consider stabilizing, but I think we want to decide what to do with them long-term as a group rather than stabilizing individual rules.

Is there a reason you're interested in this one in particular?

Some of these rules are PEP8 compliant, I would like to see them in stable, as not everyone uses the formatter

In fact `black` / `ruff format` doesn't fully format the code in PEP8 style either

Although PEP8 makes the following [recommendations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations):

IMHO E302 should absolutely be part of the default rules. Just as one example: If E302 is not enabled but I001 is, `ruff check --fix` can leave blank lines at the top of the file, which is almost certainly not what you want.
