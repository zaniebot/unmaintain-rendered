```

attribute = 'foo'
template = '({}={{0!e}})'.format(attribute)
print(template)
$ python3 foo.py
(foo={0!e})
$ ruff --select UP032 --fix foo.py
$ cat foo.py
attribute = 'foo'
template = f'({attribute}={0!e})'
print(template)
$ python3 foo.py
  File "foo.py", line 2
    template = f'({attribute}={0!e})'
