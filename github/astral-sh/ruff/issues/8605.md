# [D417] Missing argument descriptions in the docstring for `**kwargs` and `*args` should be allowed

---

_Issue opened by @mikeweltevrede on 2023-11-10 15:46_

I would expect D417 to not require `*args` and `**kwargs` to be put in the descriptions. Maybe this is not good practice, in which case please let me know.

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
```
def f(*args, **kwargs):
    """Description"""
```

* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
`pre-commit install` with the following config:

```
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.1.4
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
      - id: ruff-format
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-ast
      - id: check-case-conflict
      - id: check-json
      - id: check-toml
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: name-tests-test
        exclude: ^tests/utils/
      - id: no-commit-to-branch
      - id: trailing-whitespace

```

* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).

```
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pre-commit = "3.5.0"
ruff = "0.1.4"
pre-commit-hooks = "4.5.0"

[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = [
    "D",  # pydocstyle
]
ignore = ["B026", "D100", "D415", "ANN101", "ANN102", "ANN002", "ANN003"]

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
convention = "google"
```

* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
    * 0.1.4

Ah yeah, I think this is correct, though it should only be triggering if you include an `Args:` section in your docstring. If you _do_ document the arguments, I believe it's intended that you also document the `*args` and `**kwargs`, and this matches `pydocstyle` behavior.

If your signature is _just_ `*args` and `**kwargs` as above, then it probably makes sense to omit the `Args:` section altogether -- if I run `ruff check --select D417` on the example you provided above, we don't raise an error, which makes sense to me, but are you seeing differently? Here's an example from the [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/5deffe8c-8d30-4c62-b5e0-8178257ce6f5) with that rule selected.

That is a fair comment. I had something like the following:

```
def f(path, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Description

    Args:
        path: xxx
    """
```

I guess then I would have to provide documentation for `args` and `kwargs`, thanks!
