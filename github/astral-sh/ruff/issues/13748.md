# Skip first line of source ("`python -x`")

---

_Issue opened by @mheden on 2024-10-14 11:57_

Is it possible to make `ruff` ignore the first line of a source file.

I have some scripts that are using a "non-unix" verson form of shebang which I then run them with `python -x`. Since this line is not proper Python the ruff parser bails out on the first line.

No. There's currently no support for skipping over lines at the start of a file. Supporting such functionality likely requires a per-file configuration option.

I do something like this as a workaround: `tail -n +2 <file> |  ruff check -`. It is not optimal (line numbers are off by one) but works well enough. I don't have found a way of working around `ruff format` yet.
