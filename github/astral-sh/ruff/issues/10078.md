<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

```python
a = {}


def f() -> None:
    global a
    a[1] = 1
    a[2] = 2


if __name__ == "__main__":
    f()
    print(a)
```
Command: `ruff  check --isolated  --select PLW0602 file.py `

Ruff output:

This isn't a false positive, there's indeed no assignments to a, only keys of a

Nice catch @graingert 

That's correct. You can remove the `global a` and Python will resolve `a` to the symbol from the outer scope

```python
a = {}


def f() -> None:
    a[1] = 1
    a[2] = 2


if __name__ == "__main__":
    f()
    print(a)
```
