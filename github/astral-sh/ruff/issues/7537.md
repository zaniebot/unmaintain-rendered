# [rule] replace `if key in dict: del dict[key]` with `dict.pop(key, None)`

_Issue opened by @dorschw on 2023-09-20 08:31_

I'd suggest it to flake8-simplify, but their repo seems inactive since late March 😞 
If there's a better place to suggest it, please let me know and I'll copy it there.

```diff
- if key in dictionary:
-     del dictionary[key]
+ dictionary.pop(key, None)
```

Seems reasonable to me as a `ruff` rule.

You should bring this rule up to the flake8-simplify folks too, they love this kind of stuff and if they implement it, we have a nice rule code for us to build on.

Some PRs there were merged recently, I may be able to implement it in
python there.
