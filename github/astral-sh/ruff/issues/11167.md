# Rule proposal: require raw strings for regex patterns

---

_Issue opened by @andersk on 2024-04-26 18:49_

We could have a rule that enforces the [`re` documentation’s recommendation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) of rewriting `re.compile("pattern")` to `re.compile(r"pattern")`, and similar for the first argument of `re.search`, `re.match`, `re.fullmatch`, `re.split`, `re.findall`, `re.finditer`, `re.sub`, `re.subn`.

Prior art: [flake8-literal](https://github.com/plinss/flake8-literal) `LIT103` with the `literal-re-pattern-raw` option set to `always`.
