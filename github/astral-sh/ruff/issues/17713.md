# ERA001 false positives on seemingly-normal sentences

---

_Issue opened by @nicoonoclaste on 2025-04-29 15:08_

### Summary

I found another kind of false-positive case for ERA001:
```py
# Internal use: blake2 personalization strings
```

### Version

`ruff 0.11.7`

The overall issue sounds similar to #6100, but I'd guess the root cause (in the rule's heuristics) is different, so I opened a new issue

Thanks. Yes, we currently track the `ERA001` false positives in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6100.
