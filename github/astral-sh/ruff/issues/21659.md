### Summary

hello when running command

```bash
uv run ruff check .
```
with ruff version 0.14.6

on code snippet 

```python
def get_pair():
    """Return a pair of elements."""
    return 1, 2

Hmm, I'm not able to reproduce this in https://play.ruff.rs/4cc4b994-68c6-44c0-8e6d-8aaf5df0e005

What's your Ruff configuration? Any chance you set https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_dummy-variable-rgx
