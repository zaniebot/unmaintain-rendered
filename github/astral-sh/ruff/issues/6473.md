# Is there a way to raise `PT011` for any exception types?

_Issue opened by @harupy on 2023-08-10 06:58_

### Discussed in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/6382

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **harupy** August  7, 2023</sup>
I want to disallow calling `pytest.raises` without `match` **regardless of the error type**. Is there a way to achieve that? We could use [raises-require-match-for](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#flake8-pytest-style-raises-require-match-for) and specify all error types in a codebase there:


```toml
[tool.ruff.flake8-pytest-style]
raises-require-match-for = ["ALL", "ERROR", "TYPES", "IN", "THIS", "REPO", "..."]
```
</div>

Is there an easier way?

### Ideas

- Regular expression (e.g. `[".*"]`)
- Wildcard (e.g. `["requests.*"]`).
- Inroduce a special name (e.g., `"ALL"`).
- Treat an empty array as any error types.

We could probably support globbing... We already use globbing for _some_ settings, like https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort-extra-standard-library.

Globbing sounds good :)

Can I implement this?

That'd be great, thanks.
