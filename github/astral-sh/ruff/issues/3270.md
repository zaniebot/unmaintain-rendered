# TRY200 false positive inside function definition inside except block

---

_Issue opened by @manueljacob on 2023-02-28 10:59_

```python
def good():
    try:
        from mod import f
    except ImportError:
        def f():
            raise MyException()
```

Currently, with ruff 0.0.253, this prints “TRY200 Use `raise from` to specify exception cause”, but setting the ImportError as the exception cause inside `f()` wouldn’t make any sense.
