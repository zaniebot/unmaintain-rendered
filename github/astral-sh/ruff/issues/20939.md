# Explore the 'Marker' idea from the skip formatter

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2025-10-17 14:00_

Ruff's formatter is based on the same algorithm as Prettier. 

> It haunted me so much that when I built the Skip pretty printer, I ended up finding a much more [elegant solution using the notion of a "marker"](https://github.com/skiplang/skip/blob/b63d2de7ed50a20519ba22b63b0a8a3d95728a65/src/runtime/prelude/stdlib/debug/Doc.sk#L80). If anyone reading is building a pretty printer based on the same infrastructure, I highly recommend using it instead.

From https://blog.vjeux.com/2025/javascript/birth-of-prettier.html#:~:text=Printing%20Difficulties

We should explore if we can use this `Marker` to replace `BestFitting`
