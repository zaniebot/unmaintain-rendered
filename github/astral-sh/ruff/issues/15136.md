# Feature request: Autofix for `none-not-at-end-of-union (RUF036)`

---

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2024-12-24 19:05_

I tried out `RUF036` (in preview) today in typeshed and it found 140 errors. That would take a long time to fix manually, and I imagine an autofix for this rule should be doable.

As usual, marking it "unsafe" when comments are in the way is fine.

Ruff 0.8.4
Command: `ruff check --fix --preview --isolated --select=RUF036`

@jordyjwilliams Sorry for the ping, just wondering if this is still something you're working on? (could be forgotten, since it's been a while) I'm definitely looking forward to seeing autofixes for this rule !
