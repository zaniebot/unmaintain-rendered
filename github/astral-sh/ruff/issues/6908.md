# `E501` - option to customize line length

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2023-08-27 01:00_

also, it seems weird that [the docs only mention PEP 8's 79 character recommendation](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/line-too-long/#why-is-this-bad) but the number it actually uses 88 characters

Is this covered by https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#line-length ?

yeah, i guess i missed that because it wasn't mentioned in [the rule's "Options" section](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/line-too-long/#options). is there a reason for that?
