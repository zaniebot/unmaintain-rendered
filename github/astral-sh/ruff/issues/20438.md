# feat: support --output-format "filename"

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2025-09-16 16:49_

I would like to only get the filenames with violations printed, so I can easily open all of them in a editor like:

`vim -p $(ruff check --select G --output-format=concise -- .  $(python_files) | sed 's/:.*//' | grep -v Found | sort -u)`

which could be just:
`vim -p $(ruff check --select G --output-format=filename -- .  $(python_files))`

Hmm that's an interesting use case. If you have `jq` it might be slightly shorter to do something like this:

```shell
ruff check --output-format json | jq '.[].filename'
```

but that's probably the best existing option that I see.

I think past ruff versions (from the beginning) had the possibility to specify the output string like: `--format "{filename}:{lineno} {rule} {violation}"`.
That would also be nice. For example, sometimes I want to see only the affected code, which nowadays gets underlined in the "full" output with a large context.

For example so that I can display:
```
G002 Logging statement uses `%`

I think @ntBre's proposed solution is sufficient here. It also won't scale well if we need a different output format for every possible field combination and there's https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2350 that asks for a custom format
