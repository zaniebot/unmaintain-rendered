# new rule - ban `from __future__ import annotations` when targeting python >=3.14

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-10-07 08:04_

### Summary

`__future__.annotations` is deprecated as of python 3.14, see https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/#abstract

would be nice if ruff had a rule (similar to the existing pyupgrade rules) to suggest removing it.

I agree with the suggestion but not the reasoning: for most use-cases the default behavior of Python 3.14 will look the same with or without `from __future__ import annotations`, but it is not the case that `from __future__ import annotations` does nothing in Python 3.14 or is deprecated.

If you follow that link it specifies that `__future__.annotations` will not be deprecated until after Python 3.13 is EOL, which is quite a ways off. Until then `from __future__ import annotations` has the same effect in Python 3.14 as it did before - to turn annotations into strings. See the discussion around https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/18502#issuecomment-3355668188 for more.

hmm i guess i misread it then. although i the way i see it, "is deprecated" and "will subsequently be deprecated" mean the same thing to me as long as there's a suitable replacement. if the new behavior in 3.14 is intended to replace `from __future__ import annotations` then that means it doesn't make sense to use it at all in new code (unless targeting python <=3.13), regardless of whether it's formally deprecated.

i guess to avoid confusion the error message could say something like "`from __future__ import annotations` is *unneccessary* as of python 3.14" instead of "`from __future__ import annotations` is *deprecated* as of python 3.14"
