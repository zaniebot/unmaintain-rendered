# [red-knot] condense literal class and function types

---

_Issue opened by @carljm on 2024-06-06 21:51_

Display e.g. `Literal[C1, C2]`, not `Literal[C1] | Literal[C2]`

For now I think we should not mix different kinds of literals, i.e. we should still produce `Literal[1] | Literal[C] | Literal[f]`, not `Literal[1, C, f]`.

@carljm is this something a contributor could take up?

Sure. It should just be a localized change in `types/display.rs` for UnionType
Display, handled similarly to IntLiteral types.
