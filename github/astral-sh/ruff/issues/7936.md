# description of C408

_Issue opened by @yuuuxt on 2023-10-13 08:42_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Not reporting a bug - seeing [C408 description](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-collection-call/) saying `dict()` call is not necessary, while there is a useful use case - it can be used to prevent having duplicate (string) keys easily (ref: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22242922/4318625)). I'm using it for that purpose, so I have to disable `C408` check there.

Maybe it's worth mentioning in the C408 description? Thx

I appreciate this call-out though am not sure that it merits mentioning in the docs, since we'll still end up flagging C408 in that case.
