I was looking at ruff and rustc for inspo for lexing and the cursor files are pretty similar:

👋 I went on quite the hunt trying to see if there was context about this. As far as I can tell nobody talked about the rustc lexer and they probably would have if they based the design on it? I'm curious to hear from @MichaReiser though. 

Some references I looked at:

- https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6099
- https://github.com/astral-sh/RustPython-Parser/pull/38
- https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5715

Yes, we absolutely should. 

I was fairly certain that I mentioned in some comment that the implementation is derived from Rust in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/4922 (inline comment or at least on the PR), but I didn't!
