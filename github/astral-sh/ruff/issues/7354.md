# Rename `format` option to `output-format`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-09-13 16:32_

The `format` option could be confused with our formatter. It should be renamed to `output-format` in both the configuration file and CLI e.g.

`--format <kind>` -> `--output-format <kind>`
`format = <kind>` -> `output-format = <kind>`

The previous name should undergo a deprecation period during which we display a warning on use.

I think we'll want to look into building tooling for rename deprecations in our configuration macro.
