# Enforce every `tqdm()` has a `desc: str`

all instances of `tqdm` should have a description. when later inspecting logs e.g. from jobs that ran on HPC, this helps a lot to remember what the progress bar was tracking.

```py
from tqdm import tqdm

# bad
for ii in tqdm(range(10, 0, -1)):
    pass

# good
for ii in tqdm(range(10, 0, -1), desc="countdown"):
    pass

# bad
for ii in tqdm(range(10)):
    for jj in tqdm(range(10), leave=False):
        pass

# good
for ii in tqdm(range(10), desc="outer"):
    for jj in tqdm(range(10), desc="inner", leave=False):
        pass
```

open question is whether the rule should ignore `tqdm(leave=False)` cases. even with `leave=False`, it still shows up e.g. in slurm log files so leaning towards no.
