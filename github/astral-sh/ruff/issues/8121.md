<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

- [x] E275

All these rules are very similar, already implemented, and have a trivial autofix that should be added. It would also be a good first issue since the autofix is an easy one to write. @charliermarsh you may want to add a `good-first-issue` label.
