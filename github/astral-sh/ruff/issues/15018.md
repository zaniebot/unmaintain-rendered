# ruff cache folder contains many subfolders

---

_Issue opened by @yabirgb on 2024-12-16 11:14_

I noticed that I had a folder `.ruff_cache` and seems to have different subfolders

```
(rotki) ➜  rotki git:(migrate-movements) ✗ du -h .ruff_cache 
124K	.ruff_cache/0.1.11
132K	.ruff_cache/0.3.7
120K	.ruff_cache/0.3.0
156K	.ruff_cache/0.7.1
128K	.ruff_cache/0.5.2
132K	.ruff_cache/0.5.5
216K	.ruff_cache/0.1.5
132K	.ruff_cache/0.5.4
148K	.ruff_cache/0.7.0
132K	.ruff_cache/0.4.1
272K	.ruff_cache/0.6.2
872K	.ruff_cache/content
144K	.ruff_cache/0.6.4
648K	.ruff_cache/0.6.3
132K	.ruff_cache/0.4.7
240K	.ruff_cache/0.2.2
156K	.ruff_cache/0.8.2
248K	.ruff_cache/0.1.15
2.4M	.ruff_cache/0.5.6
256K	.ruff_cache/0.3.3
112K	.ruff_cache/0.1.9
3.0M	.ruff_cache/0.1.7
2.4M	.ruff_cache/0.5.7
604K	.ruff_cache/0.3.5
156K	.ruff_cache/0.8.0
148K	.ruff_cache/0.6.8
132K	.ruff_cache/0.4.2
1.8M	.ruff_cache/0.8.1
144K	.ruff_cache/0.6.7
132K	.ruff_cache/0.4.3
236K	.ruff_cache/0.4.4
144K	.ruff_cache/0.6.9
 16M	.ruff_cache
```

I belive those are all the ruff versions that I used in the project. Would it be possible to have some rule to autodelete it when I use a new ruff version? Is it fine if I delete them?

We store cache on a per-version basis which is what you're seeing there. It should be fine to remove cache from older versions or you can utilize `ruff clean` to remove all the cache and then the subsequent run should only create the cache folder for the version that you're using.
