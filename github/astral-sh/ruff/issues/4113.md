# Docs bug: default `show-fixes`

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-04-26 06:45_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

From https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#show-fixes

```toml
[tool.ruff]
# By default, always enumerate fixed violations.
show-fixes = true
```

Specifically the comment:

> `# By default, always enumerate fixed violations.`

This comment is incorrect, the default of `show-fixes` is actually `false`.  The comment should say something like:

> `# Enumerate all autofixed violations.`
