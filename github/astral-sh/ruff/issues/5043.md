# RUF008 false positive on class variable

---

_Issue opened by @hauntsaninja on 2023-06-13 07:05_

```
λ cat xyz.py
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class X:
    class_var = {}
    x: int

print(X(123).x)

λ ruff check xyz.py --select RUF008
xyz.py:5:17: RUF008 Do not use mutable default values for dataclass attributes
Found 1 error.
```
This is a false positive, `class_var` is not a dataclass attribute. Python 3.11 (which tries to error at runtime for mutable dataclass attributes) also accepts it
