if I accedently have flake8 enabled, sometimes it's enable dby the IDE itself globally, or a collegue opens the code base from his IDE, as ruff noqa has its own error code (for e.g. `AGR001` here) that flake8 is not aware. We can see some unexpected IDE warning:

Is it possible to create new ruff specific `noqa` keyword ? maybe `noruff` ?

We're probably going to redo suppression comments more holistically, so I'd like to hold off on making any incremental changes in the meantime, but I'm going to keep this open since it's a relevant issue for us to resolve with any improved design.
