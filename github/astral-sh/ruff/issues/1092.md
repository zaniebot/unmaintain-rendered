# [bug] Incorrect fix for `D210` (no whitespace surrounding docstring text)

---

_Issue opened by @smackesey on 2022-12-06 00:02_

When the summary ends in a double quote, the `D210` fix produces invalid Python:

```
### Before:

def local_image(self, python_version: str) -> str:
    """Generates the local image name, like: "dagster/foo:some-tag" """

### After:
def local_image(self, python_version: str) -> str:
    """Generates the local image name, like: "dagster/foo:some-tag""""
```

I think `ruff` should just not apply the fix if the docstring ends in a '"', since it's supposed to end in a period anyway.
