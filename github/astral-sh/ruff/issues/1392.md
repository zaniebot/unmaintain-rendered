# [playground, bug] Autofix doesn't work on the playground

---

_Issue opened by @Sawbez on 2022-12-26 20:10_

As seen in this image, the online playground doesn't allow you to quickfix `F401`, which has an autofix programmed in. None of the sidebar settings are changed.

Testing with other different categories (`W292`, `I001`) provides a similar result.

The original code is:
```python
import sys
import os

print(os.listdir())
```

You're too fast, the playground isn't ready for primetime!
