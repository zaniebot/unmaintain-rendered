# Syntax error in formatter known deviation docs

---

_Issue opened by @ulope on 2024-09-10 17:26_

The second example in the `Tuples are parenthesized when expanded` section of the known deviations docs contain a syntax error:

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/210a9e606807c56e0c38b14e21cf500432e79709/docs/formatter/black.md?plain=1#L460-L462

`for a, f(b,) in c:` is invalid syntax (`SyntaxError: cannot assign to function call`).
