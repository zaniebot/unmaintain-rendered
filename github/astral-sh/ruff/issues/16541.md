# B905 not being raised when "B" rules enabled

---

_Issue opened by @jackdent on 2025-03-06 18:26_

### Summary

Example code to reproduce:
```
some_list = [1, 2, 3]
for first_second in zip(some_list, some_list[1:]):
    print(first_second)
```
What I've tried:
- Adding both `B` and `B905` to my `extend-select` lint config (this _doesn't_ work)
- Disabling `B` and adding `B905` to my `extend-select` lint config (this _does_ work)

Is there a way to enable `B905` but leave the default `B` rules on by default? I noticed that opinionated `B9xx` rules are disabled by default (see [this thread](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4054#issuecomment-1539338629)), but I can't figure out how to turn them on. The suggestions in [this thread](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4102) didn't work unfortunately.

### Version

0.9.3

Would you be able to share your entire configuration? Using `extend-select=["B"]` on its own should be sufficient. So there must be something else going on. You can also try `ruff check --show-settings` to see what settings Ruff resolves to (and `ruff check -v --show-settings`)

It looks like your target version is being defaulted to 3.9 so the rule is not being applied. I don't understand why this magically changes things:

> Disabling B and adding B905 to my extend-select lint config (this does work)

Could you help us reproduce with some minimal setup instructions?

In the meantime you could try specifying your `target-version` in your `ruff` configuration and see if that solves the immediate concern.

Setting `target-version = "py311"` in my ruff.toml does work, thank you! (We have `requires-python = ">=3.11"` in our `pyproject.toml`)

Would a reproduction still be helpful or does that give you all the info you need?

Great to hear!

> We have requires-python = ">=3.11" in our pyproject.toml

does your `pyrpoject.toml` have a `[tool.ruff]` section? If not, then this is a known issue that should be resolved by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16319

If so, then I'd be interested in reproducing the problem so it'd be helpful to learn more

Our `pyproject.toml` does not have a `[tool.ruff]` section.
