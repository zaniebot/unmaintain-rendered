# T100 doesn’t flag `sys.breakpointhook` and `sys.__breakpointhook__`

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-02-16 16:03_

### Description

[`debugger` (T100)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/debugger/) doesn’t flag `sys.breakpointhook` and `sys.__breakpointhook__` in Ruff 0.9.6. It should, because T100 does flag `breakpoint`, which just calls `sys.breakpointhook`, and there is no reason to treat them differently. Also, Pylint’s [`forgotten-debug-statement` (W1515)](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/messages/warning/forgotten-debug-statement.html), which in #970 is mapped to T100, flags `sys.breakpointhook`.
