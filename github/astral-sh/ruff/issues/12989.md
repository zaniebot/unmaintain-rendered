Ruff 0.5.6

It seems that `ruff format` often moves semantic comments (such as `# type: ignore` or `# noqa: ...`) to inappropriate places that in the end make Ruff itself or other tools fail.

Ruffs current behaviour:

```diff
- from gitlab_batch_transformer.transformers.kraken.csttransformer import KrakenProjectDoTransformations  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
+ from gitlab_batch_transformer.transformers.kraken.csttransformer import (
+     KrakenProjectDoTransformations,  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
+ )
```

The correct way to put the `# type: ignore` command is on the first line:

```diff
- from gitlab_batch_transformer.transformers.kraken.csttransformer import KrakenProjectDoTransformations  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
+ from gitlab_batch_transformer.transformers.kraken.csttransformer import (  # type: ignore[attr-defined]
+     KrakenProjectDoTransformations,
+ )
```

Another example, Ruffs current behaviour:

```diff
# ruff format --line-length 30
- from . import foooooo, baaaaarrr  # noqa: F401,E402
+ from . import (
+     foooooo,
+     baaaaarrr,
+ )  # noqa: F401,E402
```

Resulting in the `# noqa` not take effect and `ruff check` to fail:

```
# ruff check rufftest.py 
rufftest.py:2:5: F401 [*] `.foooooo` imported but unused
  |
1 | from . import (
2 |     foooooo,
  |     ^^^^^^^ F401
3 |     baaaaarrr,
4 | )  # noqa: F401,E402
  |
  = help: Remove unused import

rufftest.py:3:5: F401 [*] `.baaaaarrr` imported but unused
  |
1 | from . import (
2 |     foooooo,
3 |     baaaaarrr,
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ F401
4 | )  # noqa: F401,E402
  |
  = help: Remove unused import

Found 2 errors.
[*] 2 fixable with the `--fix` option.
```

Again, the correct behaviour would be to keep the comment on the first line:

```diff
# ruff format --line-length 30
- from . import foooooo, baaaaarrr  # noqa: F401,E402
+ from . import (  # noqa: F401,E402
+     foooooo,
+     baaaaarrr,
+ )
```

I just found https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12901 which is basically the same issue.

Thanks for the excellent write up!


Yes, I think those are the same. I'll close this issue in favor of #12901
