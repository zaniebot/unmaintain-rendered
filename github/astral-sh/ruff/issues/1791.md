# SIM108 removes explanatory comments

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-11 22:36_

```
$ ruff --isolated  --select SIM108 foo.py
foo.py:1:1: SIM108 Use ternary operator `value = item if item.filename is not None else item.value` instead of if-else-block
Found 1 error(s).
1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
$ cat foo.py
if item.filename is not None:
    value = item  # It's a file upload
else:
    value = item.value  # It's a regular field
$ ruff --isolated  --select SIM108 --fix foo.py
Found 1 error(s) (1 fixed, 0 remaining).
$ cat foo.py
value = item if item.filename is not None else item.value  # It's a regular field
```

→ The leftover comment is not true anymore.
I would suggest to leave the code as is.

This is basically the same as #1719. I'll just disable the autofix if the code contains any comments.
