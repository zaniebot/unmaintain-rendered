pep8 rules must implement in ruff.
Some rules like:
* `String Quotes`
* `Whitespace in Expressions and Statements`
* And other rules

We can implement `--fix` for this rules like `autopep8`

I _think_ this can be considered a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402, which covers the pycodestyle rules, which in turn cover PEP 8.
