# Consistent and informative style for the "Options" section in rule documentation

---

_Issue opened by @InSyncWithFoo on 2024-11-15 00:05_

Currently, this is how the documentation for [`F821`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undefined-name/) is rendered in PyCharm and VSCode:

| PyCharm                                                                              | VSCode                                                                               |

Zoomed in:

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac62448b-fd3c-451c-98c3-2781db2b29e8)

And this is the only example I can find in which a description is included. All other 125 similar sections follow this format, plain and uninformative:

```markdown
## Options
- `foo.option1`
- `bar.option2`
```

The lack of proper links make such options non-interactable: The user can't just jump straight to the docs but forced to search all on their own. Leaving the IDE while working is uncomfortable.

----

Personally, I have a special use case as a plugin developer: resolving these links in-place. In other words, the rule's documentation can be directly and immediately replaced with the option's documentation, right inside the IDE, no browser involved.

PyCharm allows plugins to determine what to do on link clicks, and I want to take advantage of that. I'm already doing this for the options' documentation (e.g., `extend-select`, which mentions `select`). Currently, I'm forced to do the error-prone task of parsing Markdown myself; this shouldn't be necessary.

Adding the link to the options makes sense to me
