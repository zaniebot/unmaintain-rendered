To understand better: Do we want to follow the same approach for `typing.Any` and infer it as a known instance?
[Any](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/ca65e087f1f9dfc28e89192b60ce7cfc2e92c674/stdlib/typing.pyi#L134) is assigned an object. If we leave it as is then we just need to infer the `KnownClass::Object` in the annotations.

I think so. It's important that we distinguish internally between "members of the type `Any`" and "the singleton symbol that actually represents the `Any` type itself". Inferring the symbol `typing.Any` as a known instance allows us to do that.
