# S101 assert can be used in testing.

---

_Issue opened by @bytepure on 2025-12-22 06:51_

### Summary

https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/assert/

in testing, `assert` used frequently

so, is there a way to allow the use of `assert` command in tests, and in src not allow

```
project
  -src
  -tests
```

I think this is a perfect use case for the [per-file-ignores](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_per-file-ignores) setting with a value like:

```toml
[lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/*" = ["S101"]
```
