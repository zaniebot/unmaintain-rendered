# Proposal: detach file output format from output format

---

_Issue opened by @penguinolog on 2023-10-26 12:59_

Use-case:
`ruff` is used on jenkins CI. Text output is usually read by user, but also collected and parsed JUnitXML log.
At current moment is no method to specify file output format different from stdout otput format.
Proposal:
add `--output-file-format` CLI option in addition to existing `--output-file` option
