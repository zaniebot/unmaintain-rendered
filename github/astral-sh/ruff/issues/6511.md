# One or more modules are part of multiple import sections, including: `src`.

_Issue opened by @zhou13 on 2023-08-11 19:00_

When I run ruff against my codebase, I got the following:
```
     warning: One or more modules are part of multiple import sections, including: `src`
```
It is not clear to me what it means and how to avoid this warning. Googling does not yield any meaningful results.

Are you able to include your Ruff configuration? Hard to help without more information.

Sure:
```
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
select = ["F", "E", "W", "I001"] # pyflakes, pycodestyle, isort
ignore = [
    # E402 module level import not at top of file, very hard to workaround
    "E402",
    # Line too long
    "E501",
    # Do not use variables named 'I', 'O', or 'l'
    "E741",
]
unfixable = ["F401", "F841"]
extend-exclude = [
    "*external*",
    "third_party",
]
# Allow unused variables when underscore-prefixed.
dummy-variable-rgx = "^(_+|(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?))$"
src = ["src", "tests"]

target-version = "py310"

[tool.ruff.per-file-ignores]
"__init__.py" = ["F401"]

[tool.ruff.isort]
known-first-party = ["src"]
known-local-folder = ["src"]
```

Ruff version:
```
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.282
```

```toml
[tool.ruff.isort]
known-first-party = ["src"]
known-local-folder = ["src"]
```

This part here is telling Ruff that imports like `import src.foo` or `from src import bar` should be classified as both first-party and local-folder, so Ruff isn't sure how to classify them, since those are contradictory instructions. Is `src` a package, or is it the folder that contains your package? You should be able to remove these two lines; otherwise, you likely want to exclude `known-local-folder = ["src"]`, that's a very uncommon option as "local folder" is really meant for relative imports (those that start with a dot).

Thank you so much! In my case my packages are under `src` folders so I removed these two lines. The warning is gone now.
