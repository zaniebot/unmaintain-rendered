# Report unused methods

---

_Issue opened by @acampove on 2025-11-26 04:12_

### Summary

Hi,

I seem to have dead code in my projects and unused methods are not been flagged as such, despite I am using Ruff and pyright. E.g.

```python
class MyClass:
    def fun(self):
        pass

    def _method(self):
        pass

    def __method(self):
        pass
```

should show that both _method and __method are unused. Adding this functionality would allow users to remove hundreds of lines of forgotten code.

Cheers.
