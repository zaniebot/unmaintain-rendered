# Allow function parameters on multiple lines

I have been adding comments to force ruff to allow my functions to separate parameters onto separate lines of code.  Is this the best way to do this or should I be doing this some other way?  I am new to ruff.

A trailing comma should force `ruff format` to leave arguments on separate lines.

For example,

```python
def fn(
    foo,
    bar,
):
    pass
```

will remain unchanged, as will

```python
print(
    "hello",
    "world",
)
```
