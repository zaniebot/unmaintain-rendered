# Options included via `ruff rule F841` (or equivalent) are unlinked

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-13 19:41_

Should we just make these direct links to the documentation rather than references?

Alternatively, should we rewrite these links during `ruff rule`?

Yeah. It looks like [mdcat](https://crates.io/crates/mdcat) has some limitations, including:

> Not supported:

> * CommonMark extensions: [Footnotes](https://github.com/swsnr/mdcat/issues/1) and [tables](https://github.com/swsnr/mdcat/issues/2)
> * [Re-filling paragraphs](https://github.com/swsnr/mdcat/issues/4)

Reflowing paragraphs will be a problem, especially with longer links.

An alternative could be [`termimad`](https://crates.io/crates/termimad) which supports reflowing and tables, but I think that is lacking in other areas, e.g. code highlighting.

I intentionally did not include these links in the `ruff rule` output. The installed `ruff` may not always be up to date so having its output link to the latest documentation could be confusing.

I implemented the `config` subcommand in #2775, which can show all the information we have about config settings. I think it would make sense to either automatically add a note ``Learn more about these options with `ruff config <option>``` or alternatively simply automatically including the option description in the `ruff` rule output.

Reflowing is not a problem because we can use CommonMark link definitions.
