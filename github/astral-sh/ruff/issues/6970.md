_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2023-08-29 09:29_

there are existing rules that enforce it in some cases, but i would like one that enforces it all the time

You should be able to achieve this by marking it as a required import: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort-required-imports

Does that work, or is there a limitation?
