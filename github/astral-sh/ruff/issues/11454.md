# PGH004 (blanket-noqa) doesn't checks file-level pragmas

---

_Issue opened by @ashrub-holvi on 2024-05-17 07:25_

Hi,

If blanket `noqa` is used on a file level, `cat test.py`:
```
# ruff: noqa

print("Hello Astral!")
```
ruff will not complain about it:
```
ruff check --select=PGH004 test.py
All checks passed!
```
but probably it should, because in any case better to disable exact rules, not everything.
Same for `# flake8: noqa` which is also supported by ruff.

```
ruff --version
ruff 0.4.4
```

Seems reasonable to me? May need to be added in preview since it's an increase in the scope of the rule.
