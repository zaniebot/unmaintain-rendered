# Enable `resolve_call_path` to resolve symbols across files

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-07-03 17:37_

Now that we have a "real" import resolver (unused, but implemented), we should be able to remove (e.g.) `typing_modules` and some other settings by resolving symbols across files.

This is a project, not an issue.
