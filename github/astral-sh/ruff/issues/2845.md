# RUF100 may leave an empty line behind

---

_Issue opened by @scop on 2023-02-13 07:46_

ruff 0.0.246

When an unused `noqa` is alone on a line, the autofix leaves an empty line behind in its place.

```shellsession
$ cat t.py
# noqa: FOO42
print("hello")
$ ruff --select RUF --fix t.py
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).
$ cat t.py

print("hello")
```

I suppose it would be better to remove the empty line. (Black likely does that when run after ruff on the file.)
