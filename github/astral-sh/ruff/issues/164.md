# E501: error message doesn't show how much longer the line is

---

_Issue opened by @Jackenmen on 2022-09-12 02:07_

Flake8 shows both the max line length and the actual length of the line:
```
❯ flake8 repro.py --max-line-length 88
repro.py:1:89: E501 line too long (110 > 88 characters)
```
Ruff does not:
```
❯ ruff repro.py  
repro.py:1:89: E501 Line too long

Found 1 error(s).
```
