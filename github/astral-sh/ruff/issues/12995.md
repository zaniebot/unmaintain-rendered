# `string-or-bytes-too-long (PYI053)` flags and removes long strings in `Literal`, producing invalid type

---

_Issue opened by @Avasam on 2024-08-19 17:40_

In the example reproduction below, 

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  string-or-bytes-too-long PYI053
  
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
```py
def foo(bar: typing.Literal["a", "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"]):...
```
becomes
```py
import typing

def foo(bar: typing.Literal["a", ...]):...
```

Not only is this an invalid type form (https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#reportInvalidTypeForm) but even if autofixed to `Literal["a"]` that would fundamentally change the parameter's type.

I assume this is an oversight as it's meant to replace long default values ~~and is not flagged by flake8-pyi~~ .

* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
ruff check --isolated --select=PYI053

* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
not relevant

* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
ruff 0.6.1

> is not flagged by flake8-pyi

I can actually repro this bug with flake8-pyi as well on this snippet in a `.pyi` file:

```py
from typing import Literal

x: Literal["fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooO"]
```

We disable the flake8-pyi rule at typeshed for our generated stubs; maybe that's what was hiding the bug? https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/a7ff1be4394cef089dd62090a2e2ad10cc77cfe6/.flake8#L16

I merged #13002, but then immediately afterwards realised that it doesn't deal properly with type aliases. We still get two false positives on this snippet, even after #13002:

```py
from typing import TypeAlias, Literal, Annotated

x: TypeAlias = Literal["fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooO"]
y: TypeAlias = Annotated[int, "metadataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"]
```

@dylwil3, don't suppose you'd be interested in a followup PR, would you? :-) The alternative approach I suggested in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13002#discussion_r1723034693 might work better here after all:
- we'd want to add tracking in the semantic model for when we're entering `Annotated` slices, the same as we do when we're entering `Literal` slices
- we'd want to skip PYI053 when we're inside any `Annotated` or `Literal` slice, not just when we're inside annotations.

Sounds good I'll give it a try!

@AlexWaygood  Can you not do

```python
def f(x: int) --> "AnnotationsForClassesWithVeryLongNamesInQuotesAsReturnTypes"
```
?

Well, there's no reason to ever use quoted annotations in stubs, since forward references can be used even with `__future__` annotations enabled. We have another rule (`PYI020`) specifically for flagging _any_ quoted annotation in a stub... but I suppose if you _are_ going to use quoted annotations in stubs for some reason, and have `PYI020` switched off for some reason, then maybe it makes sense for this rule to ignore veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy long quoted annotations.

In case it's not obvious, I changed my mind about this while writing this response out 😆 So it's definitely worth adding a comment about this to the code for the rule!

Hmm... for some reason `in_typing_literal` has no effect - it doesn't trip for either the argument annotation or typevar. Maybe I've done something wrong. I'll try to investigate later today.

That _is_ odd. I can't immediately see why that would be... don't worry too much about fixing it if you can't figure it out; feel free to ping me if you're stuck!

Yep, you're right ! That's exactly what happened.

Sorry for the delay - I was derailed by my baby learning to crawl all of a sudden 🚀 🚀 🚀

Mystery solved - I had an invalid .pyi file since I did not actually import `Literal` or `Annotated` 🤦
