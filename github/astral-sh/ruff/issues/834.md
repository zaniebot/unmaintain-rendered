# N804 skips positional-only args

---

_Issue opened by @nstarman on 2022-11-20 19:39_

Rule N804 erroneously skips positional-only args. I found this in a piece of code similar to the following MWE.
Ruff is saying that ``other`` should be `cls`.

```python
class Class:
    @classmethod
    def method(cls, x, /, other):
        ...
```
