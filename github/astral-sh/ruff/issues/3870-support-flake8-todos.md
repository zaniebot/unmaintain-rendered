# Support `flake8-todos`

---

_Issue opened by @edgarrmondragon on 2023-04-03 20:56_

https://github.com/orsinium-labs/flake8-todos

- [x] **T001**: use TODO instead of FIXME (or BUG) for consistency.
- [x] **T002**: add author into TODO ([motivation](https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go/presentations/qcon-china.html#_dont_comment_bad_code_rewrite_it)).
- [x] **T003**: add link on issue into TODO.
- [x] **T004**: missed colon in TODO.
- [x] **T005**: missed text in TODO.
- [x] **T006**: write TODO instead of ToDo (use upper case).
- [x] **T007**: missed space after colon in TODO.
