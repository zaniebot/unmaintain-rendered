# Enable --include and --extend-include as command line args

---

_Issue opened by @nikonikolov on 2024-12-26 23:39_

While it's possible to use `--exclude` or `--extend-exclude` on the command line, the alternatives `--include` and `--extend-include` seem to be unsupported. How can I dynamically change these on the command line. In my case, the list of exclude files can vary significantly and is a big hassle to figure out every time.
