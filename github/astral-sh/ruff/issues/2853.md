# `RUF100` strips valid `noqa` comments when file contains syntax error

_Issue opened by @stinodego on 2023-02-13 11:51_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

See the example below.

### Config

```toml
[tool.ruff]
fix = true
select = ["W", "RUF"]

[tool.ruff.pycodestyle]
max-doc-length = 88
```

### Code

```
class Repro:
    def foo(self) -> None:
        """Docstring way toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long."""  # noqa: W505
        ...

@cool_decorator()  # Syntax error due to indentation
    def bar(self) -> None:
        ...
```

Running `ruff .` results in the `noqa` comment erroneously being stripped.

### Version
Latest (`0.0.246`)
