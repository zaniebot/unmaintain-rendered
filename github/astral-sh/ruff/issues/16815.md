`__dunder__` names were excluded in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/294

because of

> Module level "dunders" (i.e. names with two leading and two trailing
underscores) such as all, author, version, etc. should be
placed after the module docstring but before any import statements
except from future imports.

There's an argument that we should flag `__all__` in between imports but that would be a different rule.
