# (🎁) new rule: `unconditional-break`/`unconditional-continue` within loop

---

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2023-08-15 04:34_

```py
for a in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(a)
    break  # error: unconditional-break
```
The `break` here is completely invalid and is most certainly a developer mistake.

It makes sense, though my concern is that the rule may have low precision. It's probably not a very common error, and when it _does_ appear in code, I can see situations in which it may be intentional. For example:

```python
for a in some_list():
  use_the_first_element(a)
  break
```

I guess you could do this by slicing, or with `next`, but I'm worried that we'll find other such patterns that won't outweigh the usefulness.

For reference this is covered by [`FURB133`](https://github.com/dosisod/refurb/blob/master/docs/checks.md#furb133-no-redundant-continue) in Refurb (see #1348). `FURB133` only covers `continue` though, whereas this would cover `break` as well. I'd agree that `break` changes the control flow (and may be intentional), whereas `continue` is harmless to remove.

I would say that a single `continue` at the end of a short `for` loop is not very useful to detect. But, if there is an `if`/`else` statement at the end of a `for` loop, the `continue` might go unnoticed. The [test data](https://github.com/dosisod/refurb/blob/master/test/data/err_133.py) for `FURB133` gives some examples of `continue` statements that may go unnoticed.
