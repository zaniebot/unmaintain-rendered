Can you provide a minimal reproducible code example?

---

_Comment by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-05-05 18:45_

Would adding a noqa be fine for your use case?

No I want to see this error for other import code
but ignore all the `resources.py` imports

I guess a setting could be added to ignore `F401` for a list of imports.

How?

_Comment by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-05-05 19:23_

It needs to be implemented.

---

_Comment by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-05-05 19:24_

Do you import `ressources` in a lot of files?
If not the noqa could be added manually.

Can you explain how can I implement this?

---

_Comment by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-05-18 14:38_

I can implement it if you want.

I want to help you and contributing in this project.
If you have no problem!

_Comment by @IamRezaMousavi on 2023-05-18 20:01_

We can add `dummy-import-rgx`
What you think?

---

_Comment by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-05-21 08:47_

To implement this you can look up [CONTRIBUTING.md/#example-adding-a-new-configuration-option](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#example-adding-a-new-configuration-option).
`F401` is implemented here.

To clarify, you can ignore the unused import _only_ for that line with:

```python
import resources  # noqa: F401
```

That will prevent an unused import error from appearing for that line, but won't prevent other imports from being marked as unused.

Right, but what if I want import like this?
If I just want to ignore _Name:
```python
from ImportFrom import OtherName, _Name
```

I can do like this but it's ugly:
```python
from ImportFrom import OtherName
from ImportFrom import _Name # noqa: F401
```

(This is solved in #4691 )

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-06-03 04:09_

I think the conventional way to format that would be:

```python
from ImportFrom import (
    OtherName,
    _Name,  # noqa: F401
)
```
