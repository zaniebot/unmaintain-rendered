# Feature: Add Workflow for Manual Version Bumps

---

_Issue opened by @taj54 on 2025-09-06 11:56_


We should add a GitHub Actions workflow powered by [**Universal Version Bump**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/universal-version-bump).  
This will allow maintainers to manually trigger version bumps from the **Actions** tab, keeping the project version consistent and reducing manual errors.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria  
- [ ] A workflow is visible in the **Actions** tab.  
- [ ] You can choose the bump type (`patch`, `minor`, `major`).  
- [ ] Running the workflow updates the version automatically using [**Universal Version Bump**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/universal-version-bump).  
- [ ] (Optional) Extend the workflow later to include Git tagging + release creation.

## 🌟 Why This Matters  
- Keeps project versions aligned with development progress.  
- Reduces manual overhead and error-prone version edits.  
- Leverages [**Universal Version Bump**](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/universal-version-bump) for reliable and consistent updates.  
- Lays foundation for future enhancements like automated tagging, changelog updates, and releases.

Thanks for the suggestion, that looks like a neat project! But we already have a nice [release process](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-process) built around [rooster](https://github.com/zanieb/rooster). I think we'll stick with that for now.
