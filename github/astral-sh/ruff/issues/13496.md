This blocks usages of `from libfaketime import fake_time`.  It can be useful in some unit/integration tests, but is unlikely to be wanted in regular non-test code.

This would be nice to have in ruff. I'm not sure if there are other similar imports that could be detected, maybe `freezegun`?

Is this covered by https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/banned-api/? I didn't notice that until after creating this issue.

If it's about flagging specific imports, than banned-api's is what you want.
