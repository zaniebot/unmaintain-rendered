# PLW3201: Add setting to add custom names allowed for dunders

For example, [SQLAlchemy uses](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/mapping_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.DeclarativeBase.__table__) various names such as  `__tablename__` and `__table_args__`. Adding a noqa in tons of models would be extremely noisy.
