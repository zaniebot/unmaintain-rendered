# Develop rigorous benchmarks for formatter announcement

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-09-12 16:14_

We won't be focusing on benchmarks for the Alpha. But when we release the Beta, we'll want to include benchmarks against Black (with and without `--fast`, with and without caching), both on the CLI and for the VS Code extension if possible.

Happy with the current benchmarks. We're probably not gonna do LSP benchmarks for the announcement, just a GIF or similar if it proves helpful.
