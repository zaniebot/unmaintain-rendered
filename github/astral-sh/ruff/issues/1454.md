# Add custom messages to the `Fix` API

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-12-29 23:52_

In LSP extensions, the action prompt is, like, `Fix F401`. We can make these a lot more specific and actionable (e.g., `Remove import Foo`).

Gonna start on this. I'll make it optional, and add a few common cases.
