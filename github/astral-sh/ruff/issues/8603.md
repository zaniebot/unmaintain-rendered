# Difference between PLR1701 and SIM101?

---

_Issue opened by @alanhdu on 2023-11-10 14:58_

I was browsing through the code and came across both PLR1701 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/repeated-isinstance-calls/ and SIM101 https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-isinstance-call/. To my reading, they look like they do the same thing (merge `isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float)` to `isinstance(x, (int, float))`. Is there a difference in implementation that I'm missing, or is it a deliberate duplication?

Huh... could've sworn I looked for duplicates. Going to close this then -- sorry for the noise!
