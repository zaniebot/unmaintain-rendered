# ruff check needs --range

---

_Issue opened by @cam-laf on 2024-06-21 14:46_

I want to be able to use the following command to check existence of type hints across a range in a python file, specifically to prevent _new_ callables from being added without type hints:
```bash
ruff check --select ANN --ignore ANN101,ANN102 --range <start_line>-<end_line> <file.py>
```
Why is this currently not available like it is in ruff format?
It hinders my ability to gradually enter checking over a large mature codebase.

Range formatting is an important formatter that many editors require, linting only a range is something that's less common. 

I don't see specific reasons why Ruff can't support linting just a range, but there's quiet a bit of complexity involved and I don't expect us to prioritize this highly in the near future.
