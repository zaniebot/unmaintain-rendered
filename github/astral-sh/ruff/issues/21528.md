# update contributing docs now that mkdocs-material-insiders is free for everyone :)

_Issue opened by @tsvikas on 2025-11-19 18:16_

Material for MkDocs Insiders is now free for everyone
https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/blog/2025/11/11/insiders-now-free-for-everyone/

You might want to update the docs:
https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/contributing/#mkdocs

and also might want to update relevant build tasks, if any.
