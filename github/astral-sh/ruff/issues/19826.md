# Update `find_ruff_bin` to match `find_uv_bin`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2025-08-08 12:26_

I made a bunch of changes over in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/python/uv/_find_uv.py that we'll want to port here.

An open question is whether I should move this into a Python library and add it as a dependency? It'd be kind of annoying to have a Python dependency, but... if we ever build out a Python API we're probably going to have Python dependencies in the future anyway.
