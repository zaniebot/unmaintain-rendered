I'd like to see a rule that allows for the banning of "autouse" pytest fixtures.

https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/fixtures.html#autouse-fixtures-fixtures-you-don-t-have-to-request

In a large codebase, the overuse of auto-use fixtures can make reasoning about tests very difficult and cause a lot of unexpected behavior.

This is particularly true for `autouse` fixtures in `conftest.py` files as they just become automatically applied to any tests in scope of the `conftest.py` file.


It would make sense as a `PT` rule.
