# `--config` requires that filename is `pyproject.toml` or `ruff.toml`

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-02-02 01:48_

We need a way to infer the schema... I think we could loosen this, and assume that it's a `ruff.toml` if it's not named `pyproject.toml`? Since `pyproject.toml` is a special name, but `ruff.toml` is just something we made up.
