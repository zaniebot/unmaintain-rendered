# Docs: add strikethrough to rule ID in rules list if rule is removed

_Issue opened by @MaddyGuthridge on 2025-05-26 13:23_

As requested [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/18297#issuecomment-2909545016), I've moved this to a separate issue. Apparently, adding a strikethrough was decided against early in the design of the docs, so I completely understand if there are good reasons not to do this.

Here's what it would look like:

I think the. main concern here is that it just feels "too much". There's the opacity, strikethrough, and the `x` icon at the end and it's not clear to me how using strikethrough would improve readability

That's a fair point. I think the main benefit in my opinion is that each way of communicating it is read in a very different way. For example, I personally don't find the opacity filter to be especially helpful, and so the strikethrough communicates it better for me. This is especially the case because deprecated and removed filters have a similar opacity effect which is hard to distinguish imo.

If you think it's too much, even with this rationale, that's completely ok. Feel free to close this issue :)

Yeah, I prefer keeping it as is.

This is sort of intentional because new users shouldn't use those rules anymore.
