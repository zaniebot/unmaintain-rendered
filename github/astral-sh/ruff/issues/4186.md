# Respect `Applicability` in LSP

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-05-02 09:34_

This task is part of #4181 and it depends on #4183 and #4185

* Double check if we need to change the LSP fix command to use `--fix-unsafe` when applying a code fix. 
* Change the `fixAll` action handler to only apply safe fixes by default
* Introduce a new option to also run unsafe fixes as part of `fixAll`

Additionally, would having `unsafe-fixes = true` in the config mean that the `fixAll` code action _includes_ them?

Yes, I think it should.

I think applicability is now respected in the LSP but @zanieb correct me if I'm wrong.
