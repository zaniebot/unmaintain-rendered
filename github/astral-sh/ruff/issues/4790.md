# F401 false positive in try except ImportError

_Issue opened by @Skylion007 on 2023-06-01 17:22_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
```
F401 delete an import statement used to check whether a module is installed:
```
     try:
         import slack_sdk
         del slack_sdk
     except ImportError as e:
         raise MissingConditionalImportError('health_checker', 'slack_sdk', None) from e
```
Code snippet from https://github.com/mosaicml/composer
This auto fix just removed the import statement which creates an error when it is run again.
```
```
     try:
         del slack_sdk
     except ImportError as e:
         raise MissingConditionalImportError('health_checker', 'slack_sdk', None) from e
```
Obviously, the new code is a bad fix.

I thought we handled this case (try-catch with ImportError) explicitly. It’s supposed to flag, but not autofix.

Guessing it’s related to the del but I’ll have to test.
