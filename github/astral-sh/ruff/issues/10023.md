# RUF027: false positive for gettext translation strings

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2024-02-18 12:00_

```
bar = 'something'
foo = _('my translation {bar}')

# later: foo.format(bar=bar)
```
is detected as `RUF027 Possible f-string without an "f" prefix`.

I consider this false-positive, as strings in `_()` should never be `f` strings or otherwise formatted.

Makes sense, we’ll omit these.

Hey @charliermarsh, seems like a good issue for a newby in the ruff code base. I'd like to give it a shot.
