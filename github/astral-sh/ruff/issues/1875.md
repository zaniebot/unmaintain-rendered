# Add support for isort remove_redundant_aliases option

---

_Issue opened by @nefrob on 2023-01-14 20:28_

Ref: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html.
> Tells isort to remove redundant aliases from imports, such as import os as os. This defaults to False simply because some projects use these seemingly useless aliases to signify intent and change behaviour.

Configuration in ruff:
```toml
[tool.ruff.isort]
remove_redundant_aliases = true

This might be redundant with `PLC0414` check from `pylint`: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#convention-plc.

Yeah I believe we implement this (with autofix) as `PLC0414`.
