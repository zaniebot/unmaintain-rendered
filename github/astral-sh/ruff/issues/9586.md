# How to prevent mutli-line dicts or kwargs from being collapsed into single line?

Here are a few examples:

```
-    return {
-        'backups_by_type': backups_by_type,
-        'all_backup_types': all_backup_types
-    }
+    return {'backups_by_type': backups_by_type, 'all_backup_types': all_backup_types}
```

```
     if admin_users.remove(email):
-        return {
-            'status': 'success',
-            'message': f'{email} was removed from the administrators list.'
-        }
+        return {'status': 'success', 'message': f'{email} was removed from the administrators list.'}
 
-    return {
-        'status': 'error',
-        'message': f'{email} is not an administrator.'
-    }
+    return {'status': 'error', 'message': f'{email} is not an administrator.'}
```

```
-    op = CreateJobOperation(
-        payload=payload,
-        current_user=g.current_user,
-        input_source=input_source
-    )
+    op = CreateJobOperation(payload=payload, current_user=g.current_user, input_source=input_source)
 ```

Is there a way to turn this off? I prefer having these line breaks retained as it aids in readability.

Like Black, we'll avoid collapsing lines if you include a trailing comma. Here's an example: https://play.ruff.rs/89d3c7c8-8c18-46bc-91aa-a7739e51639b?secondary=Format.
