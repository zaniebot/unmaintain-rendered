# Take Python version from the .python-version file

---

_Issue opened by @kevinrenskers on 2025-02-24 19:27_

### Description

Why do I have to specify the `target-version` when I already have a `.python-version` file?

When I am running a Python application (not a library that will be published), then `.python-version` should be enough I would think. `requires-python` becomes mostly useless, and `target-version` also seems kinda redundant? But when I remove both of those then ruff will complain to me.

Supporting `.python-version` as a fallback does make sense for applications when neither `target-version` or `project.requires-python` is specified. 

But I'm still somewhat hesitant to add this because it does mean that Ruff now has to probe one extra file when discovering a file's configuration. We also need to be careful about how this plays with inherited configurations, user level configurations, and extended configurations.

Yea that makes sense, I understand the hesitation. It's just a bit annoying that when I upgrade to a newer Python version that I have to change this in multiple places. 

Actually, now that I think about it.. maybe I should just get rid of `.python-version`, and only use `requires-python`? I know uv likes to use `.python-version`, but it's not required, is it? Simply set `requires-python` to `"==3.13.*"` and I should be sure that 3.13 is used, both by uv and by ruff.

You could but it seems to be sort of an anti-pattern. See the conversation in https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/11624#issuecomment-2669110520

I have a [mono repo](https://github.com/hongbo-miao/hongbomiao.com) with over 100+ Python projects. I am hoping to add `target-version`.

Currently each subfolder has a `.python-version` (no `requires-python`) and `.ruff.toml` and if have something like

```
target-version = "py314"
extend = "../.ruff.toml"
```
```
target-version = "py313"
extend = "../.ruff.toml"
```

Renovate can bump `.python-version`, however, it cannot bump corresponding `target-version` in `.ruff.toml` in each subfolder.
It would be great to support `.python-version` as a fallback. Thanks! ☺️
