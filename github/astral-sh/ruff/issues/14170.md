# [red-knot] support typing.TYPE_CHECKING

---

_Issue opened by @carljm on 2024-11-07 16:32_

Supporting the symbol itself should be quite easy, the trickier part of this is just https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/12700

I think we can close this as "completed" now that #14952 has landed. The only parts of this left to do are entirely covered by #12700
