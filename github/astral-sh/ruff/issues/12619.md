<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

In https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/9842, they renamed `too-many-positional` to `too-many-positional-arguments` and implemented it.

If we at some point implement support for full names in addition to the codes we support already, this will affect us too.

PS: What’s the schedule for this rule coming out of preview?

Annoyingly, these are strictly-speaking _parameters_ rather than _arguments_... but the new name seems strictly better than the old one, and it's useful to have the same name as pylint. PR welcome!
