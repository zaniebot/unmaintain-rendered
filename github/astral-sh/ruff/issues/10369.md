# Make thread count a configurable parameter for `ruff server`

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-03-12 18:17_

Right now, `ruff server` has a hard-coded background thread pool size of `4`. Ideally, this should be configurable via command line arguments (or eventually, in the extension settings).
