# New server settings dropped support for config overrides

---

_Issue opened by @tylerlaprade on 2025-02-07 19:07_

### Description

As per https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/migration/#unsupported-settings, there is no replacement for the following config override in my VSCode setup. I have an extensively customized `ruff.toml`, so it's not feasible for me to maintain a second copy just for this single override.
```json
	"ruff.lint.args": [
		"--config",
		"lint.flake8-annotations.ignore-fully-untyped=false"
	],
```
My usecase is that I want these errors to show locally but not in the CLI or in CI, since Ruff doesn't have the concept of an error vs a warning.

See the discussion thread here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/15991#discussioncomment-12097928, it has the same query.

**tl;dr** use [`ruff.configuration`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/settings/#configuration).
