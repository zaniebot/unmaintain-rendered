# [Feature Request] System-wide configuration file

---

_Issue opened by @blackteahamburger on 2024-08-28 11:09_

It would be convenient if ruff supports system-wide configuration file by default like `/etc/ruff.toml`.

See also https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6742 (we should do something consistent)

Can you tell us more about your use case? Ruff already supports a user-wide configuration file.

I just want multiple users to use the same configuration.
