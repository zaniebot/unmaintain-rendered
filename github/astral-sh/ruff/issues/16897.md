# Will be there any refactoring features in ruff lsp ?

---

_Issue opened by @ZeyadMoustafaKamal on 2025-03-21 13:04_

### Question

One of the features I am missing in `neovim` is that when I rename a file, all imports that should be changed are being changed automatically. I have seen [this](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/5148#issuecomment-1557415101) from pyright team so it doesn't seem that they plan to work on it. And it will be only supported on pylance.

I am not quite sure if a formatter like ruff should have these features or this should be a separate tool. But it would be nice to add them. And also note that I am not talking about this feature specifically, I am talking about refactoring in general.

### Version

ruff 0.8.4

It's not on our immediate roadmap but it's something we want to add eventually.
