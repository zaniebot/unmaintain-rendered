# New Rule + fixer: Use a list instead of calling split with string literals

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

I've seen this pattern a handful of time:
```py
"""
	itemA
	itemB
	itemC
""".split()
```
or
```py
"a,b,c,d".split(",")
```
And I'd like a rule to transform usages of `join` with literals into actual inline lists without the overhead of calling "join". My two examples above would become:
```py
[
	"itemA",
	"itemB",
	"itemC",
]
```
or
```py
["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

I don't think this rule exists in any linters that I'm aware of.

The exact details of how this gets formatted isn't important to this rule. Probably just rewrite everything on a single line and let formatting/other rules take care of the rest.

Great suggestion, I think it's worth adding. With autofix this adds to developer experience as writing the comma-seperated pattern is sometimes just more convenient.

Real-world examples:
- https://github.com/apache/fury/blob/main/java/benchmark/analyze.py#L246
- https://github.com/alibaba/AliceMind/blob/main/VECO/NLU/evaluate.py#L103
- https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/utils/hct/hctdb.py#L261
- https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/main/pandas/tests/reshape/merge/test_merge_asof.py#L61
- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy/f2py/tests/test_return_real.py#L91

This seems reasonable. Although I'm somewhat surprised that people do this :D 

The comma pattern seems easy enough to detect. The `split` without a `separator` needs some extra care to ensure we apply the exact same logic.

For posterity, @AlexWaygood noticed that this rule exists in flake8-simplify:
