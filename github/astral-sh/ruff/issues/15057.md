# Unused import not detected F401

---

_Issue opened by @schlamar on 2024-12-19 11:10_

```python
import mylib.mylib as cli
import mylib.test

cli.test()
```

Expected error:

```
test2.py:2:8: F401 [*] `mylib.test` imported but unused
```

Actual: 

```
> ruff check --select F .\test2.py
All checks passed!
> ruff --version
ruff 0.8.3
```

@MichaReiser my example is quite different than the one #4656

And in this case my example is correctly detected by pyflakes:

```
> pyflakes .\test2.py 
.\test2.py:2:1: 'mylib.test' imported but unused
```

As far as I can tell it's the same underlying issue and it should be fixed by https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/13965
