# RUF017 Autofix uses iadd but docs recommend iconcat

---

_Issue opened by @nicodemus26 on 2024-02-22 23:54_

I could not find a substantive difference between `iadd` and `iconcat` in cpython aside from some narrower type contexts for iconcat. As the autofix uses `iadd` to resolve RUF017, I'd suggest updating the documents to match that behavior. If there is a significant difference, it would be helpful to call it out in the docs.

It may be helpful to mention the performance characteristics of the alternatives suggested, as observed here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9045#issuecomment-1845429922
