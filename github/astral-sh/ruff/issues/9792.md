They clog up the output of the check command.

Can I ask why you want to suppress it, rather than address the warnings? Are the warnings invalid?

Not every `noqa` is a ruff `noqa`. Sometimes I'm telling pycharm not to underline my code with `# noqa: pycharm`

especially in the http endpoints test when doing `response.json()` since apparently it's impossible to type it correctly:

workaround `| grep -v ^warning`

Hey @Vulwsztyn it sounds like you're looking for the [`external`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_external) setting.

@zanieb I do not see how I can suppress this message with this setting. I do not have e.g. `# noqa: VXXX` so as to suppress `V` by this settings. I have `# noqa: PyCharm` or `# noqa bla bla reasoning`

You should be able to pass whatever you want to `external`. E.g., `external = ["PyCharm"]` should be supported.

@charliermarsh unfortunately that doesn't work because the error is that the noqa statement is invalid due to its format

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/1ae67f44872c2c08ffe21a907a35765374c1cde8/crates/ruff_linter/src/noqa.rs#L244-L250

We should probably try to support `external` here though
