# Fixes for FURB122 and FURB142 should parenthesize lambdas and ternary expressions

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-06-09 12:57_

### Summary

The fixes for [`for-loop-writes` (FURB122)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/for-loop-writes/) and [`for-loop-set-mutations` (FURB142)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/for-loop-set-mutations/) should parenthesize the iterable expression when it is a lambda expression or a ternary conditional expression and it is not already parenthesized and the fix produces a comprehension.

```console
$ cat >furb122.py <<'# EOF'
from pathlib import Path
def write(lines_a, lines_b, *, write_a):
    with Path("file.txt").open("w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        for line in lines_a if write_a else lines_b:
            f.write(f"[{line}]")
with Path("file.txt").open("w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for l in lambda: 0:
        f.write(f"[{l}]")
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check furb122.py --select FURB122 --preview --diff 2>&1 | grep error:
error: Fix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

$ cat >furb142.py <<'# EOF'
s = set()
for x in (1,) if True else (2,):
    s.add(-x)
for x in lambda: 0:
    s.discard(-x)
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check furb142.py --select FURB142 --preview --diff 2>&1 | grep error:
error: Fix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.
```
