# PT003: Implement autofix to strip `scope="function"`?

---

_Issue opened by @ngnpope on 2023-01-27 15:03_

Consider the following:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def fixture():
    ...
```

This results in the following:

```console
❯ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.236

❯ ruff --select PT003 --fix bug.py 
bug.py:3:17: PT003 `scope='function'` is implied in `@pytest.fixture()`
Found 1 error.
```

It seems that this should be easy enough to autofix... 🛠️
