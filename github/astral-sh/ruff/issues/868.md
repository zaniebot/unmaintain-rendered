# Upgrade autofix to fix-until-stable

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-11-22 02:22_

See: #660. The idea is that, if we apply an autofix, we should re-lint the fixed file, apply any fixes, and continue until the source code has stabilized (up to some reasonable limit). We may want to make this opt-in to start.
