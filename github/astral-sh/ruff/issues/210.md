# Regression on GHA with ruff==0.0.39

---

_Issue opened by @amotl on 2022-09-16 08:38_

Dear Charlie,

after being upgraded to `ruff==0.0.39` on our CI setup for `mqttwarn` (https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/203#issuecomment-1249055408), I found `ruff` croaks on GHA without any output [1].

```
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

After downgrading to `ruff==0.0.37` again with https://github.com/jpmens/mqttwarn/commit/ba3ecd9ac and https://github.com/jpmens/mqttwarn/commit/f4ffb30, linting works again [2].

I did not observe this on my macOS workstation, upgrading to `ruff==0.0.39` worked well there, leading to https://github.com/jpmens/mqttwarn/commit/fad50af.

With kind regards,
Andreas.

Thank you, I realized this lying in bed last night hah. Going to fix as soon as I’m back at a computer.

Should be fixed via `24de97d9514e7a27cfbf2940023c0752734c6744`, please let me know if you see otherwise. (Building now as `0.0.40`.)

I can confirm `ruff-0.0.40` works well again on CI/GHA. Thank you so much, you rock.
