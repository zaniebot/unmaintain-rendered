# FString formatting drops comments

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-08-09 08:19_

```python
result_f = (
    f'  File "{__file__}", line {lineno_f+1}, in f\n'
    '    f()\n'
    # XXX: The following line changes depending on whether the tests
    # are run through the interactive interpreter or with -m
    # It also varies depending on the platform (stack size)
    # Fortunately, we don't care about exactness here, so we use regex
    r'  \[Previous line repeated (\d+) more times\]' '\n'
    'RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\n'
)
```

The formatter drops any dangling comments inside an FString. This is because the comments are associated with the `ExprConstant` whereas the string formatting looks up the comments from the FString expression.
