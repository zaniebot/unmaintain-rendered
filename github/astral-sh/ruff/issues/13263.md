<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Aliases for query parameters are not considered by FAST003, which leads to an incorrect error message.

The following valid code
```python
from typing import Annotated
from fastapi import FastAPI, Path

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/documents/{documentId}")
def get_document(document_id: Annotated[str, Path(alias="documentId")]) -> str:
    return "Lorem Ipsum"
```
outputs: 

> FAST003 Parameter `documentId` appears in route path, but not in `get_document` signature
