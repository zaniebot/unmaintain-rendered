<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
```python
class Person:
    name = "Foo"
    name = name + " Bar"
```
with unsafe fixes applied becomes:
```python
class Person:
    name = "Foo"
```
It may not be the cleanest way of writing that, but it probably shouldn't trigger.

```python
class Person:
    names = ["Foo"]
    names = names + ["Bar"]
```
is a use case I've actually seen in real code that probably should not be flagged.

ruff version is 0.1.4.

making it do `+=` seems to be a decent mitigation for the objects which define it, but that may not always be an option depending on the Python object.
