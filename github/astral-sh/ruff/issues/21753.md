# EXE003 - allows "uv run" but errors on "uv --quiet run"

---

_Issue opened by @Jamie-BitFlight on 2025-12-02 15:44_

### Summary

Hi,
The EXE003 rule errors when given:

`uv --quiet run --active --script` even though the '--quiet' argument is global. (like color, offline, no-progress, project)

Can the rule be updated to allow `uv (\s*--[\w]+)*run` instead of `uv run`

The regex should permit at least one space between the argument and `run`, something closer to 
`uv(?: *--\w+)* *run`
