# Add `-> None` automatically to all pytest tests

---

_Issue opened by @chbndrhnns on 2024-07-10 12:16_

When running mypy on a larger codebase with many tests, it will report missing `-> None` annotations on tests in strict mode.

I suggest adding a rule that adds this return type to all tests discovered by pytest.

Hi, thanks for the feature request! Have you tried enabling the autofixes for [`ANN201`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/missing-return-type-undocumented-public-function/), `ANN202`, `ANN204`, `ANN205` and `ANN206`? They might already do what you want here
