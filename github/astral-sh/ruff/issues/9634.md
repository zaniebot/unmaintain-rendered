# Ruff formatter does not break long strings into multiple lines.

---

_Issue opened by @MiguelMonteiro on 2024-01-24 14:41_

The ruff formatter does not seem to obey  `line-length` when it comes to long strings. See [this example](https://play.ruff.rs/b2a3f481-06ec-4017-93a9-b290da212158).
Is this intended behavior? Is there a configuration setting that breaks long strings into multiple lines?

Thanks for filing (and for the playground link)! We don't currently break strings, but there's a tracking issue here: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6936.
