Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).

The function can be found in pylint, but not in ruff until now.

I'm not sure to which rule you're referring to but there's a pylint tracking issue https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970 where you can see the current progress and which rules get implemented.

as shown in the picture, the attribution "_abc" doesn't exist in the class. Pycharm, which I used in the picture will reminde me of this error cause its own code inspection mechanism. But ruff won't highlight this kind of error.
