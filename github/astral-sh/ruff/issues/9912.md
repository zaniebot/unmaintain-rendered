<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

What do you think about the following edge case? I believe this should not be reported, since Enum members are typically low cardinality and are not garbage collected anyway.

```python
# test.py

import enum
import functools


class Foo(enum.Enum):
    ONE = enum.auto()
    TWO = enum.auto()

    @functools.cache
    def bar(self, arg: str) -> str:
        return f"{self} - {arg}"
```

```
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.2.1

$ ruff check --isolated --select B test.py
test.py:9:5: B019 Use of `functools.lru_cache` or `functools.cache` on methods can lead to memory leaks
Found 1 error.
```

I think I agree with this, though I'd love other opinions / confirmations that this is safe.

Confirmed with Alex and Carl that this should be fine.
