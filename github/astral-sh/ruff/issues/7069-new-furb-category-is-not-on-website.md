# new `FURB` category is not on website

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2023-09-03 05:35_

the new refurb category added in [v0.0.287](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.287) is not on https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/

probably the same issue as #6907 where the deploy job failed
