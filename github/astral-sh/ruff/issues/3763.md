# noqa comments for N812 don't apply to the correct line in multi-line imports

---

_Issue opened by @ehdr on 2023-03-27 20:48_

When trying to apply a `noqa` comment for rule N812 (`lowercase-imported-as-non-lowercase`) on a multi-line import, it does not seem to apply to the correct line. For example, I would expect the following to not flag any errors:

```python
from mod import (
    lower_case as NonLowerCase,  # noqa: F401, N812
)
```

but it gives

```shell
n812.py:1:1: N812 Lowercase `lower_case` imported as non-lowercase `NonLowerCase`
n812.py:2:34: RUF100 [*] Unused `noqa` directive (unused: `N812`)
Found 2 errors.
```

The following however gives no errors:
```python
from mod import (  # noqa: N812
    lower_case as NonLowerCase,  # noqa: F401
)
```
