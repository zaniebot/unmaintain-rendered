# single command for check and format

---

_Issue opened by @DaniBodor on 2024-06-05 10:19_

Is there a single command to check both linting and formatting? 
If not, this would be a nice addition in my mind. Not that it's a big deal to do it in two steps, but our CI only passes if both are correct, so basically whenever we do either, we do both.

Unfortunately not, but it's high on our wish list. We just need to find the time to implement it. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8232 to track the progress.
