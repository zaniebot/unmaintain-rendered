# Support ruff configuration in inline script metadata via the `[tool]` table

---

_Issue opened by @Julian on 2025-01-07 15:21_

[PEP 723 introduced the ability](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/) for single python scripts to declare metadata about themselves, and in particular delegates a `tool` table.

It would be nice to be able to self-declare a desired ruff lint configuration within the script, such that single python scripts written to be entirely self-contained also contain their ruff configuration just as a full package would in a `pypackage.toml`.

Concretely, I'd like to be able to write:

```
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# [tool.ruff.lint]
# select = "ALL"
# ignore = ["A100", "D200"]
# ///
```

rather than needing to know what the correct settings are externally.

(I didn't see this discussed anywhere, apologies if I missed an existing discussion. And thanks as usual for a great tool.)

Aha thanks! I'd searched for "inline script metadata" but not "PEP723" directly. Thanks for the link.
