# Improve error recovery for illegal use of keywords in parameter positions

---

_Issue opened by @samwgoldman on 2025-10-20 22:14_

### Summary

Ruff's is quite good at recovering from invalid inputs and producing an AST. I recently encountered an example where I think the parser error recovery could be better, and could make it easier to flag a helpful error to users: using a reserved keyword as a function parameter name.

For example:

```
def f(global: int, region: str):
    pass
```

parses as:

```
def f():
  global int, region, str
  pass
```

I can get similar results using other keywords like `await` and `not`.

If Ruff instead parsed the invalid keyword as a parameter, we could provide a very targeted error message guiding the user to avoid the keyword.

Thanks!
