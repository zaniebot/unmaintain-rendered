# new rule - empty module

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-01-10 04:28_

sometimes i'll create a new python file intending to move something to it, then i forget about it and eventually accidentally commit it as an empty file. it would be nice if there was a rule to report modules that should be deleted because they are empty.

this rule would be reported on all empty python files except `__init__.py`/`__init__.pyi` files, since it's common for them to be empty.
