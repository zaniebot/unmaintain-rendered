# False negative for `invalid-pathlib-with-suffix` (`PTH210`) if method called on direct instantiation

---

_Issue opened by @dylwil3 on 2025-07-14 15:10_

### Summary

False negatives are understandable here if we can't be sure that an object is a `Path` object - but the below false negative seems silly because we are in a situation where we should be even _more_ confident that we have a `Path` object!

```python
from pathlib import Path

path = Path()

path.with_suffix("py") # PTH210

Path().with_suffix("py") # no lint
```

This is roughly the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/19294 but for `with_suffix` instead of `open`

Good catch - I will transfer this to a comment there instead!

Wait - actually that is the _opposite_ issue
