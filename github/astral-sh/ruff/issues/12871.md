# `PTH123` suggests `Path.open()` which does not support file descriptors

_Issue opened by @sbrudenell on 2024-08-13 23:49_

```python
fp = open(2)
```
```bash
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.5.7
$ ruff check --isolated --select PTH123 t.py
t.py:1:6: PTH123 `open()` should be replaced by `Path.open()`
  |
1 | fp = open(2)
  |      ^^^^ PTH123
  |

Found 1 error.
```
`Path.open()` doesn't seem to have a variant which supports a file descriptor.

This is essentially similar to #7620
