# [Rule request] [`pydocstyle`] no-blank-line-after-last-section

---

_Issue opened by @MatthijsBurgh on 2024-05-07 08:28_

I would like to request the a rule, which is the opposite of D413, [`blank-line-after-last-section`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/blank-line-after-last-section/). This rule should remove all the blank lines after the docstring section.

As I think this is the standard for `Google` and `pep257`.

For what it is worth, numpydoc enforces no empty line with GL03:

```
    "GL03": "Double line break found; please use only one blank line to "
    "separate sections or paragraphs, and do not leave blank lines "
    "at the end of docstrings",
```

This is also mentioned in #9451 (although not the main issue there).
