# Allow marking private packages (leading underscore) as public for `pydocstyle`

---

_Issue opened by @nelsyeung on 2024-02-12 10:40_

Currently, `pydocstyle` ignores private modules, even those imported from public ones. This prevents it from analysing code structures like pytest's, where internal code resides in a private package (`_pytest`) and public interfaces in a separate package (`pytest`). As a result, rules solely applicable to public modules are ineffective in this scenario.

For example, in `src/_foo/foo.py`:
```python
class Foo:
    ...
```
and in `src/foo/__init__.py`:
```python
from _foo.foo import Foo
__all__ = ["Foo"]
```
Can a config be added to mark some packages as public? Or somehow make the above scenario show `D` errors?

Note that this is similar to #9561 but for private packages.
