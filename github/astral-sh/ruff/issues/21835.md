# Update ruff_linter to use optimized version of parenthesized_ranges

---

_Issue opened by @denyszhak on 2025-12-08 00:54_

PR #21738 for Issue #21510 added optimized version for `parenthesized_range`. Now we can replace usage of the old `parenthesized_range` with a new one that relies on `Tokens.`
