<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
PYI026s autofix is broken. It addes TypeAlias annotations everywhere, but unconditionally imports `from typing` when it should import `from typing_extensions` if the target_version is less than py310. The bug appears to present when the PR was initially introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5844
