# new rule - ban importing specific names from a module if the whole module is already imported (or vice versa)

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2025-09-24 07:45_

### Summary

my codebase has a lot of imports like this in the same file:

```py
from foo import some_module
from foo.some_module import a, b, c
```

which means there are often inconsistent usages of the names imported from that module:

```py
a()
some_module.a()
```

it would be nice if ruff had a rule to enforce that only one kind of import is allowed for each module being imported in the current file.

note that i don't necessarily want to enforce one or the other, because whether we want to import the whole module or just a few names from it usually depends on how many names we want to import. so the rule would only complain if *both* methods of importing from the same module are present.

I thought there was an existing request for this, but I was thinking of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10638, which seems a bit different.

Adding some context that was discussed over at https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/issues/1633:

> There is definitely a valid use case for combining `import foo` and `from foo import bar` for the same module. For example, `randrange()` is self-explanatory in what it does, `choices()` is unclear and should be instead written as `random.choices()`.

I don't disagree with this rule proposal, but I've definitely written code that goes against it (with good reason, I think).
