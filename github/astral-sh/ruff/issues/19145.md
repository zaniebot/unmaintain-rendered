# Consider removing deprecated macOS config file discovery

---

_Issue opened by @ntBre on 2025-07-04 14:57_

In https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11115 we moved from defaulting to `$HOME/Library/Application Support` to `$XDG_HOME` on macOS and added a deprecation warning if we find files in the old location:

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/411cccb35eafbf91787d36ca6092101328211e2c/crates/ruff_workspace/src/pyproject.rs#L130-L135

This has been deprecated for over a year and since v0.5, so I think we can consider removing it in a future release.
