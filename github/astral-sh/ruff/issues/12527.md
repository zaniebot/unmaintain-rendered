# ruff_format not shown as format binary

---

_Issue opened by @ic-768 on 2024-07-26 12:15_

I use neovim and was trying to setup ruff as a formatter. I was not able to get it to work, as I thought that simply using `ruff` as my formatter would be enough, when in fact I had to use `ruff_format`.

In the `mason` package manager, it does not show that `ruff_format` is an available executable, just `ruff`.
The only reason I was able to get this to work is because I found other people's configs online and tried copying it.

For new users who want to set formatting up maybe it would be beneficial to show `ruff_format` as the binary for the formatter.

The `ruff_format` is an identifier which comes from `conform.nvim` while `mason.nvim` (correctly) reports that we provide the `ruff` binary. The `ruff_format` is just an identifier to indicate that it'll run the `ruff format` command and is not an actual executable. You might want to refer to the docs in `conform.nvim` / `mason.nvim`.
