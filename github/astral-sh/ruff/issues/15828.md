# Reimplement popular Mypy plugins

---

_Issue opened by @johnthagen on 2025-01-30 13:15_

### Description

In order to migrate from Mypy to Ruff for static type checking, one thing users may need are reimplementations of the most popular Mypy plugins.

- https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending_mypy.html#extending-mypy-using-plugins

Assuming for a moment that exposing a Mypy-compatible plugin interface is out of scope, the following Mypy plugins are ones I've seen in wide use within the community and could be considered:

- Some appear built into Mypy already: https://github.com/python/mypy/tree/master/mypy/plugins
- (Deprecated) Numpy: https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/typing.html#mypy-plugin
- Pydantic: https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/integrations/mypy/#enabling-the-plugin
- `django-stubs`: https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
- `djangorestframework-stubs`: https://github.com/typeddjango/djangorestframework-stubs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

Another list of Mypy plugins I found:

The numpy plugin is deprecated and the stubs are not plugins, right?  Might want to remove those from your list.

`django-stubs` and `djangorestframework-stubs` both expose mypy plugin on top of the stubs

We don't plan to support Mypy plugins for our initial static type checker release, but it's something that's on our mind. I'll close this as it's not planned until after the initial type checker release.

@MichaReiser Now that [`ty`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/) is public and released as alpha on PyPI, should this issue be re-opened and/or migrated to https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues ?

Sure. I think it could help document our position. @dcreager did [give an answer to this question on hackernews] and you can find a somewhat longer answer from @carljm in [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/live/XVwpL_cAvrw?feature=shared&t=2528)
