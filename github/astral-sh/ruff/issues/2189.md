# [question] only report lines from diff

---

_Issue opened by @fschulze on 2023-01-26 06:38_

The ``flake8`` option ``--diff`` allows one to only get a report for lines that changed. That way it is possible to enforce rules on new code without requiring old code to be touched.

Is there a way to get the same functionality with ``ruff``? Maybe a post-process step with another tool?

Duplicate of #1149 and #1931.
