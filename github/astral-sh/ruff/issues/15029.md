# Fix for INP001 implicit-namespace-package

---

_Issue opened by @kiyoon on 2024-12-17 01:57_

Can there be a fix for the rule? I would like to add `__init__.py` files where missing.

In the meantime I generated a simple python script that checks the lint and adds the files:

Our current fix infrastructure doesn't support modifying files on disk. I think this might be useful because language servers do provide refactoring ability to move snippets of code to another file.

This seems to be a duplicate of #4736.
