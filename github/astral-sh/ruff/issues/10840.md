@erictraut [say's](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/7645#issuecomment-2043962935) that it is not a bug, so maybe this issuer need to be closed without fix/code.
 
> Pyright is working correctly here. When you wrap a `NewType` with `Annotated`, the resulting object is no longer a `NewType`. It's a type alias. It's name does not need to match that of the (anonymous) NewType that was created.
