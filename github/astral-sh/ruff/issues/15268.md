# FURB171: Potentially unsafe fix

---

_Issue opened by @fedyakov on 2025-01-05 14:19_

FURB171 auto-fixes
```python
s in " "
```
into
```python
s == " "
```
But the Initial expression is equivalent to `s == "" or s == " "`, not `s == " "`.
It's a valid warning and safe fix for explicit collections like lists or sets, but probably should be disabled or at least moved to unsafe for strings.
