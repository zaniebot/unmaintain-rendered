# TRY201 wrongly complains about raising from None

---

_Issue opened by @adamtheturtle on 2023-02-12 14:55_

Take the following example:

```python
try:
    raise Exception("We want to hide this error message")
except Exception:
    try:
        raise Exception("We want to show this")
    except Exception as exc:
        raise exc from None
```

`ruff` with `TRY201` selected tells us:

```
TRY201 Use `raise` without specifying exception name
```

However, we cannot do `raise from None`.

See https://peps.python.org/pep-0409/#proposal for context of this syntax.
