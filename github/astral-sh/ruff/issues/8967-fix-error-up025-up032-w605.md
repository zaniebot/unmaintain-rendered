# [Fix error] UP025, UP032, W605

_Issue opened by @AlexBlandin on 2023-12-02 16:00_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Using `ruff check --select UP025,UP032,W605 --fix --isolated pokedex/doc/tabledoc.py` on a local copy of the https://github.com/veekun/pokedex repo reports Ruff introducing a syntax error. So, this seems to be an issue with Unicode literals in f-strings?
