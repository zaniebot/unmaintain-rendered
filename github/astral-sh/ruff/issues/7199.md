---

_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-06 15:31_


Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select RUF013 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
from Tea.model import TeaModel\

class Config(TeaModel):
    def __init__(
        read_timeout: int = None,
    ):
        self.access_key_id = access_keyid
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/298_IDX_0_RAND_79953379162912133788556.py:5:23: RUF013 PEP 484 prohibits implicit `Optional`
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/298_IDX_0_RAND_79953379162912133788556.py`, the rule codes RUF013, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!

```
