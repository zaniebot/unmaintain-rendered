# pyupgrade Python Version

---

_Issue opened by @gitpushdashf on 2022-11-23 15:53_

This is awesome!

Is there anything like pyupgrade's python_version? It lets you set the Python version that you want to update your code to. I find it nice to set that to the oldest non-EOLed Python version for open source libraries and to the latest version for applications.

The arguments for pyupgrade are `--py36-plus`, `--py37-plus`, etc.

Yeah! But we use the Black convention, so it's like: `--target-version py36`.
