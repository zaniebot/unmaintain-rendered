# PT007 raises a false positive for single-item strings

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-20 02:04_

Not sure if this is inherited from the flake8 plugin, but this is a false positive for PT007:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("archs", [["x86_64"], ["arm64", "universal2"]])
```

If the item on the left is a string with no commas, then the thing on the right doesn't have to be a list of tuples, it can be a list of anything, including lists.
