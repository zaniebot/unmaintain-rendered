# Add ruff --stdin--zero/ruff -0 like xargs or ruff --paths-from-file

_Issue opened by @rtaycher on 2025-12-10 13:57_

I was just using ruff to add linting to our CI. Since the idea of comparing to baseline errors seems stuck for a while it would be nice if there was a nicer way to provide a bunch of input paths besides passing them as arguments. 

Especially since some paths may have special characters or spaces.

Plus isn't there a maximum # of arguments which can be passed on the command line?

`echo $null_sep_filenames|ruff -0` or 

`echo $line_sep_filenames>line_sep_filenames;ruff --F line_sep_filenames`

would make it a lot easier to pass a large number of files to ruff.

I don't think it's documented anywhere but Ruff supports passing an argfile like so

```
ruff check @file_containing_arguments
```

The arguments in `file_containing_arguments` must all be written on their own line

See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/7d47f711c148eac0f123f6a3e2527183295837b5/crates/ruff/tests/integration_test.rs#L1738-L1781
