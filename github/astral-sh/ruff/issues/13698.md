# (🎁) should `N804` enforce `mcs` on metaclass `classmethod`s?

_Issue opened by @KotlinIsland on 2024-10-10 00:19_

```py
class M(type):
   def f(self):  # N804
       pass
   def m(cls):  # no error
       pass
   @classmethod
   def m(cls):  # no error
       pass
    @classmethod
    def c(mcs):  # N804
       pass
```
i would expect this to be `N804`, `no error`, `N804`, `no error`

There does seem to be some precedent for the "mcs" shorthand: https://grep.app/search?q=def%20%5B%5E(%5D+%5C(mcs%5B,%5C)%5D&regexp=true, @AlexWaygood any thoughts?

Even though `mcs` itself maybe not be widely accepted, the fact that that it should be a one of `mcs`, `mcls`, `metacls`, `<any other possible shorthand>` to explicit difference in nature from `cls` (instance space in the case of metaclasses) seems more than reasonable (see https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/10656#issuecomment-2558202018).

I would love to see [https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13698#issue-2577234229](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/13698#issue-2577234229) (planned to be) fixed!

Personnal opinion: I really **love** `mcs` for 3 reasons:
1. Three characters, like `cls`.
2. Hard to accidentally go from `mcs` to `cls` (or vice versa) than from `mcls` to `cls`.
3. Precedent point + no "tall letter" (_e.g._ the `l` from `cls`) also makes it easier to "read the difference" from a quick glance imo.

Note that official library `abc` uses `mcls` for example:
