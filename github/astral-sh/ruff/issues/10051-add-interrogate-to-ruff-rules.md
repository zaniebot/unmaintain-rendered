# Add interrogate to ruff rules

---

_Issue opened by @HenriqueAJNB on 2024-02-19 13:47_

I was wondering if it's possible to integrate [interrogate](https://interrogate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to ruff's rules.

Interrogate is similar to [pydocstyle (D)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/#pydocstyle-d) but they have a different purpose, specially because interrogate measures docstring coverage that is not covered in pydocstyle.
