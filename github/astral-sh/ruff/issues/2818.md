# noqa: F40 as shorcut for noqa: F401,F403

_Issue opened by @cclauss on 2023-02-12 17:25_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
The linter directive `# noqa: F40` works as expected in flake8 while ruff requires `# noqa: F401,F403` to do something similar.  Would it be possible to adopt the same linter directive syntax?

I think we're somewhat unlikely to support this. I know it works in Flake8, but I think the complexity of the implementation (plus having to support this with `--add-noqa`, and with the `RUF100`-style noqa enforcement) wouldn't outweigh the benefits, which don't seem that compelling to me. (I actually think it's good to encourage users to explicitly enumerate ignored codes, though it can be more tedious.)
