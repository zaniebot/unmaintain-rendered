# Upgrade ESLint to version 9

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-08-07 02:08_

Now that typescript-eslint v8 is released (https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v8) with full support for ESLint v9, we should remove the Renovate constraint and upgrade the dependency:

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/90e5bc2bd95e15086a3af81589cc2a1af298b6b2/.github/renovate.json5#L74-L80

The issue with updating to eslint v9 now appears to be eslint plugin import; see https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/issues/2948.

If a PR to remove the removate.json5 snippet above would be useful, please let me know.

Oh, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for checking that. I'd hold the upgrade for now then.
