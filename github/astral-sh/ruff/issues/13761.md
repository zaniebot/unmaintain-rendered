# Ruff splits subscript targets instead of parenthesizing the value.

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-10-15 13:20_

```python
my_object.elemnt[
    0
].subelement = SomeEnumName.VERY_VERY_VERY_LONG_ENUM_VALUE_DESCeeeeeebbbdddddddddddddddddeeeddddd
```

This is ugly :sweat: 

Black does a better job and formats it as:

```python
my_object.elemnt[0].subelement = (
	SomeEnumName.VERY_VERY_VERY_LONG_ENUM_VALUE_DESCeeeeeebbbdddddddddddddddddeeeddddd
)
```

Which would align with how subscripts are handled in `can_omit_optional_parentheses`:

Note, that Ruff does format subscript correctly when using more than one assignment target (in which case the formatter takes the `RightToLeft` formatting target (which prefers breaking the right side over the left side).
