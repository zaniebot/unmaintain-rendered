# Build ruff fails on FreeBSD

---

_Issue opened by @donnex on 2024-10-07 11:55_

Right now it's not possible to compile `ruff` on FreeBSD.

The build fails on `tikv-jemalloc-sys`.

This is problematic since `pip` tries to download and compile `ruff` if it's listed as a project dependency and this fails on FreeBSD.

This is probably the same issue that was recently fixed in `uv` at https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/7780

It seems that we intentionally enabled jemalloc on freebsd in the past. See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/2965

I wonder if the error your seeing is because `gmake` isn't installed. Can you try running /installing `gmake` ?

You are absolutely correct. The fault was all mine because of `gmake` missing from my systems. Thanks :pray:
