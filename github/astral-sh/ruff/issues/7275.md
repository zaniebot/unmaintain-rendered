# Ruff Isort line between import and from import

---

_Issue opened by @MehulBatra on 2023-09-11 17:40_


I saw Ruff insert a line between import and from import statements:

```
import Cython.Compiler.Options  

from Cython.Build import build_ext, cythonize 
```

How can this be avoided, I am on version v0.0.286
