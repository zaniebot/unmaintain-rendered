Can you try adding `preview = true` to your `pyproject.toml`, under `[tool.ruff]`?

@charliermarsh 
```toml
[tool.ruff]
preview = true
# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
exclude = [
    ".bzr",
    ".direnv",
    ".eggs",

It's still not working.Did I make a mistake?

Hm okay. This works for me but I use the old LSP (and vscode). 

Can you try removing the 
```
settings = {
    args = options.ruff_args,
  },
```

because the new server doesn't yet support options (but I'm just guessing at this point).

@snowsignal do you have an idea what's going on here?

@MichaReiser  I try removing the
```lua
settings = {
    args = options.ruff_args,
  },
```
but it's still not working,ruff-lsp works good for me.

Hey @a1401358759, I don't think the new server supporst configuring Ruff via the global `--config` flag or a local configuration file.

@snowsignal Correct me if I'm wrong here.

---

_Comment by @snowsignal on 2024-04-09 01:08_

@a1401358759 Right now the new server has a few limitations, especially around configuration. At the moment, we don't support configuring the server with the `--config` flag, nor do we support the `args` field in `settings` (like @dhruvmanila and @MichaReiser mentioned). Alternative configuration is something we're actively working on, but at the moment the configuration just defaults to any `pyproject.toml` / `ruff.toml` files at the root of your workspace or in parent folders.

Thank you for opening this issue - I'll follow up once we have a setting like this available.

@snowsignal Okay, thank you very much for your answer.

@a1401358759 Once https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/11140 lands in the next release, you should be able to specify a custom configuration file!

Here's what your LSP config could look like:
```lua
return {
  filetypes = { "python" },
  single_file_support = true,
  cmd = { "ruff", "server", "--preview", },
  settings = {
    configuration = "~/.config/nvim/pyproject.toml"
  },
}
```

The `configuration` setting is what you should use to specify the configuration file.

Let me know if you run into any more issues!

but ruff server still doesn't check E30* errors

Is there still a problem with my configuration?
