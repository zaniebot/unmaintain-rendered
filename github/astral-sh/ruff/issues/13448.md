This is a cumulative issue, because I don't want to pollute the issue tracker with errors, especially when red_knot is not yet fully released.

The files are not minimized because a single run of red_knot on a folder with one small file takes ~1 second, making minimization time consuming(in opposite to ruff)

Thank you very much for providing this corpus. It helped a lot in finding some bugs. With #14091, #14306, #14312, #14317, #14325, (#14326) and #14337 merged, we can now run red knot on all files in your corpus without panicking.
