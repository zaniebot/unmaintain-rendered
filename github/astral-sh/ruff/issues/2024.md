# Implement `flake8-executable`

---

_Issue opened by @sbrugman on 2023-01-20 11:40_

- [x] [`EXE001`](https://github.com/xuhdev/flake8-executable): Shebang is present but the file is not executable.
- [x] [`EXE002`](https://github.com/xuhdev/flake8-executable): The file is executable but no shebang is present.
- [x] [`EXE003`](https://github.com/xuhdev/flake8-executable): Shebang is present but does not contain "python".
- [x] [`EXE004`](https://github.com/xuhdev/flake8-executable): There is whitespace before shebang.
- [x] [`EXE005`](https://github.com/xuhdev/flake8-executable): There are blank or comment lines before shebang.

Tracking issue for `flake8-executable`:
> Very often, developers mess up the executable permissions and shebangs of Python files. For example,
 sometimes the executable permission was accidentally granted, sometimes it is forgotten. Moreover,
 this should be consistent with Top-level code environment checks.

(Plugin would already be relevant for `scripts/`)

This can probably be closed now if `EXE006` and `EXE007` from https://github.com/xuhdev/flake8-executable/pull/66 won't be implemented for the time being.
