# N805 First argument of a method should be named self -- false positive for __new__

---

_Issue opened by @LefterisJP on 2022-11-06 11:01_

In python `__new__` is a special method and its signature does not need to start with an argument named `self`. It most commonly looks like this:

```python
def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
    ....
```

Yet ruff will complain with `N805 First argument of a method should be named self`

Other exemptions present in the pep8-naming [source](https://github.com/PyCQA/pep8-naming/blob/main/src/pep8ext_naming.py): `__new__`, `__init_subclass__`, `__class_getitem__`, and any method in a class with `type` or `ABCMeta` in its base classes, are automatically class methods.
