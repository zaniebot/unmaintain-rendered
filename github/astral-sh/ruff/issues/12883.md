# PLW3201: Customize error message for dunder methods removed with Python 3

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-08-14 07:16_

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12607 proposed a new `dango-model-with-dunder-unicode` rule that flags any `__unicode__` dunder method. We realized that this is already covered by `PLW3201` (preview), but the error message could be improved to state that a dunder method is Python2 only explicitly. 

The comments list a few dunder methods that were removed with python 3:

* https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12607#issuecomment-2286703217
* https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12607#issuecomment-2286633321
* https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12607#issuecomment-2286597816

We should change `PLW3201` to use a custom error message for any dunder method that was removed with Python 3.
