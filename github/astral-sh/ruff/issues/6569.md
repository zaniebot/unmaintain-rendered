# Incorrectly reported undefined name in a loop

_Issue opened by @hotpxl on 2023-08-14 19:07_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Running `ruff --check` (no configuration needed) on 
```
def main():
    for i in range(100):
        if i != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            a = 0
```
yields an undefined name error and a "assigned to but never used" error, whereas
```
def main():
    for i in range(100):
        if i == 0:
            a = 0
        else:
            print(a)
```
is fine.

While one could argue that the former is bad style and hard to read, unfortunately there's quite a bit of code written in that style already. Is this something Ruff could understand?

Thanks for filing! Hmm, while I wish we could, I don't think we can reliably support this kind of conditional assignment. Even Pyright which has a much more sophisticated inference model marks `a` as possibly unbound in both cases. Ideally, we'd mark both cases as "possibly unbound", but even that wouldn't necessarily solve your problem, since you'd still have to fight that lint error.
