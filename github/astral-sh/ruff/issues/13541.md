# Feature request: Local variable never read

---

_Issue opened by @alippai on 2024-09-27 18:18_

It'd be useful to track if a local variable was read before assigned again:
```python
def main():
  x = 5
  x = 6
  print(x)
```
A common use-case is simply typos or using `if` instead of `elif`:
```python
if case1:
  x = 1
if case2:
  x = 2
else:
  x = 3
```
Where `x = 1` is never used.
The correct snippet after fixing the mistake would be:
```python
if case1:
  x = 1
elif case2:
  x = 2
else:
  x = 3
```

This likely depends on https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10891

Does `ty` help with this?
