# Ruff detecting external import as local import

---

_Issue opened by @Nar67 on 2023-04-11 11:56_

We are switching our projects to ruff and found that it sorts the `alembic` import as a local import instead of an external import and so it places it in the incorrect block of imports. 
We have a local `alembic` folder in the root of our projects and I assume it's what is causing the problem.



ruff version: `ruff 0.0.261`
python version: `3.9`


pyproject.toml:
```
[tool.ruff.isort] 
force-single-line = false
split-on-trailing-comma = true
lines-after-imports = 2
lines-between-types = 1
known-first-party = ["something"]
```

Ah, ok, and that `alembic` local folder is _not_ a Python module? Like it's a folder with some other contents?

(In case it's unclear, you _should_ be able to mark as `known-third-party = ["alembic"]` to unblock.)
