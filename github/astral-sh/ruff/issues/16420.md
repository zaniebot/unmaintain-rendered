# Allow CPY001 (missing-copyright-notice) to ignore empty files

---

_Issue opened by @benblank on 2025-02-27 19:30_

### Summary

In particular, empty `__init__.py` files are common enough and it's weird to copyright an otherwise-empty file or the copyright notice itself. 🙂

I've no strong opinion on whether this should be configurable or just the default.

Can you try if https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-copyright_min-file-size works for you? Otherwise, you can use `per-file-ignores` and exclude all `__init__.py` files

Yep, `min-file-size = 1` does the trick. I had assumed there was no setting for that because settings aren't mentioned on the CPY001 page itself. But they're linked from the CPY block of the rules page, which I also should have checked, so that's on me.

Apologies and thanks!
