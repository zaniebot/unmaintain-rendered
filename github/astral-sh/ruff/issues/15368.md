# Rename `flake8-builtins` options to remove the "builtins" prefix

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2025-01-09 08:19_

The "builtins" prefix for the `flake8-builtins` options is redundant and is inconsistent with other options like [`allowed-unused-imports`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pyflakes_allowed-unused-imports) or [`allowed-markup-calls`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_ruff_allowed-markup-calls).

- [ ] Rename [`builtins-allowed-modules`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_builtins-allowed-modules) -> `allowed-modules`
- [ ] Rename [`builtins-ignorelist`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-builtins_builtins-ignorelist) to `ignorelist`

Although we _can_ tackle this in 0.9 release, I'd say we do the rename (maintaining backwards compatibility) after the 0.9 release and hard deprecate in 0.11.

Backward compat seems nice. We could change `builtins-allowed-modules` because the only rule using it is still in preview but it probably makes little sense to only add the backwards compatibility for one setting and not the other.

Considering that both settings have the `builtins` prefix I don't see this blocking the release (because we renamed A005)

Yeah, the backwards incompatibility issue was why I didn't rename the setting at the same time as the rule (but I also didn't think hard about it; thanks @dhruvmanila for bringing this up!).

I agree that we should probably change the name of all settings together (the `builtins-` prefix is redundant), and going through a deprecation period. Let's add the new names for the settings (and add a deprecation message for the old ones) in the next patch release after v0.9. We can then add a hard error on using the old names for the settings from v0.11.0.
