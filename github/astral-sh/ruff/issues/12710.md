# False positive hardcoded-sql-expression (S608)

---

_Issue opened by @mats-erik on 2024-08-06 07:05_

Ruff (0.5.6) gives false positives for list concatenation if the added list contains sql, even if there is no string formatting done.
Other bug reports for false positives don't concern lists.

`class B(A):
    sqls = A.sqls + ["select colB from tableB"]`

`["select colA from tableA"] + ["select colB from tableB"]`
