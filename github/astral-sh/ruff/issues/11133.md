# Allow empty first line after code block with ruff format

---

_Issue opened by @alechouse97 on 2024-04-24 17:05_

I've seen some discussion on here about allowing/not allowing an empty first line after a new code block with `ruff format`. [This was updated to be allowed by black 24+](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/change_log.html#id16). It also seems that black's removing of the empty new line [was only a feature in black 23](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4193#issuecomment-1915008471); previous versions of black did not enforce this.

Is there any willingness to allow these empty newlines in ruff? Or perhaps an optional flag to allow them? I agree with others' opinions that ruff should not format existing code with no new line, but should allow empty new lines.

Thoughts?

This is a duplicate of https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9745. We're considering but have no plans changing this in the short term.
