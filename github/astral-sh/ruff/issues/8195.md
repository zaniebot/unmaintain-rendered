# `uncapitalized-environment-variables` (`SIM112`) - option to specify variable names to ignore

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2023-10-25 02:21_

there are some environment variables in our project that we do not control the capitalization of, it would be nice if there was an option to ignore certain variables

SEO: `https_proxy` `http_proxy`

There are also some environment variables that are built in to Windows that do not have uppercase names (including `Path`, `CommonProgramFiles`, `ProgramFiles(x86)`)
