# [feature] Differentiate between safe and unsafe fixes

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-05-02 09:07_

This task tracks the work implementing safe and unsafe fixes as described in #1997. 

*Safe* fixes are fixes that don't change the semantics of the program. *Unsafe* fixes may change the program's semantics; therefore, we advise users to manually review and test the changes.

@MichaReiser You can assign this to me, I'd like to take it to completion if it's open!

Hey @evanrittenhouse. Do you plan to work on all of it or individual sub-tasks?

From what I can tell, @zanieb has done quite a bit of progress on #4276 already. I'd happily take on #4184 - 87 though (and 76, if Zanie doesn't want to do it anymore).

 I have a draft PR for #4185 out already that hinges upon the completion of #4184, so I'm trying to knock that out. There's a list of the remaining linters that have `unspecified` fixes in the description for #4185. Since I'm already doing those, I figured I could just also take on #4186 and #4187, if nobody has any objections!

@zanieb should we close this issue? I'm okay deferring the add "message to fix" for now as it also is somewhat unrelated to the applicability work.
