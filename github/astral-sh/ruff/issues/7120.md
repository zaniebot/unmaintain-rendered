Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select B013 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
class OceanMonkey:
                try:
                    idle_time = 0
                except(Exception, ):
                    i
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/98889809016.py:4:23: B013 A length-one tuple literal is redundant in exception handlers
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/98889809016.py`, the rule codes B013, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
