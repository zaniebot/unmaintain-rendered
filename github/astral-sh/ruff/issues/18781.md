# Add lint rule for specific exceptions with empty handlers?

---

_Issue opened by @IndrajeetPatil on 2025-06-19 03:29_

## TLDR

Request for a new lint rule to flag specific exception handlers that only contain `pass` (or are otherwise empty), as these often hide important errors.

## Current behaviour

Ruff flags bare `except: pass` but doesn't consistently flag specific exceptions with empty handlers:

```python
# Currently flagged by existing rules
try:
    foo()
except:
    pass

# Not flagged, but arguably should be
try:
    foo()
except ValueError:
    pass  # Silent failure - debugging nightmare

try:
    foo()
except (KeyError, AttributeError):
    pass  # Multiple specific exceptions, still problematic
```

## Proposed rule

Flag specific exception handlers with only `pass` or empty bodies. This would catch "exception swallowing" that can hide real problems.

**Should flag:**

- `except SpecificError: pass`
- `except (Error1, Error2): pass`
- Empty except blocks (just whitespace/comments)

**Should not flag:**

- `except: pass` (already handled by existing rules)
- Exception handlers with any substantive content (logging, return, etc.)

## Rationale

Empty specific exception handlers are usually incomplete error handling that silently masks failures. Unlike bare `except:`, these appear more intentional, but are often equally problematic. For source code, a linter rule requiring at least a comment explaining why the exception is being ignored would be valuable. E.g. this is far better:

```python
try:
    foo()
except ValueError:
    pass  # Explicitly ignoring lint rule: explanation of why 
```

## Relationship to existing rules

Ruff already has `S110` (try-except-pass) which catches some cases, but it appears focused on bare `except:` blocks. Not sure if this should extend `S110` or be a separate rule since the specific exception case has different implications.

That does already exist as `SIM105` [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/ee87b988-7a14-40d1-a80a-785420973487)

Awesome! Thanks for the playground example :)

Sorry for missing this.
