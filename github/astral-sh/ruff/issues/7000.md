_Issue opened by @max-muoto on 2023-08-30 02:44_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

[Rule PT019](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/pytest-fixture-param-without-value/) flags unused mock arguments prefixed with underscores as Pytest fixtures.

### Example

```python
from unittest import mock

# `_func` gets treated as unused fixture, failing a `ruff check`.
@mock.patch("func")
def test(_func):
    assert 1 == 1
````

### Details
- Ruff version: v0.0.286
- Command: `ruff check .`

@charliermarsh Understand this is probably just due to fixture naming conventions, but just thought I would flag in case!
