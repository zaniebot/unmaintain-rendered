# Formatter: `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` preview style

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-10-27 10:37_



Port the `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` preview style added to black in [PR1](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3964) and [PR1]([second PR](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3992)) to ruff formatter:

For better readability and less verticality, _Black_ now pairs parantheses ("(", ")")
with braces ("{", "}") and square brackets ("[", "]") on the same line for single
parameter function calls. For example:

```python
foo(
    [
        1,
        2,
        3,
    ]
)
```

will be changed to:

```python
foo([
    1,
    2,
    3,
])
```

Don't forget to share your opinions in the black repo when the time comes.

> Last year I feel we may not have gotten enough feedback during this period, leading to some controversy over certain decisions, so I hope we'll be able to get more early feedback this year. If Ruff or its users could provide feedback on any preview-style features, I'd be happy.

@henriholopainen That's what's implemented in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8293/files#diff-b84e5729fb09571d5fd2e3fcba65612a57765cd6351ba6388b674208b79877ffR48-R60, right?

This is now supported via https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8293, though we don't yet apply these rules recursively (intentionally).

> we don't yet apply these rules recursively

Good choice, please never do so

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-12-19 00:17_

We're gonna continue without applying these rules recursively.
