# Support `resolve_call_path` resolution for same-file definitions

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-07-03 17:30_

If a user specifies a `classmethod` decorator or other setting based on a call path, we only respect that call path when the decorator is _imported_.

For example, if the file is `foo.py`, and user defines a method like:

```python
def bar():
  ...
```

Then if the user lists `"foo.bar"` as a call path for a call path-based setting, we _only_ respect it in files that `import foo` or `from foo import bar` etc. -- we wouldn't respect it in `foo.py` itself.
