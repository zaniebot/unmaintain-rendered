# Running standalone vs from venv

---

_Issue opened by @matdibu on 2025-09-15 13:50_

### Question

Hello! I'm currently running ruff as a standalone tool, on an entire monorepo.

Is there any reason to add ruff as a dev dependency to the individual packages and to run it from within the venv?

### Version

_No response_

One reason would be to ensure that you and your collaborators are using the same version of Ruff. Also note that if you manage your monorepo as a [`uv` workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/) then you could set the dependency for all of your packages at once, uniformly.

got it, thank you!

so there's no extra information that would be obtained from the venv, correct?
in the same way that mypy needs to be executed from the venv to "see" the dependencies

Not at this time, no - Ruff performs (with the exception of some rules that look at your directory structure) single-file analysis (as opposed to type-checkers like `mypy` or `ty`)
