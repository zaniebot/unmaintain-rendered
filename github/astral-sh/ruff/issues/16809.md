# [red-knot] Refactor Red Knot to use the new `Diagnostic` type. Delete "old" diagnostic code.

---

_Issue opened by @BurntSushi on 2025-03-17 15:07_

With #16503, we added types defining a new `Diagnostic` data model. In #16711, we added a renderer based on that new data model. At present, Red Knot is still using the "old" diagnostic types. In this issue, we should move forward by using the new types in Red Knot.

I expect that this will _mostly_ be a mechanical translation that doesn't impact the diagnostic output too much, but it might be hard to resist doing some improvements along the way.
