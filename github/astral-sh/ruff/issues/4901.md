# F841: unused local in 'with' statement with parethesised value does not converge

---

_Issue opened by @addisoncrump on 2023-06-06 09:56_

This is a really specific one. The following snippet prevents Ruff from converging:

```py
def e():
  with (input('>')) as f:
    print(1)
```

To trigger this, the value specified in the `with` must be parethesised and the `with` must not be in the global scope of the script.

Discovered by #4822.
