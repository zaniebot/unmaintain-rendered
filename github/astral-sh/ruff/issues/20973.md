# DOC502 false positive on `raise e`

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-10-19 22:12_

### Summary

[`docstring-extraneous-exception` (DOC502)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/docstring-extraneous-exception/) reports a false positive when an exception mentioned in the docstring is caught and explicitly reraised (i.e. `raise e` or `raise e from None`, assuming `e` is bound in the `except` clause and not rebound before it is raised). It correctly ignores implicit reraising (i.e. just `raise`) of a documented exception. The upstream implementation in pydoclint gets it right both ways. [Example](https://play.ruff.rs/ffc4e2ea-af0f-4ca4-a56e-ea2c40c373f8):
```console
$ cat >doc502.py <<'# EOF'
def f():
    """Do nothing.

    Raises
    ------
    OSError
        If the OS errors.
    """
    try:
        pass
    except OSError as e:
        raise e
# EOF
