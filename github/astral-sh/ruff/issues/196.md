# Syntax error doesn't cause ruff to exit with non-zero code

---

_Issue opened by @Jackenmen on 2022-09-15 01:51_

For code with invalid syntax, e.g:
```py
def x():
```

The output is:
```
❯ ruff repro.py
[2022-09-15][03:50:47][ruff][ERROR] Failed to check repro.py: Got unexpected EOF at line 2 column 1
Found 0 error(s).

❯ echo $?            
0

❯ flake8 repro.py
repro.py:1:8: E999 SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

❯ echo $?            
1
```
