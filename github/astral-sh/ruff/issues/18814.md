# [`Pylint`] `PLE0241` fix can delete comments

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-06-20 05:57_

### Summary

The fix for [duplicate-bases (PLE0241)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/duplicate-bases/#duplicate-bases-ple0241) can delete comments. In this case it should either be marked unsafe, not apply, or move the comments. [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/5bb7a327-e8eb-4cc0-872e-35eb2a616a29)

The fix should be marked as unsafe if it intersects with any comments and the fix safety should be documented.
