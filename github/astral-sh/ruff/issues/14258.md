# Import sorting does not respect `requires-python` when specified via inline script metadata

---

_Issue opened by @brettcannon on 2024-11-11 01:15_

In the below example I would expect `tomllib` to be sorted as a stdlib module as the script specifies that it requires Python 3.13 or newer which guarantees tomllib in the stdlib:
```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.13"
# ///

import sys

import tomllib
```

Related: #10457, #13446

We don't support reading any configuration from inline metadata yet.

I'll merge this into the above linked issue.
