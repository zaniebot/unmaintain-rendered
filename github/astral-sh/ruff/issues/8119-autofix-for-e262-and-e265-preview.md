# Autofix for `E262` and `E265` (preview)

_Issue opened by @Skylion007 on 2023-10-22 18:35_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Follow up to #8114 . This is also another really easy autofix to add. `E265` is nearly identical and should also warrant a similar easy autofix. This is probably a good first issue.
