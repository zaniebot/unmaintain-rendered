# Archlinux AUR package

---

_Issue opened by @mortymacs on 2022-12-04 21:20_

Hi,

I've prepared the AUR package for ArchLinux-based distributions.
Here is the link: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-ruff

Cheers,
Mort

@mortymacs - Oh cool, thank you! Will that automatically update when new releases are published?

@charliermarsh, I'm updating it manually as I don't have access to the repo to trigger a pipeline. But we can do something to make it automated. I can give you ownership of the AUR package and you can keep it updated by this Github Action: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-aur-package
What's your idea?

Yeah I'm open to that. How is the `PKGBUILD` file created?

Sorry for my delay in response. The `PKGBUILD` file should be created manually, which I already did (https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=python-ruff). The only change every time that should be applied to the file is the `pkgver` (version) and `sha256sum` variables. I already automated this process as well. I can send a PR if you want.

PR would be awesome if you're up for it.

I have good news!
The ArchLinux community officially prepared the package, and now it's in the official repository (https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/ruff/). Now, anyone can install it by `pacman -S ruff` without needing any AUR package.
So, I'm gonna close this issue :)
