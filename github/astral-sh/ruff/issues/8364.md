# Docs for file-level error suppression do not match error report

_Issue opened by @doolio on 2023-10-30 18:39_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

`ruff v0.1.3`

The [docs state](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter/#error-suppression) 

"To ignore all violations across an entire file, add `# ruff: noqa` to **any** line in the file" (emphasis mine)

But `ruff` reports the misuse of this suppression as:

"warning: Unexpected `# ruff: noqa` directive at <foo.py:29> . File-level suppression comments must appear on their own line. For line-level suppression, omit the `ruff:` prefix."

I think the docs should state this line should be on its own line. Happy to submit a PR for consideration.

The tutorial docs are more explicit stating the following:

"If we want to ignore a rule for an entire file, we can add a `# ruff: noqa` comment to the top of the file:"

Although, shouldn't it be:

"If we want to ignore a rule for an entire file, we can add a `# ruff: noqa: {code}` comment to the top of the file:"

From what you've stated here, this sounds wrong and should be fixed as you suggest.

PR welcome :)
