# [flake8-simplify] SIM911 false positive when methods have args

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-06-19 01:16_

### Summary

`SIM911` has a false positive if you give the methods args, since they are removed when it is transformed into `.items()`, which changes the behavior of the code to no longer raise a `TypeError`. If there is a situation in where the code thinks the variable is a `dict`, but it's actually the `dict` class, that could actually show up in non-constructed code. I was unable to find such a situation though. [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/fb6f3473-53a1-401b-88ea-a943232e4b44)
