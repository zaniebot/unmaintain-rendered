# git integration

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-02-15 14:30_

It would be nice if there would be a `git` integration so that via a command line option and a option in `pyproject.toml` would restrict `ruff .` to only files which are tracked in git and leave untracked files untouched.

I believe we already ignore anything in `.gitignore`. Are you seeing otherwise? Or are you imaging a different behavior?

we track the `.gitignore` in the repo, so I have lot of files which are untracked and not listed in `.gitignore` as I would not commit/push that.

Git lets you configure additional gitignore files via `git config core.excludesfile`. We could also pick that up.

I _think_ that's already picked up: https://docs.rs/ignore/latest/ignore/struct.WalkBuilder.html#method.git_global

OK, then using this as inspecting git might be too costy?

Yeah I think we in general should try to avoid adding new options when existing features do the job just fine.

(Agreed.)
