# How to sort methods?

---

_Issue opened by @Pedrexus on 2023-03-14 09:38_

Hello, 

I'm recently migrated my linter/formatter to ruff, but before I used a flake8 plugin that would sort methods, functions, properties in alphabetically. Is there any way to achieve this functionality in ruff?

In any case, thank you for this amazing lib. The speedups are impressive!
