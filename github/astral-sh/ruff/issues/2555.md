<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).

-->
When I run pre-commit, this error comes out:
```
ruff.....................................................................Failed
- hook id: ruff
- exit code: 2

error: the argument '--force-exclude' cannot be used multiple times

Usage: ruff.EXE check [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

For more information, try '--help'.
```
Using ruff with pre-commit.
```
rev: v0.0.240
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args:
          - --force-exclude
          - --extend-ignore=E501
```
`pyproject.toml`
```
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 80
```

We changed the pre-commit hook to include `--force-exclude` by default. You should be able to omit it now. Can you try removing the argument?
