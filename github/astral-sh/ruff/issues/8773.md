# False positive: non-lowercase-variable-in-function (N806) for a type alias

---

_Issue opened by @Tinche on 2023-11-20 00:08_

Howdy, this might be an easy one.

Using PEP 695 type aliases seems to trigger N806.

```python
def f() -> None:
    type MyInt = int
```

Setting aside that type aliases might be less common on the function level, I don't think this should trigger N806.
