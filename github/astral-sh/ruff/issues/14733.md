# Update `unncessary-regular-expression` (`RUF055`) fix to use `var == value`

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2024-12-02 15:16_

I think this should be `s == "abc"`. It's a minor stylistic difference (in which I think `x == VALUE` is more idiomatic), but it can cause actual differences due to type checking implementations, e.g. https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/9093
