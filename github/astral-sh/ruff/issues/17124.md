# UP018 fix introduces a syntax error when the argument contains a newline

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-04-01 15:37_

### Summary

The fix for [`native-literals` (UP018)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/native-literals/) can introduce a syntax error when the argument contains a newline between a unary `+` or `-` and a number literal. It should wrap the expression with parentheses as needed to avoid the error.
```console
$ cat >up018.py <<'# EOF'
int(-
1)
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check up018.py --select UP018 --diff 2>&1 | grep error:
error: Fix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.
```
