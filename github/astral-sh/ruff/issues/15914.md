# N815 does not enforce enums to be named IN_ALL_CAPS (pylint invalid-name)

---

_Issue opened by @Apakottur on 2025-02-03 15:49_

# Description
Consider the following code:
```python
# test.py
from enum import Enum, auto

class MyEnum(Enum):
    mango = auto()
    BANANA = auto()
```

Running
```shell
pylint test.py
```
Gives:
```
test.py:6:4: C0103: Class constant name "mango" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
```

According to the [Pylint tracking issue](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970), the `invalid-name` check is already implemented in Ruff under rule N815. However, running Ruff:
```shell
ruff check --select ALL test.py
```
Does not give any errors regarding the enum naming.

I'd expect Ruff to have a check that enforces enum members to be named in all caps, which is [recommended in the official docs](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/enum.html#module-enum).

# Details
```shell
ruff 0.9.4
pylint 3.3.4
astroid 3.3.8
Python 3.12.3 (main, Jan 17 2025, 18:03:48) [GCC 13.3.0]
```
