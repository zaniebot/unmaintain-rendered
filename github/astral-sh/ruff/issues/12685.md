# DOC202 false positive with abstract methods

---

_Issue opened by @mhooreman on 2024-08-05 11:27_

Hello,

### Context:
- An abstract method is defined
- The docstring of this abstract method has a return statement
- There is (obviously) no implementation in the abstract method ... and so no return statement

### Actual result:
 `DOC202 Docstring should not have a returns section because the function doesn't return anything`

### Expected result:
No error

### Keywords searched in issues list before creating this issue

- DOC202

### Code snippet:

```python
import abc

class A(metaclass=abc.abcmeta):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def f(self):
        """Lorem ipsum

        Returns
        -------
        dict:
            The values
        """

class C(A):
    def f(self):  # noqa: PLR6301 - this is for demo purpose
        return {}
```

### Remarks:
- Same result with type annotation given in the abstract method definition (e.g. `def f(self) -> dict:`)
- In terms of implementation, a possibility could be to check if the method is decorated as abstract before doing this test

Do you still see this in the latest release? We ignore stub functions already, so the example above doesn't raise a violation: https://play.ruff.rs/c6b7a90d-26a2-4a50-9b0a-8d5b0259a85f

0.5.7 did seem to fix it for me :)
