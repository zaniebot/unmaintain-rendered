# Migrate `sys.rs` generation to `stdlibs`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-05-09 00:55_

This was brought to my attention via email. We have a [script](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/56b4c47d74aecf9091890ffb8438c53f5822bb30/scripts/generate_known_standard_library.py) to generate https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_python_stdlib/src/sys.rs, and it does this by polling (e.g.) https://docs.python.org/3.10/objects.inv.

There's a nice Python library we can use instead of `objects.inv`, which (IIUC) catches a bunch of other modules that aren't present there (e.g., `_ssl`): https://github.com/omnilib/stdlibs
