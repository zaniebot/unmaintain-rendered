# Q000 Double/Single quotes message & config

---

_Issue opened by @tgross35 on 2022-11-03 01:57_

Hello,

Could the readme be updated to show how to configure Q000?

Currently, the readme says the message is "Single quotes found but double quotes preferred". However, the default message seems to be "Double quotes found but single quotes preferred", and I can't figure out how to configure this.

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length=88

[tool.ruff.flake8-quotes]
# configured based on example in readme, but the inline option doesn't seem to do anything
docstring-quotes = "double"
inline-quotes = "double"
```

```py
# test.py
ABC = "str"
```

```shell
# CLI
root@5d53afc0df87:/home# ruff --select Q .
Found 1 error(s).
test.py:1:7: Q000 Double quotes found but single quotes preferred
```

Just a little blurb in the readme in the `flake8-quotes` section about how to configure it would be nice. (I'd personally vouch for defaulting to prefer double quotes to match black, even though this doesn't match with the original flake-quotes)

Taking a look...

I agree with changing to match double quotes!

What you have above is actually working for me, but I think there's a bug with config caching (we're not invalidating the config when you change `inline-quotes`). Can you try running `ruff --select Q --no-cache .`?

(Or `rm -rf .ruff_cache` etc.)

Whoops you're right, just a caching thing! That explains some unusual results

It's a real bug! We need to invalidate the cache when you update those settings. (Great issue, by the way.)
