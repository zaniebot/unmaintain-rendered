# `FBT001` triggers for builtin types where positional arguments have to be used

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

I just migrated an internal mono-repo from flake8, isort, bandit and pylint to ruff and it's a true game changer! Thanks so much for all the work you put in here! 👏🏻

Here's a little edge-case that triggers `FBT001`, but shouldn't IMO:

```
str(True)
int(False)
float(False)

str(int(False))

# there might be more builtins with the same position-only behavior
```

Obviously, this requires for "FBT" to be included in the select list in settings.

`ruff 0.0.249`

This looks similar to #2629, if it helps

Good call, will add these exemptions.
