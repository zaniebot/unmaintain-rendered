# Feature request: A simple way to `ignore` all lint rules that conflict with the formatter

Would be nice to not have to add all 14 (or 15 if you include `E501`) of the formatter-conflicting rules individually to the `ignore` list. Having them individually stated also means I have to check in the docs that the list of conflicting rules hasn't changed when I update Ruff. Could be a special keyword in the `ignore` list or maybe something like `ignore-formatter-conflicts` in the `lint` section.

Yeah, this is something we should improve on and there's some discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8175

We now have a policy that we don't accept any new rules that conflict with the formatter. I hope that helps a bit :)
