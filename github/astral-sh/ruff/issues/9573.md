# Reharmonize `TCH*` rules with flake8-type-checking

---

_Issue opened by @Daverball on 2024-01-18 16:22_

There recently have been a whole bunch of contributions to flake8-type-checking made by yours truly which greatly decreased the rate of false positives/negatives and added new rules, as well as better support for SQLAlchemy.

Ruff independently added one of the rules which is slated to be added to `flake8-type-checking` in the next release as TC010 (string union syntax), whereas in Ruff the rule is TCH006.

Considering there's no longer a naming conflict in the `TC*` range (tryceratops kindly changed its code to match ruff's) I would suggest deprecating the `TCH*` rules and keep aliases around for backwards compatibility. At the same time we can reharmonize the rule numbering and make `TCH006` alias to `TC010`.

I can take a stab at porting some of the improvements from `flake8-type-checking` to Ruff, although I'm still a Rust novice, so I can't guarantee I will be able to contribute in a meaningful manner any time soon.

I think this makes sense, I don't know if it will be part of 0.2.0 or not. \cc @zanieb

@AlexWaygood Could we fit this into the 0.8.0 release (i.e. renaming `TCH` to `TC` while leaving redirects)?

Otherwise I will need to wait until the `TCH006` -> `TCH010` redirect gets removed before I can implement `TC006`.

I'm happy to open a PR myself.

@Daverball unfortunately I'm already somewhat behind on my tasks for this release, so I won't be able to work on this myself. I'd be very happy to review a PR targeting the `ruff-0.8` branch, however.

I can't immediately find the PRs in the past where we've remapped rules, but there have been some -- if you can find them, they should be a good template to use
