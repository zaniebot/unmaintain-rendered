# Add a script to generate all boilerplate needed for a new rule

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-01-01 18:13_

- Stub declarations in `src/checks.rs`
- Empty fixture file in `resources`
- Source file for the logic (e.g., `src/pyupgrade/plugins/os_error_alias.rs`) + imports in `mod.rs`
