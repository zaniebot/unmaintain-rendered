---

_Issue opened by @ran-isenberg on 2023-10-25 05:51_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

When using the recommended configuration presented in the readme file, an error is received:

the configuration: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ran-isenberg/9ac9b9d034a888f88d9c5e11b94a12b7/raw/14b21ae8b2cae73f43612c48079aaa2e5b217881/bug.yml

The output when running 'ruff format'
```
ruff failed
  Cause: TOML parse error at line 118, column 1
    |
118 | magic-trailing-comma = "respect"
    | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
unknown field `magic-trailing-comma`, expected one of `exclude`, `preview`, `indent-style`, `quote-style`, `skip-magic-trailing-comma`, `line-ending`
```

possible fix: remove magic-trailing-comma from the configuration example.
