# Consider replacing bincode

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2025-12-29 17:32_

bincode is now unmaintained (considered feature complete). It still gets security updates, for now. But we should probably consider moving to something else.

From what I know:

[borsh-rs](https://github.com/near/borsh-rs)  |  [wincode](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wincode)

But according to benchmarks, it seems that [bitcode](https://github.com/SoftbearStudios/bitcode) is one of the fastest
