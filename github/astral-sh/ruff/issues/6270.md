# [rule proposal] avoid creating temporary lists

---

_Issue opened by @dorschw on 2023-08-02 11:22_

```diff
- any([foo,bar])
+ any((foo,bar))
```

```diff
- all([foo,bar])
+ all((foo,bar))
```

```diff
- ",".join([foo,bar])
+ ",".join((foo,bar))
```

No reason to create a mutable list temporarily, where a tuple can be used. 
Not sure whether it should change temporary _sets_ to tuples in the any/all cases. (definitely not in the `join` case)

Seems like this would be partially covered by a PERFLINT rule (8301) that we have not implemented yet https://github.com/tonybaloney/perflint#w8301--use-tuple-instead-of-list-for-a-non-mutated-sequence-use-tuple-over-list . We should just add that rule and that would cover at least part of this use case. 

That wouldn't work for most of these example though as we would know which functions (even builtin ones) take an iterable versus a list explicitly.
