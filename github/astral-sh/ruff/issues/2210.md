# ruff --explain BLE001 wrong

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-26 18:15_

```
$ ruff --explain BLE001
blind-except

Code: BLE001 (flake8-bugbear)

Message formats:

* Do not catch blind exception: `{name}
```
says it comes from `flake8-bugbear` while it comes from https://pypi.org/project/flake8-blind-except/.

I guess it's because of substring matching, where `B` is sorted before `BLE`.

\cc @not-my-profile, maybe from a recent refactor?
