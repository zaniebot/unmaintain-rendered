# [Linter panic] My File: asv_bench\benchmarks\dtypes.py

---

_Issue opened by @FishAlchemist on 2023-05-08 11:12_

## Version(ruff --version)
**ruff 0.0.265**
## Command(Powershell)
```powershell
ruff check --select=ALL .\dtypes.py
```
**If you add --isolated , there will be no problem about Linter panic**
## Terminal Content(include stack trace)
```powershell
warning: `one-blank-line-before-class` (D203) and `no-blank-line-before-class` (D211) are incompatible. Ignoring `one-blank-line-before-class`.
warning: `multi-line-summary-first-line` (D212) and `multi-line-summary-second-line` (D213) are incompatible. Ignoring `multi-line-summary-second-line`.
warning: Linting panicked dtypes.py: This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BLinter%20panic%5D

with the relevant file contents, the `pyproject.toml` settings, and the following stack trace, we'd be very appreciative!

### Command(Powershell): --isolated

```

### Python Code in-place stack trace
```powershell
ruff check --select=ALL .
```
I don't know what the relevant file contents, so I copy dtypes.py to a separate folder with only it and pyproject.toml in it for testing.
This is what the terminal outputs when the file is placed where it should be
