# Use test-case macros to generate linter snapshot tests

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-10-13 13:25_

The boilerplate is getting a little unwieldy and continues to add friction when creating new checks. [test-case](https://crates.io/crates/test-case) looks like a reasonable solution.
