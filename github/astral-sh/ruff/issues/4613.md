# Warn about `dict.fromkeys(keys, mutable)`

---

_Issue opened by @janosh on 2023-05-23 21:21_

`ruff` should error and suggest the following fix when passing a mutable 2nd arg to `dict.fromkeys()` since modifications will affect all keys which is a common pitfall.

```py
# bad
dict.fromkeys((1, 2), {})
dict.fromkeys((1, 2), [])
dict.fromkeys((1, 2), set())
# ...

# good
{key: {} for key in (1, 2)}
{key: [] for key in (1, 2)}
{key: set() for key in (1, 2)}
```

Flake8-bugbear might be interested in adding this rule too, you should open an issue there as well.

Marking as accepted, makes sense to me.

I'll implement this tomorrow (as a precursor to #9592)!
