# SIM105 fix imports `builtins` to access `BaseException`

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2026-01-01 22:48_

### Summary

When the fix for [`suppressible-exception` (SIM105)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/suppressible-exception/) inserts a reference to `BaseException`, it always imports `builtins`, which is only necessary if `BaseException` has been shadowed, which is rare. [Example](https://play.ruff.rs/d11189ba-cfa1-41ba-a79c-0bdbeed77256):
```console
$ cat >sim105.py <<'# EOF'
import sys
try:
    sys.exit(2)
except:
    pass
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check sim105.py --select SIM105 --unsafe-fixes --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).

$ cat sim105.py
import sys
import contextlib
import builtins
with contextlib.suppress(builtins.BaseException):
    sys.exit(2)
```

Thanks! I think we should just be able to use [`get_or_import_builtin_symbol`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/26230b1ed3db02f5c2d5b9ed9d49c70062d66736/crates/ruff_linter/src/importer/mod.rs#L294) here instead:
