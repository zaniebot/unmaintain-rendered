# SIM117 false alert mixing `async with` and `with` statements

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

[SIM117](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/multiple-with-statements/) is triggered by this code:
```
with localhost.keep_awake():
        async with locking.lock("xxx"):
                ...
```
This is a false alert as it is impossible to merge a `with` statement and an `async with` statement together.

Keywords: `SIM117`
Command: `ruff check .`
Ruff settings: none
Ruff version: `ruff 0.4.8`

Hi, thanks for the report! Unfortunately I can't reproduce this locally or in the playground: https://play.ruff.rs/7d1da502-34d7-4833-a3e1-7dacdc65d03a. Would you be able to provide a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)? :)

Of course. My current code behind these calls is super heavy. Will extract a minimal reproducible example tomorrow (wednesday).

This was a false alert! There was below the first 2 lines extracted above a third line with another `async with` context. So the `SIM117` alert was legitimate and this bug report is wrong. Sorry for the noise.

No worries -- thanks for taking the time to write up a bug report!
