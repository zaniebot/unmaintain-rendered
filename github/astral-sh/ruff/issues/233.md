# Can `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE` use glob-style items?

---

_Issue opened by @amotl on 2022-09-20 15:26_

Hi again,

at #232, I learned more about the internals of `ruff`, and how to configure it properly - thank you very much.

On this matter, I humbly wanted to ask if the `DEFAULT_EXCLUDE` list would be capable of accepting and evaluating glob-style items? We are using the convention of `.venv36`, `.venv37`, etc., for having multiple virtualenv folders within our working trees.

https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/blob/09b926fd59115afc8f47c191b86ad7c47c79889e/src/settings.rs#L54-L76

With kind regards,
Andreas.

If this is going to be implemented, my small ask is for the pattern to be `venv*`/`.venv*` rather than the potential alternative of `venv3`/`.venv3*` so that it works with my `.venvs` directory :heart:

I think the fact that we now support `.gitignore` and friends probably covers this need.
