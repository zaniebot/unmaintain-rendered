# [ruff server] LSP treats pyi/stub files as regular python files instead of stub files. ruff-lsp does the right thing.

version: 0.4.5

Tried the new `ruff-server`, noticed that it was giving me lint warning about pyi files that were not reported by `ruff check`.

Going back to `ruff-lsp` fixed it.
