#  --statistics --show-source  not supported

_Issue opened by @youknowone on 2023-04-28 10:38_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

```console
$ ruff . --statistics --show-source
error: the argument '--statistics' cannot be used with '--show-source'
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.261
```
I don't have `pyproject.toml`

This is working just as expected with flake8.

I found it  while working on https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues/4943

Ah yeah, this is an intentional difference -- we treat `--statistics` a little differently, effectively as its own subcommand. When you run Ruff with `--statistics`, we _just_ print the statistics and not the violations, whereas Flake8 prints both. The thinking was that `--statistics` would be more of a one-off or few-time command vs. the standard linting workflow.

@charliermarsh My ci looks like:
```yaml
 - ruff check; ruff check --statistics
 ```
 
 I can't think of any reason I would not want this extra information to show.
