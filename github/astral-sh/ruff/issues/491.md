# Feature request: add support for C901, McCabe cyclomatic complexity

---

_Issue opened by @tgross35 on 2022-10-27 17:58_

Sorry for the recent flurry of issues, this is just one for a "blue sky" milestone

Link to relevant source: https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe

This can be run in flake8 `--max-complexity 10` which creates C901, or run on its own to show the complexity of various functions. Anything ≤ 10 is usually considered acceptable.

Implementation is pretty basic: for each function start with 1, then add 1 for every `if`, `elif`, `for`, `while`, `try`, `except`, `case` or `def` block it contains (but not for `else` since that's the "default" path).

This site describes it a bit better https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/C901.html
