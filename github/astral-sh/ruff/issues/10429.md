<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Requesting a setting to enable `if TYPE_CHECKING:` imports of `banned-api` imports.
Often times a module may be undesirable to import at runtime, but a TYPE_CHECKING import causes no issues. 

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

from banned_pkg import Foo # violates TID251

if TYPE_CHECKING:
   from banned_pkg import Bar # this is okay
```
