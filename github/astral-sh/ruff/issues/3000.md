# Support commas between directives

---

_Issue opened by @NeilGirdhar on 2023-02-17 23:23_

It would a bit nicer to support semicolons between directives:
```python
value_state = value._state  # pylint: disable=protected-access; noqa: SLF001
```
in addition to:
```python
value_state = value._state  # pylint: disable=protected-access # noqa: SLF001
```

Come to think of it, if we had https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/2999, we don't need this.
