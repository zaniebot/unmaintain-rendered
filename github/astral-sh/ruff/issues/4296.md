# Generalize comment handling in `flake8-comprehension` fixes

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-05-09 01:08_

I've provided a few examples but there will be a few more. As mentioned that whenever the parenthesis or brackets are being dropped, that's where this will happen. It seems to be happening in most of comprehension fixes.

I believe we should have a generalized way of resolving this.
