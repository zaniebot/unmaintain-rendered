Hi,

With Ruff 0.3.5 (previous version tested was 0.3.0),
it seems Q000 keeps popping up.

- when only Q002 is selected (in pyproject.toml)
- when Q is selected and Q000 is in "ignore" (in pyproject.toml)
- when running `ruff check --ignore Q000`

Thanks for opening the issue! Luckily this has already been fixed on the `main` branch, so the fix will definitely be included in the next release :-)

Closing as a duplicate of #10724
