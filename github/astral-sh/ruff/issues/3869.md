# BUG: false positives in B030

---

_Issue opened by @neutrinoceros on 2023-04-03 20:01_


```python
# reprod.py
black_list = (TypeError, ValueError)
grey_list = (ImportError, FileNotFoundError)

try:
    pass
except (*grey_list, *black_list):
    pass
```
```
$ flake8 reprod.py --select B030 # no error reported !
$ ruff reprod.py --select B030 --isolated
reprod.py:6:9: B030 `except` handlers should only be exception classes or tuples of exception classes
reprod.py:6:21: B030 `except` handlers should only be exception classes or tuples of exception classes
Found 2 errors.
```

`ruff --version` -> `ruff 0.0.260`

Note that this edge case used to be problematic in flake8-bugbear too (see https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/issues/153)
