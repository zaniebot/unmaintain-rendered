# [Autofix error] UP012 autofix doesn't work properly with string using implicit concatenation

_Issue opened by @lengau on 2023-05-10 01:07_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

The following code gets a detected syntax error from the UP012 autofix:

```python
a = (
    "abc"
    "def"
).encode()
```

when running with `ruff check --isolated --fix --select UP012 test.py` in ruff 0.0.265.

P.S. Thanks for the great tool!
