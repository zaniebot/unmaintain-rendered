# Ruff --add-noqa placed incorrectly for multi-line strings

---

_Issue opened by @fennerm on 2023-05-17 22:22_

(ruff=v0.0.267).

Minimal example:
```
weirdly_Cased: str = """
Some long
string.
"""
```

When running `ruff --add-noqa` it inserts the noqa annotation into the string itself
```
weirdly_Cased: str = """  # noqa: N816
Some long
string.
"""
```

Thanks!

(Gonna close in favor of #4483 since these are roughly the same issue.)
