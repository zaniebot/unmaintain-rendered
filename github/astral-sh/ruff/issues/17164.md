# [red-knot] Redudant-cast false positive for `@Todo` types

---

_Issue opened by @sharkdp on 2025-04-03 08:11_

We have existing handling for filtering out `@Todo` types, but apparently it doesn't work in this case:
```py
from typing import cast, Any

def f(a: Any):
    cast(dict[str, Any], a)  # Value is already of type `@Todo`
```
