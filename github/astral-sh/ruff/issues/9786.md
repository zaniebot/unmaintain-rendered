# Rule for naming functions inside function

---

_Issue opened by @Greesb on 2024-02-02 13:22_

Hello,

Just thought about a potential rule that would be triggered when a function inside a function doesn't have a specific (configurable) prefix, eg:
```python
def my_outer_func():
    # maybe some code maybe not
    def idk():  # error: function inside function should have the `inner_` prefix
        pass
    # maybe some code again maybe not
    idk()
    # maybe some code again again maybe not
```

Would make it more identifiable that the called `idk` is (re)defined inside the function and avoid having to look for it elsewhere.

What do you think ?
