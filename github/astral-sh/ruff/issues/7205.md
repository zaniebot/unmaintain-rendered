# Rule suggestion: Prevent walrus assignments in assert statements

---

_Issue opened by @awaelchli on 2023-09-06 17:08_

If you want to make your software package run with the `python -O` optimization, you might want to ensure that the code does not contain a walrus assignment in `assert` statements:

```py
y = 0
assert (x := y) is not None
x = x + 1
```

This code example runs fine normally, but if run with `python -O` the assertion gets removed and the program raises a `UnboundLocalError` because x is no longer bound. 

As a developer, I might want to configure my linter in such a way that walrus assignments are not allowed in assertion statements. This way, I can enforce that the code will be compatible running with `python -O`.

Seems reasonable to me. We can add it as a `RUF` rule.
