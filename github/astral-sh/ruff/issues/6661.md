# Please implement SIM905

---

_Issue opened by @nth10sd on 2023-08-17 20:46_

`x = "abc bcd cde".split(" ")` will turn into `x = ["abc", "bcd", "cde"]`. This rule is called `Split string directly if only constants are used`, however, it is an experimental `SIM9` flake8-simplify rule and I'm not sure if it's applicable yet.

```
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.0.284
```
