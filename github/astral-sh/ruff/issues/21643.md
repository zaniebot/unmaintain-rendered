# ruff format cli does not show what file was changed.

---

_Issue opened by @toppk on 2025-11-26 15:19_

### Summary

This is a frequently annoy bug for my pre-commit, that running ruff format will not tell you what file was actually updated, even with '-v'.    My issue happened when I accidentally staged a file that needed work, but didn't see any file that I wanted to commit in "changes".   

See also, https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit/issues/145  which I suspect will need to add "-v" default args or some such once ruff format has a capability /option to show what files it modified.
