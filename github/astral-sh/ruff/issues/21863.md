# Disagreement with isort

---

_Issue opened by @thmo on 2025-12-09 12:07_

### Summary

This minimal example:
```python
from foo import a
from foo import b as _b
from foo import c
```
is accepted without fixes by isort:
```bash
$ isort --diff import-test.py
```
but `ruff` wants to change it like this:
```bash
$ ruff check --select I --diff import-test.py
(... see below... )
Would fix 1 error.
```
```diff
--- import-test.py
+++ import-test.py
@@ -1,3 +1,2 @@
-from foo import a
+from foo import a, c
 from foo import b as _b
-from foo import c
```

This is with `isort 6.1.0` from Fedora (`python3-isort-6.1.0-1.fc42.noarch`) and `ruff 0.14.5` from Fedora (`ruff-0.14.5-1.fc42.x86_64`).

I think this is the deviation called out in https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#can-i-write-my-own-linter-plugins-for-ruff

So, basically #1381? What is the best way to cope with this if some team members use `isort` while others use `ruff` (e.g., via zed)?

We don't recommend using `isort` and `ruff` as there can be other, smaller differences. Use one or the other in your project.
