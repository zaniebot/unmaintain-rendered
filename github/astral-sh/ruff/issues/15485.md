cc @AlexWaygood, I tried re-running but that failed as well. The specific workflow job is https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/runs/12778917699/job/35630616320

Looks like this is related to https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10188 which has been fixed upstream in the meantime. I suggest we do one manual sync (#15492) and then simply wait for this runner update: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/pull/11377.
