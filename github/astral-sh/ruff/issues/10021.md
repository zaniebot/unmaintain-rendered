# CPY001: allow SPDX copyright identifiers

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2024-02-18 11:10_

`CPY001` should not detect, e.g.:

```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022-2024 Univention GmbH
# SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only
```

see https://spdx.org/licenses/

The [Reuse Specification](https://reuse.software/spec/) with it's corresponding python [tool](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool) implement this, so you could take a look there. It also checks for missing license specifiers.

Can't you achieve this with https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-copyright_notice-rgx?

Oh, we do now allow these, I added it.
