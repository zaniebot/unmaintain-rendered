# DOC201 / D400 shouldn't raise on a `@wraps()`-decorated function

_Issue opened by @tigerhawkvok on 2025-11-21 17:55_

### Summary

... optionally, unless the wrapped function is itself missing a docstring.

But in any case, a wrapped function isn't really logically independent, and depending on your configuration, can report the wrapped function's docstring anyway (though noteably VSCode doesn't do this unless you wrap `wraps` to share-down `func.__doc__`)

### Version

ruff 0.14.6 (59c6cb521 2025-11-21)

I'm not really sure what you mean by this. Can you give examples where the lint rules produce incorrect diagnostics? Maybe a [playground link](https://play.ruff.rs)?
