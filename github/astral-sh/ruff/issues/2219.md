# SIM111 autofix causes "not foo not in bar" which can be enhanced

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-26 20:28_

`SIM111` simplifies 
```diff
-               for oc in self.objectClasses:
-                       if oc not in objectClasses:
-                               return False
-               return True
+               return all(not oc not in objectClasses for oc in self.objectClasses)
```

better would be:
`return not any(oc in objectClasses for oc in self.objectClasses)`

could be identified and fixed by `SIM110` instead of `SIM111` then.
