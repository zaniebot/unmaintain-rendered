# [pydocstyle] Document which rules are disabled by which conventions?

---

_Issue opened by @alanhdu on 2023-11-09 03:30_

On https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#pydocstyle-convention, it says

> Enabling a convention will force-disable any rules that are not included in the specified convention

But I can't seem to find documentation about *which* rules are included in *which* conventions! Maybe I totally missed it, but I only found this information by going to the source code and finding https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4760af3dcbcf772fdcc1cae9aa9d0c4b8037c132/crates/ruff_linter/src/rules/pydocstyle/settings.rs#L24

Is there some place this is documented? If not, how easy/hard would it be to add some documentation? I'd be happy to contribute a patch if the best way is to just add some markdown at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/4760af3dcbcf772fdcc1cae9aa9d0c4b8037c132/crates/ruff_workspace/src/options.rs#L2378, but maybe there's some clever way to auto-generate that information from the code to ensure it stays in sync?

The list originally comes from pydocstyle. Perhaps we could enumerate the conventions in the FAQ, as part of the "Does Ruff support NumPy- or Google-style docstrings?" section?

Adding this real quick.
