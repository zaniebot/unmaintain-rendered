Humble rule request. Help us detect and transform code like:
```python
requests.get("https://example.com/api?address={0}&page={1}&offset={2}&sort=desc&apikey={3}".format(...
```
to
```python
requests.get(
    "https://example.com/api",
    params={
        "address": self.address,
        "page": page,
        "offset": offset,
        "sort": "desc",
        "apikey": KEY,
    },
)
```
