# Disable E501 for inline comments

_Issue opened by @Actticus on 2023-09-15 05:32_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Our project has pytest-cov, and some lines are disabled from being checked. We use the # noqa: nocover comment, and sometimes it goes beyond the length of the line. I would like to disable the E501 error for inline comments, is there any way to do this?

Do you want E501 to be disabled for _all_ inline comments, or only pragma comments like `# noqa`?

I think it's better for all inline comments

For now, we are disabling E501 for pragma comments, but not for all inline comments (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7692).
