# [FEATURE] Only allow relative imports

---

_Issue opened by @Kludex on 2023-05-02 12:19_

I've created https://github.com/Kludex/only-relative-import/ (only lints for now), but it's more comfortable to have it here. Would it be possible?

This is the opposite of `only-absolute-imports`.

We could probably add support for this as a configurable setting in `TID252` (e.g., `strictness = "require"` or something). Would prefer a configurable rule rather than adding a rule that directly conflicts with `TID252`.

This is also offered by https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/absolufy-imports using the `--never` option.

I would love to see this in ruff!
