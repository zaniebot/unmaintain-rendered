# Request: `external` also matching prefixes

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-10-24 17:09_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Coming from https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/8153 with `ruff==0.1.1`, there is the [`external` setting](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#external) for third party tools using `noqa` comments. It currently works solely on exact matching of the codes inside the list.

For tools like [pydoclint](https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint), which has `DOC` error codes: [jsh9/pydoclint#3-style-violation-codes](https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint#3-style-violation-codes), it would be useful if `external` worked using prefixes as well.  That way, one could just have `external = ["DOC"]`.

So the request is to have `external` also work using prefix matching (not just exact matching).
