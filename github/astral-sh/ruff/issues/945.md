# Auto-generate options reference in `README.md`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-11-28 20:18_

I just put that together manually for now, roughly in the style of [rustfmt](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustfmt/?version=v1.5.1&search=), but it'd be far preferable to auto-generate that section.
