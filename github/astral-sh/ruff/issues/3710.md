Hi! [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) maintainer here. We noticed that `v0.0.259` was tagged, but is not yet marked as latest on the repo's [releases page](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases). I'm filing this issue to confirm if the release is ready to be marked as latest, so that we can go ahead and ship it. Thanks!

Yes, `v0.0.259` is the latest release as there was a regression in `v0.0.258`. I guess he must've forgotten to mark it as the latest one.

Also, the `v0.0.258` release has been [yanked from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/#history).
