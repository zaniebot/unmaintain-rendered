# `unnecessary-builtin-import` (UP029)’s documentation does not match its implementation

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-10-30 17:22_

### Summary

[`unnecessary-builtin-import` (UP029)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-builtin-import/)’s documentation does not match its implementation or original purpose. It says:
> ## What it does
>
> Checks for unnecessary imports of builtins.
>
> ## Why is this bad?
>
> Builtins are always available. Importing them is unnecessary and should be removed to avoid confusion.

The documentation is correct that importing builtins is unnecessary. Maybe there should be a rule for that. However, that is not what this rule actually does. It does not check for all imports of builtins, e.g. `from builtins import tuple`. The purpose of the corresponding piece of [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) is to upgrade imports of builtins that are only necessary when using libraries like python-future or six for compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3.
