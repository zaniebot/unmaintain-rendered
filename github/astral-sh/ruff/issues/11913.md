# `ruff server`: Implement snapshot tests for code actions

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-06-18 03:50_

Similar to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/11912, we need snapshot tests to verify that the contents of code actions, both quick fixes and source actions, remain consistent with various test documents.
