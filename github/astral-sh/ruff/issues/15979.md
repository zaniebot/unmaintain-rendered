# Add a `README` file for the `red_knot` crate

---

_Issue opened by @InSyncWithFoo on 2025-02-05 20:15_

As Red Knot is now "[officially](https://bsky.app/profile/crmarsh.com/post/3lgvhzdfrps26)" public knowledge, the crate should at least have a short informational user-facing `README` explaining what it is, what its goals and non-goals are as well as what state it is currently in.

Such a file would serve as the single source of truth, which might help with attracting more potential contributors.
