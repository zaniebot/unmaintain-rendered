# Format `PatternMatchStar`

---

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2023-08-14 12:44_

This would be done in a similar manner as mentioned here (https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6555#issuecomment-1677241864) except that this would be delegated to [`Identifier`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/b05574babd6224af99938a429d0b19ba3297513c/crates/ruff_python_formatter/src/other/identifier.rs) formatting instead.

Implement formatting for the `*pat` pattern

```python
match x:
    case [1, 2, *rest]:
        ...
    case [*_]:
        ...
```
