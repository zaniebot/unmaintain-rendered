# Add a JSON schema for `ruff.toml`

And submit it to https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore. That way, you'll get autocomplete in editors, etc.

Should it be auto-generated like in #1015?

Yeah

Note though that `ruff.toml` won't be drop-in identical to `pyproject.toml`. It'll be like [`hatch.toml`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/) -- so, identical to `pyproject.toml`, but without `[tool.ruff]`.
