# Extend bad-dunder-method name to permit __index__

---

_Issue opened by @burgholzer on 2023-10-27 12:33_

https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/bad-dunder-method-name/ currently flags the standard python dunder method `__index__` (see https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/operator.html#operator.__index__ ) as invalid.

If you deem it reasonable, I am happy to submit a PR adding it.

That seems reasonable to me — PR welcome!
