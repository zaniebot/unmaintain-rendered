# What does `noqa_row` mean in the json output of `ruff check`?

---

_Issue opened by @peanutfun on 2026-01-07 09:38_

### Question

The JSON output of `ruff check` reports a location (row/col), an end location (row/col), and a `noqa_row`. What does the latter mean and how does it relate to the other two locations?

### Version

ruff 0.13.1 (706be0a6e 2025-09-18)

`noqa_row` is a legacy field that the old Ruff LSP used. It's the number of the row at which the `noqa` suppression comment has to be inserted at the end to suppress the violation. We'll probably remove this field in the future.
