# `FURB118` is incorrector for `operator.contains`. The operands are reversed!

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
There is a bug in the fixit for the FURB118
```python
f = lambda a, b: a in b
```
gets replaced with
```python
f = operator.contains
```
but this is NOT semantically equivalent. [Per the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.contains), `operator.contains` is equivalent to `b in a` not `a in b`!
```python
f = lambda a, b: b in a
```
is actually equivalent to `operator.contains` not what is actually getting flagged (or fixed) by refurb.

This is appearing when trying to apply this fix with ruff master.
