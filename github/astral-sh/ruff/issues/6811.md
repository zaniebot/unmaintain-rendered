_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-08-23 10:23_

Ruff 0.0.285 (latest changes from main branch)

```
ruff  *.py --select EM101 --no-cache
```

file content:
```
def test_numpy_raises_with_prefix_two(self):
    import re
   raise re.eror("hi")
```

error:
```
This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `PY_FILE_TEST_2368904233.py`, the rule codes EM101, F401, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
```

I'm guessing this is like https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/6721? Invalid syntax that we don't fail to parse?
