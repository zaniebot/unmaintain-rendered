# `ruff server` should support an optional TOML configuration file

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-04-16 21:45_

In addition to common Ruff configuration fields that were introduced in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/10984, `ruff server` should support a configuration file that can be used to configure the linter and formatter. These will take priority over file-based settings by default, though an option to have file-based settings take priority should also be available to the user.

Shouldn't it simply use the parameters from `~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml` ? Do you plan to introduce a LS specific config file ?

Yeah it will read and support that just like a CLI invocation. But some users will want to point to a specific configuration file, and we want to expose that (e.g.) in the VS Code settings pane.

Ok, this makes perfect sense.
Best of luck with the brand new Rust language server.
Thanks once again for your amazing contribution to the Python ecosystem !
