<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

pre-commit config:
```
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    # Ruff version.
    rev: v0.0.277
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: ["--fix", "--exit-non-zero-on-fix"]
```

I'm still getting E501 errors which should ideally get fixed as autofix is enabled. Not sure if i'm missing something or if it's an issue.

Hy @sahajvss 

Ruff only supports fixes for some rules and rule `E501` is one such rule for which does not yet support an autofixing (but may in the future). The [rule table](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/) in the documentation shows which violations support autofix. 

I hope this clarifies why `E501` doesn't get fixed. If not, don't hesitant to reply again.
