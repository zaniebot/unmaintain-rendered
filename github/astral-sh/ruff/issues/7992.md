# Remove the "nursery" rule group

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-10-16 19:09_

`RuleGroup::Nursery` is currently included for backwards compatibility but should be removed in Ruff v0.2.0

This change will include removing backwards compatible selection of nursery rules. All nursery rules should be moved to preview.

We may want to keep `RuleSelector::Nursery` in order to throw a nicer error message then remove it in v0.3.0 but I'm not sure how feasible that will be. If we keep it, we should hide it from the schema.

In #9683 we make this error in most cases, but retain the selector for error messages.

In v0.3.0 we should remove the group entirely.
