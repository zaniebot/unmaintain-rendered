# 0.0.179 not on PyPI

_Issue opened by @g-as on 2022-12-14 09:36_

Not a big deal, but I thought I'd warn you in case there's a broken workflow somewhere.

I noticed that it can take a few hours until PyPI gets updated.

Very strange, thank you. For some reason the release creation didn't kick off the GitHub Action?

Let me see if it resolves itself with [v0.0.180](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.180).

Not sure what happened, maybe a GitHub error, but [v0.0.180](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) is now up (which contains just one bug fix on top of v0.0.179).
