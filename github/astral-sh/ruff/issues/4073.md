# [Feature Request] Add pre-commit rules.

---

_Issue opened by @veritas9872 on 2023-04-24 01:30_

Thank you for the great work on `ruff`! I would like to ask if the official hooks in the `pre-commit` repository could be implemented in `ruff`. While these are not always related to Python, they are very commonly used and implementing them in `ruff` would benefit many projects. Some rules already overlap, such as finding `breakpoint()` code, but implementing the rest may be beneficial.

~I believe this is already supported by flake8-debugger's [T100](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#flake8-debugger-t10)~

Nevermind, re-read 😅

@edgarrmondragon Thank you for the comment. I intended the example as one that was already implemented. However, the other rules, such as excluding files that are too large, checking Python AST, check YAML & TOML, etc. are not implemented in `ruff` to the best of my knowledge.

I'd also love to see the pre-commit rules implemented.
Right now, my pre-commit rules include ruff and check-yaml and check-toml from the pre-commit repo.
If the pre-commit rules were included in ruff all checks could be done with a single tool.
While these rules aren't about .py files, they are about file types commonly used together with Python.

I would like to see the `debug-statements` hook which just checks for `breakpoint()` calls, seems very in line with the Python linter.

@PGijsbers as mentioned previously, that specific one should be covered by T100

Sorry, my bad. Must have glossed over the strikethrough.
