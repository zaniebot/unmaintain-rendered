# Docs: Ruff formatter and conflicting isort rules ambiguity

---

_Issue opened by @thernstig on 2023-10-26 06:55_

I have read all the docs now, and they are in general in great shape! So good job. There was only one section I could not grok, and I believe it could use some kind of improvement in its description.

From https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#conflicting-lint-rules

> Similarly, we recommend disabling the following isort settings, which are incompatible with the formatter's treatment of import statements when set to non-default values:

Some of the settings are not able to be "disabled" per se. And there seems to be no action to take by a user if just using the formatter as-is, right?

Could the sentence be rephrased slightly?
