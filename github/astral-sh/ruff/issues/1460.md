# Add autofix for "unused variable"

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-12-30 02:44_

To start, we can just mimic `autoflake`, whose logic is relatively simple: https://github.com/PyCQA/autoflake/blob/60eeb31082bf5290341e84a008d5c832fb04fd13/autoflake.py#L664.

(Not "trivial" but could be a good first issue if anyone's interested given that the `autoflake` logic can mostly be ported over.)
