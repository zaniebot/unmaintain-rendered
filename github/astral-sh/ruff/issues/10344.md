# E712 "true-false-comparison" incorrectly raises on array like

---

_Issue opened by @tigerhawkvok on 2024-03-11 18:03_

Consider

```python
import pandas as pd
s = pd.Series([True, True, False, False, None, None])
filter = s != False # [True, True, False, False, True, True]
notAFilter = s is not False # True
```

or similar operations on array-likes. Here, E712 is very much _not_ equivalent, and in fact, wrong.


This may not be tractable as it requires type analysis.
