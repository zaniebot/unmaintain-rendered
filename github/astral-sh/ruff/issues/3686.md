# Logical-line rules are unintentionally included in the docs

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-03-23 17:08_

When we migrated from a feature flag to debug assertions, we started including rules like E203 in the docs, despite the fact that they're not yet enabled in production.

See: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/1842#issuecomment-1481549593.
