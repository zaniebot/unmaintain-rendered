# D1** not detecting names made public via import/__all__ idiom

---

_Issue opened by @alicederyn on 2025-03-07 14:01_

### Summary

It's a common pattern to implement all one's code in private modules, and then have the top-level module export the names via `from ._child import SomethingPublic` and `__all__ = ["SomethingPublic"]`. This allows the code to be structured in a way that makes sense (small modules, helper functions grouped with the code that uses it), without that leaking out into the public API in a way which prevents restructuring later.

Unfortunately the D1** rules don't recognize this idiom, so don't flag up any missing documentation for libraries written this way. It would be great if that could be supported!

Thanks for opening this issue. 

This does make sense but, unfortunately, requires multifile analysis. What's tricky about this is that `SomethingPublic` needs to know if it's re-exported in any other file (or at least, any parent module). This isn't something that Ruff can support today. We're working on a new multifile-analsys backend that can support those kind of queries but it will take us a good while before we can use it in Ruff.
