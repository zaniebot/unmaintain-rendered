# B024 false negative when there's a class var

---

_Issue opened by @aureliojargas on 2024-04-29 21:01_

Taking the example from https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/abstract-base-class-without-abstract-method/

```python
from abc import ABC


class Foo(ABC):
    def method(self):
        bar()
```

B024 detects it as expected:

```console
$ ruff --version
ruff 0.4.2
$ ruff check --isolated --select B024 abc.py 
abc.py:4:7: B024 `Foo` is an abstract base class, but it has no abstract methods
Found 1 error.
$
```

But if I add a simple class var, now it passes:

```python
from abc import ABC


class Foo(ABC):
    BAR = 1

    def method(self):
        bar()
```

```console
$ ruff check --isolated --select B024 abc.py
All checks passed!
```

Is that expected?

It looks like it's due to https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/issues/293, but I think we can refine this check.
