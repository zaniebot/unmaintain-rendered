# Ruff doesn't raise syntax error for single starred assignment target

_Issue opened by @dhruvmanila on 2024-10-15 10:21_

We should be raising syntax error for the following code:

```py
*a = (1,)
```

Oh, I think this is caught by the compiler and not the parser as `python -m ast test.py` passes without any syntax errors. So, this is a part of #11934.
