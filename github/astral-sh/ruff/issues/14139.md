# Philosophy Doc for Ruff and Two Scale Categorization System

---

_Issue opened by @ParagEkbote on 2024-11-06 19:54_

 I believe Ruff supports several hundred rules and also has implemented rules from different linters/formatters like Pylint, Autoflake, Pycodestyle, Flake8, etc. As the project scope expands, it will be quite helpful to write a document outlining the design philosophy like the HF Transformers library to help beginners understand what rules Ruff supports, and which it does not support. Why HF Transformers? I see a correlation between the one of the goals of the project: Be as easy and fast to use as possible.

Additionally, there can be a two-scale categorization for the linting rules:

1)Rules from other linters that need to be ported or **not to be ported** to Ruff.
2)New Rules that need be written for ruff. 

This could help sort out the categorization issues in #13897 , #1774 and help the existing rules to be ported in an easier method.

I'm closing the issue due to low interest for my proposal. Feel free to reopen it in the future if required.
