# [rule proposal] prevent `all` on a len-1 iterable

_Issue opened by @dorschw on 2023-07-30 08:46_

```diff
- all([something])
+ something
```

```diff
- all({something})
+ something
```

```diff
- all((something,))
+ something
```

I'd suggest it to flake8-simplify for reusing the error code, but their repo seems inactive for a few months. 
If you have a suggestion for another Python-based linter, I can implement & contribute it there. 

P.S. same goes for `any`
