Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

In the [Vim & Neovim section](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/#vim-neovim), some links are unreadable because of their color in dark mode:
