# Allow custom exceptions to N806, N815, N816

---

_Issue opened by @janosh on 2025-03-07 12:21_

### Summary

in the physical sciences, certain variables have widely used notations that conflict with Python's snake case convention. e.g.

```py
# kT: initial temperature in metal units (K)
kT = 80 * Units.temperature  # noqa: N816
```

would be great if you could whitelist certain non-snake case variables in `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["ALL"]
ignore = [
    "ANN002",  # Checks that *args arguments have type annotations.
    "ANN003",  # Checks that **kwargs arguments have type annotations.
    # ...
]
pydocstyle.convention = "google"
isort.split-on-trailing-comma = false
mixed-case-variable-in-global-scope-whitelist = ["kT"]  # new config option proposal
```

Does the [`lint.pep8-naming.ignore-names`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_pep8-naming_ignore-names) (or related `extend-ignore-names`) option work for you?

Those are mentioned at the very bottom of the N806 docs, but I see they're missing from N815 and N816.
