```py
err = ValueError("msg")

try:
    raise Exception
except Exception as exc:
    if isinstance(exc, ValueError):
        raise err # expecting B904 here but ruff is happy
```

Bugbear has the same behavior very intentionally, though I'm not familiar with what's being described: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/pull/181#issuecomment-904314876
