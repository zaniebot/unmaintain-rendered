# Ruff fails to detect obvious AttributeErrors

---

_Issue opened by @edreamleo on 2024-04-08 09:09_

Consider the following file, say `test.py`:
```python
class Test:
    __slots__ = ('good',)

def main():
    t = Test()
    print(t.bad)  # Obvious AttributeError
        
main()
```
Running `python -m ruff check test.py` fails to detect any error, with or without the `__slots__` statement.

~~Pylint used to detect such errors, at least in some cases, but no longer does.~~
Correction: pylint issues a`no-member` warning as expected.

Are there any plans to add such checks to Ruff?

**Context**

```console
Python 3.12.0, PyQt version 6.6.3
Windows 11 AMD64 (build 10.0.22631) SP0
>ruff --version
ruff 0.3.5
```
**pyproject.toml**
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
```
**ruff.toml**
```toml
[lint]
ignore = [
    "E402", # Module level import not at top of file
    "E701", # Multiple statements on one line (colon)
    "E702", # Multiple statements on one line (semicolon)
    "E711", # Comparison to `None` should be `cond is None`
    "E731", # Do not assign a `lambda` expression, use a `def`
    "E741", # Ambiguous variable name: `l`. Bad style, but only occurs in minor plugins.

    "F401", # `xxx` imported but unused. Pyflakes checks this.
    "F841", # Local variable `xxx` is assigned to but never used. Pyflakes checks this.

Thanks for the detailed write up.  

Yes, we do have plans to add checks like this in the future when we work on adding more static analysis (type checking like) capabilities to Ruff. This should unlock a whole new set of rules that Ruff can support :)

Any news on this? Is it still the case that Ruff misses all these errors? I had an example today, I am just trying to understand if I was unlucky or this is still a systematic issue.

Yes, it looks like [ruff](https://play.ruff.rs/07024191-4aa2-46ea-b0b8-398bf8622972) does still miss these, but our upcoming type checker [ty](https://play.ty.dev/dba6bc54-434b-403f-9c08-65d22e937dbe) catches it!

It will still be a while before we can use ty's capabilities in Ruff, though.
