# FLY002: incorrect behavior of automatic fixer on strings

---

_Issue opened by @saippuakauppias on 2023-05-31 22:09_

Example:
```python
print(','.join(['first', 'second']))
```

Run ruff:
```
$ ruff test-FLY002.py --select FLY --fix
Found 1 error (1 fixed, 0 remaining).
```

Fixed result:
```
print(f'first,second')
```

Expected: if the list contains only strings (no variables), you do not need to do f-string
