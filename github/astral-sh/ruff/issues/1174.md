# Mark redefined variables as unused in simple same-branch cases

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-12-10 04:37_

Given this code:

```py
def f():
    x = 1
    x = 2
```

We should be able to mark `x = 1` as redefined-while-unused.

Because we don't do full branch analysis, I don't _think_ we can flag cases like:

```py
def f():
    x = 1
    if True:
      x = 2
```
