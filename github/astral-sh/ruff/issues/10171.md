# Remove the `ruff` to `ruff check` alias

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-02-29 14:00_

We deprecated the `ruff` to `ruff check`, `ruff --explain` to `ruff rule`, `ruff --generate-shell-completion` to `ruff generate-shell-completion` and the `ruff --clean` to `ruff clean` aliases in 0.3. Ruff 0.5 changed the commands to error.  We should remove the aliases in an upcoming minor release.

Note that the ruff-lsp used the `ruff` to `ruff check` alias https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp/pull/392

https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/12011 made using any of the above commands a hard error, but we keep printing an error. We should remove the commands entirely in a future release (0.6? or 0.7?)

So the current state is that these have a custom error, and the task here is to remove the custom errors?
