# Formatter: Allow two empty lines after `import`

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-08-22 09:17_

Black requires at least one empty line after an `import` statement but allows up to two empty lines. Ruff enforces one empty line

```python
import django.core.checks.urls  # NOQA isort:skip


__all__ = [
    "CheckMessage",
    "Debug",
    "Info",
    "Warning",
    "Error",
    "Critical",
    "DEBUG",
    "INFO",
    "WARNING",
    "ERROR",
    "CRITICAL",
    "register",
    "run_checks",
    "tag_exists",
    "Tags",
]
```

## Actual

```python
import django.core.checks.urls  # NOQA isort:skip

__all__ = [
    "CheckMessage",
    "Debug",
    "Info",
    "Warning",
    "Error",
    "Critical",
    "DEBUG",
    "INFO",
    "WARNING",
    "ERROR",
    "CRITICAL",
    "register",
    "run_checks",
    "tag_exists",
    "Tags",
]
```

## Expected

```python
import django.core.checks.urls  # NOQA isort:skip


__all__ = [
    "CheckMessage",
    "Debug",
    "Info",
    "Warning",
    "Error",
    "Critical",
    "DEBUG",
    "INFO",
    "WARNING",
    "ERROR",
    "CRITICAL",
    "register",
    "run_checks",
    "tag_exists",
    "Tags",
]
```

Or is this intentional @charliermarsh ?

No, I believe this is a bug.

The "allows at least two" should be the normal tolerance level though -- so if the import is in a nested block, it should be "at least one, allows one". If it's at the top level, it should be "at least one, allows two".
