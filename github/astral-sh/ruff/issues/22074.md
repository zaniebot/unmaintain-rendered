# Errors in `--output-format=github` (redundant `col`, `endColumn` is less than `col`)

---

_Issue opened by @Andrej730 on 2025-12-19 10:14_

### Summary

`output-format=github` output format has issues preventing it from being parsed by Github. 
Github is still able to show it in some places (e.g. on Summary), but it doesn't show the annotations in commits.

```sh
ruff check test.py --select RUF022 --output-format=github
# error logs from github action:
##[debug]Invalid error command value. 'col' and 'endColumn' cannot be set if 'line' and 'endLine' are different values.
##[debug]Invalid error command value. 'endColumn' cannot be less than 'col'.
```

Running code separately, outside CI, I get the following output. So it's indeed has `endColumn` being less than `col` and 
```sh
ruff check test.py --select RUF022 --output-format=github
# ::error title=Ruff (RUF022),file=/home/test.py,line=1,col=11,endLine=6,endColumn=2::test.py:1:11: RUF022 `__all__` is not sorted
```

Example `test.py`:
```python
# test.py
__all__ = [
    "GizmoColor",
    "GizmoAxis",
    "TextAlignment",
    "CoordinateSpace",
]
```
