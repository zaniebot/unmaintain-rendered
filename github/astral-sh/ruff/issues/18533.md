# UP008 fix safety documentation is questionable

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-06-07 13:19_

### Summary

The documentation of [`super-call-with-parameters` (UP008)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/super-call-with-parameters/#fix-safety) says:
> This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because removing the arguments from a call may delete comments that are attached to the arguments.

If that is the only reason, then the fix should be marked safe when there are no comments to delete. Otherwise, the other reasons should be documented.

### Version
