# Sonar RSPEC-1192 (String literals should not be duplicated)

---

_Issue opened by @mirecl on 2023-03-17 11:23_

Hi all!
Tell me pls - now there is a check for duplicate value?

_For example in Sonar: https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/tag/design/RSPEC-1192_

I don't think so -- we don't have a check like this, though we could add a Sonar category with this rule (and others) if someone were interested.

Voting up for adding Sonar category. Also, I'm curious if there is any plan to add a tag system in ruff in the near future, similar to what Sonar offers.
