# Ignore EM101 (Exception must not use a string literal) for specific exceptions (such as `aiohttp.web.HTTPRedirection`)

In aiohttp, we usually use exceptions to return non-OK status codes. A frequent line is 
```python
raise web.HTTPFound("/")
```
to redirect to `/`.

I hope you'll agree that assigning `"/"` to a variable beforehand wouldn't aid readability in any way. As such, it would be great to either
* ignore these exceptions by hard-coding them in ruff or
* allow users to specify exceptions to be ignored by EM101 in the config. Bonus points if we could just write `aiohttp.web.HTTPRedirection`, which is a superclass.

It seems reasonable to me to add a setting for this.
