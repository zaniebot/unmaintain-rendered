# [red-knot] Avoid running ecosystem checks when not necessary

Most recent example https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/16493#issuecomment-2700540847

The PR doesn't change any files outside of Red Knot. The ecosystem checks should not run.

I think an ecosystem check ran on that PR because this commit in the PR (which has now been force-pushed away) modified code in the `ruff_python_ast` crate: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/commit/dbae500cd2f737e76f10125c9c4f20ce79a10ebc. I don't see ecosystem checks on most red-knot PRs
