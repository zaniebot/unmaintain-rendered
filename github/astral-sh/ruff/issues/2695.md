# Feature request: isort.force-to-top

---

_Issue opened by @henryiii on 2023-02-09 20:59_

I couldn't see it listed elsewhere, so I'd like to point out `[tool.isort] force_to_top = ["setuptools"]`. It's useful for putting an import that must be imported before other imports (setuptools should be imported before distutils), or maybe for sticking pytest at the top.
