<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

UP012 (`unnecessary-encode-utf8`) fixes:

```python
(f"foo{bar}").encode("utf-8")
```

to:

```python
().encode("utf-8")
```

`"utf-8"` should be removed, but `f"foo{bar}"` is removed.
