# [red-knot] Compare expression inference - Tuple

_Issue opened by @cake-monotone on 2024-10-09 08:45_

Related to #13618

I’m creating this issue to avoid any overlap with other contributors. This task will include implementing lexicographic type comparison using `infer_binary_type_comparison`.
