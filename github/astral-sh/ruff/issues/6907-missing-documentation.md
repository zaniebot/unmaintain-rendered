# Missing Documentation

_Issue opened by @danparizher on 2023-08-26 23:22_

In VSC, I have code that flags rule `PLR6301`:

When I click on the hyperlink to go to the Ruff documentation for that rule, this is what I see:

The URL that it brings me to is: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/no-self-use

Thanks, I think the docs must’ve failed to update on deploy. I re-ran the job.
