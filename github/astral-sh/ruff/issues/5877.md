# Running without cache

---

_Issue opened by @larsrinn on 2023-07-19 09:39_

We'd like to run ruff in our CI pipeline in a Docker container. The process running the CI doesn't have permissions to create new files in the container, which is why the check fails with

```
error: Failed to initialize cache at /app/.ruff_cache: Permission denied (os error 13)
error: Failed to initialize cache at /app/.ruff_cache: Permission denied (os error 13)
error: Failed to create cache file '/app/.ruff_cache/content/14915633640191433684'
```


The command I'm trying is simply:

```
ruff check .
```

Version is 0.0.272

Is there a possibility to run `ruff` without a cache?

Hy. Nice that you're using ruff. 

You can use `ruff check . --no-cache` 

I hope that helps. If not, feel free to comment again and I'll reopen the issue.

 That was easy. I searched the documentation but didn't check the `--help` 🤦🏼‍♂️
