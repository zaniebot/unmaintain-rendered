# `SourceCodeLocator` doesn't handle multi-byte characters

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-10-14 17:39_

If you have a file like:

```py
class nonascii:
    'Це не латиниця'
    pass
```

Running `cargo run --select D203` throws:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'byte index 36 is not a char boundary; it is inside 'т' (bytes 35..37) of `class nonascii:
    'Це не латиниця'
    pass
`', library/core/src/str/mod.rs:127:5
```
