# `ruff server`: Implement snapshot tests for Jupyter Notebook document updates

---

_Issue opened by @snowsignal on 2024-06-18 03:52_

Similar to the [snapshot tests that already exist](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/blob/main/crates/ruff_server/tests/document.rs) for text document updates, we need snapshot tests that verify that notebook update requests are executed correctly.
