# Formatter: `blank_line_after_nested_stub_class` preview style

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-11-29 01:27_

Implement Black's [`blank_line_after_nested_stub_class`](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3564) as a preview style. This new style only applies to stub files (`.pyi`)

```python
class Outer:
    class InnerStub: ...
    outer_attr_after_inner_stub: int
    class Inner:
        inner_attr: int
    outer_attr: int

# output
class Outer:
    class InnerStub: ...
    outer_attr_after_inner_stub: int

    class Inner:
        inner_attr: int

    outer_attr: int
```

See added new lines after the nested classes (that don't have a dummy body)
