# [website] Search preview snippets should always show "What it does" instead of "Where it derives from"

_Issue opened by @corneliusroemer on 2025-07-15 19:32_

I came across non-ideal behavior of the search modal while looking for a Ruff lint rule that would flag Exceptions without any message text.

I noticed that the search preview snippets weren't as useful as they could be. All the snippets mention where the rule comes from. But I don't care about that. I want to know "What it does". That information _is_ available, it's just not shown above the fold by default.

Feature request: make "What it does" be the number one thing in preview snippets.

See the default snippets (without having clicked anything):

The actually relevant summary only shows when I click on "2 more on this page":
