Does poetry accept `^3.11`? Looking at the [allowed specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#id5), `^` isn't a valid operator according to the spec. I think you want `~=3.11`

Interesting, I've been using Poetry that way for years, it allows it but obviously it shouldn't!  I've adjusted and all is working, thanks for pointing that out!
