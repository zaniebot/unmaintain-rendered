# Renable black compatibility test

---

_Issue opened by @Thomasdezeeuw on 2023-06-20 15:12_

This was disabled in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5120 as it wasn't really running for a while. The test itself will likely need to be moved the `ruff` crate as that is where the resource live now.

We ended up removing this so marking it as a non-goal to re-enable.
