# RUF100 only removes noqa string when using names

_Issue opened by @JannKleen on 2023-05-26 08:21_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

When having the following code:
```python
def test():  # noqa: too-many-branches
  pass
```

RUF100 would only remove the noqa, leaving this:
```python
def test():  # : too-many-branches
  pass
```

Edit:
The removal of the 'numeric' codes (i.e. `# noqa: PLR0912`)  works as expected.

- `noqa`'s with rule names are not supported (c.f. #1773)

We don't support this right now, but we likely will in the future.
