# new rule - replace if all([value_1, value_2]) with if value_1 and value 2

_Issue opened by @spaceby on 2024-10-17 09:04_

In a project I'm working on, I saw this code
```python
value_1 = value_2 = value_3 = True

if all([value_1, value_2, value_3]):
    pass
```

t can be rewritten like this
```python
value_1 = value_2 = value_3 = True

if value_1 and value_2 and value_3:
    pass
```
This makes the code simpler and faster.
The same logic can be applied to any, tuple

I like this idea! One minor concern is that using `and` or `or` may lead to a behavior change:

```python
if all([f(), side_effect()]):
    ...

if f() and side_effect():
    ...
```

A fix for this rule should be marked as unsafe.
