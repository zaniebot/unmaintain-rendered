# Extend `no-return-argument-annotation-in-stub` (`PYI050`) to all name annotations and non-stub files

_Issue opened by @tjkuson on 2023-10-01 18:01_

The given reason for preferring `typing.Never` to `typing.NoReturn` for argument type annotations is that the name is more explicit about the annotation's intent. 

Currently, this rule is limited to function arguments in stub files. Following the reasoning of the rule, it should probably also apply to other variable annotations and in non-stub files.
