<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
First of all, I'd like to thank you for a great and easy-to-use linter 🥳 

I've been running into issues lately where logging calls would fail, because I unpack some `dict` in the `extra` parameter to logging methods (or directly put a variable there), and that dict has a `name` key, for example.

Ruff doesn't catch these issues, and I thought a good rule (or extension to one of the existing `flake8-logging-format` rules) could catch these issues and warn about them.
Knowing exactly when a bad argument will appear can be difficult, like in calls to `pydantic` classes' `dict` method, but I think warning on all places that pass an object directly to the `extra` parameter or unpack a `dict` inside it is still a good idea.

What do you think? I would also be willing to work on a PR for this, though my rust skills aren't as sharp as I'd like them to be for this 😅

Thank you :) Do you mind including an example snippet that demonstrates the problem? (Is it that the unpacked dictionary keys are also themselves valid arguments to `logging` calls?)

Sorry, should have included examples in the original message. Yes, the problem is as you stated it.

The following is correctly flagged by ruff G101:
```
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.info("", extra={"name": "fails"})
```

While the following aren't caught:
```
logger.info("", extra={**{"name": "fails"}})
extra = {"name": "fails"}
logger.info("", extra={**extra})
logger.info("", extra=extra)

from pydantic import BaseModel

class PydanticFail(BaseModel):
    name: str = "fails"

logger.info("", extra=PydanticFail().dict())
logger.info("", extra={**PydanticFail().dict()})
```

+1 Just hit the same issue but passing a TypedDict to `extra`.
