# SIM905 fix breaks `"".split(maxsplit=0)` and similar expressions

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-05-13 14:41_

### Summary

The fix for [`split-static-string` (SIM905)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/split-static-string/) changes the behavior of `str.split` with `sep=None` (the default) and `maxsplit=0` if the string is empty or begins with white space. The output of `split` should not contain an empty string or a string beginning with white space. Similarly, the fix breaks `str.rsplit` if the string is empty or ends with white space.

```console
$ cat >sim905.py <<'# EOF'
print("".split(maxsplit=0))
print(" ".split(maxsplit=0))
print(" x ".split(maxsplit=0))
print("".rsplit(maxsplit=0))
print(" ".rsplit(maxsplit=0))
print(" x ".rsplit(maxsplit=0))
# EOF

$ python sim905.py
