# Autofix for `undocumented-public-function`: insert docstring stub

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

The `undocumented-public-function` rule currently has no autofix. 
Writing documentation for functions can be made more effective by providing the documentation template automatically.
PyCharm allows to insert a "documentation string stub":

```python
def func1(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> int:
    raise ValueError("Value not valid")
```

Proposed by PyCharm (depends on the docstring style configuration):

```python
def func1(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> int:
    """

    Args:
        arg1: 
        arg2: 

    Returns:
        object: 
    """
    raise ValueError("Value not valid")
```

Would you accept a similar (unsafe) fix in `ruff`?

Ideally, the rule considers arguments, return values and exceptions.


```python
def func1(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> int:
    """...

    Args:
        arg1: ...
        arg2: ...

    Returns:
        ... 

    Raises:
        ValueError: ...
    """
    raise ValueError("Value not valid")
```

This could make sense, but only with `Applicabilty::DisplayOnly` so that the fix needs to be applied manually because this is more an editor refactor than a "proper fix". 

I'm not sure how the CLI or LSP handle display only fixes

For completeness:

Applying the fix will break down `undocumented-public-function` (`D103`) into multiple violations:

- `empty-docstring-section` (`D414`): Section has no content ("Returns")
- `undocumented-param` (`D417`): Missing argument descriptions in the docstring for `func1`
- and various others related to the function summary/description D415, D212, D205
