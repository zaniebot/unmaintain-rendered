Formatter issues:


* Switch over to tool-specific configuration sections: Recommend the tool-specific configuration and deprecate the global configuration options (but don’t remove them yet). 

Controversial (I don't think we should do it): 

* Switch to preview styles

Maybe: Deprecate the `ruff` alias to `ruff check`.

Ok, I have PRs up for removing all the `is_preview()`-style checks within rules (where appropriate -- I left a few for now).
