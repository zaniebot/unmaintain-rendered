# Allow default configuration for integrators

---

_Issue opened by @ofek on 2023-11-17 04:48_

I am integrating with Ruff and wish to provide out-of-the-box configuration that users can override if they wish. Essentially, a flag to set the [extend](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#extend) option like `--config-extend` would be perfect.

My use case is a new `fmt` command for [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) but I imagine others would wish to integrate in a similar way, like Visual Studio Code.

Would this be easy to implement?

I'm not sure about the implementation complexity and I see your use case. A related issue is that larger projects want to share some configuration across projects that may be stored in different git repositories. I started looking into this in March but have since then be busy implementing the formatter. The main idea is that you can specify a named configuration (git URL / python package name / or something else) in extend. I believe that could solve your use case too:
* No user configuration: Pass the default configuration
* A user configuration exists: The user should extend your base configuration

@ofek
Does https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/9599 solve your issue?
