# Adding a linter for Django templates

---

_Issue opened by @ulgens on 2025-12-20 10:57_

### Summary

I was reviewing https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/pull/2382 and wondered if djade can be used with ruff. Turned out none of the popular Django template linters (djade, djlinter) have their ruless in ruff yet.

Would be nice to have them in ruff.
