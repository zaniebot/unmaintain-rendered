#  B019 discuss

_Issue opened by @me-v2 on 2024-08-16 06:39_

`  @lru_cache(maxsize=128)
    # def get vcab size
    def vocab_size(self):
        return self.tokenizer.vocab_size`

 B019 Use of `functools.lru_cache` or `functools.cache` on methods can lead to memory leaks

Thanks for opening the issue

Could you help me understand why `B019` use of `lru_cache` or `functions.cache` can lead to memory issues and in what situations this happens?

Can you expand on what you want to discuss about `B019`? It's not clear to me what this issue is asking for.
