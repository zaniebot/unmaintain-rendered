# Require rules with fixes to include help message

---

_Issue opened by @chriskrycho on 2024-07-31 18:12_

While working on #12595, we noticed that some fixes do not have a corresponding help message. This means that when displaying those to the user, the fix can be displayed with no explanation or context.

An alternative design here might be to fall back to “Suggested fix” or something like that as a stopgap when there is no help message available.
