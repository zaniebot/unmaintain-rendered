Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
Hi, I don't know if this is an intended behaviour or not, but I'm having troubles understanding why a snippet like the following is highlighted as [B007](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-loop-control-variable/)
```py
for _ in range(10)
    print("hello")
```
From the doc, any variable prefixed with `_` should be safe. Is there anything I'm doing wrong?
I know the example is (way too) trivial, but a more realistic use-case would be cycling through rows in a Pandas DataFrame with `iterrows()` but without using the index.
Thanks for the help!

Do you have some context where it gets flagged?

When testing here https://play.ruff.rs/56729c12-30db-43e0-955c-2e82ac2c4ece, it shows no violation.

I get this problem only when using Ruff under pre-commit, which is configured to use my local ruff version (0.6.4)
Here's a screenshot:

Mystery solved! Apparently, there was a typo in my team's config `dummy-variable-rgx` inside pyproject.toml 😅
Sorry about the false positive and thank you for the help.
