# F401 false positive for .pyi files

---

_Issue opened by @JonathanPlasse on 2023-02-18 16:38_

```python
import queue

class Serial:
    queue: queue.Queue[bytes | None] | None
```

`ruff` detect an `F401` error while `flake8` does not.
It works for `.py` files but not for `.pyi`.

- I did not add a playground link as I could not reproduce the error with it (c.f. #3013).
