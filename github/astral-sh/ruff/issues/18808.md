# [`Pyflakes`] `F632` does not support simple arithmetic

---

_Issue opened by @MeGaGiGaGon on 2025-06-20 01:05_

### Summary

CPython gives a `SyntaxWarning` on code [is-literal (F632)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/is-literal/#is-literal-f632) doesn't when using simple arithmetic. Based on my limited testing this happens when an expression gets turned into a `LOAD_CONST` under `dis`. [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/f7e83252-b12b-411b-91f4-7c75bc5a270b). I'm not sure how much of this could be reasonably supported though. One simple case that would be nice to support is negative numbers [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/f81ca38d-8fce-42a2-b3a7-f8d139cada8d), since there are 6k results for a [github search](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Apython+%22is+-1%3A%22&type=code) on `is -1:`, and it probably wouldn't add too much complexity. 
```pycon
>>> x = 1
>>> x is 1 + 1
<python-input-2>:1: SyntaxWarning: "is" with 'int' literal. Did you mean "=="?
  x is 1 + 1
False
>>> import dis
>>> dis.dis("x is 1 + 1")
<dis>:1: SyntaxWarning: "is" with 'int' literal. Did you mean "=="?
  0           RESUME                   0

  1           LOAD_NAME                0 (x)
              LOAD_CONST               0 (2)
              IS_OP                    0
              RETURN_VALUE

```

We could use ruff's limited local type inference feature here. Although this is a rule extension and needs to be gated behind preview
