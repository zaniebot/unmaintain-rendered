# Implement isort option lines_between_types

---

_Issue opened by @PushUpek on 2023-02-05 18:01_

The isort configuration is missing the [lines_between_types](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#lines-between-types) option.

I'm not all that fond of setting it, but it's used in pypa/build, along with other projects from Felipe (meson-python, pyproject-metadata, etc).
