# [red-knot]: Unify `operator-unsupported` and `unsupported-operator` diagnostic codes

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2024-10-28 08:19_

We should either unify the two diagnostic codes into a single diagnostic code or use more specific names to make it clear why they're separate.

I think this was just an accident and they should unified. Should be an easy PR.
