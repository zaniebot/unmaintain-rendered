# Bug?: `--show-fixes` doesn't work with `--fix-only`

---

_Issue opened by @MaksimZayats on 2023-03-09 09:44_

Hi! When I tried to use `--show-fixes` with `--fix-only` it doesn't work.

```bash
> ruff demo.py --fix-only --show-fixes
Fixed 1 error.
```

```bash
> ruff demo.py --fix --show-fixes

Fixed 1 error:
- demo.py:
    1 × I001 (unsorted-imports)
```

```bash
> ruff --version
ruff 0.0.254
```

I'm not sure if this is a bug or feature :)
