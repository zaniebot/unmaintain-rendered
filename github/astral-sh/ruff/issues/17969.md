# Inconsistent formatting of match-case on `[]` and `_`

---

_Issue opened by @adamchainz on 2025-05-08 21:37_

### Summary

[Playground link](https://play.ruff.rs/5a7bdd18-182f-4d70-b855-2fdd149ddae7)

Source:

```py
a = []
b = []
match a, b:
    case [], []:
        ...
    case [], _:
        ...
    case _, []:
        ...
    case _, _:
        ...
```

Formatted:

```py
a = []
b = []
match a, b:
    case [[], []]:
        ...
    case [[], _]:
        ...
    case _, []:
        ...
    case _, _:
        ...
```

It seems rather inconsistent that the formatter adds wrapping `[]` on the first two cases but not the others.

Edit: for reference, Black leaves the original file unchanged.
