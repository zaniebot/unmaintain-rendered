# False positive for `ARG001`; unused function argument

---

_Issue opened by @dycw on 2023-02-07 08:42_

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.

```python
from typing import Any, cast


def _identity(x: None) -> None:
    return x


def f(x: None) -> None:
    """Raises ARG001 Unused function argument: `x`."""
    _ = cast(Any, _identity)(x=x)


def g(x: None) -> None:
    """Does not raise anything."""
    _ = cast(Any, _identity)(x)
```

* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.

```
> ruff --isolated --select ARG001 foo.py
foo.py:8:7: ARG001 Unused function argument: `x`
```


* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

```
ruff --version
ruff 0.0.242
```
