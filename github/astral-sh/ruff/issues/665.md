# Plans on creating a full LSP

---

_Issue opened by @jhossbach on 2022-11-09 22:24_

Hey,
I was thinking about adding a plugin for linting the code using ruff for the python language server (https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) but it seems like there already exists a language server using ruff, namely ruffd by @Seamooo.
I am wondering whether the plan for the ruffd language server is to become a full-blown LSP server according to the [Microsoft specification](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/) or if the goal is to be integrated into existing LSP's?

My current thinking is that `ruffd` will evolve into a full-blown LSP server (it already _is_ an LSP server following that spec, IIRC, though maybe it needs some more features).

The [vscode-ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/vscode-ruff) plugin also implements Ruff into an LSP, though that's based on [pygls](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls) as per the VS Code Python extension template, and there are plans to migrate that plugin to `ruffd`.

Does that make sense?

Sounds great, I will ask the python-language-server maintainers in the meantime if they are interested in a plugin for linting purely.

Will gladly ditch pyright for ruffd once it's mature
