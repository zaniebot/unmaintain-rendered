# Feature: Exporting report to a file

---

_Issue opened by @victorcrrd on 2023-06-08 16:52_

I'm wondering if it's possible to export the generated report to a file given as an option to the command? Something like `ruff check --format json --output report.json .` I have seen nothing like that reading the docs.
If not, is it already an idea to implement in the future? Would you accept contributions to add that feature?
