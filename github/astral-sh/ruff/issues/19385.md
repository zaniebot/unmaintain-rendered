# PYI013 fix deletes comments

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-07-16 12:47_

### Summary

The fix for [`ellipsis-in-non-empty-class-body` (PYI013)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/ellipsis-in-non-empty-class-body/) can remove comments, which is unnecessary and unsafe. [Example](https://play.ruff.rs/0090ad57-c618-4b58-862a-38e0788b7e1c):
```console
$ cat >pyi013.py <<'# EOF'
class C:
    x = 1
    ...  # comment
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check pyi013.py --select PYI013 --diff
--- pyi013.py
+++ pyi013.py
@@ -1,3 +1,2 @@
 class C:
     x = 1
-    ...  # comment

Would fix 1 error.
```

Compare [`unnecessary-placeholder` (PIE790)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-placeholder/), which safely doesn’t delete the comment.
```console
$ ruff --isolated check pyi013.py --select PIE790 --diff
--- pyi013.py
+++ pyi013.py
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
 class C:
     x = 1
-    ...  # comment
+    # comment

Would fix 1 error.
```
