# RUF009 - allow defining other field function

---

_Issue opened by @CarliJoy on 2025-04-16 11:24_

### Summary

I am using [typed-settings](https://typed-settings.readthedocs.io) a framework allowing to load settings easier.

It  provides an extended alias to `attrs.field` [`typed_settings.option`](https://typed-settings.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apiref.html#typed_settings.option).

Using [`extend-immutable-calls`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_flake8-bugbear_extend-immutable-calls) I can whitelist the complete function but this would prevent finding mutables when defined as `ts.option(default=[])`

Could one extend the syntax for `extend-immutable-calls` i.e. that I can define `typed_settings.option(default=*)` and ruff checks the values of `default` to be immutable?

From looking into this a bit, it sounds like two options might be required:
- a setting to extend the known `field` functions
- a setting to extend the known dataclass kinds

The second one is based on my quick skim of the `typed-settings` docs, which showed that they have aliases for `attrs` class decorators too.

On the other hand, maybe type inference could resolve the aliases and the rest of the current implementation could work as normal.
