Thanks for the report! I think you may need to set your [logger-objects](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_logger-objects) to something like:

```toml
lint.logger-objects = ["loguru.logger"]
```

With that setting, the diagnostic is emitted as expected in the [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/19ad5d0c-1d66-4185-b56f-6e50ef8891b0).
