# ANN autofix for builtin constrcutors

---

_Issue opened by @twoertwein on 2023-12-26 18:00_

Could infer the return type for int()/str()/bytes()
```py
def test(x): # unsafe ANN fixes do currently not add -> int
    return int(x)
```

A slippery slope of ruff slowly becoming a type checker :)
