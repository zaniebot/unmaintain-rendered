# Implement `flake8-no-implicit-concat`

---

_Issue opened by @ngnpope on 2023-01-30 20:33_

[GitHub](https://github.com/10sr/flake8-no-implicit-concat), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-no-implicit-concat/).

- [x] [`NIC001`](https://github.com/10sr/flake8-no-implicit-concat#violation-codes): Implicitly concatenated str literals on one line
  - Already implemented via `ISC001` from [`flake8-implicit-str-concat`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#flake8-implicit-str-concat-isc).
- [x] [`NIC002`](https://github.com/10sr/flake8-no-implicit-concat#violation-codes): Implicitly concatenated str literals over multiple lines
  - Already implemented via `ISC002` from [`flake8-implicit-str-concat`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#flake8-implicit-str-concat-isc) when using the configuration option provided by `ruff` (`allow-multiline = false`)
- [x] [`NIC101`](https://github.com/10sr/flake8-no-implicit-concat#violation-codes): Implicitly concatenated bytes literals on one line
  - Already implemented via `ISC001` from [`flake8-implicit-str-concat`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#flake8-implicit-str-concat-isc).
- [x] [`NIC102`](https://github.com/10sr/flake8-no-implicit-concat#violation-codes): Implicitly concatenated bytes literals over multiple lines

This is somewhat the inverse of [`flake8-implicit-str-concat`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#flake8-implicit-str-concat-isc). Despite this, they agree that implicit concatenation on a single line shouldn't happen. One also has a separate rule for `bytes` vs `str` where the other uses combined rules.

I think we actually _do_ support `NIC002` via [this setting](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#flake8-implicit-str-concat), which defaults to `true` for compatibility with `flake8-implicit-str-concat`.

Ah, I think it's not quite the same... Lemme check.

Nope. You're right 😄 I missed that the code was different...

We probably want a documentation bit to state that setting `allow-multiline = false` for `ISC002` requires disabling `ISC003` to prevent them conflicting. (Or we could disable `ISC003`?)

```python
implicit_single_line = "abc" "xyz"

explicit_single_line = "abc" + "xyz"


implicit_multiple_line_continuation = "abc" \
    "xyz"

explicit_multiple_line_continuation_after = "abc" \
    + "xyz"

explicit_multiple_line_continuation_before = "abc" + \
    "xyz"


implicit_multiple_line_parentheses = (
    "abc"
    "xyz"
)

explicit_multiple_line_parentheses_after = (
    "abc" +
    "xyz"
)

explicit_multiple_line_parentheses_before = (
    "abc"
    + "xyz"
)
```

For which I got the following outputs:

```

Well, other than the potential disabling of `ISC003` if `allow-multiline = false`, we can chalk this up as another supported plugin.

Another aside: At some point it'll be good to have visibility of what rules are disabled by various configuration options.
