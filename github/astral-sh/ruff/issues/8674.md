# implement pylint W0133 pointless-exception-statement

---

_Issue opened by @Yasu-umi on 2023-11-14 10:44_

[pylint W0133 warning](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/warning/pointless-exception-statement.html) is very useful feature that can help prevent human error.
```python
Exception  # bad
raise Exception  # good
raise Exception('some reason')  # good
```
If there doesn't seem to be any reason should not to implement it, I'm thinking of creating a pull request. What do you think?

I believe this is already covered by `useless-expression` (`B018`) -- can you give that a try? Here's an example: https://play.ruff.rs/624389a6-9342-4ff0-94e8-7cceb14c10c4
