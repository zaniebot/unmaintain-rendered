# Formatter: `Match` (includes `MatchCase` and `Patterns`)

---

_Issue opened by @konstin on 2023-07-17 14:14_

This is a bigger project that includes the following nodes:

- [x] #6298
- [x] #6299
- [x] #6641
- [x] #6642
- [x] #6644
- [x] #6643
- [x] #6645
- [x] #6557
- [x] #6558
- [x] #6555
- [x] #6753
- [x] #6933

The match arms have the same considerations for comments as if branches or try-except branches.

As a note. The idea isn't that this is all implemented in a single PR. I recommend to start implementing `StmtMatch` and stubbing out the match cases (if they aren't already). We can then add support for the match statements one by one

Regarding the match patterns, I would say that `PatternMatchValue`, `PatternMatchSingleton`, `PatternMatchStar`, `PatternMatchSequence` (sequence of other patterns), and `PatternMatchOr` (similar to `PatternMatchSequence`) are good first issues and could be taken on in the order mentioned.

Awesome. Let's start with one to leave an opportunity for other contributors too. Can you pick one and comment on the issue so that I can assign it to you?

I don't think this is ready yet. We first need to land https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/6594 (@evanrittenhouse  you can work on top of that PR, as long as you don't mind that there's one failing test).

Is #6933 still required for the Alpha release? Looks like it’s marked as Beta.

---

_Comment by @charliermarsh on 2023-09-01 15:06_

My impression is that #6933 shouldn't be blocking for alpha.
