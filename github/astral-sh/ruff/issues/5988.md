# Add native type literals to `UP018`

---

_Issue opened by @dosisod on 2023-07-22 21:08_

See https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1348#issuecomment-1646520368.

`UP018`/`C408` detects some, but not all of the same errors as Refurb:

```python
# detected by Ruff and Refurb
l = list()
d = dict()
t = tuple()

# only detected by Refurb
i = int()
f = float()
c = complex()
b = bool()

# missleading error message in Ruff, see below
by = bytes()
s = str()
```

Running in Ruff:

```
$ ruff x.py
x.py:1:1: E741 Ambiguous variable name: `l`
x.py:1:5: C408 [*] Unnecessary `list` call (rewrite as a literal)
x.py:2:5: C408 [*] Unnecessary `dict` call (rewrite as a literal)
x.py:3:5: C408 [*] Unnecessary `tuple` call (rewrite as a literal)
x.py:10:6: UP018 [*] Unnecessary call to `bytes`
x.py:11:5: UP018 [*] Unnecessary call to `str`
```

Running in Refurb:

```
$ refurb x.py
x.py:1:5 [FURB112]: Replace `list()` with `[]`
x.py:2:5 [FURB112]: Replace `dict()` with `{}`
x.py:3:5 [FURB112]: Replace `tuple()` with `()`
x.py:5:5 [FURB112]: Replace `int()` with `0`
x.py:6:5 [FURB112]: Replace `float()` with `0.0`
x.py:7:5 [FURB112]: Replace `complex()` with `0j`
x.py:8:5 [FURB112]: Replace `bool()` with `False`
x.py:10:6 [FURB112]: Replace `bytes()` with `b""`
x.py:11:5 [FURB112]: Replace `str()` with `""`
```

The "Unnecessary call to `bytes`/`str`" message is also misleading because there are no arguments to `str()`/`bytes()`.

Very few projects according to [grep.app](https://grep.app/search?q=%5B%5Ea-zA-Z_.0-9%5D%28int%7Cfloat%7Cstr%7Cbytes%7Cbool%7Ccomplex%29%5C%28%5C%29&regexp=true&case=true&filter[lang][0]=Python) are using the `int()`, `str()`, etc. form, but still worth adding IMO.

Complex seems a bit difficult (no pun intended) as it can accept 0, 1 or 2 arguments and it can accept them as keyword arguments as well:

```python
complex()
# 0j

complex(1)
# (1+0j)

complex(1, 2)
# (1+2j)

complex(real=1, imag=2)
# (1+2j)

complex(1, imag=2)
# (1+2j)
```
