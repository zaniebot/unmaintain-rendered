# option to select the ruff version on the playground

---

_Issue opened by @DetachHead on 2023-10-03 09:04_

currently the version is displayed here but there's no option to change it (also it's currently outdated since the latest version is 0.0.292)

it would be nice if there was an option to pick the version, like in the [mypy](https://mypy-play.net) and [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) playgrounds

We're interested but this is relatively low priority for us. We normally update it automatically on release at https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/actions/workflows/playground.yaml looks like something is broken.
