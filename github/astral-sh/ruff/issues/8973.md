_Issue opened by @Ryang20718 on 2023-12-02 21:53_


In my ruff.toml, i have, but I get an error for C3001 and C3002 not implemented?
https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970

It looks like `C3001` is implemented as `E731`, and `C3002` is implemented as `PLC3002`. You may need to remove `C3001`, since it's already covered by your `E` select.
