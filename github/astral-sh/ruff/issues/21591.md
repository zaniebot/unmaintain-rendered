# Add `list-sort-copy` rule (like `list-reverse-copy`)

---

_Issue opened by @injust on 2025-11-23 11:28_

### Summary

Like https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/list-reverse-copy/, but for sorting.

https://play.ruff.rs/001368a5-f14d-44fd-a216-8a03e0555f28

```python
l = [1, 2, 3]
l = sorted(l)
# above line should be rewritten to:
l.sort()
```
