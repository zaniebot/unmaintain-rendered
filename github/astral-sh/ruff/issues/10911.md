# `PLR6104` has false positive for non-commutative additions

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2024-04-12 15:00_

@charliermarsh Is this fixed for:
```python
test_string = "desired = " + test_string  # False positive PLR6104
```
since `+` is sometimes commutative.

I'm not sure from the code, but you still catch:
```python
x = x + "string"  # should be x += "string"
```
right?

This is fixed on `main` IIUC.
