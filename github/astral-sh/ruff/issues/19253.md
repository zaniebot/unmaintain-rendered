# Rule: Encourage parentheses when unpacking is used with binary expression

---

_Issue opened by @NeilGirdhar on 2025-07-10 09:49_

### Summary

Consider:
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5]
c = [*a + b]  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
I find it unintuitive that `*` binds less aggressively than all binary operators.  Looking at [the grammar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html), we have
```
star_expression:
    | '*' bitwise_or 
    | expression
```
If `bitwise_or` doesn't degrade to at least `await_primary`, consider suggesting to the user to parenthesize the expression.
