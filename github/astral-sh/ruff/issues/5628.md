# `pandas-use-of-dot-read-table` is outdated

---

_Issue opened by @tjkuson on 2023-07-09 13:51_

`.read_table()` and `.read_csv()` are identical, except the first expects tab separation and the second expects comma separation. I am unclear why it is bad practice to use `.read_table()` to read tab separated values, for example

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_table("data.tsv")
```

The current implementation of the rule would instead recommend

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.tsv", sep="\t")
```

I tried to find the reasoning for the rule following the original [pandas-vet](https://github.com/deppen8/pandas-vet) plugin, which references three sources for its rules (and, by implication, its preference for `.read_csv()` or `.read_table()`). The first is [an article](https://medium.com/dunder-data/minimally-sufficient-pandas-a8e67f2a2428) that suggests that `.read_table()` is deprecated in favour of `.read_csv()`, but that is [no longer true](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/27102) following [a discussion](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25220). The second is [a website](https://deppen8.github.io/pandas-bw/reading-data/index.html) that cites the previous article in saying that the method is deprecated. The third is the Pandas documentation, but I couldn't find any recommendation against [`.read_table()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_table.html). After this research, I think the rule originates from an outdated understanding of Pandas and should be changed.

Instead, I think the rule should be changed to be more useful in light of modern Pandas conventions (e.g., only recommending `.read_csv()` over `.read_table()` if the separator is set to commas).

I think this makes sense, to only recommend `read_csv` over `read_table` if the separator is set as such.
