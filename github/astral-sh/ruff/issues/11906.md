# I001 Isort doesn't fix multiline imports

---

_Issue opened by @spaceby on 2024-06-17 15:03_

Isort does not translate multiline improt into one line
`ruff check . --fix --unsafe-fixes --preview`
``` python
from datetime import (
    date,
)
```


However, isort works for such multiline imports
``` python
from datetime import (
    date
)
```
``` python
from datetime import date
```

Can you try removing the `,` after `date,`. Ruff, by default respects trailing commas, similar to the formatter/Black. You can disable this behavior with the [isort.split-on-trailing-comma](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_split-on-trailing-comma) option.

Is it possible to remove empty lines between the beginning of the page and the import?

```python
# This comment is here only so that these empty lines are visible



from datetime import date


date(date(2024, 1, 1))
```

E303 is the closest to what you're looking for or you can use `ruff format`.
