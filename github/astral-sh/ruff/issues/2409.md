# new rule: unnecessary brackets in class definition

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-31 19:20_

```
class Foo():
    pass
```
should be written as:
```
class Foo:
    pass
```

A new rule could cover this.

Not to weigh in one way or another, but just a note that black will rewrite the first example as the second.
