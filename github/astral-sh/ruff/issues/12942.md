<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.
  e.g. "RUF001", "unused variable", "Jupyter notebook"
* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

On ruff version 0.6.1, this file:

```python
import typing
import overrides

class Base:
    "Sample class"

    def do_thing(self) -> None:
        "Do a thing."
        pass


class First(Base):
    "Success with typing.override"

    @typing.override
    def do_thing(self) -> None:
        pass


class FailueA(Base):
    "Failure with overrides.override"

    @overrides.override
    def do_thing(self) -> None:
        pass


class FailureB(Base):
    "Success with overrides.overrides"

    @overrides.overrides
    def do_thing(self) -> None:
        pass
```

gets flagged twice with `D102`:

```
$ ruff check sample.py --extend-select D102
sample.py:24:9: D102 Missing docstring in public method
   |
23 |     @overrides.override
24 |     def do_thing(self) -> None:
   |         ^^^^^^^^ D102
25 |         pass
   |

sample.py:32:9: D102 Missing docstring in public method
   |
31 |     @overrides.overrides
32 |     def do_thing(self) -> None:
   |         ^^^^^^^^ D102
33 |         pass
   |

Found 2 errors.
```

and I don't see a way [in the docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/undocumented-public-method/) to extend D102 to treat these decorators from `overrides` like `typing.override`

Is that library still relevant with the advent of `typing.override`? (I'm not familiar with it, just confirming before we do anything about it.)

Valid question! The `overrides` library offers certain runtime capabilities that can't be done with static typing. For example, it has a metaclass that enforces the use of `override` decorators on child classes, even from other packages. The two use cases:

1. If you use a library that uses the enforcement metaclass, you'd have to do a double decorator (typing.override and overrides.override) in order to please both ruff and `overrides`
2. If you're providing a library that provides base classes, you may want to use this to ensure that people aren't accidentally overriding your methods on new versions, even if they don't use linters like ruff.

Actually, this works:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
ignore-decorators = [  # Functions with these decorators don't have to have docstrings.
    "typing.overload",  # Default configuration
    # The next four are all variations on override, so child classes don't have to repeat parent classes' docstrings.
    "overrides.override",
    "overrides.overrides",
    "typing.override",
    "typing_extensions.override",
]
```

so the issue is probably then just that the docs should mention that configuration option :-)
