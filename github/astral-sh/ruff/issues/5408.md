# Add remove noqa

---

_Issue opened by @gaborbernat on 2023-06-27 23:53_

This would be the reverse of add-noqa, so as such would be exclusive flag with ``--add-noqa``. This is something one would want to use when they decide to no longer ignore those failures and instead fix them.

We have `--ignore-noqa`, would that have the same effect in practice?

No I'd actually like ruff to delete the noqa entry, the same way add-noqa writes to the file. Sometimes I might add a typo with add-noqa, and this would allow me to reverse that command easily.

How would that differ from a workflow of:

- Run `--ignore-noqa`.
- Fix violations.
- Run with `ruff --extend-select RUF100 --fix` (to automatically remove unused `noqa` comments, now that the comments are unused).

Hmm, that works just feels less intuitive.
