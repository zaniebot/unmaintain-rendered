DJ008 Model does not define `__str__` method
```

Example:

import typing_extensions
from django.db import models as django_models

class ParentModel(django_models.Model):
    class Meta:
        abstract = True

    @typing_extensions.override
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f'{self.id}'

class ChildModel(ParentModel):  # <-- DJ008 Model does not define `__str__` method
    pass
```

Current ruff version: 0.1.9
Configuration: `--strict` with some small exclusions

No worry @charliermarsh , not a critical issue, just small omission! We have added `type: ignore` by now, when the issue is fixed, it will be reported as unused ignore 🎉
