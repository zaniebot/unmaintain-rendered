# Rule: Flake8-bugbear B038 " detect changes to iterable object of loop"

---

_Issue opened by @mimre25 on 2024-01-14 05:40_

I've added a new rule to flake8-bugbear.

In brief, the rule detects bugs like the following:
```py
some_list = [1,2,3]
for i in some_list:
  if i % 2 == 0:
    some_list.remove(i)
  print(i)
```

(More context at github.com/PyCQA/flake8-bugbear/issues/445)

I'd be happy to contribute if its desired to implement this rule in ruff as well :slightly_smiling_face:

Awesome :) I will assign you to avoid others hopping on it accidentally, but just LMK if you find yourself unable to get to it.

FYI: I got a prototype working, but with flake8-bugbear we already got reports about some oversights leading to false positives - I'm looking into making it more solid - just wanted to give a heads up that I'm getting there :slightly_smiling_face:
