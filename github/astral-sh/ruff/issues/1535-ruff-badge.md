# `ruff` badge

---

_Issue opened by @matteosantama on 2023-01-01 19:45_

A nice wish-list item is a `ruff` badge that other projects can display in their `README.md`, similar to how `mypy`, `black`,  and `isort` have badges (see the badges on [this](https://github.com/matteosantama/dantzig) repo).

I do want to do this... I'm not sure what it takes exactly.

Just closing as a duplicate of #989.
