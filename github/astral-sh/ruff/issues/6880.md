# Refine edge-case comment handling for `PatternMatchClass`

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-08-25 19:05_

In this case, comments `a` and `b` are leading on `2`, but should be leading on a node for the entire `b=2` (this requires an AST change):

```python
    case A(
        b # b
        = # c
        2 # d
        # e
    ):
        pass
```

In this case, the comment should be an open parenthesis comment on the arguments, but is currently a leading comment on `x` due to our generic parenthesized comment handling (which thinks `x` is parenthesized, rather than in a call) (this requires an AST change):
```python
    case Point2D(  # end of line line
            x
            ):
        ...
```
