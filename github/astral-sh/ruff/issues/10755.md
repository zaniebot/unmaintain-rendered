# Should `ICN001` allow conventional imports with a leading underscore?

_Issue opened by @lucascolley on 2024-04-03 10:58_

[PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#public-and-internal-interfaces) says:

> Even with `__all__` set appropriately, internal interfaces (packages, modules, classes, functions, attributes or other names) should still be prefixed with a single leading underscore.
> 
> An interface is also considered internal if any containing namespace (package, module or class) is considered internal.

In light of that, should `ICN001` allow things like `import numpy as _np`? Is that _conventional_, or not? If not, why not? Sure, it doesn't see much use, but is that really in line with PEP8?

I'm still not quite sure how to interpret PEP8 there. Does the second paragraph I have quoted above mean 'every interface contained in an internal namespace should be prefixed with a single leading underscore', or 'every interface contained in an internal namespace needn't be prefixed with a single leading underscore, in virtue of being contained in an internal namespace'? I think the latter makes much more sense, but the wording is far from clear.

If it is the latter, then I suppose this can be resolved by importing from only internal modules in `__init__.py`.
