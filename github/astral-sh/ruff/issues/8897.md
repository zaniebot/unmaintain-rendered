# Formatter: `wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens` preview style

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-11-29 03:06_

Implement Black's [`wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens`](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3440) style as a Ruff preview style. 

> **Note**: 
> This new style may not be accepted as part of Black's 2024 style guide.

```python
my_dict = {
    "a key in my dict": a_very_long_variable * and_a_very_long_function_call() * and_another_long_func() / 100000.0
}
```

**Ruff Stable**

```python
my_dict = {
    "a key in my dict": a_very_long_variable
    * and_a_very_long_function_call()
    * and_another_long_func()
    / 100000.0
}
```

**Black Preview**

```python
my_dict = {
    "a key in my dict": (
        a_very_long_variable
        * and_a_very_long_function_call()
        * and_another_long_func()
        / 100000.0
    )
}
```

This new style does not apply to subscripts, although it probably should? But this is a non goal for now and tracked separately

We don't plan to implement this preview style as part of Ruff's 2024 style guide because we believe that improving the binary expression formatting solves the problem more holistically. See https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4123 for the details

This style did not ship as part of Black 24
