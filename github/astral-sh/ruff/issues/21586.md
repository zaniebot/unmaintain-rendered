# unittest: Use `self.assert{Equal,True,False}` instead of `assert` statements

_Issue opened by @injust on 2025-11-23 10:08_

### Summary

This was a silly mistake I made when first using unittest. Seems like a good fit for a lint rule.

From https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#basic-example:

> These methods are used instead of the [assert](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assert) statement so the test runner can accumulate all test results and produce a report.
