# (feature) pre-commit support

---

_Issue opened by @kierun on 2022-09-01 14:54_

It would be nice to have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) support. [How to create new hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#new-hooks) in case it is needed.

It can wait… Definitely not an urgent task.

#55 has something to this effect! Just need to get around to testing + merging it.
