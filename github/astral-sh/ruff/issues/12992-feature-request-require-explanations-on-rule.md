# Feature request: Require explanations on rule overrides

---

_Issue opened by @tylerlaprade on 2024-08-19 16:48_

Similar to [this ESLint rule](https://mysticatea.github.io/eslint-plugin-eslint-comments/rules/require-description.html), I don't want any Ruff rules to be overridden without an explanation of why.

Is this the same as https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5182 ?
