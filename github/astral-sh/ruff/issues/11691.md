# Add info about used git commit into `ruff --version` if available

---

_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2024-06-02 12:49_

Currently git version of app, always for `ruff --version` prints something like 
```
ruff 0.4.7
```
I think that here could be added more info like
- git hash of commit
- type of build - custom build, official build, other
- build commands

e.g. 
```
ruff 0.4.7, abcdef, custom build
ruff 0.4.7, abcdef, from debian repository
ruff 0.4.7, abcdef, official package
```

Uff, that took me a while to figure out myself. You can use `ruff version` to get the commit number (doesn't work for local builds).

Yeah we added this in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/8034

As mentioned there, we could include this for the `-V` / `--version` flag. We didn't change it initially to avoid a breaking change for tools that parse the output. I think we should change this to match the `uv` behavior which is as follows:

```
❯ uv -V
uv 0.2.3
❯ uv --version
uv 0.2.3 (ce4d862b0 2024-05-24)
❯ uv version
uv 0.2.3 (ce4d862b0 2024-05-24)
```

I would instead follow the same behavior as python which output the build info when `--version` (or `-V`) is provided twice. https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-version

```
❯ python3 --version
Python 3.11.7
❯ python3 --version --version
Python 3.11.7 (main, Dec 18 2023, 10:50:03) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)]
```
