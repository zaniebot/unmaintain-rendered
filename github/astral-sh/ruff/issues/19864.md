# UP018 should detect more unnecessarily wrapped literals

---

_Issue opened by @dscorbett on 2025-08-11 15:28_

### Summary

Some unnecessarily wrapped literals would be easy for [`native-literals` (UP018)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/native-literals/) to detect but are not detected.

`int()` is not detected when followed by an attribute. This is to avoid a syntax error. However, the syntax error can be avoided with parentheses. Compare `int(0)`, which UP018 always detects, inserting parentheses when needed.

Implicitly concatenated string literals are skipped for no apparent reason. If it spans multiple lines, it still needs to be parenthesized, but the `str` call is unnecessary.

The `object` keyword of `str` is not supported.

`complex` is not supported.

[Example](https://play.ruff.rs/820cc69f-7e30-4b02-bc49-f3fe757924c9):
```console
$ cat >up018.py <<'# EOF'
int().denominator
str("A" "B")
str(
    "A"
    "B"
)
str(object="!")
complex(1j)
complex(real=1j)
# EOF

$ ruff --isolated check up018.py --select UP018
All checks passed!
```

Ideal fixed output:
```python
(0).denominator
"A" "B"
(
    "A"
    "B"
)
"!"
1j
1j
```
