# chore: Rename the `ruff` crate to `ruff_linter`

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-09-19 21:12_

Ruff has become more than just a linter and the `ruff` crate now only contains the linter logic. Make this explicit by renaming the `ruff` crate to `ruff_linter`  and removing the following from the `ruff_cli/Cargo.toml`

```
# Since the name of the binary is the same as the name of the `ruff` crate
# running `cargo doc --no-deps --all` results in an `output filename collision`
# See also https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6313.
# We therefore disable the documentation generation for the binary.
doc = false
```
