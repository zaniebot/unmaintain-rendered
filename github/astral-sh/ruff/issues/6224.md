<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
```py
# asdf.pyi
def asdf(): ...
```
```
>ruff asdf.pyi
asdf.pyi:1:5: D103 Missing docstring in public function
Found 1 error.
```

when adding a docstring, it triggers `PYI021`:
```pyi
def asdf():
    """asdf"""
```
```
>ruff asdf.pyi
asdf.pyi:2:5: PYI021 Docstrings should not be included in stubs
Found 1 error.
```
