# UP030 replaces regex repetitions

---

_Issue opened by @tobixx on 2025-07-15 08:30_

### Summary

Regex repetitions are partially removed by this rule, example:
```diff
-    _re_date = r'(?P<day>\d{{1,2}})(?P<month>{0})'.format('|'.join(_months))
+    _re_date = r'(?P<day>\d{{,2}})(?P<month>{})'.format('|'.join(_months))
```
* `1` is removed in the regex expression: `\d{{1,2}}`
* `format` has only one parameter, removing any other but `{0}` in this case is wrong anyway
