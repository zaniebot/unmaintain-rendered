# W391 implementation is missing despite being checked off

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->
In a pycodestyle tracking issue https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402 the rule for `W391` is checked but this does not exist in the ruff codebase. In fact there is a [comment noting this](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402#issuecomment-1855323380). Can this be unchecked so the tracking and expectations is right and, ultimately, tackled?

Thanks, I unchecked it -- not sure how that happened!
