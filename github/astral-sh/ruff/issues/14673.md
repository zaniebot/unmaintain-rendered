# new rule - Removing extra spaces in dictionary

---

_Issue opened by @spaceby on 2024-11-29 08:52_

Ruff does not remove extra spaces in such dictionaries.
```python
d = {'a':               'b'}
```
In other cases, spaces are removed.
Please add a rule for this case too.

Have you tried `ruff format`? It should remove the extra spacing. Or aren't you using it because it is too opinionated?

I don't use it.

I'll merge this into https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/2402 because this is covered by pycodestyle E241
