<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).

Hello, If I try check file from stdin ruff crashed, but it printed errors.
```sh
error: Ruff crashed. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BPanic%5D

...quoting the executed command, along with the relevant file contents and `pyproject.toml` settings, we'd be very appreciative!
