# Request: `fixable = ["ALL"]`

---

_Issue opened by @jamesbraza on 2023-04-25 22:02_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

Currently per https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/#using-pyprojecttoml with `ruff==0.0.263`, to fix all, one needs to pass all codes:

```toml
# Allow autofix for all enabled rules (when `--fix`) is provided.
fixable = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "I", "N", "Q", "S", "T", "W", "ANN", "ARG", "BLE", "COM", "DJ", "DTZ", "EM", "ERA", "EXE", "FBT", "ICN", "INP", "ISC", "NPY", "PD", "PGH", "PIE", "PL", "PT", "PTH", "PYI", "RET", "RSE", "RUF", "SIM", "SLF", "TCH", "TID", "TRY", "UP", "YTT"]
```

In a config, if one has `select = ["ALL"]`, it would be nice to have an accompanying `fixable = ["ALL"]`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
fix = true
fixable = ["ALL"]
select = ["ALL"]
```

This is simpler, future compatible, and more readable.

What you have in the example should actually work, we respect the same set of selectors between `fixable` and `select`. (Note, though, that `fixable = ["ALL"]` doesn't meant that we're able to fix _all_ rules; rather, it means that Ruff is allowed to fix all _fixable_ rules.)

If you see otherwise, happy to re-open :)

(If you want all rules to be fixable, you should just be able to ignore `fixable` entirely, since that's the default.)

Okay that's good to know!

From https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/#using-pyprojecttoml:

> By default, Ruff's autofix is aggressive

I see now what "aggressive" means, it would be good to document that "aggressive" just means autofix everything possible.
