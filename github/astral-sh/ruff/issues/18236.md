# Warn against use of `.__annotations__` (in many circumstances)

---

_Issue opened by @JelleZijlstra on 2025-05-21 02:18_

### Summary

Directly using the `.__annotations__` attribute of an object is unsafe in a few circumstances:

- On classes with custom metaclasses, various odd things can happen (https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/#pre-existing-bugs). On Python 3.14 and newer this only happens if at least one of the classes involved uses `from __future__ import annotations`; on earlier versions it can always happen.
- Accessing `__annotations__` on an instance of an annotated class works in released versions of Python (most of the time) but won't work in Python 3.14.
- (Minor) Accessing `__annotations__` on arbitrary type objects will raise AttributeError on static types, e.g. `int.__annotations__`.

However, it is always safe to access `__annotations__` on function and module objects.

Therefore, it probably makes sense for Ruff to warn against any use of the `.__annotations__` attribute, perhaps with an exception for objects known to be functions or modules.

Similar to #17853.
