# Union not auto-fixed when inside generic

_Issue opened by @phillipuniverse on 2023-02-01 17:12_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

- A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
- The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
- The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
- The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->


```python
from typing import List, Union

stuff = List[Union[str, int]]
```

`pyproject.toml` config:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py311"
line-length = 100

select = [
    "I",  # isort
    "C4", # flake8-comprehensions
    "UP", # pyupgrade
    "F",  # pyflakes
    "E",  # pycodestyle
]
ignore = [
    "E501",  # line too long, handled by black
    "C401",  # generator syntax for sets vs always force set comprehension
    "PLC0414",  # allow explicit re-exports using 'as' without forcing __all__
]
```

Running `ruff --fix test.py` on this produces:

```python
from typing import Union

stuff = list[Union[str, int]]
```

So the List -> list is good, but I would expect to autofix to:

```python
stuff = list[str | int]
```

Current `ruff --version` is `ruff 0.0.239`.

Just as a sanity check, I confirmed this is autofixed correctly:

```python
from typing import Union

another: Union[str, int] = "hello"
```

is autofixed to:

```python
another: str | int = "hello"
```

This was changed intentionally but I have to look back to remember why. Maybe we're being overly timid.

#1563 was the relevant PR.

I think that should've only been disabled for pre-3.9 code? Maybe that's the error. Can you do `str | None` etc. on 3.9+?
