# C408 fixer rewrites non-builtins

---

_Issue opened by @spaceone on 2023-01-11 21:59_

foo.py
```
def list():
        return [1, 2, 3]


a = list()
```

```
$ruff foo.py 
foo.py:1:1: A001 Variable `list` is shadowing a python builtin
foo.py:5:5: C408 Unnecessary `list` call (rewrite as a literal)
Found 2 error(s).
1 potentially fixable with the --fix option.
```

The fixer turns it into:
```
def list():
        return [1, 2, 3]


a = []
```

It would be nice if the fixer could detect the situation and ignore it.

Oh, yeah, we have this capability. Will fix.

(Specifically, we have the binding knowledge necessary to know whether list is a built in there.)
