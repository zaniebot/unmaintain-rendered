# namespace-packages to supports globs

---

_Issue opened by @zawsq on 2024-02-15 12:08_

Version: `ruff 0.2.1`

Consider supporting [namespace-packages](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#line-length) glob 

**Problem:**
Currently we need to specify each nested package separately, which increases maintenance overhead.

**Current configuration:**
```toml
namespace-packages = [
    "plugins",
    "plugins/ex1",
    "plugins/ex1/test",
    "plugins/example",
    "plugins/utils/example/test",
    ]
```

**Proposed configuration:**
```toml
namespace-packages = ["plugins/**"]
```

Utilizing a `glob` pattern like `plugins/**` makes managing a large set of plugins easier by automatically including all sub-packages without the need for explicit listing, thus reducing the effort required for maintenance.

I think this is reasonable.

Unless I'm reading the wrong part of the code, we're doing glob expansion?

I tested it out locally as well using `--show-settings` and we do support it:

```console
$ tree plugins
plugins
├── ex1
│   └── test
├── example
│   └── foo.py
└── utils
    └── example
        └── test
```

And,

```console
$ ruff check --show-settings .
[...]
linter.namespace_packages = ["/Users/dhruv/playground/ruff/plugins/ex1", "/Users/dhruv
/playground/ruff/plugins/ex1/test", "/Users/dhruv/playground/ruff/plugins/example", "/
Users/dhruv/playground/ruff/plugins/utils", "/Users/dhruv/playground/ruff/plugins/util
s/example", "/Users/dhruv/playground/ruff/plugins/utils/example/test"]
[...]
