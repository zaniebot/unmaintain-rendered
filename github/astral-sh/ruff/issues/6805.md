# [I001] Is this a bug?

---

_Issue opened by @harupy on 2023-08-23 08:36_

<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.

If you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:

* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.
* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.
* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).
* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).
-->

`ruff --select I --fix` trasforms this code:

```python
from a import (
    b as x,
    c as y,
)
```

into:

```python
from a import (
    b as x,
)
from a import (
    c as y,
)
```

Observed in ruff 0.0.285.

I see, isort has the same behavior:

```
> isort a.py
Fixing /home/haru/Desktop/repositories/mlflow/a.py

> cat a.py
from a import b as x
from a import c as y
```

Found https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/settings/#isort-combine-as-imports. This is not a bug.
