# Bump `pysource-minimize` (and other dependencies?) in `py-fuzzer`'s `uv.lock` file

---

_Issue opened by @AlexWaygood on 2025-04-16 11:35_

There was just a new release of `pysource-minimize`, one of the libraries used by our [`py-fuzzer`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/main/python/py-fuzzer) script. We should try to upgrade the `pysource-minimize` pin in the script's `uv.lock` file (as long as the script still works as intended), and see if we can bump any other dependencies there as well.
