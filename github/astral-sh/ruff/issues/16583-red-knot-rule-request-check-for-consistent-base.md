# [red-knot] Rule request: check for consistent base class ordering

---

_Issue opened by @NeilGirdhar on 2025-03-09 23:49_

### Summary

It would be nice if red-knot could detect inconsistent base class ordering (like PyRight does).  I am proposing this because I would like to delete my tool: https://github.com/NeilGirdhar/inheritance_graph, which helps in debugging why the ordering is inconsistent.  It would be nice to have this functionality in red-knot as well!
