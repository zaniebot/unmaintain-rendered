# False positive: `args` in a numpy-style docstring is treated as a section header

---

_Issue opened by @bzoracler on 2024-08-08 04:18_

Possibly related to https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/9426

I'm trying to write a numpy-style docstring for a `TypedDict`, however it's triggering `D405`, `D407`, and `D411` because it thinks that one of the key-value pairs is a section header (see [ruff playground](https://play.ruff.rs/d5c9b0b3-b72b-420c-80eb-6e55fb59d180)):

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class CommandLineSettings(TypedDict):
    """
    Settings to the command line program

    Items
    -----
    args
        CLI arguments
    """

    args: list[str]
```

`Args` is not a recognised section header in numpydoc, which only specifies [`Parameters`](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#parameters), so I think this is a false positive.

I've tested this with `pydocstyle`, which also produces the same false positives, but it's no longer maintained, so I'm posting the issue here.

I'm aware that `Items` is not a recognised section header, but numpydoc doesn't have a style guide for `TypedDict`s, and none of the existing recognised headers (`Attributes`, `Parameters`) are suitable substitutes IMO. Anyway, ruff isn't producing any false positives for the section `Items`, so I don't have any issues with ruff's behaviour of this section - just the `args` entry underneath the header.

Can you try setting the `pydocstyle.convention` setting to `numpy` [playground](https://play.ruff.rs/a9b6fa54-ad9a-4089-83ca-e176dc2dc7d2). I'm not quiet sure what convention is used when the value is `null` (default) but the error goes away in the playground when explicitly setting numpy.

Oh, thank you! That fixed it.
