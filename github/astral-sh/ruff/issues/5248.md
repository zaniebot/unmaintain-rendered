# Long lines are sometimes not reported as E501 error

_Issue opened by @tlinhart on 2023-06-21 11:55_

Consider this code in `test.py`:

```
def f(argument_with_a_very_long_name):
    pass


aaaaaaaaaa_bbbbbbbbbb_cccccccccc_dddddddddd_eeeeeeeeee_ffffffffff = "xxx"

f(
    argument_with_a_very_long_name=aaaaaaaaaa_bbbbbbbbbb_cccccccccc_dddddddddd_eeeeeeeeee_ffffffffff
)
```

and these Ruff settings in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.ruff]
cache-dir = "~/.cache/ruff"
select = ["E", "F", "W", "I"]
line-length = 79
target-version = "py310"
```

When I run Ruff with `ruff check test.py`, it doesn't report any violation despite the fact that the code contains a line exceeding the length of 79 characters (line 8). On the other hand, running `flake8 test.py` reports:

```
test.py:8:80: E501 line too long (100 > 79 characters)
```

Regarding the line too long violations, I only encoutered [this FAQ paragraph](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#is-ruff-compatible-with-black) about compatibility with Black where it states:

> Ruff, on the other hand, will flag rule E501 for any line that exceeds the line-length setting.

From that I would assume that Ruff should report the issue in all cases.

I use Ruff version 0.0.274.

This is intended -- we don't flag lines that consistent of a single unbroken word. I can add a note to the documentation.

Thanks for clarifying. On one hand, it makes sense as it makes it consistent with Black's best effort behavior. On the other hand, coming from Flake8, it makes a lot of `# noqa: E501` comments obsolete.

Can always use `ruff --select RUF100 --select E501 --fix` to automatically remove those obsolete `noqa` comments :)
