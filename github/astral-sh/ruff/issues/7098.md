_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-03 18:35_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select RET504 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
def mavko_debari(P_kbar):
    D=0.4853881 + 3.6006116*P - 0.0117368*(P-1.3822)**2
    return D
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/9728647.py:3:12: RET504 Unnecessary assignment to `D` before `return` statement
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/new?title=%5BAutofix%20error%5D

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/9728647.py`, the rule codes RET504, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!


```
