# [B903] Preview rule feedback

---

_Issue opened by @mikeshardmind on 2025-02-19 01:44_

### Description

- This rule probably shouldn't be on by default, it's extremely opinionated, and may result in slower import times for users. dataclasses imports inspect. Even in applications where inspect would always end up imported, dataclasses are more expensive to evaluate their type than a handwritten slotted class. 
- If this rule is going to exist, it probably shouldn't recommend namedtuples, see [this post](https://snarky.ca/dont-use-named-tuples-in-new-apis/) for details about accidental API surface caused by their use which can create unintended API contracts for users of the type (eg. unpacking)

Thank you for the feedback.

Even in applications where inspect would always end up imported, dataclasses are more expensive to evaluate their type than a handwritten slotted class.

It won't be included in the default rule set (related to #1774).

Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think this recommends `namedtuple`?

It does, in both in the hint shown by the VSC plugin, as well as in the [docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/class-as-data-structure/#why-is-this-bad)
