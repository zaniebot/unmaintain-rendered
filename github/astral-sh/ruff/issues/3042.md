# N999 for `__main__.py`

---

_Issue opened by @scop on 2023-02-19 21:11_

ruff 0.0.248 seems to issue `N999` for all `__main__.py`.

Maybe it should get the same treatment as `__init__.py`, or be ignored altogether?

Ah yeah that's definitely a false positive.

I will take a look at this now and perhaps cut a new release real quick.

Out of curiosity shall I make sure we don't use release 0.0.248 in CI or will this be backported to 0.0.248?

Trying to understand how to use ruff versions in our CI, thank you!

I'm going to release 0.0.249 in a moment, but it will indeed be a new release -- we don't really have a way to backport or update existing releases.
