# Suggestion: Sort linter rules in docs

---

_Issue opened by @xymy on 2025-02-14 15:24_

### Description

The current ordering of [linter rules](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) is a bit confusing. Although it is generally in order, there are some sorting errors. I have detected `flake8-copyright`, `flake8-gettext`, `flake8-slots`, `flake8-todos`, and `flake8-fixme` are not in the correct location in docs.

Other rules not named in `flake8-*` pattern appear to have been ordered manually. I have not a good idea about how to sort them. But I think we can fix order of `flake8-*` rules firstly.
