# Rule request: `not` on non-empty tuple is always `False`

---

_Issue opened by @tamir-bahar on 2025-08-04 10:41_

### Summary

I ran into the following in my code:

```python
return not (a or b or c,)
```

Due to the `,` before the closing parens, the expression was a non-empty tuple and therefore always returned `False`.

Since we have the `not` there, I doubt there will be many false-positives for that (honestly, I can't think of any).

Thanks!

I could have sworn we had a rule for this, but the two I found only apply in certain contexts, which is probably what I was thinking of:
- [if-tuple (F634)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/if-tuple/#if-tuple-f634)
- [assert-tuple (F631)](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/assert-tuple/#assert-tuple-f631)

I guess along this theme we could call the rule something like `negated-tuple`, but these all seem like special cases of a hypothetical `tuple-in-boolean-context` rule.

or even a rule that detects values that are always truthy or falsy values in boolean context
