# Use `tab_width` option in formatter

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-09-25 09:20_

Allow customizing the `tab_width` in the formatter by respecting the global `tab_width` (`tab-size` today) option. 

The `tab_width` should only change the width of a tab character but not allow changing the number of spaces when using `indent-style= "space"` (May require reverting https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/7301)
