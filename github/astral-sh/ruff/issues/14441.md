# Feature request: rule to check an argument of `pathlib.Path().with_suffix`

_Issue opened by @TheBits on 2024-11-18 19:48_

Hi!

The [argument of function `pathlib.Path().with_suffix`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.0/Lib/pathlib/_abc.py#L231) must starts with a dot. It's easy to forget if you don't use it often. Can you please add a new rule to check the argument?

Thanks!
