# Documentation request: conform to black settings

---

_Issue opened by @ahonnecke on 2022-09-01 16:19_

https://pypi.org/project/black/ is a very popular auto code formatter / style guide.

Many tools include documentation that specifically lay out how to configure said tool to conform to black.  I think that would be a helpful subsection.

Good suggestion. Given Black's popularity, I do want ruff to focus less on stylistic linting and more on semantic linting, which would make this less of an issue, but it should def be documented.
