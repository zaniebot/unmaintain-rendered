# Is there a way for Ruff to notify when a `per-file-ignores` item is unnecessary?

### Question

Is there a way for Ruff to notify when a `per-file-ignores` item is unnecessary?

We have a very long list of `per-file-ignores` that we are slowly working through. It happens regularly that we do fix all violations of a specific rule in a Python file but forget to remove the corresponding item in the `per-file-ignores` list. It would be helpful if Ruff could notify in such cases. Looks like what we are looking for is very similar to [rule `RUF100:unused-noqa`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unused-noqa/). Is there such a thing?

### Version

0.9.10

This is an interesting question. 

Short answer: no, this isn't possible.

What I find interesting is that this doesn't just apply to `per-file-ignores` but to ignores in general, similar to Ruff's unused-noqa rule (as you pointed out). It would require Ruff to not only track if a noqa had a "rule hit" but also if any `ignore` or `per-file-ignore` "suppression" was used. 

Longterm, I think a better solution for this problem are baselines, see #1149

Yes, it seems like a "baseline" feature is something we could work with for this use case. I subscribed to <https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1149>.
