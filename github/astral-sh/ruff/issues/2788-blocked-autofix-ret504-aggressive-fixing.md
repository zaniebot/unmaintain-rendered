# [blocked, autofix] RET504 Aggressive fixing

---

_Issue opened by @Sawbez on 2023-02-12 00:55_

This relates to PR #2599 in which it is planned to have the fix work only for basic cases with comments and pretty much nothing else in between because some other cases break it. 

Eventually once we have autofix levels (see #1992) we can add that option to not include the restrictions.
