_Issue opened by @qarmin on 2023-09-04 11:49_

Ruff 0.0.287 (latest changes from main branch)
```
ruff  *.py --select I001,PLR1722,UP036 --no-cache --fix
```

file content(at least simple cpython script shows that this is valid python file):
```
if (sys.version_info < (2,7,0)):
    exit(1)
elif (sys.version_info >= (3,0)):
    i
```

error
```
/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/875119901397.py:2:5: PLR1722 Use `sys.exit()` instead of `exit`
Found 1 error.

error: Autofix introduced a syntax error. Reverting all changes.

This indicates a bug in `ruff`. If you could open an issue at:

...quoting the contents of `/home/rafal/test/tmp_folder/875119901397.py`, the rule codes I001, PLR1722, UP036, along with the `pyproject.toml` settings and executed command, we'd be very appreciative!
