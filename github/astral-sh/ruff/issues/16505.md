# [red-knot] define new `Diagnostic` type for representing our diagnostic data model in code

---

_Issue opened by @BurntSushi on 2025-03-04 18:07_

For this task, we should:

* Move existing (as of 2025-03-04) diagnostic code into "old" sub-module.
* Define the data model described in #16504 in code centered around a new concrete `Diagnostic` data type.
