# Formatter: Preserve parentheses of yielded value

---

_Issue opened by @MichaReiser on 2023-08-22 09:24_

Black seems (need confirmation) to preserve parentheses around the yielded value:

## Input / Output
```python
yield ("Cache key will cause errors if used with memcached: %r " "(longer than %s)" % (
        key,
        MEMCACHE_MAX_KEY_LENGTH,
     )
)

yield "Cache key will cause errors if used with memcached: %r " "(longer than %s)" % (
    key,
    MEMCACHE_MAX_KEY_LENGTH,
)
 
 
yield ("Unnecessary")


yield (
    "#   * Make sure each ForeignKey and OneToOneField has `on_delete` set "
    "to the desired behavior"
)
yield (
    "#   * Remove `managed = False` lines if you wish to allow "
    "Django to create, modify, and delete the table"
)
yield (
    "# Feel free to rename the models, but don't rename db_table values or "
    "field names."
)

yield "#   * Make sure each ForeignKey and OneToOneField has `on_delete` set "    "to the desired behavior"
yield "#   * Remove `managed = False` lines if you wish to allow " "Django to create, modify, and delete the table"
yield "# Feel free to rename the models, but don't rename db_table values or "    "field names."
```

## Ruff

Always removes the parentheses.
