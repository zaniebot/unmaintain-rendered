Is there a usecase for implementing [isort's presets](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/profiles.html)? E.g. `preset = black` is short-hand for:

```toml
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = true
ensure_newline_before_comments = true
line_length = 88
split_on_trailing_comma = true
```

Note that most of these settings are not available in Ruff (yet); the only exception being the last two options.

Thanks! FWIW my general attitude is that I'm open to contributions for additional isort options, but we likely won't prioritize implementing them ourselves, and we likely won't support the options that enforce dramatically different formatting (e.g., any of the grid modes or alternate wrapping behaviors like `multi_line_output` -- it's just too much maintenance burden to support so many different formatting modes given how much less common they are IMO). That's in juxtaposition to options like `lines-before-import` which are comparatively less dramatic.

One major bump in my projects adopting the ruff isort'er is the [length sort sections](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/options.html#length-sort-sections) option. Is this something that a contribution would be welcome for?

Is there a plan for resolve the first issue?

Then why did Ruff re-implement isort if it's not going to have feature parity? It would seem better to have a plugin system where existing tooling can be used rather than only partially implementing the existing functionality while also trying to replace it.

It just depends on the popularity of the setting. isort has a long tail of features and many of the features in that long tail aren't relevant to the vast majority of users. I don't mind accepting PRs for popular settings, but we're not going to (e.g.) prioritize implementing complex settings that few users would use.

(You're of course welcome to continue using isort alongside Ruff if you rely on something in there -- there's nothing incompatible in that workflow.)
