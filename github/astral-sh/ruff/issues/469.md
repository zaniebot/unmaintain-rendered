# Ruff supports `B001` (no bare exceptions), but as `E722`

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2022-10-26 01:26_

How should we handle identical exceptions that exist under different codes? (I don't really understand why this exception exists in `flake8-bugbear`, but it does.)

Similarly, `B902` is covered by `N804` and `N805`.

Similarly, `B950` is roughly `E501` (with some extra functionality).
