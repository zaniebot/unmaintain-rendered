# Add support for attribute symbol resolution

---

_Issue opened by @charliermarsh on 2023-07-03 17:32_

See the discussion in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pull/5444#discussion_r1248987832.

Given a reference like `Class.method` or `Class.Subclass`, we'd like to be able to resolve the method or class definition to which it resolves.
