# `pyupgrade.keep-runtime-typing` should be ignored for `.pyi` stub files

---

_Issue opened by @monosans on 2023-07-10 10:30_

Should the `pyupgrade.keep-runtime-typing` setting really apply to `.pyi` stub files? I think not, because they don't have runtime, so they should always use the new type annotation syntax.

I think you're right -- we can probably ignore `keep-runtime-typing` in those files.
