It would be nice if ruff supported these extra tryceratops checks:

- [ ] [TRY005 - Define __reduce__ to make exception pickable](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/blob/main/docs/violations/TRY005.md)
- [ ] [TRY006 - Inheriting from non defined base exception](https://github.com/guilatrova/tryceratops/blob/main/docs/violations/TRY006.md)

`TRY006` makes sense to me. 

I fear that`TRY005` is blocked by #1774 because it's a very specific rule that probably doesn't make sense for most projects. However, we have quiet a few users that use Ruff with `--select ALL`.

Could `TRY005` be gated behind a configuration setting like it is in tryceratops?

I don't think gating single rules behind additional configuration is appropriate for us

but what is the issue with that? Not needed rule can be added to `ignore` or `per-file-ignores` config sections. I would expect it's part of ruff (pre-commit hook) upgrade process.
