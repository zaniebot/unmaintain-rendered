# NextLineHelp should still indent help past the option to improve readability

---

_Issue opened by @joshtriplett on 2016-07-18 22:39_

My help string looks like this:

```
FLAGS:
    -h, --help      Prints help information
        --stdout    Write patches to stdout rather than files.

OPTIONS:
        --in-reply-to <Message-Id>    Make the first mail a reply to the specified Message-Id
```

If I try to make that more readable by setting NextLineHelp for --in-reply-to, I get this instead:

```
FLAGS:
    -h, --help      Prints help information
        --stdout    Write patches to stdout rather than files.

OPTIONS:
        --in-reply-to <Message-Id>
       Make the first mail a reply to the specified Message-Id
```

I think this would look more readable:

```
FLAGS:
    -h, --help      Prints help information
        --stdout    Write patches to stdout rather than files.

OPTIONS:
        --in-reply-to <Message-Id>
                    Make the first mail a reply to the specified Message-Id
```

This becomes even more important in a list of multiple options on adjacent lines.

I agree, it should at least indent one indentation past the `--`. I'll add this to the queue :wink: :+1:

Not just "one indentation past"; ideally, it should line up with the help messages for non-NextLineHelp options.

It would also be nice to have an `AppSettings` setting that makes Clap limit the maximum width of the option name/value column, and automatically uses NextLineHelp otherwise.  (Or, ideally, that could become the default.)

Hmm, I'll have to think about how to best do that. I agree it's the most aesthetically pleasing, but depending on the changes required to implemented we'll see. Lining them up using the internal variable `longest` should make this somewhat easy.

Good idea, could you open a new issue for the maximum length idea. It will most likely be implemented similar to how the maximum terminal width is implemented with a dedicated method on `App`.
