# Investigate windows wasm build issue

---

_Issue opened by @stevepentland on 2018-05-05 22:18_

As reported at Drops-of-Diamond/diamond_drops#59 there seems to have been a missed case when `wasm` support was introduced. This will need to be fixed up and seems to be pretty straightforward.

The original work was done in #1190 in response to #1132
