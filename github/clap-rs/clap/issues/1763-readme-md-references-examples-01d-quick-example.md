# README.md references examples/01d_quick_example.rs but there is no such example

_Issue opened by @Ran4 on 2020-03-26 15:53_

### Clap version

Latest master

### Where?

README.md references examples/01d_quick_example.rs but there is no such example: the examples only go up to `c`.

Derive examples live in [`clap_derive/examples`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/clap_derive/examples). I'm closing this particular issue in favor of #1652 (catchall)
