# allow delimited values to be turned OFF

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-11-30 07:33_

Relates to and requires #348 to be implemented first.

This would add something like `Arg::allow_value_delims(bool)` which defaults to true (i.e. most users would never have to worry about this method), but if an application requires `val1,val2,val3` to be parsed a **single** value, they would set `Arg::allow_value_delims(false)`
