# Document AppSetting::DisableVersion

---

_Issue opened by @freshstrangemusic on 2016-07-23 07:47_

Currently, the `AppSetting::DisableVersion` setting is undocumented. From what I can tell, this setting is used to disable version flag on subcommand when the app (or super-command) uses `AppSettings::VersionlessSubcommands`.

However, if a user would like to not have a global `-V, --version` flag for their program, this setting will still work. I feel like this should be documented as it is genuinely useful.

@brennie It's used internally, and wasn't designed to be used publicly. This isn't to say it couldn't become public, but as of right now if one wishes to _not_ have the `-V, --version` generated for subcommands, one can use [`AppSettings::VersionlessSubcommands`](http://kbknapp.github.io/clap-rs/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#variant.VersionlessSubcommands)

@kbknapp Yes, but I mean it could _also_ be used to disable the `-V, --version` flag for the main `App` instance.
