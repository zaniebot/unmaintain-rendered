### Clap Version

master

### Describe your use case

When I run ```cargo clippy``` on this project .. There are too many issues for a human to scan.

A recent  clippy rule ... It is now suggesting change of this form 
```
-            println!("Diffing {}..{} {} (color={})", base, head, path, color);
+            println!("Diffing {base}..{head} {path} (color={color})");
```

This project has about 100 of these warnings ... I just want to cut the list down so I can scan other results.


### Describe the solution you'd like

By targeting on rule, I hope this make the review process easy. 

### Alternatives, if applicable

Should I fix all other clippy issues?

My feeling on that is no with so many other PR on this project it would be disputive

### Additional Context

_No response_

Closing as this is something we do not need to track in an issue.  We enforce that there are no clippy lints for a specific version of rustc (our MSRV).  There will always be new lints being reported with each version of rustc being released and it isn't worth tracking this as an issue each time.
