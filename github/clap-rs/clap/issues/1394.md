# Subcommands: allow using the shortest substring matching

### Rust Version

* Any

### Affected Version of clap

* any (2.31.2)

### Feature Request Summary

This is a feature from python's argument parsing, as seen for example in mercurial's cli.

For example: if the "hg" binary provides subcommands "commit", "config" and "copy", I can do:  

`> hg comENTER` and it will work as if I digited `> hg commitENTER`, because "com" is the shortest unambiguous substring of the subcommand. Same with "comm" and "commi".

If instead I digit: `> hg cENTER` it will fail with:

```
hg: command 'c' is ambiguous:
    cat checkout clone commit config copy
```

https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#variant.InferSubcommands is probably what you're looking for.

EDIT: Nevermind, I forgot that `InferSubcommands` requires unambiguous matching.
