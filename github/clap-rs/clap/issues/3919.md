Hello @epage @shannmu I read #5544 and #5744, but it is still not clear to me what is missing to have Elvish native completion. Could you please explain? Thanks :-)

We've kept the shell support issues open because no one has yet created a definition of done for them. Mainly that identifying regressions from the existing stable completions and addressing them or at least creating issues.
