# Implicit `use_delimiter(true)` can be confusing

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2016-09-16 21:27_

After some testing, the new implicit `Arg::use_delimiter(true)` can be confusing to the point of thinking things are bugs. 

It needs to be removed in favor of explicitness. The comma (`,`) will remain the default delimiter if none is defined though.
