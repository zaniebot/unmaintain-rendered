### Clap Version

master

### Describe your use case

Building on #2912, if we can move `clap_generate` to only depend on `clap_reflect` and not `clap`, that will be a good test case and would unlock future help improvements.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Port `clap_generate` to `clap_reflect`, expanding it as needed.

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context
