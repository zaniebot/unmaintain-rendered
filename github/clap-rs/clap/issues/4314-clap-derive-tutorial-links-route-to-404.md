# `clap_derive` tutorial links route to 404.

---

_Issue opened by @Xithrius on 2022-10-01 00:50_

The README [here](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/clap_derive/README.md) for `clap_derive` has broken links for the tutorial and reference.

The derive tutorial leads [here](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v4.0.7/examples/tutorial_derive/README.md) and the reference leads [here](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v4.0.7/examples/derive_ref/README.md).
