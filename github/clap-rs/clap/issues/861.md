# Custom errors format

---

_Issue opened by @RazrFalcon on 2017-02-18 20:43_

Is there a way to print errors without the `error:` prefix?

For example, my application uses `Error:`(first letter is uppercase) prefix and I have to replace all the clap's error messages before printing.

I think the best solution is to add a new field to the Error struct, which will contain only an error message. No `error:` prefix, no usage, nothing.

Currently there isn't 😕 

I agree with additional field aspect, and hindsight being 20/20 that should be called, "message" but repurposing it would be a breaking change. I'll add a field to the error struct which contains only error itself. I'm not sure what I'll call this field yet, but watch this issue for news!

Thanks for filing this.
