# Missing breaking change in changelog or invalid feature for clap_app! ?

---

_Issue opened by @Keats on 2016-01-29 23:02_

Posted it on reddit but figured it might be a better place:

> Tried to update https://github.com/Keats/dbmigrate to clap 2.0 but realised the unstable feature requires nightly rust since its feature flag includes clippy.
> Maybe it should be mentioned that the clap_app macro is not usable anymore outside of the nightly branch in the breaking changes? What's the reasoning behind it?

I can update the changelog/change feature set depending on whether that was intentional or not

#403 Fixes this. Apologies for missing it!

Cheers, is #252 the place for the macro changes or is it somewhere else?

For subscription to changes yes. We may spawn some issues based  off that one, but all discussion should start there. Also note, the changes I'm thinking of are kind of low on the priority chart right now, so don't expect pre-1.0 Rust level breaking changes :wink:
