_Issue opened by @Sherlock-Holo on 2021-06-17 11:50_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Clap Version

3.0.0-beta.2

### Describe your use case

When I use ArgEnum derive macro for the enum like
```rust
enum MyEnum {
    DoIt,
    NotDoIt,
}
```

I hope it generate possiable valuse `DoIt, NotDoIt`, but it generate `do-it, not-do-it`

### Describe the solution you'd like

I hope there is a way to set the generated possible values use camelcase, for example
```rust
#[derive(clap)]
#[clap(....)]
struct Opt{
    #[clap(short = 'm', long = "my", arg_enum(case = "camelcase"))]
    my_enum: MyEnum
}
```

I found the way:
```rust
#[derive(ArgEnum)]
#[clap(rename_all="camel")]
enum MyEnum {
    DoIt,
    NotDoIt,
}
```
