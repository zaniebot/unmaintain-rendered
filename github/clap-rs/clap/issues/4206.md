# Set required(false) by default for all arguments

_Issue opened by @epage on 2022-09-12 21:55_

### Discussed in https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4203

<sup>Originally posted by **fritzrehde** September 11, 2022</sup>
I am trying to simplify my argument parsing in clap.
I want to do something like this: 
```
			arg!(-i --interval <SECS> "Seconds to wait between updates, 0 only executes once")
				.required(false)
				.default_value(DEFAULT_INTERVAL)
				.value_parser(value_parser!(f64)),
```
However, most of my arguments are not required (and have a default value), but I don't want to write required(false) every time. Is there an easy way to set required(false) as default for all arguments?</div>
