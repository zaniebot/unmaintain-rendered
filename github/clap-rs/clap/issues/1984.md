# Typo on 'Build Your Own Binary' section at 'README.md'

---

_Issue opened by @ewilazarus on 2020-06-25 12:46_

### Clap version

**branch**: `master`
**Cargo.toml version**: `3.0.0-beta.1`

### Where

[Build Your Own Binary](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/README.md#build-your-own-binary)

### What's wrong

The `README.md` has a typo. On the bullet point at line 413, it is written `* Writer your program as described in the quick example section.`.

### How to fix

Just remove the **R** after **Writer**, so it becomes **Write**. The line 413 should look like `* Write your program as described in the quick example section.` after the change has been applied.
