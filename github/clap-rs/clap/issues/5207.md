### Describe your use case

Other CLIs (ocaml for example) use `-?` in addition to `-h`:

```
arty.exe c -?
Compile into verilog

  arty.exe compile 

=== flags ===

  [-output Output]           . file
  [-help], -?                . print this help text and exit
```

### Describe the solution you'd like

In that case, they don `-?` instead of `-h`. `less` is another example of this.

We are unlikely to run into conflicts with other flags.

However, I don't like the idea of this being a visible alias, in part because I'm unsure about forcing the help item. I also see little value if it were a hidden alias.

I would also be 👎🏻 on this as a default implementation. People can already add `-?` if desired as either a hidden/visible alias or even replace `-h` entirely.
