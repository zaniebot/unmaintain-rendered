# Broken link on CONTRIBUTING.md

---

_Issue opened by @sru on 2015-08-30 19:05_

`conventional` link is broken in CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md

`CONTRIBUTING.md` didn't say anything about message starting with lowercase letter and without dot.

It might be better to have README.md redirect to CONTRIBUTING.md on "How to Contribute" section.

<sub>I am sorry I didn't follow the guidelines.</sub>

I have looked at current convential-changelog repo and found only https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/a5505865ff3dd710cf757f50530e73ef0ca641da/conventions/angular.md

May be we'd better create our own CONVENTIONS file. Or not we, but `clog`

I'm good with linking to that page/commit. Let's just ensure we add a blurb saying something to the effect of, "In addition to the conventions defined above, we also use `imp`, `wip`, etc."
