# Suggestion: Change the output of the `possible_values` help

---

_Issue opened by @phrohdoh on 2018-02-02 03:01_

My suggestion is to change `[values: ...]` to `[possible values: ...]` to match the builder API.

```rust
extern crate clap;
use clap::{App, Arg};

fn main() {
    let matches = App::new("clap_issue_1160")
	.arg(Arg::with_name("myarg").possible_values(&["foo", "bar"]))
	.get_matches();
}
```

```
$ cargo run -- qux
error: 'qux' isn't a valid value for '<myarg>'
	[values: bar, foo]


USAGE:
    clap_issue_1160 [myarg]

For more information try --help
```

```
$ cargo run -- --help
clap_issue_1160

USAGE:
    clap_issue_1160 [myarg]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

ARGS:
    <myarg>     [values: foo, bar]
```

I'm not against this, my only thinking is it makes the lines longer and I try to stick to no wrapping *by default* if possible on 80-100 width terminals. Having said that, if someone is using several values already, they're probably already wrapping.

I can mark this as mentored and a good first issue if someone wants to take a swing at it.
