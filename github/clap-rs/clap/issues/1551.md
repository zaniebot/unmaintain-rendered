# Accept permutations of a required argument

---

_Issue opened by @Matelasse on 2019-09-26 04:14_

### Bug or Feature Request Summary
I have this example use case, in my program I will be accepting 120 arguments, but no more. Ideally, I would want Clap's intelligent suggestions around them, but I don't want to type an array of 120 items, instead I want to type the 6 characters and get all their permutations generated for me. To clarify, an example program needs to accept `abcdef` passed in any order. These are fine: `./program --req abcdef | ./program --req bacdef`, but this is not fine `./program --req abcdefg` (Note that this feature request is exclusively for TOML Clap) 

### Expected Behavior Summary
I want to be able to do this by adding one line like `permuations: "accepted"` or something in the similar fashion.

### Actual Behavior Summary
Now, the programmer would have to resort to filling up an array of `n!` items in TOML, which is not ideal.

----------------------------------------------

This use-case sounds a bit contrived, but nevertheless I believe there exist projects that can benefit from this. Please, let me know your thoughts too and thanks for working on clap.

@Matelasse If you're still interested, could you please explain your use case to us? It sounds like a really rare case and I'm not sure we want to go into it.

I agree. This is very niche. You can use validators to achieve this.

OK, let's be proactive here and close it. @Matelasse , you are free to reopen it.
