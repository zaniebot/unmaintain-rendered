# clap_app!: allow app names and subcommands with hyphens

---

_Issue opened by @g2p on 2018-06-13 06:59_

At the moment dashes cannot be used with the macro.

Follow-up to #321.

It appears to work for app names but not subcommands.

Unfortunately, it is an issue with Rust `macro_rules!`. We use `$ident` and it does not allow `-`.

We could allow `($expr)` along with `$ident` so people can use `clap_app!( ("cool-ap") ...)`

This *is* allowed in 3.x

Closing as solved
