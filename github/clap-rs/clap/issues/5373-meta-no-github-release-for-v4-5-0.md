# [Meta] No github release for `v4.5.0`

_Issue opened by @hasezoey on 2024-02-24 15:40_

I just noticed that there is not github release for tag `v4.5.0`, but there is for `v4.5.1` and before that the last being `v4.4.18`.
But the release exists in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#450---2024-02-08).

Unclear why the [workflow didn't run](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/actions/workflows/post-release.yml).
