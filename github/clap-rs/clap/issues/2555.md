---

_Issue opened by @anatawa12 on 2021-06-20 05:36_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Clap Version

= 3.0.0-beta.2

### Describe your use case

For a subcommand with long documentation, in the `SUBCOMMANDS` list in parent command, I want to show a summary of a command instead of long documentation.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Add an option to show only first line in the documentation on the subcommand's struct or field.
```
/// Simple description
/// 
/// long documentation
#[derive(Clap)]
#[clap(single_line_doc_in_parent_doc)]
pub struct SubcommandOptions {
}
```

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

I'm using #[derive(Clap)] pattern.
