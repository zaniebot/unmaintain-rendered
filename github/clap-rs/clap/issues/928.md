# SSL cert invalid for book.clap.rs

---

_Issue opened by @cardoe on 2017-04-11 00:34_

I see that the certificate was recently renewed per #887 and #890 but it appears that https://book.clap.rs was left off. To compound the issue the site uses HSTS so there's no way to override it temporarily and get to the content.
