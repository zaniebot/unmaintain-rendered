# Auto generate fish completion

---

_Issue opened by @wdv4758h on 2016-07-10 13:56_

As clap support generating Bash completion now, I hope it will have [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) completion, too.
(I'll spend some time trying to implement it :P)

This would be awesome! Zsh is next on my list, followed by Fish. That being said, if I get a PR for Fish or ZSH before I'm able to finish it myself I'll gladly merge :+1:
