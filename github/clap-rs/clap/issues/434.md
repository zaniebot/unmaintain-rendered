# Mysterious failing build on nightly (missing feature 'osstring_simple_functions')

---

_Issue opened by @ketsuban on 2016-02-22 21:18_

My [build is failing](https://travis-ci.org/Ketsuban/rustboyadvance/builds/111059085) on nightly, complaining about a missing feature annotation in clap. The weird thing is that the [previous commit](https://github.com/Ketsuban/rustboyadvance/commit/394c0d7eab4e998ea34d402e2c96e66735235c56), using the nightly from a couple days before with the same version of clap, worked fine and complained only about something in my code which previously was allowed and is being phased out.

I can't rightly tell if this bug is yours or a regression of some sort in the compiler, but I thought it prudent to tell you and let you decide what to do because you're my direct upstream.

https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29453 recently added #433 should fix this.

v2.1.2 on crates.io should fix this for you.
