# Add Arg::hide_default_value()

---

_Issue opened by @TimBednarzyk on 2017-03-14 20:52_

There should be a way to hide the output of `[default: x]` on an option that has a default value, just like how you can hide the output of `[values: x, y, z]` by calling `arg.hide_possible_values(true)` on an argument that has multiple possible values.

Thanks for the suggestion, I agree it's an inconsistency that's easy to fix!
