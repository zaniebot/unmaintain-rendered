# allow value delimiter to be changed

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-11-30 07:37_

Relates to #348 and #352 and requires those to be implemented first.

This would default to `,` (comma), but allow the user to change the value delimiter to any other arbitrary character using something like `Arg::value_delim(char)`

For example, if I wanted to change the delimiter to `;` (semicolon) I could use `Arg::value_delim(';')` and then `val1;val2;val3` would be parsed as 3 values but `val1,val2,val3` would only be parsed as a single value.

Wow, this is very cool! Great idea, I will do at free time closer to end of the month, if it willn't be done.

I will be able to change my custom validation in minesweeper.
