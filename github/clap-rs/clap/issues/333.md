# v1.4.6 has a silent breaking change

---

_Issue opened by @Diggsey on 2015-10-31 16:33_

Starting with v1.4.6, `--version` and `--help` cause the process to exit with a non-zero exit code. This sort of change shouldn't happen on a minor release.

Ah, thanks for reporting this! We'll yank 1.4.6 and put out 1.4.7 :+1:

@Diggsey once #336 merges I'll yank 1.4.6 and post 1.4.7 to crates.io, this was a bug and shouldn't have happened. Thanks again for point this out :+1:
