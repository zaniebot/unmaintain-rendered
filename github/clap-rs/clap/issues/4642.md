### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.1.1

### Describe your use case

I am using `klask` to generate `egui` applications directly from `clap`. This allows me to turn cli applications into native gui apps or webapps for people unfamiliar with the command line. 

However, I find that the names for subcommands benefit from  a longer more descriptive name in the GUI app and on the contrary CLI apps should use shorter names with hyphens which are easier to type out. 

I tried implementing `Display` for the subcommand `enum`, but noticed the macro creates a `Command`s which I cannot implement a custom display for. Thus, it seems I am stuck with only a single name for each command.



### Describe the solution you'd like

This way I could use abbreviations for the cli applications, but the full names for gui applications.
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Parser)]
pub enum Subcommand {
    #[command(name = "mcsf", display_name = "My Special Command Function")]
    MSCF {},
    #[command(name = "subcommand-a", display_name = "Subcommand A")]
    SubcommandA {},
}
```

The problem with this is we have nowhere else to use this display name within clap.

A workaround is we are exploring the idea of [a plugin system](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/3476) where `Command`, `Arg`, etc effectively have an `AnyMap` so the user can attach any data they want and any library on top of clap can read it.  An easy example of this is clap doesn't care about `ValueHint` but `clap_complete` does so we should move it out.

Our main priority atm is styling of help and errors.  Next is either the plugin system or wrapping up some `ArgGroup` work.

Without further input, I'm closing this in favor of the future plugin system.
