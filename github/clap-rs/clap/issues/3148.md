# [A-docs] Numbers of methods of arg and app building in FAQ.md are wrong.

---

_Issue opened by @vi on 2021-12-10 23:26_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [ ] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [ ] I have searched the existing issues

### Rust Version

Not applicable

### Clap Version

v3.0.0-rc.4

### Minimal reproducible code

Not applicable

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

Look at https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.0.0-rc.4/docs/FAQ.md, linked from README:

> To build an App there are three [?]:
>
>  * Derive Macros
>  *  Builder Pattern
>
> To build an Arg there are four [?]:
>
>  *  Derive Macros
>  *  Builder Pattern


### Actual Behaviour

`FAQ.md`'s app and arg creation lists' introductory phrases are contradictory, probably leftover from Clap v2.

### Expected Behaviour

FAQ does not contain phrases that are not play well with actual content in it.

### Additional Context

_No response_

### Debug Output

_No response_
