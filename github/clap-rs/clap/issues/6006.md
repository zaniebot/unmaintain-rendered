### Clap Version

4.5

### Describe your use case

Dear clap team, 

I am wondering whether it makes sense to add a citation option so that when software packages are itself a paper, we can put the original paper citation there, just like the version. Thanks!

### Describe the solution you'd like

similar to that of .version("v0.1.0")

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

We provide ways for users to customize version and help today.

Could you help me in what way built-in support would be a benefit?
