# allow disabling the `-h` short help flag without disabling the long one (`--help`)

_Issue opened by @lovasoa on 2023-10-04 20:16_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.4.6

### Describe your use case

I am porting [dezoomify-rs](https://dezoomify-rs.ophir.dev/) from structopt to clap. 

dezoomify has a `--help` argument, but `-h` is a shortcut for `--max-height` and should not display a help message.

[`Command::disable_help_flag(true)`](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/struct.Command.html#method.disable_help_flag) disables **both** `-h` **and** `--help`.



### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be nice to have a separate `Command::disable_short_help_flag` and `Command::disable_long_help_flag`

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

_No response_

We used to have a lot of fancy ways of taking care of this on your behalf but they caused poor performance and clogged up the API.

The expected behavior for this is to `disable_help_flag(true)` and then to define your own help flag with `ArgAction::Help`.

As this is expected behavior, I'm going to close this.  If there is a reason we should re-evaluate that, let us know!

I understand the reasoning. Maybe a little help should be added to the documentation of `disable_short_help_flag` about that, with an example of how to do instead ? Starting from the derive documentation, it took me a lot of time to figure out what to do in my case.

People have wanted examples but haven't quite found the right place.  I think you are right that `disable_help_flag` is the right place for this.  Adding it in #5160.
