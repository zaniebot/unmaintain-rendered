# Easier way to create Arg only instance from YAML

---

_Issue opened by @cstyan on 2016-04-20 23:42_

Re: our discussion in gitter, it would be nice if there was an easier way to create an arg only instance from a YAML file. 

Though this technically would be unnecessary if Arg's were accessible after being added to an App instance, or if all Arg struct fields (in my case, validator) could be set via the YAML file.

@cstyan apologies on the delay, I've been out of town. I should have this implemented soon as we discussed.
