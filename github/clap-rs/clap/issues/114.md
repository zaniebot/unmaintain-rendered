# Groups with groups as members get overwritten by child group members

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-05-09 16:12_

I.e.

```
parent_group: "arg1", "arg2", "arg3", "group2"
group2: "arg4", "arg5"
```

If `parent_group` needed to be displayed in the usage it would only show `arg4, arg5` **not** `arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5`
