# 4.5.10 release notes?

---

_Issue opened by @mistydemeo on 2024-07-24 16:22_

It looks like v4.5.10 was created without release notes: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/releases/tag/v4.5.10

The changelog entry is empty too. Was this a mistake? Is there a list of this release's changes available?

For internal or superficial changes, I don't always write out release notes which is what happened here.

I think it would help to have a little note such as "No significant changes" so people know it isn't a mistake!
