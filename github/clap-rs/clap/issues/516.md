# After Help and Before Help Issues

---

_Issue opened by @mitsuhiko on 2016-05-29 16:28_

Things I noticed
- [x] Currently `before_help` does not seem to do anything for subcommands
- [x] `after_help` does not render a leading newline
- [x] `after_help` is not wrapped at the terminal width
- [x] `before_help` is not wrapped at terminal width

Numbers 1 and 2 should be fixed with #517 I'll do the third as I get time over this trip or as soon as I get home.
