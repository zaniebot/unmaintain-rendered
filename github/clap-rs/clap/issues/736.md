# Validator syntax for clap_app!() macro / usage strings seems to be poorly documented

---

_Issue opened by @flo-l on 2016-11-11 13:06_

Maybe I'm missing something, but it took me some time to stumble upon #217, which mentions the syntax `{validator_fn}`.

Neither the [validator example](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/master/examples/15_custom_validator.rs), nor the [macro example](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/master/examples/01c_quick_example.rs) mention validator syntax for the macro. I think at least the macro usage example should include validator syntax.

I was subconsciously looking for a full guide explaining either all features the clap_app! macro offers, or how to translate the (very well documented) builder pattern examples to the macro syntax. If somebody provided me with the needed information I'd be more than happy to write it out in full sentences and open a pull request!

Thanks for bringing this up! You're right, the macro version isn't documented well at all. This is partly due to the fact the macros were unstable for a time and only recently stabilized. We had some potential breaking changes in mind, but ultimately decided against them for the time being.

Unfortunately I don't have anything to point to that specifically spells out all the details. Nor do I have a good place to put it, minus just throwing everything into the `clap_app!` docs, which seems messy. I think what _may_ end up happening is adding a block at each of the corresponding builder pattern docs which says something like, "the syntax to use this feature with the macros is `x`"

This will probably be a little by little improvement though, and I welcome any and all PRs on the matter!
