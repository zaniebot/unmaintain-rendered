Cow works by offering both the `&'static str` and the owned `String`.

Alternatively we can keep the `&'a` for the `App` and `Arg` contexts however, when handling strings, we own them as the consumer hands their ownership over directly.

I'm game for it, let's try and it see how it works out! Worst case scenario, we have a concept to shelf for a future iteration :+1:

@kbknapp I did try it, and reverted it to `&'a` See my rewrite revision history, it was once ... very cow friendly. :D
