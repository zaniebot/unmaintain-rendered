# Implement multiple subcommands at once

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-04-29 03:34_

Currently only one sub-command may be used per match. For example:
Assume `myapp` has two subcommands `one` and `two`, and each of those has `subone` and `subtwo` respectively. 

```
myapp
    |-one
    |   |-subone
    |-two
        |-subtwo
```

Meaning currently you can only run the following permutations

```
$ myapp one
$ myapp one subone
$ myapp two
$ myapp two subtwo
```

This issue proposes using a `..` syntax to mean "Back up one level" meaning you could then add these additional permutations to valid uses

```
$ myapp one ..two
$ myapp two ..one
$ myapp two subtwo ..one
$ myapp two subtwo ..one subone
$ myapp two ..one subone
$ myapp one ..two subtwo
$ myapp one subone ..two
$ myapp one subone ..two subtwo
```

This could also lead to `....` meaning up three levels or any multiple of `..` adding an additional level.

This will be labeled `maybe` because I'm unsure of _why_ would need something like this other than combining multiple invocations of a program into a single call... I'll think on this one for a bit and see how it turns out.

Is this feature still feasible with the current `clap` architecture? If so, is the proposed design the best choice?
I really need this feature and I am willing to contribute to the project. Where do I start?

would also love this feature.
especially since implementing a workaround is not that easy (I tried)

For some weird reason I did not think to search issues here before posting a similar question on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ci2r3d/multiple_subcommands_with_structoptclap/

Does the "wont do" label refer to the particular way it was thought of in the OP or will there never be an option of parsing multiple subcommands?

I don't have time to implement it myself anymore but perhaps @kbknapp is open to accept a PR from some willingness person?

This issue was from 4 years back. I'd suggest create a new issue so that we can discuss it again. Or if you wish and have time, feel free to go ahead and implement it (on v3-master)
