# subcommands with hidden aliases show a visible '|' after the name

---

_Issue opened by @joshtriplett on 2016-06-12 21:39_

If a subcommand has a hidden alias, but no visible alias, it shows up as `cmd|` in help.

Thanks for pointing this out. This should be fixed with #526 
I'll add some tests for prevent this as well.
