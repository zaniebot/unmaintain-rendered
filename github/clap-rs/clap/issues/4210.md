### Clap Version

4.0.0

### Describe your use case

When I flatten an struct, I'd like to be able to refer to all members of that struct for relations between arguments

### Describe the solution you'd like

Implicitly create an `ArgGroup` with the type's name that contains all of the struct members, including the group from a flattened field

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

This lays the ground work for #2621
