# Disable Magical Version Handling

---

_Issue opened by @mitsuhiko on 2016-05-28 19:25_

Currently you cannot implement `--version` yourself and what's worse is that you cannot disable the short alias for it (`-V`), you can only bind it to a different letter.

What i want is to not have version info at all on arguments and implement `--version` myself as i want to short some license info there as well.

Currently if you disable the version flag with the setting and you add your own `--version`, clap starts handling it again and brings up it's own version screen.

I agree this would be a good change, I came across something I wanted to do muslef like this as well. I'll post back here as I start getting this implemented. 👍

#517 fixes this. Now you'd just need to specify an arg with a long of `version` which effectively disables the auto-generated one (to include the short).
