# Website is not linking back to github repo

---

_Issue opened by @erdii on 2020-05-27 12:40_

Nice community work here btw!

### Clap version

---

### Where

[https://clap.rs](https://clap.rs)

### What's wrong

The website https://clap.rs/ does not include a link to this github repo (at least I couldn't find it).

### How to fix

Maybe you can add one or more links so that people can come here :)
I'd suggest one link in the site footer, next to the other social media icons. and at least one that is more prominent.

I will actually commandeer this issue to discuss a much need refactor of our website clap.rs

I would take inspiration from https://diesel.rs. @CreepySkeleton has been wanting to write some guides which we can host there too.

A good project needs to have 4 kinds of documentation as described [here](https://documentation.divio.com/). We already have the "Reference" at docs.rs. So, let's host the other stuff on the website. We could use zola and docs folder in this repo to auto deploy and stuff.

@kbknapp Would love to hear your thoughts too.

I'm fine with someone working on a refactor. I just don't personally have time to work on it. The current implementation is just a barebones wordpress site. It *used* to have a lot more content, but due to some shenanigans the old site was lost and I stood up just a bare bones version.

I'll fix the link on the current site so we can close this issue, but I'm good with opening an issue to refactor the site.

Potentially of note here is that the Wordpress installation on https://clap.rs appears to be compromised - https://clap.rs/?page_id=46 for example seems like spam?

Hm, I don't see any spam there, but rather a stub:

Probably related to

At minimum, the quick links at the top of every page should link to:

* This repository
* [Documentation](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.3/clap/)
* [The crate on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/clap)

If somebody wants to volunteer on working on redesigning clap.rs website, I think nobody here would object to that. We also need to involve Kevin, I think.

I have a working multilingual zola website template we can use for clap.rs. Once we deploy to GitHub pages, we can point the domain to there.

Hey! I'm happy to take a look at this one. I have some spare cycles and can look into providing some content to put on the site. Things like a basic getting started guide as well as some examples and tutorials.

A lot of what's currently in the repository can potentially be migrated over to the site. Things like the FAQ and the quick examples are good starting points.

I have some experience with maintaining multilingual sites on hugo as well - https://helm.sh/docs/ is multi-lingual.

If there are areas of focus you'd like newer community members to take a closer look, please feel free to point me in the right direction.

Out of curiosity... Is https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/v3_occ_vs_vals.md and https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/v3_warn_cases.md still relevant today? It hasn't been updated in 3 years, and I don't fully understand the context behind those documents. They look like quick notes jotted down as a reminder about some of clap's behaviour. I'm curious if that should be expanded to explain some of clap's internals.

IIRC I left them there because we need to include notes about them in the 3.0 release news.

---

_Comment by @pksunkara on 2021-11-06 10:48_

I am going to close this issue since it's done, but let's continue the discussion.

Multi-lingual is not an issue. I already have a skeleton that I can add in here. We just don't have any translators for now to actually add content to it.

There's no tutorial and/or understanding section on our site right now. You can add it if you want.

But https://clap.rs/cookbook/ is the "how-to" section. Feel free to send PRs to any of them.
