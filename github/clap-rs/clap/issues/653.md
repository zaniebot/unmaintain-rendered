_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2016-09-10 15:58_

Similar to the default, except that even when term size can be determined don't go above `max`

As in #639 or?

Right now if the term size can't be determined it defaults to 120. But if the term size _can_ be determined and it's really big (I.e. I use a full screen term most of the time), I'd like the ability to say if the term size is huge go ahead and wrap at 120 or whatever number.

IOW force term width override?

Kind of, I don't want to say always wrap at a specific width because the width may be smaller which would create weird line breaks. I want to say wrap at x width unless it's smaller then wrap there instead
