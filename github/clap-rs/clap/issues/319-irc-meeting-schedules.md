# IRC meeting schedules

---

_Issue opened by @WildCryptoFox on 2015-10-19 08:05_

Considering the attempt for an IRC channel wasn't all that successful. How about a more scheduled meeting? The channel remains open for any discussion at any time regardless on scheduled discussions. I have been the only member for the past 11 days.

I personally have nothing urgent to discuss.

`irc.mozilla.org:6697 +ssl #clap-rs`
## Possible schedule times

Weekends?

We are all in different time zones. So we need to choose time, too.

Yeah, I've been swamped with work and class lately :( I'm going to try and start idling in there more often. Weekends work best for me, but perhaps for the time being we just create an issue here to schedule a meeting (at the pre-determined time) if we have something to discuss. I.e. if there isn't something that needs to be discussed for a week, no issue is created.
