# multiple_values() documentation wrong

---

_Issue opened by @intgr on 2020-04-15 22:51_

### Clap version

master branch (d210b9fcedba48c997e8e83ce06f0c18dacb8d55)

### Where

https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/src/build/arg/mod.rs#L3729-L3777

### What's wrong

The `Arg::multiple_values()` method doc talks about **empty values** instead (?!) is this a copy-paste error?
```rust
/// Allows an argument to accept explicitly empty values. An empty value must be specified at
/// the command line with an explicit `""`, `''`, or `--option=`
```

PS: I also find the distinction between `MultipleValues` and `MultipleOccurrences` very confusing and not well documented, I don't understand enough to do it myself.

I've started a branch (v3-docs) where I'm trying to go through and finally knock out some of these docs issues and update all the examples and such.
