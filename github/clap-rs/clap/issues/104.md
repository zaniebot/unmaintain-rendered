# Allow case insensitivity in arg_enum! macro

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-05-05 13:24_

Currently if you use `arg_enum!` to create possible values into an enum, you must either allow non-camel-case enum variants (to suppress the warning), or force users to start their possible values with an upper case character. For example, if you had a `--mode` which accepted an `arg_enum!` of

``` rust
arg_enum! {
    enum {
        Vi,
        Emacs
    }
}
```

The user must use `$ myprog --mode Vi` which isn't optimal. This enum should be able to match `vi` _or_ `Vi`.

Simply converting to lowercase is also a very tricky subject if `utf-8` is to be supported. But being, I don't use any non-ascii characters on a regular basis, I'm unfamiliar with capital/lowercase unicode graphemes.
