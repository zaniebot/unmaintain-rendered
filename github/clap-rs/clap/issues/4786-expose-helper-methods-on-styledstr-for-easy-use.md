# Expose helper methods on `StyledStr` for easy use by consumers

_Issue opened by @pdaoust on 2023-03-24 20:03_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

master

### Describe your use case

Sometimes there's a desire to create extra help text (e.g., in `before_help`) that's similar in structure to the autogenerated help text but written by hand. By 'similar in structure' I mean that, for example, headers/literals match the colours of autogenerated headers/literals and multi-line text is wrapped and indented properly.

There's already PR #4765 to allow `StyledStr` to accept user-styled text and output the proper escape symbols for the execution context. The advantage of using the already existing helpers is that it's durable to changes -- if the maintainers of clap decide to change headers from yellow/uppercase to blue/title-case, the manually written text will change too.

I'd be happy to submit a PR for this, but thought I'd open it as an issue in case discussion should happen first.

### Describe the solution you'd like

`StyledStr::header()`, `::literal()`, `::warning()`, `::trim()`, `::indent()`, and so forth are exposed as public members of the impl and are made available to projects that depend on the `clap` crate.

### Alternatives, if applicable

The existing API won't work when we move forward with #3234, so I'm going to close this as Not Planned,.  If there is a reason for us to re-evaluate this, let us know!
