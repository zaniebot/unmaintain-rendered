# Arguments with default values conflict 

---

_Issue opened by @Dylan-DPC-zz on 2019-12-09 13:51_



This [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=9913e0f7a7905f7be0131ae53ef4ec63) contains a slightly modified version of the test case introduced in f7a695523844962f9c6fda65b139b693a232e18e. The main difference to the original is that I moved the `conflicts_with` option to the the same argument, which also uses the `default` option. This should result in the same behavior but instead results in an error as soon as `-f` or `--flag` is passed.

**Known Workaround**: Split `default` and `conflicts_with` between the two arguments.
