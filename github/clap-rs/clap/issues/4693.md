### Clap Version

4.1.1

### Describe your use case

Auto-generate completions for a python shell [Xonsh](https://xon.sh) in a Runtime Executor [rtx](https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx) (asdf rust clone) just like for other shells


### Describe the solution you'd like

Xonsh is added to the list of shells that allow completion generations

This is how it's currently done in rtx

https://github.com/jdxcode/rtx/blob/067ba808a14e061e6fb53d7ec144ae88d79eff6d/src/cli/complete.rs#L9-L28
