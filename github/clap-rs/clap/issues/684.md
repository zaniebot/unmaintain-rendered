Thanks for taking the time to do a detailed write up! I'm aware of this issue, it was reported in #638 as well. Unfortunately I haven't been able to put much time into solving it. Perhaps using `$crate` in the macros would work? I'll have to do some testing as I'm not a macro guru by any means.

I'm going to close this issue, but copy over your detailed comments to #638.
