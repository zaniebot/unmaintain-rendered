# Incorrect documentation for `derive(Clap)` example

---

_Issue opened by @tiziano88 on 2020-01-22 22:49_

I have just came across `clap`, and the first thing I tried was to use the `derive(Clap)` feature from the README, but it seems that is not actually working, and also the README mentions `examples/01d_quick_example.rs`, which does not seem to exist.

My guess is that this is either a new feature, or a deprecated one, but I cannot tell which one.

It's a very very new feature that is work-in-progress. Don't look at those examples, they are not polished yet. Also we are about to rework the derive so it may become a little bit different from what's in the examples. Clap v3-beta will be released by the end of the month, you'll see the kind-of-final version then.
