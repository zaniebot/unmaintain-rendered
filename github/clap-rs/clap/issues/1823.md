# Rename Arg::help to Arg::about

---

_Issue opened by @pksunkara on 2020-04-14 17:07_

Rename `Arg::help` to `Arg::about` to make it consistent with `App`. Similarly `Arg::long_help`. Also rename the respective field names.

Hey @pksunkara, Can I take this up?

---

_Comment by @CreepySkeleton on 2020-04-14 20:55_

@creativcoder Sure, go ahead!

I don't see the point of renaming this, it will be another change for a user upgrading from 2.x land to 3.x without much reason.

There is much reason because `help` in `App` is different semantically than `help` in `Arg` which would end up confusing the users. This should fix it and make it consistent.

As a compromise, we can rename it but leave the old `help`, deprecating it.

Help is more synonymous with CLIs and the usage is understood. I don't see the value of this tbh

Help is about the full help message. About concerns only the description.

I don't want to keep `Arg::help` behaviour the same and keep it deprecated. I want to make it similar to how `App::help` behaves, by making it replace the full help text of an argument rather than the generated one.

The generated help contains other things like possible values, default values etc.. which should completely be replaced if `help` was specified.

So, you are going to change the behavior of a very frequently used function without changing its signature. If you ask me - or don't, but I'll tell you anyway - this is spectacularly bad idea. Just because old habits die *hard*. This will spread a lot of confusion among users, a lot more than the benefit from having the API unified will ever be. If you want to pull such a drastic change - rename the method.

For the record - I kind of see Dylan's point. People are already got used to about/help difference. But I also see why we may want to make the API consistent. 

My call - let's ask for forgiveness, not for permission. We do this, we push the beta outdoors, receive feedback, revert if the feedback turns out to be largely negative.

I agree which is why it took me such a long time to create the issue. I had been thinking about this since I started working on clap. It kept bothering me that the help related stuff is very inconsistent between `App` and `Arg`. I want to do a `HelpBase` which extracts the common stuff and make it customisable.

I've had some first-hand confusion over this change and have started https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2937 about the specific problem I had, while trying to acknowledge all of the other needs.  Hopefully we can find a good solution.
