### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)

### Clap Version

n/a

### Where?

https://clap.rs/

### What's wrong?

The "cheatsheet" and "cookbook" pages on https://clap.rs/ do not work

Both briefly go to their relevant URL's, then immediately redirect to `/`

```
$ curl https://clap.rs/cheatsheet
<script>
  window.location = 'https://clap.rs';
</script>
```

### How to fix?
