# ColoredHelp global_setting only goes one level deep

---

_Issue opened by @clux on 2016-09-01 16:34_

Similar to #519 - but now on clap 2.11.0.

``` rs
App::new("foo")
        .setting(AppSettings::ColoredHelp)
        .global_settings(&[AppSettings::ColoredHelp])
        .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name("bar")
            .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name("baz")))
```

``` sh
foo -h # colored
foo bar -h # colored
foo bar baz -h # uncolored
```
