# Deprecate and remove `Parser::update_from`?

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2023-06-19 17:18_

`Parser::update_from` and related functions were introduced into the derive API in clap v3 (ie they didn't exist in structopt).  They required a lot of work to get the basic semantics down for 3.0.0 (#2212, #2605) and since have continued to have issues for it (#4501, #4617, see also #3924).

However, it does seem like this does not have impact on build time or binary size which I had assumed it would.

#4975 is the branch I used for testing binary size and build time of  `--example git-derive`
