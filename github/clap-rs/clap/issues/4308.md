_Issue opened by @SUPERCILEX on 2022-09-30 18:01_

- Help fiddlings like [this](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1127#issuecomment-1263580821) should be in the cookbook.
  - This is probably also a good place to show `max_term_width = 100` and `wrap_help` since everyone is going to want that.
- An example of the old help template should be in the cookbook.
- The changelog doesn't say that errors were moved to `error` module
- The crate_authors link here is broken: https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.author
  - There's also no explanation of where this goes now that it isn't in the default template
- As far as I can tell, adding the `color` feature doesn't do anything anymore
- A bunch of methods (e.g. https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.ignore_errors) talk about `global_setting` without explaining what it is (but I also don't think it exists anymore)

> Help fiddlings like https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1127#issuecomment-1263580821 should be in the cookbook.

I feel like knowing what and how we want to cover it might take some more exploring.  Could you create a separate issue.  Generally, rollup issues like this are [unhelpful](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3418#issuecomment-1054510326) and its better create dedicated issues but I went ahead and took care of the rest of the items in #4309

> An example of the old help template should be in the cookbook.

Good idea.  Instead of the cookbook though, I've put it in the docs for `Command::help_template`

> The changelog doesn't say that errors were moved to error module

Huh. looks like I missed some deprecation attributes in v3 which we were relying on for some of these changes.

> The crate_authors link here is broken

Thanks.  We were relying on intra-doc links to keep things up-to-date but there were a couple of direct links still left

> There's also no explanation of where this goes now that it isn't in the default template

Added a note about it

> As far as I can tell, adding the color feature doesn't do anything anymore

As you can [see](https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/pull/2196#discussion_r983029367), the color feature does still do stuff though [help is more using other terminal styling than color](https://epage.github.io/blog/2022/09/clap4/#polishing-help-output) but we generally mean all terminal styling with "color".  https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4132 has more discussion on the switch from the colors in `--help`

> A bunch of methods 

Thanks!  Bad copy/paste since we first created these methods.

As #4309 is merged and the remaining item needs its own issue, I'm going to go ahead and close this out.
