# warning: unused variable and non-snake case filename on examples

---

_Issue opened by @sru on 2015-08-30 04:16_

Cargo spews out ~20 different warnings on examples when building tests. It doesn't on `cargo build` though.

Yeah I just haven't got around to changing the names to proper snake case yet :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
