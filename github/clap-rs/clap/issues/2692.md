# Make sure positionals have `MultipleOccurrences` set rather than `MultipleValues`

---

_Issue opened by @pksunkara on 2021-08-13 23:17_

Currently, positionals use `MultipleValues` during building of the arg and parsing. We need to change that to rely on `MultipleOccurrences`

Could you clarify which cases you are referring to?

---

_Comment by @pksunkara on 2021-08-18 08:55_

Hmm.. all the code whenever dealing with positionals which are multiple? Not exactly sure what you are asking.

---

_Comment by @epage on 2021-08-18 14:42_

Can you point me to a specific example?

Examples:

1. https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/5580e8c4657dea6ac085ce76102c3aefe5f33d81/src/parse/parser.rs#L182

I'd have to dig in deeper, those might still be valid cases for multiple values.

Yeah, they might be valid use cases, but I was just show casing that we need to use the `MultipleOccurrences` as the main setting to imply that a positional can be used multiple times.

I'm not aware of any work remaining on this issue once we merge #2978, #2977, and #2984, 

Does anyone want to double check or should we go ahead and close this out once those are merged?

(of course we might find more things, like as I work on my experiments for #1772 but those can be responded to as they come up rather than keeping this open without a clear end goal).

I will double check over the weekend and close this of there is nothing else.

---

_Comment by @pksunkara on 2021-11-04 08:58_

Double checked and everything looks good.
