# Automatic version and author based on Cargo.toml values

---

_Issue opened by @olalonde on 2020-03-12 04:15_

I'm not sure if this is possible with macros (Rust noob), but it would be nice if it was possible to automatically set the version and author from the value present in `Cargo.toml`.

For anyone else coming across this, you probably want [app_from_crate](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.3/clap/macro.app_from_crate.html), or one of the other similar macros.
