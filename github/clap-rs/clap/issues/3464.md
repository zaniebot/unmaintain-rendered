There is a cost to each feature flag we create (e.g. code complexity; bloating of documentation, making it harder to find relevant information).

I wonder if we are getting the desired value out of having an `env` feature flag and if we should deprecate it.

I think we would probably need to decide how exactly we are going to make clap modular before deprecating this. We don't want to increase the churn by redoing this later.
