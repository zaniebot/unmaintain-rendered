<!--
Please use the following template to assist with creating an issue and to ensure a speedy resolution. If an area is not applicable, feel free to delete the area or mark with `N/A`
-->

### Rust Version
rustc 1.46.0

### Affected Version of clap
3.0.0-beta.1

### Expected Behavior Summary
Provide possibility to overwrite how the `--version` argument is handled.

### Actual Behavior Summary
Clap prints version prefixed with binary name even if I specify `version` as an argument and handle it myself.

### Steps to Reproduce the issue
Run the example

### Sample Code or Link to Sample Code
```rust
use clap::Clap;

#[derive(Clap)]
#[clap(author = "Author", name = "example")]
struct Opts {
    /// Print version and exit
    #[clap(short, long)]
    version: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let opts = Opts::parse();

    if opts.version {
        println!("TEST_VERSION");
    }
}

```

Running `example -v` prints `example` and not `TEST_VERSION`
