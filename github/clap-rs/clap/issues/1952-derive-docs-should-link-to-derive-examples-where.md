# derive docs should link to derive/examples, where all the docs are

---

_Issue opened by @FauxFaux on 2020-05-30 20:29_

### Clap version

3.0.0-beta.1

### Where

Readme, module docs, docs.rs homepage.

### What's wrong

All of the docs for derive appear to be in the examples folder, which you have to know is different to the main examples folder, and that it follows a different strategy. The docs for the derive module are not useful.

Please link https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/clap_derive/examples from everywhere. Or merge the "main" examples with the derive examples?

Yeah, we know about it. And about a million of other things. We will be sweeping through the documentation when the time comes, but right now we're preoccupied with other stuff to deal with.

I'm closing this particular issue in favor of #1652 , but if you could give us a hand and fix a link or two, we would very much appreciate it!
