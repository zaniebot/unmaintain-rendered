# AppSettings doesn't implement BitOr

---

_Issue opened by @jplatte on 2021-08-17 13:15_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Rust Version

rustc 1.54.0 (a178d0322 2021-07-26)

### Clap Version

3.0.0-beta.4

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
use clap::{App, AppSettings};

fn main() {
    let _app = App::new("foo")
        .setting(AppSettings::DeriveDisplayOrder | AppSettings::UnifiedHelpMessage);
}
```


### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

cargo check

### Actual Behaviour

Doesn't compile, `AppSettings` doesn't implement `std::ops::BitOr`.

### Expected Behaviour

Should compile, `CHANGELOG.md` says that `.settings(&[Setting1, Setting2])` was removed in favor of `.setting(Setting1 | Setting2)`.

### Additional Context

_No response_

### Debug Output

_No response_

I only saw in the `CHANGELOG.md`:
 
> Arg::settings in favor of Arg::setting(Setting1 | Setting2)

But neither ArgSettings or AppSettings impl it
- https://docs.rs/clap/3.0.0-beta.4/clap/enum.AppSettings.html
- https://docs.rs/clap/3.0.0-beta.4/clap/enum.ArgSettings.html

I've not dug through the history yet to see if this is something else we lost between branches.

However, I was proposing that we remove `Settings` in favor of functions, see https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2607

@pksunkara this is for 3.0.   We either need to
- Decide `setting` is good enough
- Add back `settings`
- Find the original `|` work and add it back in

Combined with deciding if we will deprecate or obsolete settings in favor of functions. 
- If we obsolete, there is nothing to be done, because settings will be removed
- If we deprecate, then I recommend we go with `settings` since its easy to add back in and keeps the 2-3 migration effort low
