# Please factor terminal dimensions code into a crate

---

_Issue opened by @joshtriplett on 2016-06-29 23:14_

clap's `src/term.rs` provides functions to detect the terminal size on either Windows or POSIX systems.  I'd love to have a crate providing those functions, for use in applications other than clap.
