# Re-evaluate shells included by default

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2025-10-30 14:42_

When does it make sense for a shell to be included by default?

Considerings
- Levels of support for native completions, #3166
- #5729
- Levels of use of the shells https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/5880#discussioncomment-14821780
