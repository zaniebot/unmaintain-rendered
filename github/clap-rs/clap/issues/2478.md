As your GitHub repo for your website is marked as archived, I hope this is the correct place to raise this issue.

I found this issue and went to file an issue a minute ago and then I found this. I think that this is the right place - this site code is in this repo. I can see this problem in edge (new), firefox, firefox dev, firefox nightly, chrome canary, etc. This is not a browser-specific issue. Also, the cheatsheet link just redirects back to the home page.

Yeah, it's heavily WIP. I have been meaning to add a little "Getting started" blurb. Should be done by this week.
