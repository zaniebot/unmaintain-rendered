# load from YAML dynamically

---

_Issue opened by @whoizit on 2018-09-17 02:42_

Just a question.
Can I load YAML file dynamically, without recompilation?

Ok, I have a answer from Russian community. Just I shouldn't use load_yaml!
from
```
let yml = load_yaml!("17_yaml.yml");
let m = App::from_yaml(yml).get_matches();
```
to
```
let yml = "17_yaml.yml";
let m = App::from_yaml(yml).get_matches();
```
or something like that
