# Bring coverage back up

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2016-10-29 15:13_

Coverage (via coveralls.io) has fallen by the wayside, we need to bring it back up!

`assert_eq!(`[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/kbknapp/clap-rs/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/kbknapp/clap-rs?branch=master)`, >= 80%);`

According to one of the latest PRs, it was actually 91%. I'll reopen this one the master push reports it's numbers if it's below 80%.
