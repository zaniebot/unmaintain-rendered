# Pass `String` to `description`

---

_Issue opened by @jmaargh on 2018-08-28 18:06_

How do I send a heap `String` to `App::description`?

### Rust Version and Affected Version of clap

Rust 2018 from the playground

### Bug Summary

Can't pass a `String` either by-value or by borrow to `about`. Error message:

```
error[E0277]: the trait bound `&str: std::convert::From<&std::string::String>` is not satisfied
  --> src/main.rs:12:34
   |
12 |     let matches = App::new(NAME).about(&description).get_matches();
   |                                  ^^^^^ the trait `std::convert::From<&std::string::String>` is not implemented for `&str`
   |
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::convert::Into<&str>` for `&std::string::String`
```

You can either call [`as_str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.as_str):

```rust
let matches = App::new(NAME).about(description.as_str()).get_matches();
```

or use `&*` ([which is now suggested by rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/59268)):

```rust
let matches = App::new(NAME).about(&*description).get_matches();
```

I'm trying to understand why the API use `Into<&str>` in the first place. Do you have any references ? @JD557
