# Option flags appear in random order in --help

---

_Issue opened by @ghost on 2015-04-05 06:33_

Windows 7 64 bit
Rust 1.0.0-beta 64 bit (9854143cb)
clap 0.5.11

Invoking --help many times results in randomly ordered flags

Yeah this was by design from not sorting the options as I wasn't sure about what performance impact that would have. But since its also been causing issues with #4 I think I'm going to implement it.

Give me a day and I'll push this in 0.5.12 once a have a second to add it. 

Thanks for taking the time to file the issue :)

Just to elaborate a little too, the help info is generated lazily only when `--help` (or by default `-h` unless the dev specifys their own `-h`) is found, so the performance isn't too big of a concern at that point. Once I have this implemented I'll post back.

This is closed with #63 (v0.5.12 on crates.io or f4b2bf5 on master).

Arguments are sorted by name, this side steps some of the mess from determining if sorting by shorts, longs, names, or ones that have shorts but no longs and vice-versa, etc. But it allows the help-info to stay constant between runs which will be a big plus for #4

Thanks :)

The name sort does seem the most reasonable since it allows users of clap to group relevant flags regardless of the short/long flags.
