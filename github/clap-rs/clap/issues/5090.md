# Update documentation for `arg` attribute

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.4.0

### Describe your use case

I've been porting a CLI application from clap ~2, to 4.4.0 with the goal being struct based arguments through derives.
One of the tests showed the change in behavior of `--flag val1 val2`, currently known as `num_args`.
It was impossible to find an example usage of this for derive-style in examples and docs.

I finally managed to find it through a lucky comment in [this discussion](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4998#discussioncomment-6681330), but knowing this and browsing the repository again, it revealed that this parameter is only mentioned a few times.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Ideally there'd be docs and examples for every parameter `arg` (possibly other) macro accepts, so at least creating issues to add those examples would help a bit.

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

I'm not well versed in `clap`, this has been my first usage of it in a project.

At this time we intentionally document how to use builder methods within the derive and only explicitly document attributes that have special meaning outside of the derive API.

#4090 is where we are discussing how this could be better communicated or improved.  Closing in favor of that.
