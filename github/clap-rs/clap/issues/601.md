# Docs incorrect about ArgGroups in YAML

---

_Issue opened by @laishulu on 2016-07-25 06:05_

with the following yaml file, when I invoke `myapp` without any arguments, it just passes.
But according to the spec, at least one of `base` and `delta` should be presented.
Also, I don't find anything about the arg group when I invoke `myapp help`

``` yaml
name: myapp
version: 0.1
about: myapp
global_settings:
    - ColoredHelp
args:
    - base:
        long: base
        value_name: BASE
        help: Base
        takes_value: true
        display_order: 2
    - delta:
        long: delta
        value_name: DELTA
        help: delta
        takes_value: true
        display_order: 3
arg_groups:
    - test:
        args:
            - base
            - delta
        required: true
```

Oh, I found if use `goups` instead of `arg_groups`, then it works.
but the document and examples (https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/master/examples/17_yaml.yml#L87)  should be updated.

Ah thank you for pointing this out! This was a change between v1 to v2.
