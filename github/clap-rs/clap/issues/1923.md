ef92e2b is not implemented on v3, but I also don't have strong feelings about it. It changes the error message when `suggestions` are enabled. The old v2 and current v3 implementation will suggest a subcommand with the appropriate args even when no subcommand is used. Whereas that commit only suggest a subcommand when that subcommand is used.

I think the current v3 (and old v2) is fine, but if we want to cherry pick it across (and I'm not sure it can be cleaning picked) that's fine too.
