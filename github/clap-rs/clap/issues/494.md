# Default help for "help" subcommand longer than 80 columns

---

_Issue opened by @joshtriplett on 2016-05-05 00:03_

The help for the "help" subcommand runs longer than 80 columns:

```
    help        Prints this message or the help message of the given subcommand(s)
```

I'd suggest changing "message of the" to "help for the".

I agree, we could also pull off the `(s)` as well. Thanks for filing! :+1: I'll either put this in once I get home, or if someone wants [an easy PR by changing this line](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/dae2d93bdd5d1bf1094acc23ecb8c23f8bb27776/src/app/parser.rs#L822) this could be one :wink:

One would also need to look through the tests and ensure those lines are changed too :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
