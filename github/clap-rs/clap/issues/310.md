# Short option arguments

---

_Issue opened by @birkenfeld on 2015-10-05 19:28_

In most option parsers that restrict single-dash options to one char, you can give arguments to short options in the same word, i.e.

```
grep -iC2 src *
```

clap doesn't allow this, which is kind of surprising.

It's a recent addition. It hasn't made into Cargo yet. See https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/277#issuecomment-145270842

Ah, excellent! Then this can be closed I guess?

We'll leave this open until 1.4.4 gets published to crates.io (which you can track via milestones) :smile:

@birkenfeld until then, the current master branch supports this feature :wink:

1.4.4 is out on crates.io, but due to a bug I'd wait until 1.4.5 is out (sometime today) before upgrading.
