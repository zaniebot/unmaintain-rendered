# How to install 3.0.0 ?

---

_Issue opened by @cryptohuang on 2020-02-04 01:52_

Hello, I am new to rust.
I have `Cargo.toml`

```
clap = {version = "3.0.0-beta.1", features = ["yaml"]}
```

but cargo reports error:

```
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `clap = "^3.0.0-beta.1"`
  candidate versions found which didn't match: 2.33.0, 2.32.0, 2.31.2, ...
```

Version does not exist? How do I install version 3?

3.x version was not released yet, officially. We will release `3.0.0-alpha.1` as soon as it's done, I expect it to be a week or two from now on.

Meanwhile, you can try the upcoming version via
```toml
clap = { git = "https://github.com/clap-rs/clap" }
```

Please be aware that clap is under heavy development - any help is very welcome here! - so expect severe bugs, documentation inconsistency and API breakage.
