# Can't parse two bools at the same time

---

_Issue opened by @ghost on 2023-01-04 09:20_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Rust Version

rustc 1.66.0 (69f9c33d7 2022-12-12) (built from a source tarball)

### Clap Version

4.0.32

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
#[arg(default_value_t = false, short, long)]
append: bool,
#[arg(default_value_t = false, short, long)]
r#continue: bool,
```

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

cargo run --offline
MYBINARY -a 1 -c 1

### Actual Behaviour

While parsing the arguments "-a 1 -c 1": Found argument '1' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context. But only "-a 1" or only "-c 1" works.

### Expected Behaviour

Parse both bools correctly.

### Additional Context

_No response_

### Debug Output

_No response_

Please include a full reproduction case as it is unclear if interactions with other parts of your program or CLI definition are causing some of the behavior you are seeing.

Part of what you are seeing is that [`bool` implies a flag](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html#arg-types), so you need to add `#[arg(action = clap::builder::ArgAction::Set)]` to override that.

The part that is unclear is why its accepting `1` as an argument when you just use `-a 1`.  My best guess is you have a positional argument not shown in the example code.

Without further details, there is nothing more we can help with.  I'm closing this out.  We can always re-open this later, start a Discussion, or open a new issue.
