# help for `help` says "Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)" but only takes one subcommand

---

_Issue opened by @joshtriplett on 2022-10-03 21:43_

The help text for the `help` subcommand says:
```
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```
That phrasing makes it *sound* like `help` could show help for multiple subcommands at once (e.g. `cmd help subcmd1 subcmd2 subcmd3`). However, the `help` subcommand only takes one subcommand to show help for, not multiple. Given that, I think the help should be:
```
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand
```

The output of `help help` says:
```
  [COMMAND]...  The subcommand whose help message to display
```
Which seems more correct: it says "The subcommand", singular.
