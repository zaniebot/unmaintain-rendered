I am trying to submit a bug report for clap, and it seems that only "form" is available. I would really appreciate it if there was a (not necessarily default) option to submit an issue as a single markdown text area. For me personally, filling the form is highly frustrating, because it causes me to do the work that I know would not be useful for a particular bug report I have in mind, and also requires me to do more GUI clicking instead of just typing stuff.

We [should have blank issues enabled](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml#L1)

It should appear as a link at the bottom:

I can understand frustrations with templates as not everything fits within them.  We've tried to keep our template light (its at least lighter than it was before).

Aha, thanks, that's indeed pretty hard to notice!
