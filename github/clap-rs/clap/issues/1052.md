### Rust Version

* rustc 1.20.0 (f3d6973f4 2017-08-27)

### Affected Version of clap

* clap 2.26.2

### Expected Behavior Summary

Set some required delimiter:

    .arg(
                Arg::with_name("volume")
                .short("v")
                .long("volume")
                .value_names(&["SOURCE","DESTINATION"])
                .value_delimiter(":")
                .require_delimiter(true)
                .takes_value(true)
         )

Help could show it:

    -v, --volume <SOURCE>:<DESTINATION>

And if I run the code with space delimiter, clap could warn me to use ":" instead!

### Actual Behavior Summary

Helps shows space delimiter:

    -v, --volume <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>

Running with space delimiter it gives error, without the correct hint about what went wrong:

    ./prog -v a b
    error: Found argument 'b' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

    USAGE:
        prog --volume <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>

It gives error but does not show me to use ":" between a and b to get the correct behavior.
