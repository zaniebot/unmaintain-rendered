# Make "name" optional in YAML -- nothing gets parsed if it's left out

---

_Issue opened by @jaques-sam on 2021-03-02 15:20_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Rust Version

1.48.0

### Clap Version

### Minimal reproducible code

Using rust edition 2018:
```rust
fn main() {
    let yaml = clap::load_yaml!("cli.yml");
    let matches = App::from_yaml(yaml).get_matches();
}
```
cli.yaml:
```yaml
version: "1.0"
author: Tester <email@dummy.com>
about: parse command line parameters
args:
    - config:
        short: c
        long: config
        value_name: FILE
        help: Sets a custom config file
        takes_value: true
```


side note: why can I not make this window bigger (using Firefox)!! Very annoying :-(
