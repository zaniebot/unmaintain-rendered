# Option to put a newline between version and about text

---

_Issue opened by @blinry on 2018-07-09 07:37_

My application has a multi-paragraph about text, and it looks silly to put it directly after the version line. I'd like an option to insert a newline between them.

You can use either use a [Help Template](https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/struct.App.html#method.template) or use [`App::long_about`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/struct.App.html#method.long_about) to only display those multiple paragraphs when the user runs `--help` (vs `-h`).  

Feel free to ping me if those don't help and we can discuss more :wink:

Oh, you can also just start your about message with `\n\n`. I forgot to mention that one.

The help template works super well for this, thanks!

I just realized that the issue I just opened (#1432) is relevant here as an example of why "just start your about message with `\n\n` isn't a viable solution:

This problem applies to subcommands too, but you can't use the `\n\n` workaround there because it'll break the subcommand listing in the top-level `-h` output.
