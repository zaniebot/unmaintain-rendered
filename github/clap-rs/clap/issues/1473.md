# Allow documentation inside of arg_enum! macro call for enum variants

---

_Issue opened by @NickHackman on 2019-05-15 16:43_

I believe this is a bug, writing documentation for the enum inside arg_enum! macro call as a whole is valid, but writing documentation for any of the variants results in a compile time error

edit: in the examples it says that only bare enums are allowed, why does that include documentation?
