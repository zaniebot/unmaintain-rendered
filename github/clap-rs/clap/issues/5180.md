# Ability to use more than one char in the short aliases for arguments

_Issue opened by @andreykaere on 2023-10-21 16:50_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.4.6

### Describe your use case

Right now it's not possible (or I just don't know of the way to do that) to create a short alias for the arguments except for `char`. However it's useful sometimes to have two chars, i.e. good short name for "--album-cover" is "-ac". 


### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to be able compile this:

```rust
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
struct Args {
    #[arg(short = "ac", long)]
    album-cover: String,
}
```

That is, I would like to have the ability to put `&str` in `#[arg(short = ...)]`, not just `char`.

Is there a reason to not make it a long alias (`--ac`)?

I recognize some parsers blur the line between `-` being one character that can be mixed and `--` being a word by itself, we're intentionally strict on that front.

But can I have both "--album-cover" and "--ac"? I tried to implement this, but I haven't found functionality for that.

See https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.visible_alias

How can I adapt this to the pseudo-code above? I mean, I don't really understand how to add it to the derive ...

UPD: I found out, that I can put "visible_alias" in the deriving struct. But when I use `--help`, I want it to look like this:

--ac, --album-cover ...

And now it's something like
--album-cover .... [aliases: ac]

Yes, only the primary short/long shows up on the left to avoid it getting too wide.

_Comment by @andreykaere on 2023-10-22 08:12_

Is there any way to change it?

---

_Comment by @epage on 2023-10-23 13:20_

Only by providing your own help output

_Comment by @andreykaere on 2023-10-23 14:17_

Okay. Thank you for your answers! Well, since you said that `clap` is not going to implement the functionality described in the title of this issue, I think it's safe to close it.
