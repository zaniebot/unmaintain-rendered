### Actual Behavior Summary

Apologies! Thank you for pointing this out! The `examples/` directory have taken over for the old test binary.

You can test them out by doing:

```
$ cargo build --example <example>
    # such as cargo build --example 01a_quick_example

$ ./target/debug/examples 01a_quick_example --help
[ .. snip ]
```

You can also do a single run via

```
$ cargo run --example <example> -- [args]
    # such as cargo run --example 01a_quick_example -- --help
[ .. snip ]
```

I'll update the readme on the next PR. Thanks :+1:
