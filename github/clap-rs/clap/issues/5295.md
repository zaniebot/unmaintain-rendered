### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

master

### Describe your use case

Single click environment setup. 
This can be used to speed up the setting up of development environments for new contributors along with not having to install dependences directly on machines. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be nice to have a devcontainer manifest file that describes a working environment. 
More information can be found on the link below:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container

### Alternatives, if applicable

VM Images could be a substitute, but they are more complicated to deploy and are much more resource heavy than containers. 

### Additional Context

This would make the project slightly more beginner friendly resulting in the possibility of a wider set of contributors. This increase would result in the growth the community and an increase in the number of community contributions.

I'm not normally a fan of tying repos to specific editors.  For instance, I generally recommend user-wide ignores for stray editor files, rather than per-project ignores.

In particular, this sets specific policies of what tools are for use by the user.

Got it, I totally understand the philosophy there. Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the clarification!
