# Help subcommand about message

---

_Issue opened by @yakubin on 2019-06-26 10:01_

### Rust Version

```rustc 1.24.1```

### Affected Version of clap

Output of `grep clap Cargo.lock`:

```
name = "clap"
 "clap 2.33.0 (registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index)",
"checksum clap 2.33.0 (registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index)" = "5067f5bb2d80ef5d68b4c87db81601f0b75bca627bc2ef76b141d7b846a3c6d9"
```

### Bug or Feature Request Summary

It would be great if it was possible to customize the "about" message of the automatically generated help subcommand, similarly to how it's possible to customize it for the `--help` flag with `help_message()`.

### Expected Behavior Summary

Right now it is only possible to get the "Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)" message.

### Actual Behavior Summary

A method `subcommand_help_about()` or something along those lines behaving analogously to the `help_message()` method + a corresponding YAML field.
