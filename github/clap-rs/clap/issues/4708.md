### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.1.4

### Describe your use case

`ArgGroup::is_multiple` requires a `&mut self`, yet the function does not itself do any mutations to the `ArgGroup`. The `&mut` is unnecessary. It also means that when you have an immutable reference to an `ArgGroup` (like the one you would get from calling `groups()` on a command), you can't check it the group allows multiple options.

### Describe the solution you'd like

We should remove the `&mut` from the function signature.

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

_No response_
