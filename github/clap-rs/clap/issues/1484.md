### Bug or Feature Request Summary

I'm creating an interactive command line application in rust. It is like an embedded command line in a program. The user enter a command and press enter, the command is processed and the user is ready to enter a new command. It works like python's [cmd2](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2).

I would like to use clap to process the arguments on some commands. But then I can only give clap a Vec of arguments. Also I need to capture the output printed by clap since printing to stdout doesn't work because I'm using a raw screen. I also need to prevent clap from exiting the process if the user enter bad arguments.

Is something of that possible?

Thanks!
It seems I can use App.get_matches_from_safe_borrow or App.get_matches_from_safe to give the arguments as a sequence and capturing the output. And App.set_term_width to set the width of the text.
