# `SubcommandRequired` in yml

---

_Issue opened by @laishulu on 2016-07-23 19:35_

I can **NOT** run if I have the following line in the yml file, what's the correct way to config this?

``` yaml
setting: "SubcommandRequired"
```

Thanks! I'll put this in the queue, but it should be an easy fix.

I'm sorry, I was confused about what you were asking.

In your YAML file, putting the following will work just fine:

``` yaml
settings:
    - SubcommandRequired
```

Still got the following result:

Is it pushed to crates as a new version?
Or I should install it directly from git repo?


---

_Comment by @kbknapp on 2016-07-24 00:07_

I will upload v2.9.3 to crates.io when I get home tonight. I'll also post here once the new version is uploaded :wink:
