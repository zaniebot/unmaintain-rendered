# Ensure v3 deprecation messages are useful for migrating people

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2022-08-09 21:57_

Inspired by [a reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/wgy6mr/new_alternative_for_clap_declarative_basic_and/ijbfpkl/?context=3). in preparing to release v4, we need to audit the deprecation messages in v3 to ensure they are sufficient for migrating people up so we can use it as a guided migration guide and focus the actual migration guide on the more subtle issues that aren't as easily handled
