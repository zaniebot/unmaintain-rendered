    sacking the people who have just been sacked have been sacked.

### [`v0.1.20`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0120---2025-04-09)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.19...v0.1.20)

##### Fixed

-   `Divan::skip_regex` accidentally dropped
    [`regex_lite::Regex`](https://docs.rs/regex-lite/latest/regex_lite/struct.Regex.html)
    and behaved incorrectly in `v0.1.19`.

### [`v0.1.19`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0119---2025-04-09)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.18...v0.1.19)

##### Fixed

-   \[`cargo-nextest`] no longer skips benchmarks with argument parameters (\[[#&#8203;75](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/issues/75)]).

##### Changed

-   Organized positive and negative filters into a split buffer.

### [`v0.1.18`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0118---2025-04-05)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.17...v0.1.18)

##### Added

-   Support for \[`cargo-nextest`] running benchmarks as tests.

-   \[`prelude`] module for simplifying imports of \[`#[bench]`]\[bench_attr],
    \[`#[bench_group]`]\[bench_group_attr], \[`black_box`], \[`black_box_drop`],
    \[`AllocProfiler`], \[`Bencher`], and \[`Divan`].

-   Support `wasi` and `emscripten` targets.

### [`v0.1.17`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0117---2024-12-04)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.16...v0.1.17)

##### Changed

-   Set \[MSRV] to 1.80 for \[`LazyLock`] and new `size_of` prelude import.

-   Reduced thread pool memory usage by many kilobytes by using rendezvous
    channels instead of array-based channels.

### [`v0.1.16`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0116---2024-11-25)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.15...v0.1.16)

##### Added

-   Thread pool for reusing threads across multi-threaded benchmarks. The result
    is that when running Divan benchmarks under a sampling profiler, the
    profiler's output will be cleaner and easier to understand. (\[[#&#8203;37](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/issues/37)])

-   Track the maximum number of allocations during a benchmark.

##### Changed

-   Make private `Arg::get` trait method not take `self`, so that text editors
    don't recommend using it. (\[[#&#8203;59](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/issues/59)])

-   Cache `BenchOptions` using `LazyLock` instead of `OnceLock`, saving space and
    simplifying the implementation.

### [`v0.2.14`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0214-2025-05-20)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.13...0.2.14)

\===================
This release includes a smattering of bug fixes, and hopefully a small
improvement to the time it takes to compile Jiff. Also, in this release, when
`TZ` is set to a non-empty but invalid value, Jiff will always fall back to
`Etc/Unknown` when using `TimeZone::system()`. This differs from previous
behavior where Jiff would, in this case, attempt to read the system's default
time zone. This change brings Jiff into consistency with existing Unix tooling
like `date`, and is also arguably a better failure mode. That is, when `TZ` is
set but invalid, we shouldn't silently fall back to the default system time
zone, but instead do something that indicates something has potentially gone
wrong.

Enhancements:

-   [#&#8203;364](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/364):
    Jiff now falls back to `Etc/Unknown` for invalid `TZ` values.
-   [#&#8203;379](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/379):
    Improve compilation times.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;365](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/365):
    Fixes a compile error in Jiff when only the `tzdb-concatenated` feature was
    enabled.
-   [#&#8203;366](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/366):
    Fixes slow initial `Zoned::now()` in environments where `/usr/share/zoneinfo`
    is on a very slow file system (like CI environments).
-   [#&#8203;376](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/376):
    Avoids searching for a tzdb at `/usr/share/zoneinfo` on Windows.

### [`v0.2.13`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0213-2025-05-05)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.12...0.2.13)

\===================
This release fixes a bug in a corner case where `TimeZone::following` could
sometimes omit the last time zone transition. This could only happen in time
zones that once had daylight saving time, but ended it. This did not have an
impact on other Jiff APIs that handle daylight saving time.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;362](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/362):
    Fix a bug where `TimeZone::following` could omit the last historical time zone
    transition.

### [`v0.2.12`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0212-2025-05-03)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.11...0.2.12)

\===================
This release fixes a couple bugs in Jiff's parser. In particular, a regression
was introduced in `jiff 0.2.11` where its RFC 2822 parser could panic on some
inputs. Previous releases of Jiff are unaffected.

Bug fixes:

-   [#&#8203;357](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/357):
    Fix a bug where parsing `1970-06-01T00-00:45:00[Africa/Monrovia]` succeeded
    but it should fail.
-   [#&#8203;359](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/issues/359):
    Fix a bug where the RFC 2822 parser could panic on some inputs.
