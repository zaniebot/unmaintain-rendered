# docs: replace `concolor-clap` with `colorchoice-clap`

---

_Pull request opened by @wmmc88 on 2025-02-08 03:58_

Since [concolor is deprecated](https://github.com/rust-cli/concolor/issues/47), the docs should point to its replacement, 
 `colorchoice-clap`, instead

Thanks for helping out!

Please link the appropriate issue from your PR.

If you don't have an issue, we'd recommend starting with one first so the PR can focus on the
implementation (unless its an obvious bug or documentation fix that will have
little conversation).
