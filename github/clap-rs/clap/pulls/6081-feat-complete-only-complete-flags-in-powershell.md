# feat(complete): Only complete flags in PowerShell when word starts with `-`

---

_Pull request opened by @MatejKafka on 2025-07-30 15:09_

In PowerShell, built-in completion system only completes parameter (flag) names when you type a `-` (dash), otherwise it assumes that you're entering a positional parameter value (or a subcommand). The completion script generated by `clap_complete` does not replicate this behavior, which feels out-of-place compared to the built-in completers.

This PR fixes the behavior to match built-in PowerShell completions.
