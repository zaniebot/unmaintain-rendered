A couple of concerns
- Dealing with the spread of versions of elvish that contributors will be using
- Updating elvish-version

*(copied from #5869)*

The point of this change is that we could install the exact version we specify instead of depending on the system package manager (currently the version `apt install` on the CI is 0.17 which is very old).

The next question is which version we guarantee the compability?

I don't have a good idea on what version should be our minimal (or even how to handle multiple incompatible versions).  Leaving it to the distribution sets a low water mark that gets automatically updated.
