# feat(mangen): Add option to keep line breaks

---

_Pull request opened by @pamburus on 2025-12-01 21:58_

### Feature: Add `keep_line_breaks` option to `clap_mangen::Man`

This pull request introduces the `keep_line_breaks` option to the `clap_mangen::Man` builder.

### Description & Motivation

The default behavior of `clap_mangen` is to strip line breaks within argument help text before rendering the man page. This can lead to a loss of intended formatting, particularly when arguments use multiline text, such as:

* **Bullet Lists:** Lists provided in the help text are merged into a single, potentially confusing, paragraph.
* **Structured Paragraphs:** Intended line breaks for clarity are discarded, making long help strings difficult to read in the generated man page.

This new `keep_line_breaks` option addresses this by instructing `clap_mangen` to **preserve the line breaks** within the help text of arguments. This makes the man page output consistent with the formatting seen in the application's standard **long help** output, thereby enabling authors to correctly format elements like **bullet lists** and maintain overall readability.

### Usage Example

The option can be enabled on the builder as follows:

```rust
let man = clap_mangen::Man::new(app)
    .keep_line_breaks(true) // New option
    .render();
```
