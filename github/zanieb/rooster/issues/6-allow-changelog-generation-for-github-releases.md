# Allow changelog generation for GitHub releases

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-11-08 17:32_

GitHub releases only have a single release and use a slightly different format e.g. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/v0.1.3

We should be able to generate the changelog for GitHub release from the editorialized CHANGELOG file. Interface tbd.
