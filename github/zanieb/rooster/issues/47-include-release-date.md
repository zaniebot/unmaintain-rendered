# Include release date

---

_Issue opened by @gusutabopb on 2024-09-02 10:09_

(Coming here from `uv`)

As an avid `uv` CHANGELOG reader, I think it'd be nice to have the release date next to the version number, as recommended by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).


Current output
```
## 0.4.2
```

Better (IMHO) output
```
## 0.4.2 - 2024-09-01
```

Hi! Sorry for the delay, my notifications here are buried by all the uv ones I guess :)

Would you be willing to have the release date after the heading? e.g.

```
## 0.4.2

Released on 2025-09-01.
```

Yes, that format is fine too. That’s similar to what CPython uses: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html
