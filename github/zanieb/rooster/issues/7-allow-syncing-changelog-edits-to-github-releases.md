# Allow syncing CHANGELOG edits to GitHub releases

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-11-08 17:33_

Changes to the `CHANGELOG.md` file should be propagated to GitHub releases automatically i.e. by running a command in CI on merge to `main` when the changelog is edited. This ensures there is a "single" source of truth.
