            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems like a new development, or maybe I just haven't noticed before, but it looks like <code>load_yaml!()</code> loads relative to the working directory rather than either the base of the project, or the <code>src</code> directory. This causes a problem when running <code>cargo build</code> from a directory that wasn't expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>load_yaml!</code> uses <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.include_str!.html"><code>include_str!</code></a> internally.</p>

<p>The file is located relative to the current file (similarly to how modules are found),</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Like @sru said, this uses the <code>include_str!</code> internally so it's not something we could easily change, or do so without a runtime cost.</p>
<p>If you've got ideas on a new method to add which is relative to the project root I'm not against it. But would also like to make sure it's worth the effort.</p>
