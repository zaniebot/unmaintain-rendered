            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Currently, the errors look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23066595/104830700-16b24100-5879-11eb-9999-6f782518ff93.png" alt="clap" /></p>
<p>With the colon in <strong><code>error:</code></strong> being red just like the error label itself. However, the idiomatic Rust compiler errors look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23066595/104830722-482b0c80-5879-11eb-9d87-a4734c751d41.png" alt="idioma" /></p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>It is a very minor thing, but it causes stylistic incoherence in projects that adhere to the idiomatic error style. Particularly, a few of my projects. (As you can see, I am a perfectionist... I know, sorry.) It would be great if this thing got fixed. There are libraries out there that could potentially make it easier (e.g. <a href="https://docs.rs/idioma/">idioma</a>)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, it is stylistic, but I would still like the see others reasons for it. &quot;Rust does it&quot; is not good enough because rust is not primarily CLI tool.</p>
<p>Is there research into famous CLI parsers from other languages and how they print the error messages when color is turned on? If there's a convention there, we will follow.</p>

<p>@pksunkara it looks like colorized out is not a widely supported function. Argparse and the like don't support it out of the box. So it looks like you can decide how exactly you want to colorize the output of Clap since you are the authors.</p>
<p>I just think that Rust's errors look very nice and why not follow that convention out of all others.</p>
