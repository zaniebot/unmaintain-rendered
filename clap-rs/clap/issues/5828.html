<h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)</p>
<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.21</p>
<h3>Minimal reproducible code</h3>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use clap::CommandFactory;
use clap::Parser;
use clap::Subcommand;

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Cli {
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    pub subcommand: Subcommands,
}

#[derive(Debug, Subcommand)]
pub enum Subcommands {
    #[clap(next_help_heading = &quot;foo&quot;)]

    B(BCommand),

#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[clap(
    name = &quot;a&quot;,
    about = &quot;a it&quot;,
)]
pub struct ACommand {
}

#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[clap(

    cli.get_matches();
}

<h3>Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code</h3>
<pre><code>$ cargo run -- --help
   Compiling clap-issue v0.1.0 (/tmp/clap-issue)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.17s
     Running `target/debug/clap-issue --help`
Usage: clap-issue &lt;COMMAND&gt;

Commands:
  a     a it
  b     b it
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
</code></pre>
<h3>Actual Behaviour</h3>
<p>The <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> commands are under the <code>Commands</code> header.</p>
<h3>Expected Behaviour</h3>
<p>The <code>a</code> command should under the <code>foo</code> header and the <code>b</code> command should be under the <code>bar</code> header.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>In <code>sq</code>, we have some subcommands with a mix of commands and subcommands, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>$ sq key -h
Manage keys

Usage: sq key &lt;COMMAND&gt;

Commands:
  list       List keys managed by the key store
  generate   Generate a new key
  import     Import keys into the key store
  export     Export keys from the key store
  delete     Delete a certificate's secret key material
  password   Change the password protecting secret key material
  expire     Change a certificate's expiration time
  revoke     Revoke a certificate
  userid     Manage User IDs
  subkey     Manage subkeys
  approvals  Manages certification approvals

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help (see more with '--help')
</code></pre>
<p>We want to have multiple headers to make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for.  Like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq key -h
Manage keys

Usage: sq key &lt;COMMAND&gt;

Commands:
  list       List keys managed by the key store
  generate   Generate a new key
  import     Import keys into the key store
  export     Export keys from the key store
  delete     Delete a certificate's secret key material
  password   Change the password protecting secret key material
  expire     Change a certificate's expiration time
  revoke     Revoke a certificate

Command Groups:
  userid     Manage User IDs
  subkey     Manage subkeys
  approvals  Manages certification approvals

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help (see more with '--help')
</code></pre>
<p>https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html seems to suggest that this should work for subcommands, but it doesn't seem to.</p>
<p>I apologize if this isn't a bug, and I'm only holding it wrong.</p>
