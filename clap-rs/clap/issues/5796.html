<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.20</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I would like to be able to use clap as a source for the <code>config-rs</code> crate. I think this is a pretty common use case for a lot of people.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I think a reasonable way to do this would be to provide a function like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub trait FromArgMatches: Sized {
    fn value_from_arg_matches( __clap_arg_matches: &amp;clap::ArgMatches) -&gt; ::std::result::Result&lt;Value, clap::Error&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>Value</code> is a type similar to <code>serde_json::Value</code> or <code>config-rs::Value</code></p>
<p>It would then be pretty trivial to implement <code>config-rs::Source</code> for this new type. The end result could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Default, Parser, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Opts {
    #[clap(short, long)]
    my_arg: u64,
}

let args_matches = Opts::command().ignore_errors(true).get_matches();
let value = Opts::value_from_arg_matches(&amp;args_matches)?;
let config = config::Config::builder()
    .add_source(config::File::from(path).required(true))
    .add_source(value)
    .build()?;

let opts = deserialize(config)?;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ArgMatches</code> can store any type.  To put it into a <code>Value</code> would require limiting what is stored.  There is also nothing privileged about this and this wouldn't be useful for any other part of clap.  With all of that combined, I feel like this would best live in a separate crate.  As such, I'm going to close this for now.  If there is a reason we should reconsider this, let us know!</p>
<p>btw brainstorming on how to deal with layered config is happening in #2763</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @epage thanks for taking a look. I think perhaps I wasn't entirely clear.</p>
<p>I don't think it's possible to implement this outside this crate as the behaviour is specific to <code>FromArgMatches</code>.</p>
<p>It's not possible to go form <code>ArgMatches</code> to <code>Value</code> without some additional context, and attributes like #[clap(flatten)] changes how things are laid out.</p>
<p>This definitely isn't the only way get layered configuration to work, but I thought it might be a fairly easy one to implement.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, so you are wanting to leverage <code>FromArgMatches</code> to know how to generate a value.  The problem there is that we'd then need to extend that trait to support this and create a whole new system for converting the user's data type to a <code>Value</code>.  This is starting to instead sound like deriving <code>serde::Deserialize</code> on the type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Admittedly I'm unfamiliar with how complex deriving <code>FromArgMatches</code> really is, and I was hoping it would be a small change to return an incomplete <code>Value</code> instead of <code>Self</code>.</p>
<p>There is some similarity to deriving <code>Deserialize</code>, with the main difference here being that <code>value_from_arg_matches</code> would return an <em>incomplete</em> value representation of <code>Self</code>, which would later be merged using <code>config-rs</code>.</p>
