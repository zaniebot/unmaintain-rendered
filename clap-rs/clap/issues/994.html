            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(sorry for not using the template, but I don't think it's applicable here)</p>
<p>Currently, the <code>clap::Shell</code> enum (as defined <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/e27a6ffbde87a35a367cd3c5b7369ef8173d0e7a/src/completions/shell.rs#L8">here</a>) can be matched against, which means that supporting a new shell is a breaking change. I'd like to propose making the enum nonexhaustive. Until rust-lang/rfcs#2008 or an equivalent gets passed and stabilized, this would be done through a doc hidden <code>__nonexhaustive_dont_match</code> variant (or similar). Using that variant would be considered unsupported, and the existing enum functions would ignore it (or panic if passed in). This would be a breaking change, but it would prevent future breaking changes whenever a shell is added.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate this didn't happen with clap v2. I'm not sure if this would be a major enough change to warrant waiting for clap v3, that'll be up to the maintainers of course.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since I'm actively working on v3 (see v3-master branch) I can just incorporate this into the new version. Actually I'm trying to pull out all the completion code into <code>clap_completions</code> so that changes such as this can be breaking and bump the major without changing <code>clap</code> proper.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long wait on a response :\</p>
