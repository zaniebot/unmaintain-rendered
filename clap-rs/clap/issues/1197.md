# Support subcommand aliases

---

_Issue opened by @darnir on 2018-02-28 23:04_

### Affected Version of clap

2.30

### Expected Behavior Summary

An application can define multiple subcommands which are aliases of one another, just like for arguments.

For example, in an application I am currently writing, I'd like to have a subcommand called `remove`, however to make it easier for users, I would also like to have an alias to this subcommand called "rm". This way, the application can be invoked in both of the following ways:

```
$ myapp remove /path/to/file
$ myapp rm /path/to/file
```

### Sample Code or Link to Sample Code

Ideally, the API would be similar to that of `clap::Arg`. So, it would be:

```
SubCommand::with_name("remove")
    .alias("rm")
```

Of course, the other similar API may be supported as well (`aliases`, `visible_alias`, etc.)

Apparently, I was looking in the wrong location for the documentation. The `alias()` method is indeed available.

I was looking for it under `SubCommand`, instead of `App`.
