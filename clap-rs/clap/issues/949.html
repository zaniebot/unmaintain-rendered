            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>rustc 1.19.0-nightly (f4209651e 2017-05-05)</p>
<h3>Affected Version of clap</h3>
<p>clap 2.24.1</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>Options and flag appear in same order as they are defined.</p>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>Some options are moved into a seemingly more alphabetical order instead.
Good example the '-d' option is moved before the '-n' option even though they are define in opposite order. Another is '--ini' moves up several places instead of just before the '--r*' ones where it should be so it seems to be effecting both long and short options.</p>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce the issue</h3>
<p><a href="https://pastebin.com/cePQwBXc">Download</a>
Run cargo run --bin test -- -h where 'test' is the downloaded code.
Notice things are not in the defined order.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is because you don't have <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.24.1/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#variant.UnifiedHelpMessage"><code>AppSettings::UnifiedHelpMessage</code></a> set.</p>
<p>I understand you're using the <code>{unified}</code> in the template. Without getting into the weeds, what happens is clap orders flags and options separately (unless <code>UnifiedHelpMessage</code> is set, in which case it merges them at declaration time). Then when printing the help message, if <code>{unified}</code> is used <em>without</em> having also used <code>UnifiedHelpMessage</code> it will do a &quot;best effort&quot; merge.</p>
<p>I'm going to mark this as a documentation issue, as I should probably mention this edge case explicitly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay adding the other setting did the trick thanks. Yeah probably a good idea to document it so you don't end up with another bug report down the road from someone else :)</p>
