<li>Help fiddlings like <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1127#issuecomment-1263580821">this</a> should be in the cookbook.<ul>
<li>This is probably also a good place to show <code>max_term_width = 100</code> and <code>wrap_help</code> since everyone is going to want that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An example of the old help template should be in the cookbook.</li>
<li>The changelog doesn't say that errors were moved to <code>error</code> module</li>
<li>The crate_authors link here is broken: https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.author<ul>
<li>There's also no explanation of where this goes now that it isn't in the default template</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As far as I can tell, adding the <code>color</code> feature doesn't do anything anymore</li>
<li>A bunch of methods (e.g. https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.ignore_errors) talk about <code>global_setting</code> without explaining what it is (but I also don't think it exists anymore)</li>

<p>I feel like knowing what and how we want to cover it might take some more exploring.  Could you create a separate issue.  Generally, rollup issues like this are <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3418#issuecomment-1054510326">unhelpful</a> and its better create dedicated issues but I went ahead and took care of the rest of the items in #4309</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Good idea.  Instead of the cookbook though, I've put it in the docs for <code>Command::help_template</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The changelog doesn't say that errors were moved to error module</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh. looks like I missed some deprecation attributes in v3 which we were relying on for some of these changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The crate_authors link here is broken</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks.  We were relying on intra-doc links to keep things up-to-date but there were a couple of direct links still left</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's also no explanation of where this goes now that it isn't in the default template</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Added a note about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell, adding the color feature doesn't do anything anymore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can <a href="https://github.com/artichoke/artichoke/pull/2196#discussion_r983029367">see</a>, the color feature does still do stuff though <a href="https://epage.github.io/blog/2022/09/clap4/#polishing-help-output">help is more using other terminal styling than color</a> but we generally mean all terminal styling with &quot;color&quot;.  https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4132 has more discussion on the switch from the colors in <code>--help</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bunch of methods</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks!  Bad copy/paste since we first created these methods.</p>
