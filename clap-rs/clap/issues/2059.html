Actual Behavior Summary
<p>Options in help message are sorted in a weird way I don&#x27;t recognize:</p>
<pre><code>Pod, the open-source backend for Memri project. 

USAGE:
    a [OPTIONS] --owner &lt;owner&gt;...

OPTIONS:
    -s, --services-callback-address &lt;ADDRESS&gt;
            Set the callback address for services launched from within Pod. This should be the Pod-s
            address as seen by external services. During development, it defaults to
            &quot;https://pod_pod_1:3030&quot; if Pod is inside docker, or &quot;https://localhost:3030&quot; on Linux,
            or &quot;https://host.docker.internal:3030&quot; on other operating systems
    -c, --https-pub-crt &lt;CERTIFICATE_FILE&gt;
            File to read https public certificate from [default: ./data/certs/pod.crt]

    -k, --https-priv-key &lt;KEY_FILE&gt;
            File to read https private key from [default: ./data/certs/pod.key]

    -v, --validate-schema &lt;SCHEMA_FILE&gt;
            Validate a schema file, and exit. This allows testing whether a given schema is suitable
            for use in Pod, see README.md#schema for details. Note that running project tests or
            starting the Pod will also automatically validate the schema in
            `res/autogenerated_database_schema.json`
    -h, --help                                   
            Prints help information

    -i, --insecure-non-tls &lt;insecure-non-tls&gt;
            Unsafe version of --non-tls. Do not use https when starting the server, instead run on
            http on the provided network interface. WARNING: This is heavily discouraged as an
            intermediary (even your router on a local network) could spoof the traffic sent to the
            server and do a MiTM attack. Please consider running Pod on a non-public network (--non-
            tls), or use Pod with https encryption
    -t, --non-tls
            Do not use https when starting the server, instead run on http://127.0.0.1. Running on
            loopback interface (127.0.0.1) means that only apps from within the same computer will
            be able to access Pod. This option might be used during development as an alternative to
            self-signed certificates
    -o, --owner &lt;owner&gt;...
            Comma-separated list of Pod owners (hex-encoded hashes of public keys). Only those
            owners are allowed to call Pod endpoints. Each Pod owner has its own database and files
            directory, the owners do not intersect data-wise.
            
            A magic value of &quot;ANY&quot; will allow any owner to connect to the Pod.
            
            Can be specified multiple times.
    -p, --port &lt;port&gt;                            
            Port to listen to [default: 3030]

    -V, --version                                
            Prints version information

Expected Behavior Summary
<p>Options must be sorted in alphabetical order, as specified in documentation.</p>
