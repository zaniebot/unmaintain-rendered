Hi!</p>
<p>I stumbled on a case where the derive implementation of ArgEnum does not produce its impl block without warning. It happens if the enum contains a non-unit variant.</p>
<p>If you try to compile code such as</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(ArgEnum)]
pub enum Test {
    Foo,
    Bar,
    Baz(u16),
}
</code></pre>
<p>The derive doesn't produce any code, and errors are later emitted, reporting that Test does not implement ArgEnum. I would consider that as a bug, because it is confusing and unfriendly. It would be better if an error was emitted from the macro.</p>
<p>I think I found the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/e937955efba002cbce317b715c151d359e9229a6/clap_derive/src/derives/arg_enum.rs#L37-L39">culprit</a> and would be willing to contribute a fix.</p>
<p>However, while browsing similar issues, I found <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2561">this discussion</a> where one of you proposed then implemented a <code>#[clap(skip)]</code> attribute for skipping variants in ArgEnum implementation. I think that an enum with a skipped non-unit variant should not trigger any error, and instead produce a valid implementation. If you approve of it, I would like to help on that as well.</p>
<p>What do you think?</div></p>
