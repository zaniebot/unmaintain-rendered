<ul>
<li>Ideally we&#x27;d make dynamic member access the API for this but that is still going through the RFC process</li>
<li>If we want a jump start on that API, we could provide our own &quot;any map&quot; that allows attaching arbitrary enums to the error struct.</li>
<li>Overall, this avoids limiting ourselves to each error kind having an exact set of data in every case</li>

Clap Version
<p>3.0.0-beta.2</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Preface: thank you very much for your work on clap so far, it has saved me countless hours of tedium.</p>
<p><code>ErrorKind</code> is a fieldless enum, so additional contextual information required for someone to provide their own custom error messages is provided as a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> in <code>Error</code>, named <code>info</code>.</p>
<p>Using a <code>Vec</code> to carry this information not self-explanatory in regards to what each element of the <code>Vec</code> represents (e.g. which element represents the invalid value that triggers an <code>InvalidValue</code> or <code>ValueValidation</code>). This would be okay-ish if clap had any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methods or associated functions on <code>Error</code> or <code>ErrorKind</code> to retrieve specific information</li>
<li>Functions, named constants, or an enum that can be used with <code>info</code> to retrieve specific information based on where it should be in the vector.</li>
<li>Documentation describing what the values of <code>info</code> will be for a given <code>ErrorKind</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I can tell, none of these are present, which means that in order to write one&#x27;s own error reporting, one needs to either <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/src/parse/errors.rs#L509">read the source code of the functions that construct these <code>Error</code>s</a> or do their own testing. I don&#x27;t think either should be necessary.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>The solution I&#x27;d prefer the most is a significant breaking change (described under Alternatives). I acknowledge that&#x27;s not desirable, even considering the upcoming <code>3.0.0</code> release.</p>
<p>A compromise is to add ways to retrieve this information safely, such as by adding methods to <code>Error</code> that return the relevant information. A few possible examples with placeholder names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pub fn get_arg_or_subcmd(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;str&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>pub fn get_missing(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;[String]</code></li>
<li><code>pub fn get_value_counts(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;(usize,usize)&gt; //Found, expected</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing each method should be fairly simple, if perhaps a bit repetitive considering the number of variants on <code>ErrorKind</code> that need to be matched. The bodies would mostly be pattern matches followed by accesses to <code>info</code>.</p>
<p>One caveat in the implementation is that <code>Error</code> should contain a private flag to indicate whether the <code>Error</code> was constructed by <code>Error::with_description</code> or not. If so, these functions should return empty values.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>This problem can technically be solved by improving documentation, but I&#x27;m of the mind that doing only that is the worst solution. <code>info</code> being a Vec is fragile and typo-prone, and there should be better ways to interact with it than as a <code>Vec</code>.</p>
<p>Ideally, keeping <code>ErrorKind</code> as a fieldless enum, <code>info</code>&#x27;s type would change to an enum with fields that store the relevant information for each kind of error. Some of the methods described above could still be implemented for convenience.</p>
<p>However, I acknowledge that this would be a significant breaking change that would take more than a few renames for users of clap to fix. Solutions like making <code>info</code> a method that generates a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> from data in this enum or providing both <code>info</code> and the enum in another field aren&#x27;t entirely compelling either.</p>
Additional Context
<p>I am very willing to work with you fine folks to implement any of these changes, if approved. Have a good day!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After iterating with different error designs, I think our approach of a tag-only Kind with auxiliary data is the best approach (granted, how we expose that auxiliary data can be improved).  The problem with enum fields is its brittle (can&#x27;t add fields without breaking compat) and harder to check for just the kind (<code>matches!</code> helps some but not completely).</p>
<p>The error working group is working on a general API for querying information from errors.  Something like that seems like the best long-term solution.  Short term, we can add our own query methods if we really need this before the Error WG gets their feature landed.</p>
