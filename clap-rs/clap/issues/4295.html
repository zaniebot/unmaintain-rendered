<p>We previously had a &quot;wrap_help&quot; feature flag that didn&#x27;t control help wrapping but instead controlled wrapping to the terminal&#x27;s width.  I moved wrapping into that feature as well as there are a lot of commands that focus on keeping their help short enough that only in small terminals do they need wrapping.</p>
<p>For now, I left it as non-default but called it out in the migration guide.</p>

<p>For 5.0, these should really be behind the feature unless there&#x27;s some reasoning I&#x27;m not aware of.</p>

<p>Fair enough, though the *term_width functions are just one example. I must admit the upgrade to 4.0 was quite frustrating. Created <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4308">clap-rs/clap#4308</a>. It might be worth picking some random OSS project and upgrading them to clap v4 to see what it&#x27;s like for yourself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s actually pretty cool, wasn&#x27;t aware. Maybe the actual issue then is that there&#x27;s too little info explaining how to restore old behavior. The changelog sort of reads as a &quot;Here&#x27;s what changed, good luck trying to restore old behavior you liked lol.&quot; Of course I&#x27;m exaggerating, but adding the <code>wrap_help</code> feature doesn&#x27;t make the CLI act like before, you also need to set the max_term_width. Why? I dunno. That kind of breakage would be fine if it was clearly explained as &quot;Here&#x27;s what the old thing does: example. Here&#x27;s what the new thing does: example. Here&#x27;s how to restore x, y, z old behavior in the new thing.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#x27;s what this issue was about. Run the above repro (<code>./foo help</code>) with or without the <code>wrap_help</code> feature and the help will extend through the entire terminal instead of wrapping at 100 chars. Caused by this: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/106d8f5e90952edf77f53f19ab0041712175267d/src/output/help_template.rs#L104</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To summarize what is going on</p>
<ul>
<li>In clap 3 with <code>wrap_help</code>, we would wrap on the terminal&#x27;s width</li>
<li>In clap 3 without <code>wrap_help</code>, we would assume the terminal width was 100 and wrap there</li>
<li>In clap 4 with <code>wrap_help</code>, the behavior is the same</li>
<li>In clap 4 without <code>wrap_help</code>, we no longer wrap</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing is broken per se.  The behavior for <code>wrap_help</code> has remain unchanged and we intentionally changed the behavior without <code>wrap_help</code></p>
<p>I can understand though of changing the behavior of <code>max_term_width</code> so that we default to a set number as having too long of lines becomes unhelpful for reading.  The question is what that default <code>max_term_width</code> should be and is this innocuous enough to not be a breaking change (I think so).</p>
<p>Re-opening, taking this as a request to change <code>max_term_width</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well again, I still consider this a regression, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clap 3 had a default, so yes. Regression aside, it&#x27;s quite unpleasant to read something that requires turning your head, we&#x27;re just not used to that.</li>
<li>Clap 3 had it at 100.</li>
<li>We don&#x27;t? If you&#x27;re talking about <code>current_width.unwrap_or(100)</code>, that 100 doesn&#x27;t actually do anything since it gets ignored without wrap_help and won&#x27;t be None unless there&#x27;s an error with wrap_help enabled.</li>
<li>This is a regression. Clap 4&#x27;s current behavior broke clap 3 users like me. Also, you just &quot;broke&quot; the short command output to make it <a href="https://github.com/SUPERCILEX/ftzz/commit/4c1e4d97d3f4a8b48f0f4396c784beaac49e8618#diff-16c5c609cb6d69b2626e8fad281d9a3e804ec404e07b6a69183f76d2ee41e4b3">look nicer</a>, so I don&#x27;t see how this is any different.</li>

<p>Putting &quot;broke&quot; in quotes is supposed to mean I don&#x27;t consider that a breaking change.

<p>The state of this Issue is marked in the labels, as I mentioned.  I&#x27;ve consistently asked for people to discuss things before moving on to PRs</p>
<ul>
<li>So we have a central place for the conversation as PR authors can come and go for an Issue and sometimes one author might do multiple PRs</li>
<li>PRs put extra social pressure on maintainers to merge because of the extra commitment involved by the author.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important aspect is communication.  This issue would go a lot more smoothly but</p>
<ul>
<li>Previous comments keep reiterating the same thing rather than answering my questions, not from one person&#x27;s perspective, but from the clap project&#x27;s perspective which needs to take all users into account.  This requires empathy to consider how things might impact other users.</li>
<li>Previous comments do not clearly articulate the different cases and the how the change fits into it, making the conversation a lot harder to have</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;ve also had less patience in this issue because</p>
<ul>
<li>My time is even more limited right now and I have to prioritize accordingly as I normally get time during work on this but I am on family leave atm</li>
<li>A lot of assumed trust has already been lost due to behavior on other issues in other repos.  In a short period of time, I experienced a lot of combativeness that ate up a disproportionate amount of my time and zapped a significant amount of my emotional energy, requiring distance and recharge to avoid burn out.  The problems in those other PRs and Issues reflect the same kind of problems seeing here (narrow focus on one&#x27;s own needs, not looking at wider project and user needs which includes narrative flow of documentation which can be hard to do, unclear communication, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;d recommend taking a step back for a few days, and looking at this again with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s true, but under the assumption that this isn&#x27;t any more of a breaking change than the other help tweaks, there are only a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>People don&#x27;t care (since we&#x27;re the only two people in this issue, that&#x27;s my hypothesis).<ul>

<p>Just thought of something: those people would probably argue that a max width requires them to scroll more vertically, so maybe the max width should be 120? Or you could argue that the terminal&#x27;s actual width is the prefered width, but I&#x27;ve found that to rarely be the case as the terminal tends to be in-editor or tiled by a window manager these days. If not, then the default starting width for a terminal width is 80 AFAIK, so this change wouldn&#x27;t affect those people.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d like to also clarify why I believe this is a regression, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting through. In clap 3, the default width was 100 because the <code>wrap_help</code> feature was disabled by default. In clap 4, you <em>must</em> enabled the <code>wrap_help</code> feature to get any wrapping which means people who just want some default wrapping as before will reach for <code>wrap_help</code>. The fact that text wrapping is tied to the terminal width is actually something I&#x27;m not a huge fan of, but that&#x27;s a separate discussion.</p>
<p>My point is that by forcing people to use their terminal width to get any wrapping at all, the distinction between devs saying &quot;I want my users to be terminal wrapped&quot; vs &quot;I want wrapping of any kind&quot; has been lost. And this issue is arguing that it&#x27;s better to cater to the &quot;I want wrapping of any kind&quot; people because they are necessarily a superset of the &quot;I want my users to be terminal wrapped&quot; people (though I guess that&#x27;s bad logic because the set difference could still be smaller, but I don&#x27;t think it is).</p>

<p>Side note, I think I&#x27;m just starting to hit this more personally because I have a vertical monitor and primarily use i3. So it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to have a terminal window that is less than 120 characters wide (...it&#x27;s 104 characters wide, I just counted...).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The motivating factor behind this issue is to discuss if there is a better way to handle small terminals by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to the other quote I posted, the problem solved by using the terminal width seems to be about when it&#x27;s too thin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linus rant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to be about 80 chars specifically, so let&#x27;s not do that. I&#x27;m leaning more towards 120?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I believe 100 is good, especially when rust uses 100 too haha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A point in favor of 100.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter, I guess. It&#x27;s just the problem is pretty much non-pressing, it generates much more discussion than it worth, and it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re making some sort of hard decision here - we can always revise it in future. We&#x27;re all in agreement that 100 is a good choice, so let&#x27;s just get it over with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x27;s a great summary of how I feel about this issue. I just sunk another 1.5 hrs into it, and for what? To me, it was self-evident that <em>some</em> max width was better than none because every modern website ever, the existence of books, newspapers, etc uses some max width. I should have been quicker to see that you don&#x27;t share that axium and given you arguments to support it. But also, now I&#x27;m sad that I&#x27;ve lost so much time to an issue that seemed trivial to me.</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that the documentation for <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/4.0.29/clap/builder/struct.Command.html#method.max_term_width">Command::max_term_width</a> seems to be wrong. It says</p>

<p>That would be my preference, but it is not how it behaves.  Instead, the help is wrapped to the dynamically determined terminal width.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Originally, wrapping itself was an external dependency but was always forced on.  <code>wrap_help</code> didn&#x27;t pull in the wrapping dependency but the term-width detection.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve re-implemented the text wrapping code internally but whether its internal or not makes less of a difference (besides people who play dependency golf which I disagree with).</p>
<p>So rather than forcing a dependency to be always on, we&#x27;ve consolidated wrapping related features to <code>wrap_help</code>.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s true, but under the assumption that this isn&#x27;t any more of a breaking change than the other help tweaks, there are only a few options:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The case not being handled is if someone is already setting one or both values.  If someone is setting the term width to a hard coded value and we set max term width to be less than that, we&#x27;ve violated expectations from the given API</p>
