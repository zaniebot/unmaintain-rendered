Clap Version
<p>clap-3.1.8</p>
Describe your use case
<p>The <code>cargo</code> feature exposes is_valid() as workaround but it makes quite cumbersome to deal with code that has similar needs.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Adding a setting to simply return None would spare quite a bit of boilerplate.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>Make so the <code>cargo</code> feature re-enable the former behavior.</p>
Additional Context
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<p>Can you go into more detail.  What are you doing, how, and why.  Understanding what people are trying to accomplish with a request is important for shaping features.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The <code>cargo</code> feature is for not for the needs of cargo.  In fact, cargo doesn&#x27;t enable it.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap#optional-features">README</a></p>

<p>cargo: Turns on macros that read values from CARGO_* environment variables.</p>

<p>cargo has multiple applets and some codepaths are common and they rely now on <code>is_valid()</code> to simulate what previously was simply the use of <code>value_of()</code> and managing the None path.</p>

<p>Sorry, I meant treat it as the <code>is_valid*()</code> set of functions that cargo uses.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#x27;m the one who ported cargo to clap3 and added <code>is_valid</code> for that purpose.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m taking it from your comments that you are depending directly on cargo and are re-using its flag definitions and flag reading?</p>
