<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.48</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have a tool I'm writing that needs to get a directory name, for compatibility it needs to read that from <code>$DB_DIR</code>, but since that's awfully generic (it can read from several different pre-built databases depending on the command you give it), I want to also have it read that same argument from something like <code>$PRJXRAY_DB_DIR</code> so I can have all the different database env vars set by default in the podman container so you don't need to supply them every time.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>support setting multiple different <code>env</code> vars on a single <code>Arg</code>, with prioritization if more than one of the env vars turn out to be set.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>manually handle reading env vars after parsing the command line.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
