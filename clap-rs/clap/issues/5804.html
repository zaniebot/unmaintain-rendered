Rust Version
<p>rustc 1.82.0 (f6e511eec 2024-10-15)</p>
Clap Version
<p>4.5.19</p>
Minimal reproducible code
<pre><code>use clap::{ArgAction, Parser};
use clap::builder::TypedValueParser;

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Config {
    #[clap(
        short = &#x27;c&#x27;,
        action = ArgAction::Count, 
        value_parser = clap::value_parser!(u8).map(CleanLevel::from_val)
    )]
    clean: Option&lt;CleanLevel&gt;
}

#[derive(Clone)]
enum CleanLevel {
    Untracked,
    All,
}

impl CleanLevel {
    fn from_val(val: u8) -&gt; Option&lt;Self&gt; {
        match val {
            0 =&gt; None,
            1 =&gt; Some(CleanLevel::Untracked),
            2.. =&gt; Some(CleanLevel::All),
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let config = Config::parse();
    let _ = config.clean;
}
</code></pre>
<p>playground: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=ba6ae5eae9e9514d276dc40d5479cf5e</p>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<p><code>cargo run</code></p>
Actual Behaviour
<p>At runtime, clap panics with the following message:</p>
<pre><code>thread &#x27;main&#x27; panicked at /playground/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/clap_builder-4.5.19/src/builder/debug_asserts.rs:696:9:
assertion `left == right` failed: Argument `clean`&#x27;s selected action Count contradicts `value_parser` (ValueParser::other(core::option::Option&lt;playground::CleanLevel&gt;))
  left: u8
 right: core::option::Option&lt;playground::CleanLevel&gt;
</code></pre>
Expected Behaviour
<p>I would expect that the value parser is called to produce a <code>u8</code> and then <code>CleanLevel::from_val</code> is called on the parsed value to map to an <code>Option&lt;CleanLevel&gt;</code>. It seems the sequence of events in parsing is somehow wrong, or maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding how <code>MapValueParser</code> works.</p>
Additional Context
<p>The alternative solution is to make use of an intermediate struct and a method on that struct, like so:</p>
<pre><code>use clap::{ArgAction, Args, Parser};

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Config {
    #[clap(flatten)]
    clean: Clean,
}

#[derive(Args, Clone)]
struct Clean {
    #[clap(short = &#x27;c&#x27;, action = ArgAction::Count)]
    count: u8
}

impl Clean {
    fn level(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;CleanLevel&gt; {
        match self.count {
            0 =&gt; None,
            1 =&gt; Some(CleanLevel::Untracked),
            2.. =&gt; Some(CleanLevel::All),
        }
    }
}

enum CleanLevel {
    Untracked,
    All,
}

fn main() {
    let config = Config::parse();
    let _ = config.clean.level();
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, this introduces extra clutter and indirection. It would be great to avoid using an intermediate representation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When you pass <code>clap::value_parser!(u8).map(CleanLevel::from_val</code> to clap, you are passing in an adapter from an <code>OsStr</code> to a <code>CleanLevel</code>.  The intermediate <code>u8</code> is transient and never shared with clap and  clap doesn&#x27;t know how to increment <code>CleanLevel</code>.</p>
<p>For this to work, we&#x27;d need to do one of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a derive-specific adapter (we had this with clap v3 and that was what value_parser was working to replace)</li>
<li>We build into the concept of our value parser the ability to increment, with it erroring by default.  However, this is a fairly specialized operation and doesn&#x27;t scale to other needs</li>
<li>We allow value parsers to mutate the collection the value gets stored into, either appending or incrementing as needed.  This would be a major re-work and would require some very careful <code>dyn</code> trait design to allow all of the interactions to play  out.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for workarounds...</p>
<p>We take the &quot;intermediate&quot; struct approach in https://docs.rs/clap-verbosity-flag/latest/clap_verbosity_flag/</p>
<p>The conversion can also be a helper method on <code>Config</code> which I do for other types of data in my CLIs.</p>

<p>This seems solvable by introducing a trait called something like <code>Counter</code>, with an <code>increment</code> method, like you mentioned. In the case of <code>CleanLevel</code>, the state machine implements a kind of saturating addition, and auto-implementing this functionality would be hard via <code>#[derive(Counter)]</code>, but a manual implementation would work fine. Default implementations for integers and potentially one for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> (<code>0 =&gt; None</code>) would work well IMO.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Could you elaborate on this point? Yes, likely this new trait would be closely coupled to <code>ArgAction::Count</code>, but that could be made clear with a good name. Arguably this is a relatively simple generalization to make to allow using arbitrary types as counters, enabling better state machines while staying pretty self-contained.</p>

<p>We are effectively operating on a <code>Box&lt;Any&gt;</code> for the intermediate state due to the dynamic nature of clap.  We can&#x27;t easily access a trait like <code>Counter</code>.</p>

<p>I was specifically referring to baking in the information for this behavior in <code>ValueParser</code> which is what has knowledge of the concrete type.  This is unrelated to a &quot;new trait&quot; solution.</p>
