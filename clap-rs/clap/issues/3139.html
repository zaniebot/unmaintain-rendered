<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.0.0-rc.1</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I started looking into upgrading <code>cargo-cache</code> https://github.com/matthiaskrgr/cargo-cache to clap 3 and right at the clap started crashing it because I was checking for undefined args which is great because it found a couple of bugs. :)</p>
<p>I had a couple of cases where I defined a subcommand name <code>foo</code> and then later checked <code>ArgMatches.is_present(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>, essentially defining <code>cargo-cache foo</code> but then coding for <code>cargo-cache --foo</code> later on.</p>
<p>It's one of these &quot;how could that ever work??&quot; moments :laughing:</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at '`'local' is not a name of an argument or a group.`
</code></pre>
<p>It would be great if the clap runtime when it is passed a <code>--local</code> and does not expect  one, could also check if there is a <code>local</code> subcommand defined and print that in the suggestion:</p>
<p><code>It looks like you have defined a &quot;local&quot; subcommand. Did you intend to code &quot;subcommand_matches()&quot; instead of &quot;is_present()&quot;?</code>
or something like this :)</p>

<p>Good idea! Coding it up now</p>

<p>We actually used to support subcommands with <code>is_present</code>, that was one of the breaking changes in the release.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>another small thing: I noticed the none-RUST_BACKTRACE=1 message showed the panic source as inside the clap source in the cargo cache.
I wonder if you can slap <code>#[track_caller]</code> on a bunch of things so that the displayed none-backtrace line already shows where the problem originates from in MY code (and not where the is a <code>panic</code> or whatever is in claps code :) )</p>
<p>EDIT: nvm just saw the PR already adds track caller :heart:
looking forward to rc2 then :D</p>
