### Rust Version

1.60

### Clap Version

2.34

### Minimal reproducible code

In my code, I use `structopt 0.3.25` however when I try to run my program it gives me the following error: 

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Argument short must be unique

        -f is already in use', C:\Users\<user>\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\clap-2.34.0\src\app\parser.rs:190:13
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
error: process didn't exit successfully: `C:\Users\<user>\texc_rev2\target\debug\texcreate.exe` (exit code: 101)
```

I tried adding the `debug` feature on `structopt` and got the following error: 
```
error[E0252]: the name `OsStrExt3` is defined multiple times
  --> C:\Users\<user>\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\clap-2.34.0\src\app\parser.rs:19:5

error: could not compile `clap` due to previous error
```

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

cargo run 

### Actual Behaviour

Currently whenever I run my program it shows me this issue, and quite honestly annoys me because I have no idea how to solve this issue on my end. 

### Expected Behaviour

Usually whenever I run `cargo run` I should get the help message of the program but all I get is this error, so I can't further publish patches to my crate when I have no idea if it works or not 

### Additional Context

_No response_

### Debug Output

_No response_
