            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Make sure you completed the following tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[ ] Searched the closed issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>The Apache-2.0 license requires so that full text of a license will be present along with sources. However since clap stuff gets published on crates.io separately, tarballs of clap_derive do not include LICENSE files.</p>
<p>For example, see: https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/clap_derive/3.0.0-beta.2/download#/clap_derive-3.0.0-beta.2.crate</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>License files included in all clap sub-crates.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>Not I am aware of.</p>
