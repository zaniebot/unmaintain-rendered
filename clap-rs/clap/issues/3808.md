# Port `required_if_eq` to the typed API

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2022-06-09 14:01_

With #3732, we now have a typed API.  We should support typing in the rest of the API rather than relying on raw values.

This requires the ability to compare values.

I would suggest `TypedValueParser` gaining
```rust
fn partial_eq(&self) -> Option<bool> {
    None
}
```

We would then provide it for all of the built-in value parsers.  The question is if we should make `PartialEq` a requirement for the `FromStr` blanket impl.
