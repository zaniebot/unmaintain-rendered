Clap Version
<p>master  879dd23963f6ed968535d6ed7bc6f192f02a0a16</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I have a bunch of messages defined in protobuf, I&#x27;d like to make a CLI to send those messages - <code>clap</code> should be able to parse the messages from terminal. I generate rust structs from protobuf definitions using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/prost">prost</a> and I can automatically add <code>clap_derive</code> attributes, but I can&#x27;t specify the attributes flexibly enough to solve my use-case.</p>
<p>Problematic cases are when one struct contains another optional struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct A {
   simple: u32,
   inner: Option&lt;B&gt;
}

struct B {
   a: u32,
   b: String,
}
</code></pre>
<p>When automatically adding attributes, I can differentiate between protobuf native (u32, bool, ..) types and complex types (another struct), but I don&#x27;t know if the complex type is <code>Option&lt;B&gt;</code> or <code>Option&lt;C&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>What I want is to parse these complex types (for example <code>A::inner</code>) from from json string from the command line. The default value in this case should be None (empty string), which is simple enough to implement currently. But, I&#x27;d also like to generate an example json value for the Some case in the CLI help. But what annotation can I add to the field <code>A::inner</code>, where I only know that its a optional struct, but don&#x27;t know which struct type (B or C) it actually is?</p>
<p>Its really easy for me to write a function to generate the string:</p>
<pre><code>fn example_json&lt;T: serde::Serialize&gt;(t: T) -&gt; &amp;&#x27;static str { todo!() } 
</code></pre>
<p>All I&#x27;d need to have some attribute in <code>clap_derive</code> to call that function and I don&#x27;t need to know which type is <code>A::inner</code></p>
<pre><code>#[derive(clap::Parser)]
struct A {
   simple: u32,
   #[clap(about = example_json]
   inner: Option&lt;B&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>which should call something like this in the right place:</p>
<pre><code>Arg::about(arg, example_json::&lt;Option&lt;B&gt;&gt;())
</code></pre>
<p><code>default_value_t</code> attribute actually does exactly the type-based fn specialization - I&#x27;d just like to be able to provide the generic fn and have it specialized by the field type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you! This context helps a lot!</p>
<p>So you are wanting to determine the value for an attribute based on the type of the field it is applied to, with the example being given of dynamically generating <code>about</code>, instead of manually doing it, to help with your code-gen use case.</p>
<p>This seems quite specialized.  The first question to answer is if this is needed and then the second is how.</p>
<p>A key part stuck out in your comment</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#x27;t know if the complex type is <code>Option&lt;B&gt;</code> or <code>Option&lt;C&gt;</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what is leading you to wanting to defer to clap to generate this information.  Could you help me understand this problem a little more?  I&#x27;m wanting to learn more about how this clap struct generation is happening to see how all of this fits together and if there is a better, more general solution here.</p>
<p>If we do move forward with this,  <code>clap::Arg::modify_fn</code>  doesn&#x27;t quite make sense on its own, only in the context of <code>clap_derive</code>.  I wonder if we can instead do this purely within <code>clap_derive</code>.</p>
<p>Its also unclear how <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2683">clap-rs/clap#2683</a> might impact any API design on <code>clap</code> in the future.</p>
