# Move completions / manpage generation to sub-crate

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2017-05-09 21:51_

Specifically the shell completion and manpage generation (once it lands).

Since the Custom Derive bits are in `clap_derive` I'd like to move the completions and manpage generation parts to `clap_generate`

Anyone who wants to start on this I'll add to the `clap-rs` Github org which is also where this repo and all clap related sub crates will eventually be moved to.

Completions have been moved on v3-master. They will remain in deprecated form until v3-beta at which point they will *only* exist in the clap_generate crate.
