<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I've recently learned that <code>num_args</code> and <code>value_delimiter</code> don't work as I've imagined when used together</p>
<p>I would assume if I provided</p>
<p><code>num_args=0..=2</code>
and
<code>value_delimiter=','</code></p>
<p>I would be able to enforce 0 to 2 comma separated args. However this isn't the case...</p>
<p>Based on the discussion <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4469">here</a> <code>value_delimiter</code> doesnt support <code>num_args</code> in the case of variable arg limits (i.e. <code>0..=2</code>)</p>
<p>This seems odd to me, and forces me to write my own post processing logic. In my opinion supporting variable arg limits w/ a custom value delimiter is a pretty standard use case in CLI land, and it would be really nice if clap could support this out of the box.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I would like num_args and value_parser to work together, or alternatively provide some other attribute that I can use to easily set variable arg limits on a flag w/ a custom value delimiter.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>num_args</code> controls how many values of <code>std::env::args_os()</code> to capture and to reduce the chance of confusion is why we didn't name it <code>num_values</code>.</p>
<p>Previously, we did have <code>min_values</code> and <code>max_values</code> which were about how many values total are resent for an argument.  This was across occurrences.</p>
<p>Considering we have</p>
<ul>
<li>Validation for number of arguments (which also affects parsing)</li>
<li>Validation across occurrences</li>
<li>Validation within occurrences</li>
</ul>
<p>And trying to manage these, it doesn't quite work to cover every case especially since we are also trying to weigh out</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary size</li>
<li>Build times</li>
<li>API bloat (the larger the API, the harder it is to discover whats there, the less value people get out of the API)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides post-validation, this an also be handled by a custom <code>value_parser</code> and, depending on the use case, might be more appropriate as controlling for the number of values suggests more structured data and we have value_delimiter more geared towards unstructured data.  value_parser works much better for that.</p>
<p>We've also been exploring the idea of user-extended validation, see #3476</p>
<p>In light of this, I'm going to go ahead and close this. If there is a reason we should revisit this decision, let us know!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the detailed response, its much appreciated</p>
<p>re: custom <code>value_parser</code> as far as I can understand value parser gets called for each argument</p>
<p>i.e. --some-flag val1,val2,val3
value parser will be called three times (for val1 val2 and val3 respectively). Is there a way to get clap to execute some custom value parsing method once for the range of values?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you don't pass a <code>value_delimiter</code>, then <code>value_parser</code> will be called once and handle the delimited values.</p>
