            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The argument expands to git bash root folder. This doesn't happen with other commands (<code>echo /foo</code> works fine)
When the argument has only one letter (<code>/a</code>) it expands to <code>A:/</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you run with the debug output, as requested in the template, you'll likely see that clap is just subject to whatever <code>std::env::args_os</code> returns and that this problem is likely an error in something before clap gets it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we've already confirmed that this is just <code>clap</code> using the args that it gets provided. Someone even made a demo program in C already (https://github.com/chmln/sd/pull/208#issuecomment-1746817623)</p>
<p>It's just some weird automagical path replacement that happens</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, even in C it doesn't capture argv correctly but it would be nice if clap provided a fix.
Most Rust CLI programs depend on this and git bash is widely used in Windows so if a general fix were to be possible this would be the place for it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1</code> solves it, but I don't think it's possible to use this without making the user do it.</p>

<p>We also don't automatically integrate <code>wild</code> or <code>argfile</code> but rely on people to do that directly.  We'd need a lot more information to make the decision to unilaterally workaround this for people (if there is even a way to workaround it), like why MSYS does this and if it is universally viewed (even by MSYS maintainers) as wrong.</p>
