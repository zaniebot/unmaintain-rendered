            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Look at the generated completion</p>

<p>The condition after <code>-n</code> is simplify as <code>true &amp;&amp; not true</code> which equates to <code>false</code>, so the completion is never taken into account.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I'm understanding this correctly, the way fish has us process subcommands is that we check if a subcommand has been seen and then give options for what can happen within that subcommand.</p>
<p>It sounds like there isn't a way to process nested subcommands then because we can only check for set membership and not hierarchy.  This would imply a lot more is broken then the case mentioned and likely can only be fixed with #3166.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert in fish completion. So maybe cc @mqudsi for help.</p>
<p>I'll close the issue if there is no respond for a week.
Sorry for waiting your time.</p>
