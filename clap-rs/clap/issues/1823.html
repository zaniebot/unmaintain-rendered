            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is much reason because <code>help</code> in <code>App</code> is different semantically than <code>help</code> in <code>Arg</code> which would end up confusing the users. This should fix it and make it consistent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Help is about the full help message. About concerns only the description.</p>
<p>I don't want to keep <code>Arg::help</code> behaviour the same and keep it deprecated. I want to make it similar to how <code>App::help</code> behaves, by making it replace the full help text of an argument rather than the generated one.</p>
<p>The generated help contains other things like possible values, default values etc.. which should completely be replaced if <code>help</code> was specified.</p>

<p>So, you are going to change the behavior of a very frequently used function without changing its signature. If you ask me - or don't, but I'll tell you anyway - this is spectacularly bad idea. Just because old habits die <em>hard</em>. This will spread a lot of confusion among users, a lot more than the benefit from having the API unified will ever be. If you want to pull such a drastic change - rename the method.</p>
<p>For the record - I kind of see Dylan's point. People are already got used to about/help difference. But I also see why we may want to make the API consistent.</p>
<p>My call - let's ask for forgiveness, not for permission. We do this, we push the beta outdoors, receive feedback, revert if the feedback turns out to be largely negative.</p>

<p>I agree which is why it took me such a long time to create the issue. I had been thinking about this since I started working on clap. It kept bothering me that the help related stuff is very inconsistent between <code>App</code> and <code>Arg</code>. I want to do a <code>HelpBase</code> which extracts the common stuff and make it customisable.</p>
