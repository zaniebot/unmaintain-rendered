# Change help message when prompt skippable

_Issue opened by @dariocurr on 2023-05-23 12:41_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.3

### Describe your use case

When using the skippable prompt I get the same help message as the classic prompt

### Describe the solution you'd like

For example when I use a `Select`, the prompt help message is:
`"↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter"`

The when I use a `Select`, the skippable prompt help message should be something like this:
`"↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter, ESC to select none"`

### Alternatives, if applicable

_No response_

### Additional Context

I would like to contribute, but I guess I need some guidelines

Are you sure you opened this against the right crate?  clap does not have any prompt support

You're right, I was referring to [inquire](https://github.com/mikaelmello/inquire)
