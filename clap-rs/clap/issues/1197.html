            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Affected Version of clap</h3>
<p>2.30</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>An application can define multiple subcommands which are aliases of one another, just like for arguments.</p>
<p>For example, in an application I am currently writing, I'd like to have a subcommand called <code>remove</code>, however to make it easier for users, I would also like to have an alias to this subcommand called &quot;rm&quot;. This way, the application can be invoked in both of the following ways:</p>
<pre><code>$ myapp remove /path/to/file
$ myapp rm /path/to/file
</code></pre>
<h3>Sample Code or Link to Sample Code</h3>
<p>Ideally, the API would be similar to that of <code>clap::Arg</code>. So, it would be:</p>
<pre><code>SubCommand::with_name(&quot;remove&quot;)
    .alias(&quot;rm&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, the other similar API may be supported as well (<code>aliases</code>, <code>visible_alias</code>, etc.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Apparently, I was looking in the wrong location for the documentation. The <code>alias()</code> method is indeed available.</p>
<p>I was looking for it under <code>SubCommand</code>, instead of <code>App</code>.</p>
