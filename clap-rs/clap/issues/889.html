            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m trying to help make a project&#x27;s help messages consistent, and all of the messages are of the format &quot;Start …&quot;, &quot;Check …&quot;, &quot;Print …&quot;, so the &quot;Prints  version information&quot; stands out. I was unable to find an easy way to replace only the help and version messages without re-wiring the commands themselves. Is there any easy solution I missed, or is this something that would have to be added.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There isn&#x27;t a way to do this currently. You can override the <code>--version</code> by supplying a flag with the long of <code>version</code>. The only downside to doing this, is you&#x27;ll need to check if it was used and print the version/exit accordingly. But that&#x27;s only about 3 lines of code, so in practice it&#x27;s not too bad.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would be willing to consider it, sure! I don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to work on it right now, but would gladly look at a PR adding it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So I&#x27;m working on this, and am wondering what you think the methods should be called. On args it&#x27;s <code>help</code>, but with the help arg that gets awkward. Do you prefer <code>help_message</code> and <code>version_message</code>, <code>help_help</code> and <code>version_help</code>,  or something else?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also, where in the yaml should these customizations end up? Based on the <code>help_short</code> and <code>version_short</code> it looks like they should top level?</p>
