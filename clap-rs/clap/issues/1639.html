            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like to add <code>help</code> strings, and sometimes <code>long_help</code> strings to all of my arguments, but I often forget.</p>
<p>It would be nice if I could add options to make app creation fail if help and long help strings are accidentally omitted. Perhaps <code>AppSettings::RequireHelp</code> and <code>AppSettings::RequireLongHelp</code>.</p>
<p>So this would panic on the call to <code>App::arg</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let app = App::new(env!(&quot;CARGO_PKG_NAME&quot;))
  .setting(AppSettings::RequireHelp)
  .arg(
    Arg::with_name(&quot;foo&quot;) // no help :(
  );
</code></pre>
<p>And this would be ok:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let app = App::new(env!(&quot;CARGO_PKG_NAME&quot;))
  .setting(AppSettings::RequireHelp)
  .arg(
    Arg::with_name(&quot;foo&quot;).help(&quot;It does foo stuff&quot;) // help :)
  );
</code></pre>
<p><code>App::arg</code> doesn't return a <code>Result</code>, but I think panicking is okay, since this is intended to aid development, and should not be encountered by end users. It would also be possible to make <code>AppSettings::RequireHelp</code> a noop on release builds.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi everybody, I just wanted to let you know that I started working on this. I will try to propose a solution via a pull request within the next 5 days. Since I am new to rust, clap, and the GitHub workflow, it will probably need some reviews and iterations.</p>

<p>I originally tried with that tutorial, but the &quot;link&quot; thing was grayed out and not clickable.</p>
