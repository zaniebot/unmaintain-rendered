Additional Context
<p>Going to the docs homepage: <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/">https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/</a> and clicking on the builder reference link just takes you to the same page (i.e. same as a refresh). I was expecting to be redirected to the reference like I was for the corresponding <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html">derive</a> reference link</p>

<p>Probably being too clever with that link but I feel something should be there. Maybe <code>current page</code> (no link)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I’ve also been confused by this several times in the past. I mean, I sort of get it when I think about it, but it’s not what I intuitively expect to see when I click on a “builder reference” link. Most of the text on that landing page isn’t even specific to the builder API, nor would I call it a reference except for the list of types/traits/macros at the bottom.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be more helpful to link specifically to the rustdoc pages of <code>Command</code> and <code>Arg</code>, since those are the closest equivalent for the derive reference page in that they’re where I usually go to look up how to do something that I assume must be supported but I don’t know what it’s called.</p>
