<h3>Version</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rust</strong>: <code>rustc 1.44.0-nightly (b2e36e6c2 2020-04-22)</code></li>

<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>Notice the weird line breaks</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>No weird line breaks</p>
<h3>Additional context</h3>
<p>May relate to #1642 because if all <code>long_help</code> items are less than 120 chars in width, the issue linked there goes away.</p>

<p>That was the original functionality, and only changed later as people requested a smaller default. I can't remember if the <code>max|min_term_width</code> came before or after those requests though. It's possible those didn't exist at the time and picking some sane-ish default (120) is what we landed on.</p>
<p>The counter argument to no wrapping is that if your help string is over whatever the average full screen width is (of course will vary by font, size, and resolution) such that the words will wrap no matter what, then no wrapping at all looks bad as well.</p>
<p>In fact, even help lines slightly over 120 don't look great. So wrapping <em>does</em> help.</p>
<p>The other option we have is that we could <em>lower</em> the default to 100 or even 80 so that most programs look good. If your terminal is less than 80 chars, you probably expect some kind of oddity to be honest. We lose a decent number of effective characters just through the flag/option (20-40 chars on average?), so 80 might actually be too small without having help messages that just always wrap. 100 might be the sweet spot.</p>
<p>A quick look at grep.app shows nearly all uses of <code>max_term_width</code> are <code>max_term_width(100)</code>.</p>
<p>Side note, I think I'm just starting to hit this more personally because I have a vertical monitor and primarily use i3. So it's not uncommon for me to have a terminal window that is less than 120 characters wide (...it's 104 characters wide, I just counted...).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It had me thinking: why don't we just query the terminal width and use it to insert breaks instead of a preset/hardcoded default? Oh right, <code>wrap_help</code> is optional... which raises the question of why it's optional.</p>
<p>Compilation time? Nope, it was the same with and without the feature on the build server (release build).</p>
<p>Code size? Lol, enabling the feature <em>decreased</em> the size by ~ 0.1Kb.</p>
<p>That said, my call is simple: ditch the feature as pretty useless and remove the hardcoded breaks, using terminal size instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I'm <em>very</em> inclined to agree with you, there is a non-negligible portion of the Rust community that is anti-dependency, or at least wants their dep graph as small as possible. I don't really agree with that line of thinking, other than cutting out dependencies that actually can cause bloat for little gain.</p>
<p>Based off those stats, perhaps we add it to the default list of features, which still allows those to disable if they so choose We could lower the default max term size to 100 at the same time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Along those same lines but also a separate issue entirely, at some point I would like to have the discussion about aggressive cargo feature use. Ideally, all non-essential sections of clap could be disabled (but enabled by default) to allow small binary sizes when desired. I've had quite a few people / companies approach me about clap's binary size being their only issue. In fact, I believe that is the number one factor that led Google to work on <code>argh</code>, was binary size is their top concern (for Fuschia) and don't need a lot of the &quot;extra&quot; features that clap provides.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On the other hand, people from this anti-dependency camp likely see clap as bloat-full and having too much allegedly unneeded deps irrespective of <code>term_size</code>. Clap already pulls 7 crates in <code>--no-default-features</code> mode, 22 in <code>default-features</code> mode, and 27 in <code>all-features</code> mode; one extra crate - very tiny and very useful btw - won't change their opinion. It's kind of all-or-nothing situation, 8 deps (including transitive) kind of count as &quot;as small as possible&quot;. I really doubt any of them would become our user if we feature-gate one or two tiny crates.</p>
<p>That's not to mention that clap itself takes as much time to build as (almost) all of the deps combined, and the compilation time is a <em>much</em> more common complaint among users (in my view). Along with code bloat, which would only decrease without this feature.</p>
<hr />
<p>Regarding modularization of clap.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about it too, for some time, and I've come to conclusion that, while it's doable - to some extent, it would require full-scale refactoring. And by full-scale I mean &quot;rewrite the parser and the validator entirely&quot; which is quite an endeavor.</p>
<p>But yeah, we can talk about it, it's not impossible.</p>

<p>Hmm... Hmm... Uhuh.</p>
<p>Well, the <code>grep</code> argument isn't really applicable to clap's help output because help descriptions tend to be multi-line anyway. The only thing people grep from the <code>--help</code> output would be the name of an option or subcommand or whatever, and you <em>do</em> expect the description to be multi-line in many cases, wrapping or not.</p>
<p>I pretty much agree with everything else.</p>
<p>Honestly, I feel like we're running in circles here. Given that we aren't subscribing to using <code>wrap_help</code> unconditionally (I disagree, but it's not so important to be arguing about), can we just decide on the default number? 120 is good for me personally, and I think 100 is a sane choice.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can we make it depends on the terminal width user have rather than giving our own opinion of default? We could look into <code>$COLUMNS</code> for this. But of course, we wouldn't want anyone using long terminals to suffer. But still, even if I have long terminals, I would prefer to read short lines since it is hard to read a line that is 120 characters long, I might easily jump on to the next or previous line.</p>
<p>Sadly, I am still using 106 or 87 columns width so application from nodejs that expects even a mere 100 do wrapping that makes my eye bleed. I am probably similar to one of the guy that he mentioned complained about compiling the kernel from raspberry pi 4 with 4GB of RAM, I compile rust from a ~10 years old laptop (thinkpad x220) and complained that it took 5+ hours.</p>

<p>That's when <code>wrap_help</code> is enabled. This issue is about a sane default when it is disabled. Of course we can use <code>$COLUMNS</code> but it's not always available. This issue is about the default when it's not available.</p>
