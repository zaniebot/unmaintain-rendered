<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.38</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have a subcommand with 20+ flags. A small subset of these are common flags, while the rest are for advanced features.</p>
<p>Showing <em>all</em> the flags in <code>--help</code> is quite noisy; I would ideally like to have a <code>--help</code> where only the common flags are shown and a <code>--help-all</code> where all of the flags are shown. There doesn't seem to be a good mechanism to do this today?</p>
<p>The suggestion in #4687 is to use <code>-h</code> and <code>--help</code>, which doesn't work super great for me because the users of my CLI have all gotten accustomed to using <code>--help</code>. Further, it's not particularly ergonomic to write a custom <code>--help</code> flag for myself because my subcommands are defined in separate crates (where I have a main binary crate that depends on each subcommand crate), so there's no way for me to grab a <code>CommandFactory</code> to customize <code>--help</code>.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I was thinking of something like <code>hide_unless_present</code>, along the lines of <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.required_unless_present"><code>required_unless_present</code></a>. Then you could write a subcommand like so:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Args)]
struct Foo {
    #[arg(long)]
    common_flag: Option&lt;String&gt;,

    #[arg(long, hide_unless_present = &quot;help_all&quot;)]
    advanced_flag: Option&lt;String&gt;,

    /// Show advanced feature flags.
    #[arg(long, action = ArgAction::HelpLong)]
    help_all: (),
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ah I brought up the multi-crate aspect because one way you could achieve this is by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parse args (that include some <code>--help-all</code> flag)</li>
<li>If <code>--help-all</code> is used, then create a command factory, override <code>hide</code> for a set of arguments, then call <code>print_help</code> on that new <code>Command</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this only works if you have access to the top-level CommandFactory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>#[arg(long, action = ArgAction::HelpLong, global = true)]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, suppose this works, though you're still limited to only having two &quot;versions&quot; of the help page. I.e. you could not have something like <code>--help-feature-one</code> and <code>--help-feature-two</code>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yeah -- the solution I had in mind was to pass <em>just</em> the first argument that triggers <code>HelpLong</code> to <code>write_help</code>. If you wanted some &quot;additive&quot; functionality, that's where <code>hide_unless_present_any</code> comes in.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, the original request was only for two forms of help.  I'm ok with entertaining the idea of different flavors of help beyond short/long <em>but</em> it shouldn't be theoretical but a case we can concretely talk about <em>and</em> a clear example of why its important or generally applicable.</p>
<p>Generally when I've seen people want more than two topics, they tend to instead have &quot;help topics&quot; in a help subcommand. That is something we don't help with atm.  If we went down the route of N flavors of help, I don't feel comfortable with <code>hide_unless_present</code> as I feel that over generalizes into a way that can be confusing for users approaching this as they are likely to assume that arguments after <code>--help</code> can affect <code>--help</code>.</p>
