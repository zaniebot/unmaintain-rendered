<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>master</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Single click environment setup.
This can be used to speed up the setting up of development environments for new contributors along with not having to install dependences directly on machines.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have a devcontainer manifest file that describes a working environment.
More information can be found on the link below:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>VM Images could be a substitute, but they are more complicated to deploy and are much more resource heavy than containers.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>This would make the project slightly more beginner friendly resulting in the possibility of a wider set of contributors. This increase would result in the growth the community and an increase in the number of community contributions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not normally a fan of tying repos to specific editors.  For instance, I generally recommend user-wide ignores for stray editor files, rather than per-project ignores.</p>
<p>In particular, this sets specific policies of what tools are for use by the user.</p>
