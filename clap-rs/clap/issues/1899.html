            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm porting an app from StructOpt to Clap using the derive methods in the current Git HEAD version. The original app used <code>clap::AppSettings::InferSubcommands)</code>, and also later made use of <code>#[clap(external_subcommand)]</code>. This combo wasn't a problem in StructOpt, but it fails with Clap derive.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use clap::Clap;

#[derive(Clap, Debug)]
#[clap(setting = AppSettings::InferSubcommands)]
struct Opt {
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    cmd: Command,
}

#[derive(Clap, Debug)]
enum Command {
    #[clap(external_subcommand)]
    Other(Vec&lt;String&gt;),
}

fn main() {
    let _ = Opt::parse();
}
