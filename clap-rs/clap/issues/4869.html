<h3>Rust Version</h3>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.0</p>
<h3>Minimal reproducible code</h3>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use clap::Parser;
use clap::CommandFactory;

fn main() {
    let matches = OptFoo::command().try_get_matches_from(std::env::args()).unwrap();

    println!(&quot;matches foo-bar: {:?}&quot;, matches.try_get_one::&lt;bool&gt;(&quot;foo-bar&quot;));
    println!();
    println!(&quot;matches someflag: {:?}&quot;, matches.try_get_one::&lt;bool&gt;(&quot;someflag&quot;));
}

#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[allow(dead_code)]
struct OptFoo {
	#[clap(long, action)]
	foo_bar: bool,
	#[clap(long, action)]
	someflag: bool,
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code</h3>
<p>Do <code>cargo run -- --foo-bar --someflag</code></p>
<h3>Actual Behaviour</h3>
<p>It prints:</p>
<pre><code>matches foo-bar: Err(UnknownArgument)

matches someflag: Ok(Some(true))
</code></pre>
<h3>Expected Behaviour</h3>
<p>It prints:</p>
<pre><code>matches foo-bar: Ok(Some(true))

matches someflag: Ok(Some(true))
</code></pre>
<p>This is what Clap 3.0 did, you can confirm this by running the example with Clap 3.0, i've written it to compile fine there as well. This, this is a regression of 4.0.0.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>This caused https://github.com/est31/cargo-udeps/issues/151 where I list all the <code>cargo check</code> flags in a struct that derives <code>Parser</code>, so that they can be passed on to cargo, but where cargo internally does the equivalent of <code>arg_matches.try_get_one::&lt;bool&gt;(&quot;all-targets&quot;)</code> (it does it via an extension trait on ArgMatches, via a <code>fn flag(&amp;self, name: &amp;str) -&gt; bool</code> function).</p>
<h3>Debug Output</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We called this change out in the breaking changes for 4.0 under the &quot;subtle&quot; section, meaning these were the high priority ones to review when upgrading</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(derive) Leave Arg::id as verbatim casing, requiring updating of string references to other args like in conflicts_with or requires (#3282)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the workaroumd, it is better to use <code>id</code> rather than <code>name</code>.  Its an accident that <code>name</code>i is allowed and we'll be removing it in clap v5</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note, that changelog line is very terse and unless you know clap's internals, or you have been pointed towards it, you won't really be able to derive actionable advice from it.</p>
<p>Also, even if it is pointed out, maybe it's not the best idea to have that change, given it makes such hybrid uses harder.</p>

<p>Thanks, will do!</p>
<p>Question: if #3709 is implemented, will I be able to just specify that?</p>

<p>The change was made to improve the pure-derive workflow.  If you want to declare an arg to conflict with another arg, you now refer to it by the field's name, not what the long name or the value name would be, if it exists.  This improves discoverability of the behavior.</p>

<p>We have no plans for controlling naming of <code>id</code>, for the reason given above.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for informing me, and thanks for the advice. I guess it's a tradeoff decision in the end, although of course I'm not happy that the only way to use arguments both in cargo and cargo-udeps is to either make cargo-udeps not use derives, or to put an explicit <code>id</code> attribute everywhere. The bug in cargo-udeps was especially hard to debug because i didn't know if the bug was in cargo, cargo-udeps or clap. I guess most projects have it easier, given that most projects probably only expose a CLI API surface in a fraction of the size that cargo uses.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For my own projects, I recreate the cargo CLI, rather than reuse it (see <code>clap-cargo</code>).  Granted, if you are using cargo-as-a-library for other things then that might make sense.  I tend to avoid that as its not a well supported workflow (intentionally at the moment)</p>
