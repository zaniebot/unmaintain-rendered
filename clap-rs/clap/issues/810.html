            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems to be something of a pattern for apps to support completion via the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ source &lt;(app completion zsh)
# or
$ source &lt;(app completion bash)
</code></pre>
<p>It'd be nice if there were a helper on <code>App</code> so that we could call <code>.add_completion_subcommands()</code> and have this wired up automatically.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be an easy addition, although it'd probably get implemented as an <code>AppSettings</code> variant.</p>
<p>The one thing that gives me pause, is that I've seen this done in a few different ways by different applications, such as <code>$ prog completion[s] [--shell] &lt;shell&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Is the <code>prog completion &lt;shell&gt;</code> (singular form of &quot;completion&quot;) a standard? Because if it were only up to me, I'd implement it as <code>prog completions &lt;shell&gt;</code> (plural form of &quot;completion&quot; with a single positional argument accepting the shell name), but if there's a written standard I haven't seen I'd rather follow the standard.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know if one is more popular/&quot;standard&quot; than another. I thought I had other examples up my sleeve, but the only one I can think of now is <code>kubectl</code> which takes the form <code>kubectl completion zsh</code>. I have only a tiny preference for the subcommand style, rather than flag, but it seems to just be cosmetic.</p>

<p>The clap_generate package depends on clap. Won't this be a circular package dependency?
Also. I'm having trouble using <code>clap_generate</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's possible. We can make <code>clap_generate</code> just another module in <code>clap</code> (i.e it would be no longer a separate crate), possibly behind a feature flag.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Very convenient for end users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will no longer need the <code>#[doc(hidden)] pub</code> things.</p>
<p>Let me catch your attention here: currently, a lot of stuff in clap is <code>doc(hidden)</code> <em>precisely and only</em> because <code>clap_generate</code> needs it. It's much more that you might have thought; many things (<code>struct</code>s and <code>enum</code>s) are public only because they are parts of such a &quot;public&quot; field, or a part of some function's signature (also <code>pub hidden</code> one). The point is: this pseudo-publicity <em>expands</em> onto other things transitively, pulling them into the club even though they have no need to be publich.</p>
<p>In my estimation, about 30% of code is <code>pub hidden</code> now, and those erase the line between &quot;internal API used by <code>clap_generate</code>&quot; and really &quot;public API&quot;. Once/if we embrace the generate into the <code>clap</code> itself, we'll be able to change them to <code>pub(crate)</code>, <em>as it should be</em>. A big improvement if you ask me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong>
* <code>clap</code>'s own codebase would grow a bit. Well, we're the ones who's gonna have to maintain it one way or another 🤷‍♂ .</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The advantage is that you will not compile it if you don't use it. The other solution is features, and I personally prefer to keep features to the bare minimum as they complexify the code considerably.</p>
<p>But, having this implementation hole is quite dirty. I think the clean way would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>having the introspection API used by clap_generate public and documented</li>
<li>having clap_generate in the clap crate</li>
</ul>
<p>The second way seems easier now. But that's just my humble opinion, I didn't even seen the code.</p>

<p>That's gonna be one module level <code>cfg</code> and one another <code>cfg</code> somewhere in <code>AppSettings</code>. Sounds simple enough.</p>
<p>I've seen the code, I've been trying to implement an introspection API of sorts (you just read my mind 😃, ha!), and I feel like I'm failing. <code>calp_generate</code> and <code>clap</code> are <em>so</em> closely tied to each other that we may as well make them all public. I'll show you the result of this attempt soon, but I vote for pulling it into <code>clap</code>.</p>

<p>I hate to be rude, but that's actually not true at all. Just grep for <code>#[doc(hidden)]</code>: 140 matches across 17 files. Ridiculous.</p>
