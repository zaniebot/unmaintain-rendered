Unsure how to do it

### Additional Context

This was inspired by a [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/rbyi41/ann_clap_300rc0/hntxcdo/?context=3)

> One problem I've had with StructOpt before is a type conflict. If supplying some custom function to parse like this: #[clap(parse(func))]and func does some string processing and returns a bool, this means that the argument inside the struct cannot be a bool also, since that would imply that it wouldn't take a value. Same thing happens with Vec. Is this something that could be solved? I know a little bit about macros so I don't even think this could be changed but idk really.

We didn't carry the relevant [example](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/blob/master/examples/true_or_false.rs) forward for bool but we should have that in the derive ref and also talk about other types.
