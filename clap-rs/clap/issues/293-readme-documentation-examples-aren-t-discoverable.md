# README documentation/examples aren't discoverable from rustdoc docs

---

_Issue opened by @huonw on 2015-10-01 12:05_

Looking at http://kbknapp.github.io/clap-rs/clap/index.html, there's no indication that I can see that the wonderful README and in-tree examples exist. It'd be great if the crate at least had a brief header with a link, or even if most of docs in the README were moved to be in the rustdoc docs (especially the examples, like for the `clap_app!` macro).

Good idea! We used to have the full Readme in rustdoc but pulled it out when it started to get out of date. I'll add the relevant parts back as I agree with you. Thanks :+1:
