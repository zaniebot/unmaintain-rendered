            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So I'm working on a cargo subcommand and I now call cargo itself a couple of times during application via <code>std::process::Command</code>, however I need to detect if the user has added <code>cargo +nightly</code> before calling my command and was wondering how to do that with clap?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me make this clear: you're working on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands">a cargo plugin</a> and, for some reason, you need to detect if your plugin was called as <code>cargo +nightly plugin</code>.</p>
<p>If I'm right, I believe this is impossible because, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/bb3f2c59274dbf181f2d1a58c54486df4292ec2a/src/bin/cargo/main.rs#L120-L157">apparently</a>, cargo doesn't set any env vars or some info that would possibly allow you to sort it out. <code>clap</code> can't do anything about it, you should go to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues">the cargo bugtracker</a>.</p>
