<h3>Affected Version of clap</h3>
<p>2.29.4</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>Unsetting a setting that has been made global causes it to not affect the arg or subcommand.</p>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>The setting still applies.</p>
<h3>Sample Code or Link to Sample Code</h3>
<pre><code class="language-rust">extern crate clap;

use clap::{App, Arg, SubCommand, AppSettings};

fn main() {
  let args = App::new(&quot;app&quot;)
    .global_setting(AppSettings::ArgRequiredElseHelp)
    .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;arg1&quot;)
      .takes_value(true)
      .multiple(false)
      .required(false))
    .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name(&quot;sub&quot;)
      .unset_setting(AppSettings::ArgRequiredElseHelp)
      .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;arg2&quot;)
        .takes_value(true)
        .multiple(false)
        .required(false)))
    .get_matches();
  println!(&quot;{:#?}&quot;, args);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the subcommand, the only arg is optional, so I don't want <code>ArgRequiredElseHelp</code>, but the vast majority of other subcommands (in my use case) all benefit from <code>ArgRequiredElseHelp</code>.</p>
<p>I can see this is because it's unset in <code>settings</code> but not <code>g_settings</code>. Should <code>unset_setting</code> do both or should <code>unset_global_setting</code> be added? I'd be happy to PR if I knew which direction to go in.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You're spot on, and actually in v3 I side step this slightly by using <code>(un)set</code> and <code>(un)set_global</code> and actually differentiating the two. For v2 I think it's going to have to stay as is, because I fear changing it would be breaking change (i.e. if there are people relying the current behaviour).</p>
<p>I'm going to close this, however when v3 is released if this issue pops up please feel free to re-address it.</p>
