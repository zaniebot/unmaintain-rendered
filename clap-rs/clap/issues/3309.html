Clap Version
<p>3.0.7</p>
Describe your use case
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/uutils/coreutils">uutils/coreutils</a>, we are trying to move to clap 3. Some of the original GNU utilities have long options with 3 leading hyphens. This is done because these flags are undocumented and only used for testing purposes. Two examples are:</p>
<pre><code>rm ---presume-input-tty file1
split ---io-blksize=1 file1
</code></pre>
<p>We would like to support these with clap 3.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>The ideal solution would be if I could use a leading hyphen in the string passed to <code>Arg::long</code>, however, all leading hyphens are stripped here:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn long(mut self, l: &amp;&#x27;help str) -&gt; Self {
    self.long = Some(l.trim_start_matches(|c| c == &#x27;-&#x27;));
    self
}
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, I would like to propose that only the first 2 hyphens would be stripped. So this <code>App</code>:</p>
<pre><code>App::new(&quot;cli&quot;)
    .arg(Arg::new(&quot;a&quot;).long(&quot;a&quot;))
    .arg(Arg::new(&quot;b&quot;).long(&quot;--b&quot;))
    .arg(Arg::new(&quot;c&quot;).long(&quot;---c&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>would be executed with</p>
<pre><code>cli --a --b ---c
</code></pre>
<p>This would <em>technically</em> be a breaking change, but I think that there isn&#x27;t much (if any) code that passes long arguments with more than 2 leading hyphens.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>I think I have found a workaround using <code>alias</code>, which does not strip leading hyphens. So the workaround looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Arg::new(&quot;presume-input-tty&quot;)
    .long(&quot;presume-input-tty&quot;)
    .alias(&quot;-presume-input-tty&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this supports both 2 and 3 leading hyphens and is a bit awkward.</p>
Additional Context
<p>Finally, I just want to say that clap 3 has been fantastic so far and the transition is going very smoothly!</p>

<p>We also have plans to pull out the lexer (<a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2915">clap-rs/clap#2915</a>) and allow plugging in custom lexers (<a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1210">clap-rs/clap#1210</a>).</p>

<p>This implies with clap2 you support exclusively 3 hyphens for some arguments.  Have a small, reproducible example of how you did it?  I&#x27;ve tried some ideas but haven&#x27;t.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d overall recommend this approach for the short term as anything else is unlikely to be available until clap 4.</p>

<p>Ah yeah, that&#x27;s important context indeed. That was how we were supporting it before.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sorry for being unclear. We don&#x27;t have that right now. So in that sense, we can actually model this behavior a bit better in clap 3 than in clap 2.</p>

<p>That makes sense. We&#x27;ll stick with the workaround for now! Thank you for your response!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Trying to decide what we should do with this issue moving forward.  So far, the options seem to be</p>
<ul>
<li>Closing in favor of <code>alias</code></li>
<li>Close in favor of #1210  (though doing 3 <code>-</code> on only some args will require some hard coding but getting clap2 behavior should be easy)</li>
<li>Keeping open for considering the conditional trim in <code>long</code><ul>
<li>Just unsure how confusing that will be to users if we start taking meaning from the number of <code>-</code> especially since what does one <code>-</code> mean?</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That is indeed a weird thing about my proposal. But I think it makes sense to reject a single <code>-</code>, because it implies support for #1210, but won&#x27;t work like that in practice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the trimming of <code>-</code> could be removed altogether, like already happened with <code>short</code>, since it now takes a <code>char</code> instead of <code>&amp;str</code>. This makes the API more consistent and (in my opinion) more predictable, although it will probably break a lot of code. The transition for <code>short</code> was easier, because the type checker would complain about the usage of <code>&amp;str</code>.</p>
<p>Regarding the options you present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closing in favor is <code>alias</code> feels strange, because I would intuitively expect <code>long</code> and <code>alias</code> to behave the same and I only found this difference when inspecting the source code.</li>
<li>Issue #1210 seems to be fundamentally about something else, although there could be a solution that solves both issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, I understand if you want to close this because there is a fairly viable workaround and there is no short term solution.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>As a side note: I think it&#x27;s good that the clap 2 behavior is gone and wouldn&#x27;t want it back unless it&#x27;s optional.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that for #1210 I&#x27;m more calling out the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1210#issuecomment-956656955">generalized solution I proposed in the comments</a> (was just being lazy).</p>
<p>I agree about it being weird that <code>long</code> and <code>alias</code> are inconsistent.  I was surprised to see that <code>alias</code> worked for you.</p>
<p>If we removed trimming and made <code>long</code> more like <code>alias</code>, we&#x27;d need to do it in phases.  We&#x27;d first remove trimming in clap 4, asserting when leading <code>-</code> are present, and then in clap 5 open up to leading <code>-</code>, so we could help people transition through this.  This would also be contingent on the feedback we received.  I wish there was a better way for us to receive feedback about future changes than &quot;do it and see who complains&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m less concerned with &quot;no short term solution&quot; and more with &quot;is any new solution within scope&quot;.  As long as we feel there is room for a solution within the scope of clap, I&#x27;m fine leaving an issue open even if  it is longer in the resolving.</p>
