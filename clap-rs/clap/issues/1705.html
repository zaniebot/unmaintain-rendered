            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your use case
<p>This is obviously trivial compared to just doing <code>struct Args {}</code>, but it would be nice to maintain Rust&#x27;s general consistency in allowing the same things for all three forms.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<pre><code>#[derive(Clap)]
struct UnitLikeStruct;

#[derive(Clap)]
struct EmptyTupleStruct();
</code></pre>
Additional context
<pre><code>error: `#[derive(Clap)]` only supports non-tuple structs and enums

<p>I don&#x27;t really see why this is useful. There&#x27;s no real difference between struct Foo and struct Foo {}, the second works already. We may also want to give some special meaning to unit structs in future, so let&#x27;s leave it as is for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Empty tuple structs would fall into the same category.</p>
<p>But, single tuple struct could be a different issue. Do we support any tuple structs at all in the derive library?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think it would be a good idea to give them a different meaning; in general Rust tries to make them all behave as similarly as possible, and there&#x27;s been a consistent pattern of RFCs unifying functionality and behaviour between all three so that everything works between them (<code>.0</code> etc.).</p>
<p>I tend to make all empty structs unit-like structs by default, for general style reasons, and it does have one slight &quot;advantage&quot; (you get a free <code>const</code> for it); I found it surprising to be unable to derive Clap for them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@emilazy I&#x27;m not very excited of &quot;general style reasons&quot; argument because, you know, so many man, so many minds. Everybody tends to push their own way of making things roll; some people (myself included) like &quot;different types of items - different behavior&quot;, some adore &quot;similar enough - same behavior&quot;. It&#x27;s merely a matter of taste, and whenever you start arguing about personal taste it becomes &quot;it must change just because I think it&#x27;s beautiful&quot; thing real quick. So I&#x27;m going to be tenacious here and just stubbornly say that unless I hear very strong voice for the unification (something like a dozen of &quot;I want it too&quot; comments here) I&#x27;m not changing my mind.</p>

<p><em>This</em> is pretty good argument but only if <strong>some of those RFCs were accepted</strong>. Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find one of those; could you please share a link or two with us?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree with @emilazy here. If in rust <code>struct Foo {}</code> and <code>struct Foo;</code>are the same, then the corresponding derive behaviour should also be equivalent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, according to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/structs.html">Rust reference</a>, they are the same-ish <code>StructStruct</code> entity, indeed:</p>
<pre><code>Struct :
      StructStruct
   | TupleStruct

StructStruct :
   struct IDENTIFIER  Generics? WhereClause? ( { StructFields? } | ; )

TupleStruct :
   struct IDENTIFIER  Generics? ( TupleFields? ) WhereClause? ;
</code></pre>
<p>So <em>maybe</em> it really worth the candle, but tuple structs differ from the others even at the syntax level.</p>
<p>I think that, if the other members think unit structs should be supported, than we can do that, but I&#x27;m not OK with tuple structs, empty or not, unless somebody comes up with a real world use case.</p>
