<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.4</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>This seems to be a prerequisite to https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6790, or at the very least it would really help.</p>
<p>To stabilize Cargo's <code>--out-dir</code> flag, it likely will need to be renamed to something else. However, there are a lot of users of <code>--out-dir</code>, so it would be nice to be able to <em>deprecate</em> <code>--out-dir</code> and direct users to whatever it gets renamed to.</p>
<p>Such a scenario is applicable to other projects as well: API consumers may want to rename arguments or give them a deprecation period before removing them entirely.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>A way to mark <code>Arg</code>s as deprecated, or warn when they are passed. Passing such an argument to the program will result in a warning being printed, telling the user to either stop using the argument or migrate to its replacement.</p>
<p>I don't entirely know what this API should look like--should it be a generic &quot;warn on argument use&quot; API or specifically designed around deprecation?</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<ol>
<li>A way to specifically mark <code>Arg</code>s as deprecated, possibly allowing for deprecation-specific functionality like automatically redirecting users to their replacements.</li>
<li>A simpler &quot;print a warning when argument passed&quot; mechanism.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<p>As for cargo, I wouldn't wait on anything like this.  We've already handled cases like this before by defining both attributes and suing <code>shell.warn</code> if the deprecated one is used.</p>
