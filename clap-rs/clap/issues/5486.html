Clap Version
<p>4.5.4</p>
Describe your use case
<p>This seems to be a prerequisite to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6790">rust-lang/cargo#6790</a>, or at the very least it would really help.</p>
<p>To stabilize Cargo&#x27;s <code>--out-dir</code> flag, it likely will need to be renamed to something else. However, there are a lot of users of <code>--out-dir</code>, so it would be nice to be able to <em>deprecate</em> <code>--out-dir</code> and direct users to whatever it gets renamed to.</p>
<p>Such a scenario is applicable to other projects as well: API consumers may want to rename arguments or give them a deprecation period before removing them entirely.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>A way to mark <code>Arg</code>s as deprecated, or warn when they are passed. Passing such an argument to the program will result in a warning being printed, telling the user to either stop using the argument or migrate to its replacement.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t entirely know what this API should look like--should it be a generic &quot;warn on argument use&quot; API or specifically designed around deprecation?</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<ol>
<li>A way to specifically mark <code>Arg</code>s as deprecated, possibly allowing for deprecation-specific functionality like automatically redirecting users to their replacements.</li>
<li>A simpler &quot;print a warning when argument passed&quot; mechanism.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for cargo, I wouldn&#x27;t wait on anything like this.  We&#x27;ve already handled cases like this before by defining both attributes and suing <code>shell.warn</code> if the deprecated one is used.</p>
