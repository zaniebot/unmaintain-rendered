<p>For items we <code>flatten</code> and <code>subcommand</code>, we are deriving <code>Clap</code> when we should consider deriving <code>Args</code> or <code>Subcommand</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The main docs we have atm are in <code>src/derive.rs</code> which already make the distinction to a degree.  The remaining work was what was done in #2814.  As we work on #2856, we'll also have to keep this in mind but that is a part of that issue and not this.</p>
