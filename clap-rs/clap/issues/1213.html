            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry if this is has been asked and answered (I did search), but I am new to Rust and Clap, and can't figure it out from the source..</p>
<p>I know I can programmatically print the usage information for a whole app with <code>app.print_help()</code>. How can I do the same thing for a subcommand. I would like to get the same result as entering the following command:</p>
<pre><code> my_app foo help</code></pre>
<p>where <code>foo</code> is a subcommand that itself has subcommands.</p>
<p>I did discover <code>ArgMatches::usage()</code>, but that doesn't provide <code>FLAGS</code> and <code>SUBCOMMANDS</code> sections.</p>
<p>The reason I am looking for this is to print out the usage info when no subcommands are provided to a level that does have subcommands.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can't currently do <em>exactly</em> that, however there is something that may be what you're asking for.</p>
<p>Try <code>AppSettings::ArgRequiredElseHelp</code>](https://docs.rs/clap/2.31.1/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#variant.ArgRequiredElseHelp) (which displays the help message if no arg or subcommand was used).</p>
<p>Also, if that doesn't solve it for you, could you give me some usage examples of what you're envisioning and I may be able to make a better suggestion.</p>
