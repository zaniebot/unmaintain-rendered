Clap Version
<p>3.2.21</p>
Describe your use case
<p>In case of supplying an invalid <code>subcommand</code>, <code>help</code> should be displayed with a default message.</p>
<p>See for example:
input: <code>myApp invalidCommand</code>
output:</p>
<pre><code>myApp: &#x27;invalidCommand&#x27; is not a valid command
*help is displayed here*
</code></pre>
<p>In order to achieve this, I have to use <code>try_get_matches</code>, and apply some error handling on the <code>Result</code>, which adds unnecessary complexity to my code, and makes it uglier.</p>
<p>This problem is very similar to <em>having or not having the <code>arg_required_else_help</code> feature.</em>
Since we have that, I expected to have this one as well, and spent a good amount of time searching this feature on docs, and in here.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>a similar feature is present for the absence of subcommands -&gt; <code>.arg_required_else_help(true)</code>
so, there can be something like <code>arg_invalid_show_help(bool)</code> as well imho. Would be handy for many developers.</p>
<p>In my case, the custom code I needed to write for this made the code uglier, and I think it should be fairly easy the implement this feature.
In fact, I can volunteer for implementing it if you guys are busy with other things :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like there are two parts to this</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Don&#x27;t show &quot;argument not found&quot; errors for subcommands when flags are present, especially built-in flags.  We should update that check to only care about if positionals are present.</li>
<li>Show help along with the error message (which is blocked on the first part)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>help should be displayed with a default message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like this statements could use more elaboration, especially in a lot of case where showing the help will obscure the error message to the length of output.</p>
<p>I could see including the list of available subcommands in the help output.  That could still be long for a bulleted list.  We could treat it like possible values and instead do a comma-separated list.</p>

<p>Totally understandable and I had the same hesitation. If that is the case, following the <code>git</code> way can be helpful.</p>
<pre><code>$ git kjkjkjkl                                                             
git: &#x27;kjkjkjkl&#x27; is not a git command. See &#x27;git --help&#x27;.
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m okay with this one as well. This is probably as clean as it can be.</p>
<p>On top of that, appending the error texts (related to unknown/invalid arguments) with <code>See &#x27;appName --help&#x27;</code> should not increase the size of the binary, and can be default. I can&#x27;t imagine a use case where this is not preferred.</p>

<p>Feedback is always welcome!  As I said, we are aiming to make programs feel polished / high quality out the gate.  We recently, did a push on <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4132">help output</a>.</p>
