### Rust Version

* Use the output of `rustc -V`
rustc 1.29.1 (b801ae664 2018-09-20)

### Affected Version of clap
2.32.0

* Can be found in Cargo.lock of your project (i.e. `grep clap Cargo.lock`)

### Bug or Feature Request Summary
The hide_default_value doesn't seem work for YAML file. Below is my YAML file snippet related to the issue:
```
args:
    - host:
        short: h
        value_name: HOST
        help: Sets the host (including port, eg, localhost:2425) of the recipe search service
        takes_value: true
        default_value: "bf-ca2:2425"
        hide_default_value: true
```

The issue only happened when I added the 'hide_default_value:true'. Everything was fine before that. 

### Expected Behavior Summary
The hide_default_value config should work for YAML file, too.

### Actual Behavior Summary
thread 'main' panicked at 'Unknown Arg setting 'hide_default_value' in YAML file

### Steps to Reproduce the issue
Add 'hide_default_value' to an arg for YAML file based config.

I checked the source code for `from_yaml` function (https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/src/args/arg.rs#L94-L156). Looks like the `hide_default_value` is not listed as a known parameter.
