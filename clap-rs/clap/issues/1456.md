### Rust Version

* rustc 1.33.0-nightly (7bac68a5d 2019-01-21)

### Affected Version of clap

* clap 2.33.0

### Bug or Feature Request Summary

Currently, when one creates an application with arguments that specify environment variables via `.env()`, passing a flag that prints the program's help information at runtime will print environment variable information in the form: `[env: NAME=]`, which is all expected.

The issue I wish to bring up arises when you add `AppSettings::ColoredHelp` (and have the corresponding feature enabled in your `Cargo.toml`). You'll notice that default values and possible values will be colorized, however the environment variables are not.

### Expected Behavior Summary

This is more of a minor nitpick I suppose. I would expect `NAME=` or `NAME` in the `[env: NAME=]` substring to be colorized like how `VAL` in `[default: VAL]` is colorized.

I actually removed the colorizing for default values and possible values and aliases in #1824. I wanted to rethink quite a bit on how to display this stuff while also taking #1695 into account. I am renaming this issue.

Another case to keep in mind is #1695 

With the immediate issue being resolved (consistently there is no styling), I think #2963 supersedes this.  If there are thoughts or concerns about closing this out in favor of #2963, let us know!
