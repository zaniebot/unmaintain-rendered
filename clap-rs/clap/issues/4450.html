<h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>N/A</p>
<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>N/A</p>
<h3>Minimal reproducible code</h3>
<p>N/A</p>
<h3>Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code</h3>
<p>curl https://clap.rs</p>
<h3>Actual Behaviour</h3>
<pre><code>$ curl https://clap.rs
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
</code></pre>
<h3>Expected Behaviour</h3>
<p>https://clap.rs should have a valid certificate so it cleanly redirects to https://docs.rs/clap</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Debug Output</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
