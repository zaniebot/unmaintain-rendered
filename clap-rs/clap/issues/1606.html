            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I asked this a while back on the <a href="https://gitter.im/kbknapp/clap-rs">gitter channel</a>. Feel free to close the issue and move further discussion there if that venue is more appropriate.</p>
<p>Thanks for the outstanding library! These questions are asked purely with the desire to help in getting <code>clap</code> to 3.x, and not an attempt to nag for its completion.</p>
<p>Is the work to get <code>clap</code> to version 3.x well-suited for community contribution? If it is something the community could help with, would it be possible to get a roadmap of outstanding work? I found the v3 tracking issue #1037. However, that seemed mostly for internal use and was last updated a while ago. I realize this is not a small ask as creating a roadmap can be substantial effort. Thanks in advance for your time!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are 2 things that are keeping us away from a release:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Ensure that clap-derive is compatible with clap</li>
<li>[ ] Alias to subcommand (https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1603)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I mean those are not holding back the release. Also if they are backwards compatible, the changes can be added in a minor release later.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I agree. But I think that obvious and severe bugs must be closed prior to it, even if not breaking.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, there are now 2 milestones <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/milestone/78">3.0.0-alpha.3</a> and <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/milestone/76">3.0.0</a> which should work as a roadmap. Please feel free to comment if you want to see some issue as part of these milestones.</p>
