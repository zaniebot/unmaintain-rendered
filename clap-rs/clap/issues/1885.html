            <div class="timeline-body">Make sure you completed the following tasks
<ul>
<li>[x] Searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[x] Searched the closed issues</li>
</ul>
Describe your use case
<p><code>Arg::new</code> has been suggested to use (along with <code>App::new</code>) in one of the roadmap issues. It is implemented but there are still a lot of <code>Arg::with_name</code> usages.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<ul>
<li>Remove <code>Arg::with_name</code> completely (also fixing examples, docs, etc.. just search <code>with_name</code>)</li>
<li>Align <code>Arg::new</code> signature with <code>App::new</code> to make them consistent by changing one of them or both. @kbknapp probably has some thoughts about this.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m :+1: on this and it was the intent for 3.0. My <em>only</em> concern is it makes churn for upgrading from 2.x to 3.x with no functional difference.</p>
<p>One proposal is to simply deprecate <code>Arg::with_name</code> and remove in 4.x. Of course, the counter argument is there are other breaking changes, so some churn is expected.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s such a small function that I&#x27;d honestly be fine either way (deprecate for 3.x or just go ahead and hard remove).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Spoiler: @pksunkara and I have been talking about some sort of automatized update tool based on <code>rust_analyzer</code> 😏  Click the button, become happy!</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll get to it as soon as we deal wit more pressing stuff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would be awesome. I had considered some kind of upgrade script, but there certain cases where the intent isn&#x27;t 100% known because clap 2.x didn&#x27;t allow enough granularity (<code>multiple(true)</code>, etc.). Looking forward to see how this progresses!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I had the idea for auto-upgrade tool long before working in rust. But with rust-analyzer doing most of the heavy lifting and me also needing it for another project of mine, I started to seriously consider this and try to see if I can do an MVP for clap v3. I have some workflow and API designs, but haven&#x27;t written them down anywhere.</p>
<p>https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-up. I should be working on it heavily from next week. Just trying to finish up some of the current tasks I was working on.</p>
