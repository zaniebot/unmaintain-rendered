<p>So <code>-l</code> expands to <code>--source list</code> and <code>-r</code> expands to <code>--target residues</code>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unstable replace feature gets you part way. It would allow a <code>-l</code> to expand out but it wouldn't allow <code>-lr</code>.</p>

<p>Another issue with this feature as the use case is documented <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2945#discussioncomment-1540387">here</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But the problem in #2011 is with subcommands and I thought they were the primary motivation for this.</p>
<p>There is also the item brought up about being invisible in <code>--help</code>.</p>
<p>I also feel like there has been little interest expressed in this that it makes me wonder if the feature is worth it in the first place.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that's what I meant. The current API replaces any and all input. Maybe we can restrict it to only replace subcommands by doing asserts. That, way we can use the replace config to solve the above-mentioned issues.</p>

<p>People might not be talking about it because they don't have anything to complain.</p>
<p>That's something we might have different opinions about. I would recommend keeping it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Except for the fact that its unstable which carries its own level of risk, including it being removed.</p>
<p>Features carry a cost and we need to balance that cost against the impact they have on end-users.  Right now, command aliases can be emulated by duplicating the commands.  This is also done in our &quot;default subcommand&quot; example (see the git examples).  People requested that workflow to be streamlined but with us having a workaround, the cost seemed hardly justified.  I feel like this might be another one of those scenarios.</p>
