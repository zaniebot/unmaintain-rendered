Clap Version
<p>4.5.51</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I was looking into adding dynamic completions (<code>COMPLETE=shell</code>) support for <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz"><code>cargo fuzz</code></a>. So I&#x27;d like to have it complete <code>cargo fuzz &lt;tab&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>By default, clap generates something like this on fish:</p>
<pre><code>complete --keep-order --exclusive --command cargo-fuzz --arguments &quot;(COMPLETE=fish &quot;/path/to/cargo-fuzz&quot; -- (commandline --current-process --tokenize --cut-at-cursor) (commandline --current-token))&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Changing that to <code>--command &#x27;cargo&#x27; -n &#x27;__fish_seen_subcommand_from fuzz&#x27;</code> would make it complete <code>cargo fuzz &lt;tab&gt;</code> as well. I&#x27;m not sure if the other supported shells support something like this aswell though.</p>
<hr>
<p>I also tried to do</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Parser)]
enum CargoArgs {
    Fuzz(CargoFuzzSubcommand),
}

#[derive(clap::Args)]
struct CargoFuzzSubcommand {
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    subcommand: Command,
}

fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
    CompleteEnv::with_factory(CargoArgs::command)
        .bin(&quot;cargo&quot;)
        .complete();
}
</code></pre>
<p>which works on fish, but on bash it completely replaces the original completion instead of adding to it.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>If something like fishs <code>__fish_seen_subcommand_from</code> can be done on other shells, maybe it could be exposed as</p>
<pre><code>    CompleteEnv::with_factory(Command::command)
        .bin(&quot;cargo&quot;)
        .only_complete_subcommand(&quot;fuzz&quot;)
        .complete();
</code></pre>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>Now that I think about it, it&#x27;s not <code>cargo-fuzz</code>s responsibility to register completions for cargo.</p>
<p>Perhaps cargos completion script could instead complete unknown subcommands by letting the shell complete <code>cargo-&lt;subcommand&gt;</code> directly. On fish this is very easy with <code>complete --do-complete &quot;cargo-fuzz&quot;</code>, again I have no idea how other shells compare here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have a note for this in rust-lang/cargo#14520 but I&#x27;m not seeing anything in this repo.  Probably because the assumption there is we&#x27;d make it part of <code>cargo</code>s completions, rather than having plugins register for their own completions.  If we did that and got alias to work, we&#x27;d then automatically get completions of alias for third-party subcommands, rather than nothing working for those.</p>
<p>If we can have the plugins also register for <code>cargo</code>, we could move forward with that in parallel.</p>
<p>Could you tell me why <code>-n &#x27;__fish_seen_subcommand_from fuzz&#x27;</code> is needed?  Oh, is it that we keep going if we see an unknown subcommand, trying to recover on a failure which in this case will instead flood the user with redundant <code>-h</code> and <code>-v</code> completions?  I wonder if we should have a built-in version of<code>__fish_seen_subcommand_from</code> that tells the completion parser to be strict about certain subcommands.</p>

<p>Yes, if you simply do <code>COMPLETE=fish cargo fuzz | source</code>, you&#x27;ll have <code>cargo &lt;tab&gt;</code> complete <code>cargo tmin</code>, <code>cargo list</code> etc. which you only want for <code>cargo fuzz tmin</code>. <code>cargo-fuzz</code> doesn&#x27;t have any options other than <code>-h</code> and <code>-V</code> but I suppose if it did, it would also complete them for <code>cargo build --options-from-cargo-fuzz</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I agree that ideally this would be handled by <code>cargo</code>, I&#x27;ll look into how it does its completion and if it would be possible to implement for not just fish but the other supported shells as well.</p>
