<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.1.9</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Searching google for &quot;rust clap enum example&quot; yields no results or <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.27.1/clap/macro.arg_enum.html">outdated macro <code>arg_enum</code></a>.</p>
<p>The expected answer should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(clap::Parser)]
struct Args {
    #[clap(arg_enum)]
    level: Level,
}

#[derive(clap::ArgEnum, Clone)]
enum Level {
    Debug,
    Info,
    Warning,
    Error,
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Explicitly show the example and usage in <code>README.md</code>.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<li>On the <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.27.1/clap/macro.arg_enum.html">arg_enum page</a>, click &quot;Go to latest release&quot; and show a search result for the <code>ArgEnum</code> trait which gives a derive example</li>
<li>On <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/">the docs</a> click on &quot;Tutorial: .... Derive API&quot;  and scroll down to the validation section for <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.1.9/examples/tutorial_derive/README.md#enumerated-values">enumerated values</a></li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@epage I totally ok with the suggestions as a user who have just found the correct usage. But as for new learners stumbling across this, they might still find it a hard time looking for answers. In their (including mine) points of views, the doc is not clear and easy enough, especially comparing to <a href="https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline/wiki/Enum-Flags">that of C#</a>. I am really impressed by Rust language and its safety features. That's why I want the ecosystem around the language could be more friendly to new learners. I hope the usage is only one search away, not nested in links within links imho.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Isn't that similar to <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.1.9/examples/tutorial_derive/README.md#enumerated-values">our tutorial</a>, with the main difference being that our code isn't inline?</p>
<p>The lack of inline code is not great but its a side effect of making our code samples testable.  If we switched to a mdbook, we could have them inline.  https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3189 is exploring the needs for our derive documentation.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to understand is a concrete user need that we can explore improving or a concrete solution we can evaluate applying.</p>
