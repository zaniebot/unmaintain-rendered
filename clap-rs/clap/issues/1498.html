            <div class="timeline-body"><p>According to this <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/1492#issuecomment-503618790">comment</a>, the v2 branch is closed, and all future PRs be submitted against v3-master. Could the default github branch be switched to that to avoid other people working off the wrong base?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure that's a good idea, so long as there isn't a v3 release. Folks using clap are still working with clap 2, and showing them a clap 3 README would potentially be even more confusing. As it stands today, the current setup is only confusing for contributors (as opposed to being confusing for all users if the default branch switched to an unpublished version of clap).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good point! It's just a shame it wasn't obvious there was a v3 branch in development, I could have saved some time yesterday doing some cleanup on the v2 branch.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeh. Better to merge the branches when we are closer to release. Have made a PR (#1503) for adding a note to the readme.</p>
