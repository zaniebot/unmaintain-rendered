### Describe your use case

During discussion of the solution of implemention for  #1553  the best solution to providing a custom header on the `help` sub-command was identified as requiring CommandAction with a `help` action analogous to the actions provided in `ArgAction` to generate a custom`help` argument. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

## Introduction 

The objective is to provide the user with a facility to place the help subcommand under a custom header. Currently this can be worked around by renaming the default heading. Providing the user a `CommandAction::Help` will allow them to configure a custom `help` subcommand following the same process that is currently used to generate a custom `help`  argument e.g. `-?`. The custom command can then be place under a custom header using `Command::help_heading`.

## Design Statements

| Statement | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| MUST provide Command::CommandAction enum| The key objective of the change |
| MUST provide `help` value for enum | Commands with the `help` action will trigger help |
| MUST provide `user` value for enum | Command with the `user` action must be handled by the user|
| MUST set the `user` action as the default | |
| WILL NOT propagate custom help commands  | Not sure this is the right call ❓  |
