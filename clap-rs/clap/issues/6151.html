Rust Version
<p>rustc 1.92.0-nightly (f6aa851db 2025-10-07)</p>
Clap Version
<p>HEAD, 4.5.49</p>
Minimal reproducible code
<p>cargo build</p>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<pre><code>cd clap/cargo_builder &amp;&amp; cargo build --release
cd ../../clap2/cargo_builder &amp;&amp; cargo build --release
cd ../..
bcomp (or diff) clap/target/release/libclap_builder.rlib clap2/target/release/libclap_builder.rlib
</code></pre>
Actual Behaviour
<ul>
<li>absolute paths to the source tree are embedded in the rlib, even in release mode</li>
<li>there are at least several hundred other hex differences (some look like padding, perhaps garbage or uninitialized)</li>
</ul>
Expected Behaviour
<p>Two cargo builds in different source trees on the same host on the same version result in binary-identical rlibs.</p>
Additional Context
<p>This causes distributed build, cache, and test systems like Bazel to be less efficient. Because the clap_builder dependency in a binary may be different across hosts, the resulting binary will hash differently and expensive tests may be rerun. No other clap crate has this issue.</p>
Debug Output
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is it that you saw that is clap specific about this problem rather than being a general cargo reproducibility problem?</p>
<p>Note that cargo requires extra steps to create reproducible binaries.  There is unstable support for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#profile-trim-paths-option"><code>trim-paths</code></a> which simplifies this but even that still has known reproducibility issues.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the quick response! I actually don&#x27;t build using Cargo. I used Cargo as an example to simplify the repro. I actually build using Bazel and <code>rules_rust</code>. Of the hundred or so dependent crates in Bazel, <code>clap_builder</code> is the only one which doesn&#x27;t build reproducibly in this setup, which is why I suspect something specific.</p>
<p>BTW, in my build environment all of the source paths are the same across all hosts, so that&#x27;s not causing the non-determinism (however, it would cause non-determinism in less hermetic environments). I&#x27;ve attached a binary diff of the two rlib&#x27;s in the Bazel setup (without source code paths). One can see some structure to the differences.</p>

<p>Here&#x27;s most of the cargo built diff:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can&#x27;t think of what would cause this.  This isn&#x27;t even code that depends on <code>clap_derive</code>  in case that generated code in a non-deterministic way (e.g. using a <code>HashMap</code> which it doesn&#x27;t).  I did a quick scan of what macros we invoke and I&#x27;m not seeing anything.</p>
<p>This will likely need investigation by someone interested enough and with a reproduction case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On two separate machines with the same source path, cargo delivers deterministic builds. So I think that perhaps all the differences in the cargo version are due to different source paths, and in the Bazel version due to some interaction with <code>rules_rust</code>.</p>
