Can we move this to v3? All the weird settings have been cleaned up except for this. (One of the main objective for v3).

Its really tempting to say yes but there will always be yet another thing and its easy to underestimate the amount of polish needed for that next thing.

I suggest we focus on polishing what we've done and do this soon after.  If we move forward with https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/2718, then we can start this in 3.x.

With that said, I do not see our milestones as prescriptive but focus areas. However, work done by somebody outside of a focus area should be the level of quality and lack of debate to not detract others from the focus areas.

Speaking of, "focus areas" is a model I've taken in one my projects.  Instead of release milestones, I have a project board with "Triage", "Focus", "Planned", and "Someday".  Works well for me.  Release milestones would still be useful to track more explicit blockers, like regressions from within the release.
