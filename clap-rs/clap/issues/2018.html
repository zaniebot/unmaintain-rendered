            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm trying to learn how to use Clap but I'm having a <strong>very hard time</strong> with the documentation, here I will try to explain my struggle only for the sake of improvement.</p>
<p>I might just be dumb for the time I wasted stuck on my task xD, but then let's try to understand how a dumb person deals with the documentation and how can we make it better.</p>
<h3>Where</h3>
<p>https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.1/clap/</p>
<hr />
<p>I have now realized, a long time being confused how to simply read all args from the CLI with this code.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38900226/87584043-4490b000-c6b3-11ea-9d04-7298140ab516.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Where is this teached on <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.1/clap/">the docs</a>?</p>
<p>I was very intrigued this is not clearly shown, I see almost every linux CLI tool accepting multiple arguments as a list. but <code>clap</code>'s documentation don't teach this at all.</p>
<p>As a former python developer I also found this weird because the first <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">example</a> in <code>python argparse</code>'s documentation shows how to receive a variable number of integers and sum them.</p>
<h3>What's wrong</h3>
<p>Examples containing <code>.multiple(true)</code> show how to accumulate levels of verbosity (<code>-v</code>/<code>--verbose</code>) but don't explain what happen if <code>.multiple(true)</code> is added to an <code>Arg</code> without <code>.short()</code> applied.</p>
<p>This is very obscure, if a short option is not added, then <code>multiple</code> has a totally different behavior/meaning, should <code>clap</code> users be supposed to just figure it out by trial and error? I don't think so.</p>
<h3>How to fix</h3>
<p><em>Please consider adding this to the documentation and not throwing it at the <code>examples/</code> folder, this is to grant the solution visibility.</em></p>
<p>Adding an example at the start of the documentation that debunks this confusion, here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>A program that receives a list of words and prints them out again, the program accept optional <code>--upper</code> and <code>--lower</code> flags that conflict and transform the output to upper case or lower case.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p>A calculator that receives numbers and accepts <code>--sum</code> or <code>--mul</code>, and prints out the result of the chained operation (maybe similar to argparse's example?).</p>
<p>Although I have suggested two solutions, I would like to hear external opinions</p>
<p>EDIT: I should also mention that I'm sorry if I sound cocky or offensive on this issue (I'm not a native speaker), but this was <strong>obviously</strong> not intended by me.</p>
