            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it be possible to implement something like ArgGroup but only with the possibility to contain SubCommand support? So we can have either &quot;Arg or Arg or SubCommand or Arg&quot;?</p>
<p>Would be nice IMHO.</p>
<p>Thanks for writing clap! It is awesome!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the kind words :+1:</p>
<p>It <em>would</em> be possible, but I&#x27;m not sure the juice would be worth the squeeze because it would change the implementation for quite a few things internally. So I&#x27;m open to some discussion about it, and we can see if we can fit it in somehow or another.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of what you&#x27;re trying to do, and perhaps there is another way? Sometimes just re-thinking parts of the CLI design suffice.</p>
<p>Thanks for suggesting this feature!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My use-case is rather simple. I have a program which either takes some data and puts it into a &quot;store&quot;. The program should have two ways of creating new entries in the store:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the raw presentation (like <code>cat $file | into-store --raw --stdin</code>)</li>
<li>By constructing it from the commandline (like <code>into-store entry --content &quot;foo bar&quot; --header foo=1</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see, in the first example I&#x27;m simply using flags, in the second one I&#x27;m using a subcommand. That&#x27;s my usecase; they should never appear in the same call.</p>
<p>Therefor it would be nice to be able to specify <code>either $arg or $subcommand</code></p>
<p>Maybe even <code>either $arg or $subcommand or $arggroup</code> would be nice (where &quot;or&quot; is replaceable by &quot;and&quot;)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My personal opinion would be to just dispatch both those calls to the same handler method. i.e.</p>
<pre><code>let m = App::new(&quot;into-store&quot;)
    // ...
    .get_matches();

match m.subcommand() {
    (&quot;entry&quot;, Some(sub_m)) =&gt; {
        handle_content(sub_m.value_of(&quot;content&quot;));
    },
    // ...
    (&quot;&quot;, None) =&gt; {
        // no subcommand used
        if m.is_present(&quot;raw&quot;) &amp;&amp; m.is_present(&quot;stdin&quot;) {
            handle_content(/* read from stdin */);
        }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let me play some implementations of adding subcommands to groups and see how it interacts with the system a bit and I&#x27;ll post back with some findings. It may be a day or so just due to free time, but I&#x27;ll let you know!</p>
