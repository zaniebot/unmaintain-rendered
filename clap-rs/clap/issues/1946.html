<h3>Clap version</h3>
<hr />
<h3>Where</h3>
<p><a href="https://clap.rs">https://clap.rs</a></p>
<h3>What's wrong</h3>
<p>The website https://clap.rs/ does not include a link to this github repo (at least I couldn't find it).</p>
<h3>How to fix</h3>
<p>Maybe you can add one or more links so that people can come here :)
I'd suggest one link in the site footer, next to the other social media icons. and at least one that is more prominent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will actually commandeer this issue to discuss a much need refactor of our website clap.rs</p>
<p>I would take inspiration from https://diesel.rs. @CreepySkeleton has been wanting to write some guides which we can host there too.</p>
<p>A good project needs to have 4 kinds of documentation as described <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">here</a>. We already have the &quot;Reference&quot; at docs.rs. So, let's host the other stuff on the website. We could use zola and docs folder in this repo to auto deploy and stuff.</p>
<p>@kbknapp Would love to hear your thoughts too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm fine with someone working on a refactor. I just don't personally have time to work on it. The current implementation is just a barebones wordpress site. It <em>used</em> to have a lot more content, but due to some shenanigans the old site was lost and I stood up just a bare bones version.</p>
<p>I'll fix the link on the current site so we can close this issue, but I'm good with opening an issue to refactor the site.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey! I'm happy to take a look at this one. I have some spare cycles and can look into providing some content to put on the site. Things like a basic getting started guide as well as some examples and tutorials.</p>
<p>A lot of what's currently in the repository can potentially be migrated over to the site. Things like the FAQ and the quick examples are good starting points.</p>
<p>I have some experience with maintaining multilingual sites on hugo as well - https://helm.sh/docs/ is multi-lingual.</p>
<p>If there are areas of focus you'd like newer community members to take a closer look, please feel free to point me in the right direction.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Out of curiosity... Is https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/v3_occ_vs_vals.md and https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/v3_warn_cases.md still relevant today? It hasn't been updated in 3 years, and I don't fully understand the context behind those documents. They look like quick notes jotted down as a reminder about some of clap's behaviour. I'm curious if that should be expanded to explain some of clap's internals.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am going to close this issue since it's done, but let's continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Multi-lingual is not an issue. I already have a skeleton that I can add in here. We just don't have any translators for now to actually add content to it.</p>
<p>There's no tutorial and/or understanding section on our site right now. You can add it if you want.</p>
<p>But https://clap.rs/cookbook/ is the &quot;how-to&quot; section. Feel free to send PRs to any of them.</p>
