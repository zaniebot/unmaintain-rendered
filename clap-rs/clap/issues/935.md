# Provide a way to produce empty Values and OsValues iterators (possibly implement the Default trait?)

---

_Issue opened by @golddranks on 2017-04-20 10:42_

Why? Because sometimes I need to be able to produce placeholder values to represent the case where there were no values. Currently this is possible using `Option<Values>`, but this is clunky since iterators support naturally the case of "length zero", iterating zero times.

I'd imagine that implementing the `Default` trait would be a good solution.

Seems doable. Thanks for the suggestion!
