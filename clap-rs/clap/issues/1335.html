            <div class="timeline-body">Feature Request Summary
<p>I would like to exclude some subcommands from the generated shell completion. For example, the command to generate those completions is usually only used during installation and shouldn&#x27;t be suggested to the user. I&#x27;ve managed to hide the subcommand from the help text with <code>AppSettings::Hidden</code>, but it&#x27;s still included in the shell completion.</p>
Expected Behavior Summary
<p><code>foo &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</code></p>
<p>All commands that are marked with <code>AppSettings::Hidden</code> are not suggested</p>
Actual Behavior Summary
<p><code>foo &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</code></p>
<p>All commands are suggested.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue has labels marking it as &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;help wanted&quot;. But at the same time it sounds like there are open fundamental questions about whether you want it: e.g. from issue #2541 @pksunkara said Jun 17, 2021:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Need the version you are looking at because this is fixed in master.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then in Dec 10, 2021:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we went back on the decision regarding this and are currently generating hidden subcommands too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And earlier on this issue, also on Dec 10, 2021</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ideally, we would want this to be configured while creating the generator, but there&#x27;s a lot more generation related work we would want to look at first to see if the current code is viable for future or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So... which is it, is this &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;help wanted&quot;, or is there in contrast actually need for design work and experiments and what not? In other words, if someone made a PR for this, would it actually have a chance of being merged?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Its been a couple years and I unfortunately didn&#x27;t take enough notes here.  I think it&#x27;d be reasonable to emulate what we can from the proposal in #3951 would be reasonable.  That basically means (1) don&#x27;t suggest hidden items but (2) complete within them where we can.  The part we likely can&#x27;t emulate is &quot;complete the hidden item if its the only choice left&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For my specific use case it would be fine to have it fully excluded, without the need for (2). (however I wouldn&#x27;t mind having (2)).</p>
<p>The subcommand is <code>foo generate-completions ...</code> and probably only ever used when generating a package. It&#x27;s useful to have this subcommand available but the user would likely never want to invoke it themselves (if they really want to they could however).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was resolved in #5549.  When using <code>clap_complete::dynamic</code>, we only show hidden subcommands if there is no other valid completion option.</p>
<p>To track stabilization, see #3166</p>
