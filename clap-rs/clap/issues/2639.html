        () =&gt; {
            &quot;Lorem ipsum&quot;

</code></pre>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<p>Run the test above.</p>
Actual Behaviour
<p>Assertions fail with no comments help message detected:</p>
<pre><code>%%% LONG_HELP %%%:=====
clap_derive 

USAGE:
    clap_derive [FLAGS]

FLAGS:
    -f, --foo
            

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

    -V, --version
            Prints version information

=====
</code></pre>
Expected Behaviour
<p>Assertions pass with all help messages specified by the macro call.</p>
<pre><code>%%% LONG_HELP %%%:=====
clap_derive 
&lt;- We should see some help messages here...

USAGE:
    clap_derive [FLAGS]

FLAGS:
    -f, --foo      &lt;- And here...
            

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

    -V, --version
            Prints version information

=====
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I investigated the current codebase for quite a while, and the main problem we have here seems to be the following:</p>
<p>When will the macro be expanded? Ideally <code>clap_derive</code> should never bother to deal with the macro call itself, but should instead send it safely to call site. Is this feasible?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I went down a different rabbit hole, in hopes that bumping MSRV and maybe proc macro deps might be of assistance.  I&#x27;m guessing not but at least we have <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/2640">clap-rs/clap#2640</a></p>
<p>I&#x27;ll look into that part.  Part of the problem is we do post-processing on the doc comment to better format it.  iirc we have a verbatim flag which could work with it.  I&#x27;ll dig a little into these parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Expansion of macro expressions in &quot;inert&quot; attributes occurs after decorators have executed, analogously to macro expressions appearing in the function body or other parts of decorator input.</p>
<p>There is currently no way for decorators to accept macros in key-value position if macro expansion must be performed before the decorator executes (if the macro can simply be copied into the output for later expansion, that can work).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still fairly weak on my proc macros but I think this is confirming that we have to pass along the macro call for later expansion, which means it is unlikely to work with <code>clap_derive</code> without some re-work.  As-is, we <em>always</em> do post-processing, even with verbatim is enabled.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess one option is we can either generate or embed some const-fns that do the post-processing for us.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@epage Yeah, I saw that post-processing part.</p>
<p>Before, with only doc literals, it&#x27;s reasonable to do this in the derive macro. However, when the doc macros come into play, it seems impossible (at least to both of us) to keep it this way: the call site has to be changed.</p>
<p>But don&#x27;t worry, once the macro call has been transferred to the call side, we should be able to use something like the <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/tt-call"><code>tt_call</code></a> hack to perform comptime preprocessing. (I used it in my own app <a href="https://github.com/rami3l/pacaptr/blob/f4c8ca74ca2010f5f31cafb451f15bd05df63fd7/src/pm/mod.rs#L184"><code>pacaptr</code></a> and it works, although it&#x27;s rather hard to get right.)</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true that <code>const fn</code> might be another possibility. It&#x27;s however also quite complicated to operate on <code>&amp;str</code> these days with only <code>const fn</code>... :(</p>
<p>Of course, we have to be very careful about <code>clap</code>&#x27;s dependencies... But in the worst case, we can at least move the preprocessing part to runtime.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a big problem to me. I need to generate commands from a macro, and the macro documents commands automatically, but it needs to interpolate a few strings inside documentation.</p>
<p>I am using <code>#[doc = concat!(&quot;foo &quot;, $bar, &quot; baz&quot;)]</code> to achive this, but it breaks clap and so I cannot both document and generate help/about at once.</p>
