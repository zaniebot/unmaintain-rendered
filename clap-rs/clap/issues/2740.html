Clap Version
<p>3.0.0-beta.4</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Consider the following app:</p>
<pre><code>use clap::Clap;

#[derive(Clap)]
struct Opts {
    #[clap(long, requires(&quot;foo&quot;))]
    bar: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>That app has a bug - the <code>foo</code> argument doesn&#x27;t exist - but you don&#x27;t have any way of finding out about it unless you actually <em>run</em> the application! In the real world, outside of the realm of contrived example code, this happened at $work where one parallel branch renamed an argument, while another added a new argument that required the old name - and since we didn&#x27;t (previously, we do now) have a test covering option parsing, this went uncaught until we actually tried to run the binary.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I was thinking it&#x27;d be awesome if <code>#[derive(Clap)]</code> could detect usages of <code>requires</code> (and other things that reference the name of another argument) and emit a compilation error if they reference arguments that don&#x27;t exist. This might get a little hairy in the presence of <code>#[clap(flatten)]</code> et al, though, and I&#x27;m not super familiar with the internals of derive macros so the information may well just not be available at this point</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>Maybe if it&#x27;s not feasible to do this inside the macro itself (or not desired, because of the weird interaction with <code>#[clap(flatten)]</code> we could instead have some sort of custom clippy lint that detects this?</p>
Additional Context
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<p>I was thinking maybe we could if <code>flatten</code> isn&#x27;t present but that wouldn&#x27;t work if we were deriving a mix-in.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wonder how frequently people use <code>requires</code> on a field that isn&#x27;t actually defined in the struct they&#x27;re defining - I&#x27;d bet it&#x27;s a minority of cases. I wonder if we could get away with something like</p>
<pre><code>use clap::Clap;

#[derive(Clap)]
struct Opts {
    #[clap(long, requires(&quot;foo&quot;, allow_missing))]
    bar: i32
}
</code></pre>
<p>to opt-out of the compile-time check for the field existing.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the structure of clap - is <code>assert_app</code> run as part of the derive macro (so at compile-time) or at runtime?</p>

<p>It happens at runtime with debug builds.  You could have your CI run <code>--help</code> to ensure all debug asserts pass which gives you at least some level of enforcement.</p>

<p>Yeah, I just wrote a test that calls <code>Opts::parse_from(...)</code>, but it&#x27;d be nice to have it as a compile-time check without having to remember to write a test.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Due to the challenge of <code>flatten</code>, I&#x27;m inclined to close this.</p>
<p>Our options</p>
<ul>
<li>Only do the checks when <code>flatten</code> isn&#x27;t present<ul>
<li>This gives people a false sense of security as their app scales</li>
<li>This can cause challenges with the struct you flatten into your top-level.  You could condition the assert on deriving <code>Parser</code> instead of <code>Args</code> but we let people derive <code>Parser</code> on those</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Require cross-struct references to opt-out<ul>
<li>This is adding API and implementation complexity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this, this requires us to duplicate our debug asserts.</p>
<p>We have added a <code>App::debug_assert()</code> for use in unit tests which is more extensive than the <code>Opt::parse_from</code> mentioned before (helps with subcommands).</p>
<p>If there are any concerns  with us closing this, let us know!</p>
