<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.4.0</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I've been porting a CLI application from clap ~2, to 4.4.0 with the goal being struct based arguments through derives.
One of the tests showed the change in behavior of <code>--flag val1 val2</code>, currently known as <code>num_args</code>.
It was impossible to find an example usage of this for derive-style in examples and docs.</p>
<p>I finally managed to find it through a lucky comment in <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4998#discussioncomment-6681330">this discussion</a>, but knowing this and browsing the repository again, it revealed that this parameter is only mentioned a few times.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Ideally there'd be docs and examples for every parameter <code>arg</code> (possibly other) macro accepts, so at least creating issues to add those examples would help a bit.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>I'm not well versed in <code>clap</code>, this has been my first usage of it in a project.</p>

<p>#4090 is where we are discussing how this could be better communicated or improved.  Closing in favor of that.</p>
