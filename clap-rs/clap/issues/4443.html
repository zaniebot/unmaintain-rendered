Rust Version
<p>rustc 1.64.0 (Fedora 1.64.0-1.fc36)</p>
Clap Version
<p>4.0.18, clap_mangen 0.2.4</p>
Minimal reproducible code
<pre><code>use clap::{CommandFactory, Parser};

#[derive(Parser)]
/// Command to do things
pub struct Cmd {
    /// Do thing
    #[clap(long)]
    thing: bool,
}

fn main() {
    Cmd::parse();
    clap_mangen::Man::new(Cmd::command())
        .render(&amp;mut std::io::stdout())
        .unwrap();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Cargo.toml:</p>
<pre><code>[package]
name = &quot;clap-man&quot;
version = &quot;0.0.0&quot;
edition = &quot;2021&quot;

[dependencies]
clap = { version = &quot;4&quot;, features = [&quot;derive&quot;] }
clap_mangen = &quot;0.2&quot;
</code></pre>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<pre><code>cargo run | man -l -
</code></pre>
Actual Behaviour
<p>The option description for <code>--thing</code> claims that it takes an argument:</p>
<pre><code>clap-man(1)                 General Commands Manual                clap-man(1)

NAME
       clap-man - Command to do things

SYNOPSIS
       clap-man [--thing] [-h|--help]

DESCRIPTION
       Command to do things

OPTIONS
       --thing=THING
              Do thing

       -h, --help
              Print help information

                                   clap-man                        clap-man(1)
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run -- --thing=true
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/clap-man --thing=true`
error: The value &#x27;true&#x27; was provided to &#x27;--thing&#x27; but it wasn&#x27;t expecting any more values

Usage: clap-man --thing

For more information try &#x27;--help&#x27;
</code></pre>
Expected Behaviour
<p>The man page lists the option without any argument, as it did in clap 3.2 / clap_mangen 0.1:</p>
<pre><code>clap-man(1)                 General Commands Manual                clap-man(1)

NAME
       clap-man - Command to do things

SYNOPSIS
       clap-man [--thing] [-h|--help]

DESCRIPTION
       Command to do things

OPTIONS
       --thing
              Do thing

       -h, --help
              Print help information

                                   clap-man                        clap-man(1)

Additional Context
<p>This is a followup to <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4410">clap-rs/clap#4410</a>.  clap_mangen 0.2.4 improved the situation but didn&#x27;t fix it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I want to clarify that it is the proposed change in #4506 that brought a fix for the given examples above. However as pointed out, in the PR the change doesn&#x27;t affect existing tests, which we should expect it to. I&#x27;m still trying to dig up what changed between #4432 and now, as i&#x27;m able to replicate the issue in the report.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The one big difference I notice this Issue is using the derive API and the existing tests are using the builder API.  Since #4506 fixes this, it implies that a value name is being set for flags in the derive.</p>
<p>It looks like we always set value_name in the derive: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/clap_derive/src/derives/args.rs#L232</p>
<p>Normally, we verify the relationship between num_args and value_names but apparently we skip it for empty value names to make the derive easier: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/src/builder/debug_asserts.rs#L757</p>
<p>So the question is if we should fix this in the derive or in the callers.</p>
<p>I will point out that clap_mangen is a bit simple in its rendering of values; <code>--help</code> has a bit more complex of rendering: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/src/builder/arg.rs#L4148</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One option would be for us to expose an <code>Arg::render</code> function that calls <code>Arg::stylized(None)</code>.  The only public way to access the styling is with <code>StyledStr::ansi().to_string()</code> and it will remain that way.  I&#x27;ve been considering writing an ansi code to roff converter.</p>
<p>If someone wants to step up and write the ansi to roff converter as I won&#x27;t be getting to it immediately, that&#x27;d be great.  I have notes to help prepare for it in the issues at https://github.com/epage/anstyle/issues.</p>
<p>However, that is a big ask and people likely don&#x27;t want to wait that long.  I can understand just duplicating the code into clap_mangen until then.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@epage Sorry for leaving this alone for so long. I&#x27;ve been looking into ways to make a quick workaround
for this in a way that is robust. After looking into it I think the best solution is just to go forwards
with creating the ANSI-Roff converter.</p>
<p>Adding an Arg::Render function is feasible, but it also generates styles that would be noticeably different
from the current manpage styling. I&#x27;m not sure how &quot;in stone&quot; those need to be, but want to err on
the conservative side.</p>
<p>Copying the code into clap_mangen is a lot of reduplication, as there are a lot of private dependencies
that would need to be copied over as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind working on writing an ANSI to Roff converter, but I would like to have
a better idea of what you are imagining that looking like, perhaps in another discussion. For
now I have added some tests to #4506 that demonstrate some parity between Derive and Builder commands,
and that they both show flag options appropriately.</p>
<p>As an aside, when testing these different API&#x27;s I found some other cosmetic disparities between
Derive and Builder API&#x27;s that I will write up another ticket for. However it probably would be better
to get the ansi-roff converter done first as that will probably clear up the differences.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/epage/anstyle/issues/4">epage/anstyle#4</a>, I contrast different ANSI parsing libraries.  For a first round, feel free to use what is easiest as long as it as a good license.  I&#x27;m less concerned about <code>clap_mangen</code>s build times.  We can then iterate on it as clap needs to adopt an ANSI parser.</p>
<p>anstyle is where I&#x27;m housing these different integrations, e.g. you can see what it supports today in the <a href="https://github.com/epage/anstyle#readme">README</a>.</p>

<p><code>clap_mangen</code> is in its very early stages; nothing is set in stone.  I wasn&#x27;t going to get started on it until we could reuse more help generation logic but some others were wanting it sooner and wrote most of the code.  It still has a ways to go.</p>
