If you click on "5. CHANGELOG" in the readme https://github.com/clap-rs/clap#readme
you will find the link is dead: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.0.0-rc.1/docs/CHANGELOG.md

I think this worked a couple of hours ago...?

Thanks for reporting this!  Somehow I missed that one when testing the links.  It should now be fixed
