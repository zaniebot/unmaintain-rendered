# Regression in wrapping help

---

_Issue opened by @pksunkara on 2020-10-13 07:09_

When you have a small terminal width, your code has `wrap_help` feature enabled, and you have args of which some have `about` very small so that the arg can fit in the terminal width and other args whose `about` is big such that they would be wrapped, we get the following:

### Actual Behavior Summary

```
cargo-workspaces-version 
Bump version of crates

USAGE:
    cargo workspaces version [FLAGS]

FLAGS:
    -a, --all
            Also do versioning for private crates (will not be published)

        --exact
            Specify inter dependency version numbers exactly with `=`

    -h, --help                   Prints help information
        --no-git-commit          Do not commit version changes
        --no-git-push
            Do not push generated commit and tags to git remote
```

### Expected Behavior Summary

The display should be consistent.

```
cargo-workspaces-version 
Bump version of crates

USAGE:
    cargo workspaces version [FLAGS]

FLAGS:
    -a, --all
            Also do versioning for private crates (will not be published)

        --exact
            Specify inter dependency version numbers exactly with `=`

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

        --no-git-commit
            Do not commit version changes

        --no-git-push
            Do not push generated commit and tags to git remote
```


### Additional context

This needs to be consistent per section. If all the args can fit inside the wrapped width, then we can just do one line. If not, then all of them should be in the new line format.

@ldm0 Would you like to take this? Should be easy enough.
