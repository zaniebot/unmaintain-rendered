            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, I just went through https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3822 and other related GitHub / reddit threads to find a summary of the opt-in deprecation scheme that clap ended up with. Is my memory serving me wrong that such a write-up exists?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you looking for justification for it, an explanation of the mechanics / pattern, or user facing &quot;how to opt-in&quot;?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Mostly an explanation of the pattern (I think there's not much to it, simple cfg-gated deprecation attributes?), probably with the motivation as an introduction. I thought I saw something like that before 😅</p>
<p>Context: wanted to link to it as prior art when mentioning the pattern for another project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>#3830 is the main place I can think of which is linked to in the above.  That included updates to our <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#compatibility-expectations">compatibility documentation</a> and shows how we did this.  One of the key things that requires extra work is when proc-macros need to call deprecated functionality.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, so I guess I was imagining that there was a separate document / article about this pattern. Thanks :smile:</p>
