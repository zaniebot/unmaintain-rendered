            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ValueHint</code> works well for ahead-of-time generated completions as it tells the generator what shell behavior to opt-in to.</p>
<p>However, its not really needed with Rust-native completions and actually puts more of a support burden on it.</p>
<p>On top of that, the documentation default is less relevant now that we have typed values.  We changed it for Rust-native completions in #5763 as that is still unstable.</p>
