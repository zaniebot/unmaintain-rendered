# Allow arg_enum! to work with #[repr(c)]

---

_Issue opened by @lilith on 2016-06-25 18:44_

Goal: make this possible:

```
arg_enum!{
    #[repr(C)]
    #[derive(Copy,Clone)]
    pub enum Filter { A=0, B = 1}
}

```

I have an enum with 30 variants, or manually implementing from_str would be obvious.

Thanks for filing this. This should be a very quick fix, I'll see if I can knock it out when I get home tonight.

No rush! Just a convenience thing, I have a workaround.
