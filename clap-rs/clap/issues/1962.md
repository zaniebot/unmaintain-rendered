# Arg::require_delimiter doesn't make sense in code

---

_Issue opened by @pksunkara on 2020-06-06 13:43_

Code from v2 branch is:

```rust
    pub fn require_delimiter(mut self, d: bool) -> Self {
        if d {
            self = self.use_delimiter(true);
            self.unsetb(ArgSettings::ValueDelimiterNotSet);
            self.setb(ArgSettings::UseValueDelimiter);
            self.set(ArgSettings::RequireDelimiter)
        } else {
            self = self.use_delimiter(false);
            self.unsetb(ArgSettings::UseValueDelimiter);
            self.unset(ArgSettings::RequireDelimiter)
        }
    }
```

Yeah, there's some funny business there... I'll take a look.
