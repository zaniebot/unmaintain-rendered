Clap Version
<p>v3.0.0-beta.4</p>
Where?
<p>Unsure</p>
What&#x27;s wrong?
<p>This is being split out of #1661.  We do not talk about magic methods, etc.</p>
<p>Related is #1671</p>
How to fix?
<p>Rewrite structopt&#x27;s docs for clap_derive</p>
<p>Where is a question.  I&#x27;m assuming the bulk would go on <code>Parser</code> with the other related traits and README pointing to that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Most of the guide would be in the README of <code>clap_derive</code> which should be <code>#[doc(include_str)]</code> into the <code>src/lib.rs</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m concerned about people discovering the docs there since most people will get <code>clap_derive</code> through <code>clap</code> and won&#x27;t think about the underlying proc macro crate (I&#x27;ve never look at <code>structopt-derive</code>, <code>serde-derive</code>, etc).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would be okay to as long as we point clap_derive (readme &amp; lib) to those traits.</p>
<p>Or the reverse, point the traits to derive macro documentation since we also point to clap_derive in clap readme and lib docs. I don&#x27;t think there is an issue of discoverability.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t mind either way in any case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was the biggest issue when moving from StructOpt -&gt; clap 3 beta -&gt; newer clap 3 beta for me. It&#x27;s really hard to know what the actual options are you can pass to the Parser, and what format they should be in.</p>
<p>Filed a PR for this at <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/3052">clap-rs/clap#3052</a> , I think this is what the discussion here points to, let me know whether this approach makes sense.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@epage Maybe it should be moved to a more visible location before releasing 3.0 stable? I didn&#x27;t find this documentation before, my friend just told me it was there. TBH, I am a bit surprised that it is under the <code>examples</code> directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We link to the derive reference from both the README and docs.rs.  I&#x27;d be interested in better understanding why it was missed to explore how ti can be improved.  I&#x27;d recommend continuing this conversation on <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3189">clap-rs/clap#3189</a> which is for collecting feedback on the derive reference.</p>
