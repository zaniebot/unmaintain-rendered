<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>v3.0.0-beta.4</p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Unsure</p>
<h3>What's wrong?</h3>
<p>This is being split out of #1661.  We do not talk about magic methods, etc.</p>
<p>Related is #1671</p>
<h3>How to fix?</h3>
<p>Rewrite structopt's docs for clap_derive</p>
<p>Where is a question.  I'm assuming the bulk would go on <code>Parser</code> with the other related traits and README pointing to that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Most of the guide would be in the README of <code>clap_derive</code> which should be <code>#[doc(include_str)]</code> into the <code>src/lib.rs</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm concerned about people discovering the docs there since most people will get <code>clap_derive</code> through <code>clap</code> and won't think about the underlying proc macro crate (I've never look at <code>structopt-derive</code>, <code>serde-derive</code>, etc).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would be okay to as long as we point clap_derive (readme &amp; lib) to those traits.</p>
<p>Or the reverse, point the traits to derive macro documentation since we also point to clap_derive in clap readme and lib docs. I don't think there is an issue of discoverability.</p>
<p>I don't mind either way in any case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was the biggest issue when moving from StructOpt -&gt; clap 3 beta -&gt; newer clap 3 beta for me. It's really hard to know what the actual options are you can pass to the Parser, and what format they should be in.</p>
<p>Filed a PR for this at https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/3052 , I think this is what the discussion here points to, let me know whether this approach makes sense.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@epage Maybe it should be moved to a more visible location before releasing 3.0 stable? I didn't find this documentation before, my friend just told me it was there. TBH, I am a bit surprised that it is under the <code>examples</code> directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We link to the derive reference from both the README and docs.rs.  I'd be interested in better understanding why it was missed to explore how ti can be improved.  I'd recommend continuing this conversation on https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3189 which is for collecting feedback on the derive reference.</p>
