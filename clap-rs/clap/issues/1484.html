<h3>Bug or Feature Request Summary</h3>
<p>I'm creating an interactive command line application in rust. It is like an embedded command line in a program. The user enter a command and press enter, the command is processed and the user is ready to enter a new command. It works like python's <a href="https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2">cmd2</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to use clap to process the arguments on some commands. But then I can only give clap a Vec of arguments. Also I need to capture the output printed by clap since printing to stdout doesn't work because I'm using a raw screen. I also need to prevent clap from exiting the process if the user enter bad arguments.</p>
<p>Is something of that possible?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!
It seems I can use App.get_matches_from_safe_borrow or App.get_matches_from_safe to give the arguments as a sequence and capturing the output. And App.set_term_width to set the width of the text.</p>
