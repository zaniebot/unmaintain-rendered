<h3>Steps to reproduce the issue</h3>
<ol>
<li>On Windows 2019 (e.g., GitHub Actions CI), run <code>cargo run 2&gt;&amp;1 | xxd</code> (using xxd just so that you can see the line endings)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Version</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rust</strong>: <code>rustc 1.44.1 (c7087fe00 2020-06-17)</code></li>
<li><strong>Clap</strong>: 2.33.1</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>Line endings in the output are Unix-style (<code>\n</code> only):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, I think we've never been paying attention to line endings. On the other hand, considering that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clap errors and help messages are meant to be user-facing, printed to Console/TTY. The precise format must not be relied upon, so there's very little use saving it to a file or piping to another program.</li>
<li>Windows CMD on Win 10 seems to handle <code>\n</code> just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the bullet points in mind, is that really a problem?</p>
<p>For clarity: I'm not saying no, I'm just pointing out that <em>maybe</em> this doesn't really matter. For example, both <code>structopt</code> and <code>clap_derive</code> use <code>\n</code> when transforming doc comments to help strings, and somebody has yet to complain about it...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CreepySkeleton thanks for taking a look.  &quot;inconvenience&quot; is about it -- I was building a test to verify that my program produces a useful help message when run with invalid arguments.  The easiest thing was to store the expected output in a file.  (I know the output is not stable, but I'm okay with the tradeoff in this case.)  I'm able to work around this by converting line endings on Windows only.  I don't use Windows enough to know if there are any other cases where this would be a problem for people.</p>

<p>That is the part I don't get - why do you need to convert them? Don't you just compare expected and actual outputs byte-after-byte? Or is it your test system that adores <code>\r\n</code> and can't live without them?</p>
<p>That all sounds a lot like there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem"><code>XY</code> problem</a> involved at some point...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another drop in the bucked - people often hardcode <code>\n</code> (and not <code>\r\n</code>) in the help messages that clap displays &quot;as is&quot;. It's really common out there and I have yet to see somebody accounting for <code>\r\n</code> on Windows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>More details, if you want to know: I want an automated test that ensures that my (cross-platform) executable produces a useful help message when run with no arguments.  An easy way to do that is to run it with no arguments, save the stderr output to a file, and write an automated test that runs the executable and compares its output against the contents of the file.  (I understand this means if I upgrade clap and the output format has changed, I have to fix the test, and I'm okay with that tradeoff in this case to make sure this behavior doesn't regress in my executable.)  This works as you'd expect on MacOS and Linux.  On Windows, in a typical Git install, <code>autocrlf</code> is enabled so that the file in the repo that contains the expected output has its line endings converted to Windows-style on <code>checkout</code>.   As a result, the test fails because when it runs the program, the output has Unix-style line endings, but the expected output file has Windows-style line endings.  I've worked around this by converting the line endings of the expected output file before doing the comparison.  There are other ways to work around this, like using Git attributes to disable the line ending conversion for files of this type.</p>
<p>I filed this because I expected that a Windows user might find this to be surprising behavior, but I don't use Windows much myself and I can definitely see how it would rarely come up, if ever, and it may not be worth changing anything here.</p>

<p>Oh boy! That rings a bell.</p>
<p>Listen to me for I am telling truth: thou shalt not set <code>autocrlf = true</code>. There are some <a href="https://jessitron.com/2019/11/11/line-endings-in-git/">great</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2825428/why-should-i-use-core-autocrlf-true-in-git">explanations</a> of why this is useless nowadays and hazardous in some cases, like yours. Long story short: use <code>autocrlf = input</code> in tandem with basically any text editor that was developed after dinosaurs had stopped roaming earth and humans had crawled out of caves, and you'll live happily ever after. (Sometimes you need somewhat more nuanced setup, see the links, but it's never <code>autocrlf = true</code>).</p>

<p>As a very active Windows 10 user and a heavy user of Git for Windows I can state: it's all in your hands, really. GfW explicitly asks this during installation, describing every option, and if you mindlessly press &quot;Next&quot;, you deserve what you get.</p>
<p>Well, I hope it didn't come across wrong, and thank you for bringing this up - it was nice history excursion - but I don't think we should do anything about it. We better teach people to configure Git properly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Frankly, I don't understand why people even use CRLF these days and keep biting the bullet (outside of <code>.bat</code> files and such, but those are covered by <code>.gitattributes</code>). Out of curiosity, could anybody explain me that?</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the universal solution to this problem would be creating a <code>.gitattributes</code> in your project's repo with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>* text=auto
/tests/fixtures/* text eol=lf

<p>Super fast to set up, works literally everywhere, everybody's happy.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pksunkara Thanks!  I did the same.</p>
<p>@CreepySkeleton Defaults are pretty influential (and for good reason).  Not only does autocrlf=true appear to be the default in the Git for Windows installer, but it's also the default in the GitHub Actions Windows runner, which is how I got here.  <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings#">GitHub also recommends that Windows users set autocrlf=true.</a>  The GitHub engineer in <a href="https://github.community/t/git-config-core-autocrlf-should-default-to-false/16140">this thread</a> says that you should use git attributes to control this if it's important to you, but he also says that they use this default because &quot;most guidance&quot; recommends setting <code>autocrlf=true</code> and because of the Git for Windows installer default.</p>
<p>You might find it interesting that when I used <code>--help</code> in my test program, <a href="https://github.com/davepacheco/rust-windows-testing/runs/819811169#step:4:6">the help output from clap on Windows also includes <code>\r\n</code></a>.  I'm not sure where that comes from.  It's possible something's busted in this test, but it appears that clap is inconsistent about the line endings it uses.</p>
