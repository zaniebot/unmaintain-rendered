### Actual Behavior Summary

Arguments list is ignored completely

### Steps to Reproduce the issue


### Sample Code or Link to Sample Code

__cli.yml__
```name:
version:
author:
about:
args:

      short: H
      long: hardware
      help: Show system hardware specification
  - config:
      short: c
      long: config
      value_name: FILE
      help: Sets a custom config file
      takes_value: true
  - INPUT:
      help: Sets the input file to use
      required: true
      index: 1
  - verbose:
      short: v
      multiple: true
      help: Sets the level of verbosity
```
__main.rs__

```#[macro_use]
extern crate clap;

use clap::App;

fn main() {
    let cli_yaml = load_yaml!("cli.yml");
    let matches = App::from_yaml(cli_yaml)
        .about(crate_description!())
        .name(crate_name!())
        .author(crate_authors!())
        .version(crate_version!())
        .get_matches();

    let config = matches.value_of("config").unwrap_or("default.conf");
    println!("Value for config: {}", config);
}
// End of main.rs

I was able to work around this by specifying _only_ the name in yml and the remaining properties via the crate! macros.
Not sure what other combinations work, but I feel like what is happening should at least be more clear.  Between this and the [indentation thing](https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust/issues/101) I've spent quite some time confused as the app compiles fine but the yml might completely be ignored.

I would say this is how it's supposed to work. 

* No field - no version/auther/about/etc at all
* `version: crate_version!()` - derive it from Cargo.toml
* The `name` field is mandatory, you can't omit it. Full stop. If you want it to be derived - use `name: crate_name!()`

But I agree this should be documented better.

I'm in a somewhat similar situation, didn't feel different enough to create a whole new issue. I do this in my code:
```rust
let matches = App::from_yaml(yaml)
    .name(Game::GAME_ID)
    .version(Game::VERSION)
    .author(Game::AUTHOR)
    .about(Game::DESCRIPTION)
    .get_matches();
```
Since I set all those there, I figured I could leave them out of the YAML file. But no. `name` is mandatory in the YAML, *even if* you provide it some other way. So for now, my YAML file looks like this:
```yaml
name: required_for_some_reason_even_though_it_is_defined_in_code
args:
  - ...
```

@alexschrod Well, this is inevitable. `clap::App` needs a name because it's a central concept - there's no application without a name. So, in order to being able to create an `App`, the YAML loader needs a name. There's also no way for it to know that you are going to override it in your code one line below.

We have decided to deprecate the YAML API.  For more details, see https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3087.  If there is interest in a YAML API, it will likely be broken out into a `clap_yaml` and developed independent from the core of clap.
