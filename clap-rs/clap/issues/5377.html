<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.1</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Let <code>short</code> flag allow more characters than one to facilitate user input.</p>
<p>I know that short flags implement their combined behavior by default in clap, which prevents <code>short</code> flags from using more than two characters.
For example, <code>ls -l-a = ls -la</code>, which I think is a great feature.</p>
<p>However, implementing only this functionality ignores the case where the user does not want to enter the <code>long</code> flag if there are too many parameters.
For example, the user wants to type <code>xxx-oJ</code> instead of <code>xxx --oJ</code></p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I have a solution, which is that clap can open a method to control whether I want this default composition behavior or not.</p>
<p>When I turn off the composition behavior, the <code>short</code> flag length is at least 1 or greater.
For example,<code> -oJ</code>, the output is json, there is no combined behavior here, just a single instance.</p>
<p>When I enable the composition behavior (which is the default), the <code>short</code> flag is limited to a length of 1.
Which is now the composition behavior.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Renamed the title to focus on the problem, rather than solution.</p>
<p>I know this has been discussed before but not finding the Issues or Discussions for it.  #1210 is either similar or the same thing, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>There are several problems to solve</p>
<ul>
<li>API: With clap v3, we intentionally switched <code>short</code> from accepting <code>&amp;str</code> to <code>char</code> to better represent this limitation in type system</li>
<li>Behavior: we have to deal with people who want true shorts with combining of multiple flags + a value with people who want multi-character shorts.    There might even people who want both.<ul>
<li>If its both, that adds its own complexities.</li>
<li>If its either, then we have to balance the scope of how much this is needed vs the compile time and binary size of making this large of a behavior swap conditional</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation: this is a dramatic difference at the core of clap/s lexing and parsing</li>
</ul>
<p>If this is more like #1210, then #2468 is likely the way forward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I noticed that in v2, clap short allowed multiple characters, but only the first one was retrieved.
For example, <code>short(&quot;abc&quot;)</code>  appears as -a on the command line.</p>

<p>I think developing a way to regulate whether or not composition behavior is used is a very important feature for developers and users.
The right sacrifice can sometimes be a big help.</p>

<p>I am aware of these issues and hope such issues can be resolved.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish clap better and better!</p>
