# Recursively print whole help?

---

_Issue opened by @dpc on 2019-08-26 18:05_

My app (`cargo-crev`) used `<verb> <subject> <qualifier>` convention. Eg. `cargo crev query id all`. This makes it use a lot of 3-level sub-command nesting, which is tedious for the users to fully discover.

What would be neat is having some form of recursive help, in way similar to how `tree` command prints a filesystem. 

This way user could get long, but full overview of all available commands.

Sounds like a weird corner case, but maybe...

Not a weird corner case. Man pages are essentially this.

Is this the same request as #1334 ?   Can we close this and add the use case to that one?

Yes. Seems like the same thing though I want to clarify that "recursive" is important here.
