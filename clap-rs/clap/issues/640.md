# Generate help without list of possible values on a per-argument basis

---

_Issue opened by @vks on 2016-08-29 08:12_

It would be nice if the generated list of possible values could be optional, since sometimes it is redundant to the help itself.

This is already possible via `AppSettings::HidePossibleValuesInHelp`. Maybe it might be better to have a per-argument setting for this though.

I'm re-opening this for the per-argument comment, I think that should be possible with the way we generate help text now, whereas before it may not have been.
