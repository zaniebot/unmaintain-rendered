# Website tries to load resources over plain HTTP

On Chrome 55, I get mixed content warnings when browsing clap.rs, with the following URL being marked as insecure: http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:300,400,700,300italic,400italic,700italic.

Interesting. Would you mind filing this over on the [kbknapp/clap-www](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-www) repo so I don't forget about it? It's much lower traffic there.
