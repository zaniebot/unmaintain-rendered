# C++

_@yoni386_

Hello,

Thanks for the library. Are the plans or a way to use this in c++?

Thank you

I don't currently have any plans to expose a C API, but I'm also not opposed to the idea. Once 3.x is released, I'd be willing to consider contributions to make this happen.

Ok. Do you know if this library is similar to c++ clap or tclap
?

It looks like tcclap is based on CLAP (C++). Both look pretty different from clap-rs. This library was a from scratch write, although it very loosely originates from clapp-py (by me) and ideas from one of Go's popular argv parser. 
I'm not super familiar with the C++ world so it's hard for me to say much more about those two libraries you mention. :/

Did you had a chance to compare how efficient rust is compared the a
similar python library?

Borderline indefinitely? How fast is running optimised assembly as compared to *parsing and compiling code in real time*?
