# Repo's dedicated "website link" field is empty

---

_Issue opened by @ssokolow on 2016-10-16 19:57_

If you look at a repo like [this](https://github.com/ssokolow/quicktile/), you'll notice that there's a link to the website at the end of the description. (Set via its own separate field when editing the description)

People used to poking around GitHub look for the website link there and, if we're tired and in a hurry, we might miss that there's a website link in the README portion of the page.

I don't see any link to https://clap.rs/ when I look there and it really should be added.

Are you sure the link under "this" is correct?

It's a project of mine that I'm using as an example of what it's supposed to look like when the field is filled in. (Note the URL at the end of the repo description)
