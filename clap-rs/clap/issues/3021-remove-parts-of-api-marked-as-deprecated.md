# Remove parts of API marked as deprecated

---

_@epage_

Before and during the 3.x series, we have different parts of the API that are deprecated, pending removal on 4.0.  We need to remember to do that.

Other notes
- Check #3014 for potentially relevant work
- Be sure to remove `StructOpt` trait and `structopt` attribute support
