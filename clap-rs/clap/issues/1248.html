<h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>rustc 1.25.0 (84203cac6 2018-03-25)</p>
<h3>Affected Version of clap</h3>
<p>clap 2.31.2</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>When using the macro builder as described in #217, I expected <code>possible_values[fast slow]</code> to behave
like <code>.possible_values(&amp;[&quot;fast&quot;, &quot;slow&quot;])</code>.</p>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>when using
<code>possible_values[fast slow]</code>
Cargo fails to compile the crate with this error:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --&gt; src/main.rs:51:19
   |
51 |       let matches = clap_app!(appname =&gt;

   | |_________^ expected slice, found str
   |
   = note: expected type `&amp;[&amp;str]`
              found type `&amp;'static str`
</code></pre>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce the issue</h3>
<p>Add argument to a subcommand that expects two or more possible values.
Using <code>possible_value[fast]</code> works as expected.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree this isn't optimal, however it's mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.31.2/clap/macro.clap_app.html#shorthand-syntax-for-args">macros shorthand notes</a> that you have to use the singular form and a list of values <code>possible_value[fast slow]</code></p>

<p>I'm going to close this for now, however I'd also not say no to making the docs more clear :wink:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You are referring to the last bullet point in the macros shorthand notes, i assume?
In my opinion it is far from obvious that one must use the singular form from looking at the notes.
On the first read, one would assume that this is a more ergonomic way of setting a possible value multiple times, not that it is the only way to set multiple values.</p>
<p>Where would it be appropriate to expand on this point in the documentation, if I were to send in a pull request?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree it's basically hidden. Unfortunately, it's hard to document macros properly. I'd be all for a better documentation PR if you have some good ideas? The fact that the shorthand version are quite numerous makes it hard to make each one prominent when a particular user only needs a few of them.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat common issue, recently #1253 is another such instance.</p>
