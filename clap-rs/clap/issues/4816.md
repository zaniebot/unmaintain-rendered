### Rust Version

rustc 1.67.1

### Clap Version

4.2.0

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
struct Args {
    #[arg(short, long)]
    file: String,
    #[arg(short, long)]
    mode: Mode,
    #[arg(short, long, requires = "mode")]
    speaker_0: Option<String>,
    #[arg(short, long, requires = "mode")]
    speaker_1: Option<String>,
}

fn main() {
    let args = Args::parse();
}
```



### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

`cargo run`

### Actual Behaviour

```
Short option names must be unique for each argument, but '-s' is in use by both 'speaker_0' and 'speaker_1''
```

### Expected Behaviour

This can be detected during compile time and should fail then.

### Additional Context

### Debug Output
