### Clap Version

4.0.32

### Describe your use case

`clap_derive` only supports the `skip` option for the `group` macro, as in `#[group(skip)]`. This is documented accordingly in https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html#arggroup-attributes

I wrote a struct that would benefit from having more options like `requires`, `requires_all`, `conflicts_with`, and `conflicts_with_all`:

https://github.com/cargo-lambda/cargo-lambda/blob/main/crates/cargo-lambda-new/src/lib.rs#L37-L43
https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.ArgGroup.html

### Describe the solution you'd like

I'd like to be able to use those options in the group macro.

I don't mind to implement it myself if I can get some hints on how to do it, I've never contributed to this project and I'm a little bit lost in all the macro logic.

Yes, we need to support more attributes.  This was being tracked as part of #3165 but I'm fine having a more specific issue.
