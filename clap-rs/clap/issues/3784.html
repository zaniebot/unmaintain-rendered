Clap Version
<p>3.1.14</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Would like something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
struct Args {
    /// Choice of variant
    #[clap(long, arg_enum)]
    v: Variants
}

#[derive(ArgEnum, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub enum Variants {
    /// Variant 1
    V1,
    /// Variant 2
    V2,
    /// Variant 3
    V3,
}

fn main() {
  let args = Args::parse();
}
</code></pre>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I would ideally like <code>--help</code> to show the description of the variants (V1, V2, V3).
Currently, it just shows the docstring for <code>v: Variants</code></p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>Could also work to have this be gated behind a derive arg attribute on the struct</p>
Additional Context
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<p>Is it possible to do it by <strong>derive</strong> way like that&#x27;s example</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
struct Args {
    /// Choice of variant
    #[clap(long, arg_enum)]
    v: Variants
}

#[derive(ArgEnum, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
pub enum Variants {
    /// Variant 1
    V1,
    /// Variant 2
    V2,
    /// Variant 3
    V3,
}

fn main() {
  let args = Args::parse();
}
</code></pre>
<p>or that&#x27;s available for <strong>builder</strong> only now?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, the derive will automatically pick up doc comments.  While the PR didn&#x27;t explicitly add any code for that, it picked it up through shared code.  I&#x27;m adding an explicit test for it.</p>
