            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/83bacb87bb854be8b559f9e9c4bda5c3f47a0489/src/macros.rs#L389">crate_*! macros</a> make a fairly valid assumption that consumers use <code>cargo</code> to build Rust projects by expecting certain environment variables to be present. Unfortunately, I am one of the very few not using <code>Cargo</code>. I'm actually experimenting with <a href="https://www.bazel.io/">Bazel</a> to build my Rust projects -- but <code>clap</code> fails to compile because bazel is not providing the expected environment variables.</p>
<p>As of posting, the macros causing me issues are &quot;crate_version!&quot; and &quot;crate_authors!&quot;, which seem to be provided as a convenience to <code>clap</code> users and aren't used internally.</p>
<p>If this proposal is rejected, I do have mitigation options -- faking those values or patching clap locally -- so please reject if you feel that not enough users are impacted.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wow, I wasn't aware of Bazel, that's interesting.</p>
<p>Although I'm not against adding these to a feature, and simply adding said feature to the defaults but I <em>do</em> worry that there are people who have opted out of <code>default-features</code> and are using <code>crate_*!</code> macros. The problem is that would potentially be a silent breaking change.</p>
<p>Because of that concern, I think the best way forward is to add this to the 3x timeline, which hopefully isn't too far off (waiting on Macros 1.1).</p>
<p>I believe all you should have to do on your end is export those environmental variables while building, and it should work?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Valid, but unnecessary concern. Consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[features]
no_cargo = []
</code></pre>
<p>Then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[cfg(not(feature=&quot;no_cargo&quot;))]
macro_rules! crate_authors {
  // magic
}
</code></pre>
<p>That way you need an explicit opt-in to remove the macros, granting full backwards compatibility</p>
