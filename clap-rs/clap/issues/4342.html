            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The help text for the <code>help</code> subcommand says:</p>
<pre><code>  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
</code></pre>
<p>That phrasing makes it <em>sound</em> like <code>help</code> could show help for multiple subcommands at once (e.g. <code>cmd help subcmd1 subcmd2 subcmd3</code>). However, the <code>help</code> subcommand only takes one subcommand to show help for, not multiple. Given that, I think the help should be:</p>
<pre><code>  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand
</code></pre>
<p>The output of <code>help help</code> says:</p>
<pre><code>  [COMMAND]...  The subcommand whose help message to display
</code></pre>
<p>Which seems more correct: it says &quot;The subcommand&quot;, singular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe it is incorrect to have the ellipsis after [SUBCOMMAND] and  because the value for the help subcommand can be specified at most once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can specify as many subcommands as you want.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/tests/builder/help.rs#L76 for an example</p>
<p>Now, the question may be whether the application has any more subcommands to do nesting. Unfortunately, the cost of calculating the depth of nested subcommands isn't worth it. The cost of making this configurable is also unlikely to be worth it.</p>
<p>So the only question remaining is which direction should it be biased for. I think the fact that this issue was opened helped to fulfill its purpose. Without <code>...</code> it wouldn;'t have even come up on whether multiple are allowed or not.</p>
