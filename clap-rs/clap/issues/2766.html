Clap Version
<p>3.0.0-beta.4</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Assuming I have an <code>args.rs</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>use clap::Clap;

#[derive(Debug, Clap)]
pub struct Args {
    #[clap(short)]
    pub metric: bool,
    #[clap(short)]
    pub imperial: bool,
}

</code></pre>
<p>and a <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>use clap::Clap;

mod args;

fn main() {
    let args = args::Args::parse();
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, args);
}
</code></pre>
<p>if I call the executable like this (passing an invalid flag):</p>
<pre><code>./target/debug/teste -d
</code></pre>
<p>it returns this message:</p>
<pre><code>error: Found argument &#x27;-d&#x27; which wasn&#x27;t expected, or isn&#x27;t valid in this context

        If you tried to supply `-d` as a value rather than a flag, use `-- -d`

USAGE:
    teste [FLAGS]

For more information try --help

</code></pre>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>It would be nice any global configuration in Clap to avoid suggestions like <code>-- -x</code>. The message would be like this, which is much clear for the user (since the application contains only two optional flags):</p>
<pre><code>error: Found argument &#x27;-d&#x27; which wasn&#x27;t expected, or isn&#x27;t valid in this context

USAGE:
    teste [FLAGS]

For more information try --help
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>error: Found argument &#x27;-d&#x27; which wasn&#x27;t expected, or isn&#x27;t valid

USAGE:
    teste [FLAGS]

For more information try --help
</code></pre>
<p>or even:</p>
<pre><code>error: Found argument &#x27;-d&#x27; which isn&#x27;t valid

USAGE:
    teste [FLAGS]

For more information try --help
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@matklad could you expand further on those points so that we better balance the different needs when coming up with a solution.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it&#x27;s very easy for the end-user to trigger this behavior (eg, anything with subcommands with non-global optiosn)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m assuming the problem is: &quot;When running a subcommand, I assumed some flags were global and put them after the subcommand and it failed, producing this message which doesn&#x27;t apply to my situation&quot;</p>
<p>If we made the message conditioned on there being positional arguments, that&#x27;ll make it so we never show it when it isn&#x27;t applicable but it can still show up in the workflow you mentioned if the subcommand has positional arguments.  This is one of the points I&#x27;m trying to understand since by the direction and strength of your comments it sounds like that wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable but I want to understand why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the particular way this plays out is quite frustrating for the end user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was it that was so frustrating with it?  If you ended up going down the wrong path, what was it about the message that you went that way?  I&#x27;m trying to understand what is so frustrating about this when to me it clearly articulates when the suggestion is relevant.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that you wrong but that you have a different perspective that we need to incorporate in handling this.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. And, in particular, this seems to be a very frequent problem, rather than an obscure edge case. More generally, it seems to me that more or less any mistake in the args leads to &quot;If you tried to supply ...&quot; message (although often with a more relevant suggestion as well), but the probability that I actually indeed meant to pass <code>--</code> is very low. It&#x27;s a bit like if <code>rustc</code> added &quot;you could try <code>unsafe { &amp;(*x as *const _)}</code>&quot; as a suggestion for &quot;variable does not live long enough&quot; error. There <em>are</em> rare cases where that&#x27;d be a correct suggestion, but they are very rare.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was it that was so frustrating with it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>confident wrong suggestion which sends me down the wrong path</li>
<li>the fact that if I try to follow the suggestion, I got echoed the same advice</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>λ cargo run -p neard -- init --home h

<ul>
<li>the realization that not only it&#x27;s a wrong suggestion for my situation, but that this can&#x27;t be a correct suggestion at all (because there&#x27;s nothing to take the value in this particular CLI)</li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, features which make life more complicated with comparison to a hypothetical where such feature did&#x27;t exist create a feeling of frustration.</p>

<p>It had a condition on the suggestion.  What was unclear about the condition that you thought it applied (since you were trying to pass a flag instead of a value)?  Or is it a case of &quot;scan and just do what it says&quot;, missing the condition?</p>

<p>I can understand in this case.  I have personally been in the same situation as #1284 many times and haven&#x27;t even considered using <code>--</code> and would have found this helpful.</p>

<p>Exactly this: I am a user in a hurry, whose mind is occupied by an unrelated problem. I don&#x27;t have mental space to carefully consider if-then-else clauses. If a tool suggests some solution, my assumption is that that indeed is the most probable fix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>many times and haven&#x27;t even considered using -- and would have found this helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly: there are some <strong>specific</strong> contexts where <code>--</code> is useful, but they are rare in comparison to all the contexts where <code>--</code> is <em>not</em> useful. Off the top of my head, I recall only two instances where I do want to pass <code>--foo</code> as a value:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;take the rest of the argumetns to pass through to another binary&quot; (<code>cargo run</code>)</li>
<li>&quot;needle&quot; argument for text searches</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#x27;s sort of Bayes&#x27; rule, baseline probabilities matter.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of ways we can make this more specific:</p>
<ul>
<li>don&#x27;t suggest if the suggestion is guaranteed to be wrong</li>
<li>suggest only when we do expect a value and miss one (mandatory positional arg or switch)</li>
<li>suggest only in highly-likely situations (trailing args pattern)</li>
<li>add API to flag a specific argument with &quot;hey, the value here might start with <code>-</code>&quot;, which would affect both default help and error messages.</li>
</ul>

It could probably use some more work and I&#x27;m hesitant in doing a change like this in a patch release as people might design some of their own CLI to match clap and changing it could provide a degraded experience, so we might want to call attention to this by saving it for a minor release.</p>
