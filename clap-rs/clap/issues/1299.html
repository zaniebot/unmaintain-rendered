            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a long list of configuration options and you can set values via short, long variants along with environment variables as well. Application documentation for operations includes the complete usage (<code>--help</code>) as well with additional comments. Usage is a simple copy &amp; paste of <code>--help</code> output from my side.</p>
<p>Others found (during documentation review), that we have accidentally leaked some credentials. Not a big deal, test environment and credentials were rotated immediately. How this happened?</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment variables were set.</li>
<li><code>--help</code> usage printed.</li>
<li>Copy &amp; pasted to the documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>And because <code>--help</code> prints environment variables values along with configuration options, these values were copy &amp; pasted as well.</p>
<p>Is there a way how to disable this behavior? Do not print current environment variables values in the usage even if they're set?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This can be done with <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.31.2/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.hide_env_values"><code>Arg::hide_env_values(true)</code></a> for the argument you wish to hide the values of.</p>
<p>If this doesn't fix it, feel free to re-open and we can re-address :wink:</p>
