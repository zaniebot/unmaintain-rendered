### Clap Version

4.5.13

### Describe your use case

Deno has too big of an help output, and we have various groups of subcommands (permissions, unstable, and more). We want to be to do `--help=unstable` to additionally show the flags related the unstable, and if this is not set don't show them.

### Describe the solution you'd like

- Add an option to hide groups from help output by default.
- allow specifying arg groups via value to `--help` flag. (ie `deno --help=unstable`, or `deno --help=unstable,permissions`)
- the `help` subcommand group could be a flag for each group (ie `deno help --unstable`). this is potentially probelamtic when conflicting with global flags. positional args would conflict with `help [subcommand]`. maybe a `--filter` flag?


### Alternatives, if applicable

Haven't investigated outputting custom help text, but could be potentially be the solution for us, though having this built-in seems like a potentially nice feature.
