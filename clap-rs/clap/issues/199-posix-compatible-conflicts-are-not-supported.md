# POSIX Compatible Conflicts are not supported?

---

_@sru_

In README.md. Can you clarify if "POSIX Compatible Conflicts" is "not supported" or "now supported"?

If it's not supported should it even be in the "What's new" section?

Haha, nice catch. Of course there must be noW supported, not noT.
