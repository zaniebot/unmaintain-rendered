            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Heya :wave:,</p>
<p>I was wondering what the recommended approach is to extract the currently used flags, subcommands, opts (and similar).</p>
<p>My goal is to generate man pages from a Clap struct, with the short versions and descriptions included. I've tried <code>app.write_long_help()</code>, but having to parse strings using regexes seems a bit wasteful.</p>
<p>I've also been digging into Clap's (undocumented) internals but given it's all undocumented, I take it that it might not have any stability guarantees.</p>
<h2>Current Best Approach I've Found</h2>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[macro_use]
extern crate structopt;

use structopt::StructOpt;

mod cli;

fn main() {
  let mut app = cli::Opts::clap();
  let mut stdout = std::io::stdout();
  app.write_long_help(&amp;mut stdout).unwrap();   // We need to run this first.
  for f in app.p.flags() {
    println!(&quot;flag {:?}&quot;, &amp;f);                 // Otherwise this doesn't work.
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So umm, to make these questions a bit more concrete:</p>
<h2>Concrete Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>What's going on in <code>app.write_long_help</code> that provisions <code>app.p.flags()</code> with its contents?</li>
<li>Is there a better way to extract flags than what we're currently doing?</li>
<li>If there currently isn't a better way, could we perhaps add an interface to access this information?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I hope these questions make sense. Thanks so much for your time! :sparkles:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is actually a goal of 3.x! So if you'd like to work on this problem set on the v3-master branch it would be HIGHLY appreciated!</p>
<p>The v3-master branch is quite different from the current master branch (i.e. v2) in that you iterate the subcommands and args directly and not through a <code>Parser</code> facade.</p>
<p>In the v3-master branch you'd use macros (<code>flags!</code>, <code>opts!</code>, <code>subcommands!</code>, <code>positionals!</code> etc.) which have already been defined.</p>
