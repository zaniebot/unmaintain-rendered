<h3>Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code</h3>
<p>cargo run -- --help</p>
<h3>Actual Behaviour</h3>
<p>Trailing newlines are missing for options that were wrapped around.</p>
<pre><code>test

USAGE:

OPTIONS:
    -b, --bar &lt;BAR&gt;
            This is a very very very very very very very very very very very

<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>Using <code>long_help</code> instead of <code>help</code> because <code>help</code> also results in inconsistent formatting. This is slightly better, but the lack of trailing newlines is still a problem.</p>
<h3>Debug Output</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
