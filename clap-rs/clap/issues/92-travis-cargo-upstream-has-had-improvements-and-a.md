# travis-cargo upstream has had improvements and a breaking change

I see you're using travis-cargo but had the forethought to fork it and hence avoid breaking changes. In any case, I thought I should inform you anyway, to ensure you don't get a nasty surprise in future. See http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/05/travis-on-the-train-part-2/ for more details.
