Hi 👋 

Is this a valid entry point for this issue? https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/src/builder/arg_group.rs

Hey @aobatact 👋 

I'm trying to make my first Rust contribution. And as we used Clap in the RIA book, I was looking forward to resolving an issue here ^^

Maybe you plan to tackle this issue yourself? Otherwise, I'll happy to help. :)
