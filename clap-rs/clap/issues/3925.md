# Undocumented Derive Attributes

---

_Issue opened by @Iron-E on 2022-07-13 18:12_

On `master`, looking at the [derive_ref](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/examples/derive_ref/README.md), I have come across several options from other places in the documentation which do not appear to be documented in that file:

1. `group` ([example](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.2.8/examples/tutorial_derive/04_03_relations.rs#L32))
2. `requires` ([example](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.2.8/examples/tutorial_derive/04_03_relations.rs#L35))
3. `value_name` ([example](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.2.8/examples/tutorial_derive/01_quick.rs#L13))

I can only find mention of `value_parser` and `required_if_eq` on the derive_ref. 

If this issue is invalid feel free to close.

These are documented by delegating to the builder documentation

> Raw attributes: Any [Arg method](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/struct.Arg.html) can also be used as an attribute, see [Terminology](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/examples/derive_ref/README.md#terminology) for syntax.

>    e.g. #[clap(max_values(3))] would translate to arg.max_values(3)

I've created https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4090 to further discuss the documentation of raw attributes as this keeps coming up
