            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Its really tempting to say yes but there will always be yet another thing and its easy to underestimate the amount of polish needed for that next thing.</p>
<p>I suggest we focus on polishing what we&#x27;ve done and do this soon after.  If we move forward with <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/2718">clap-rs/clap#2718</a>, then we can start this in 3.x.</p>
<p>With that said, I do not see our milestones as prescriptive but focus areas. However, work done by somebody outside of a focus area should be the level of quality and lack of debate to not detract others from the focus areas.</p>
<p>Speaking of, &quot;focus areas&quot; is a model I&#x27;ve taken in one my projects.  Instead of release milestones, I have a project board with &quot;Triage&quot;, &quot;Focus&quot;, &quot;Planned&quot;, and &quot;Someday&quot;.  Works well for me.  Release milestones would still be useful to track more explicit blockers, like regressions from within the release.</p>
