            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Make sure you completed the following tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>[x] Searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[x] Searched the closed issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have a project that needs to offer 2 shorthand flags (<code>-s</code> and <code>-t</code>) for the same argument in order to conform to a reference implementation from another language. The latter of the two is hidden and exists only for backwards compatibility; however, some old tools only use the hidden form of the flag.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I'd be looking for something similar to <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.0/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.alias"><code>Arg::alias</code></a> but for shorthand arguments. It would probably make sense to have the signature look like</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn alias_short&lt;S: Into&lt;&amp;'help str&gt;&gt;(mut self, name: S) -&gt; Self;
</code></pre>
<p>that adds a hidden shorthand alias.</p>
<p>The relevant code https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/70287eae82e25ada84ed38920fbd3598e5b19039/src/build/arg/mod.rs#L358</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>It shouldn't be too hard to just add a hidden flag and then check if either are set, but it seems unintuitive to only allow aliasing of long arguments.</p>

<p>Thanks for issue.</p>

<p>I hadn't thought that far yet.... ugh. :worried:</p>
<p>... [ thinking intensifies ] ...</p>
<p>I'd say no. So long as the docs are explicit that <code>alias</code> is for longs, and if they wish to find something similar but for shorts, look for <code>short_alias</code> I think it's fine.</p>
