# add ability to hide Subcommands from --help

---

_Issue opened by @matthiaskrgr on 2018-03-31 20:08_

I'd like to be able to hide an entire Subcommand so it does not appear in the ````--help```` output, but currently it seems there is no ````.hidden(true)```` for subcommands.

clap 2.31

For subcommands, use [`AppSettings::Hidden`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.31.2/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#variant.Hidden) it does exactly that 😉
