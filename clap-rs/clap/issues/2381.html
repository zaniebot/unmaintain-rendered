            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Please complete the following tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>[X] I have searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[X] I have searched the existing issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>If one of a set of actions is indicated, shared options for those actions should be allowed.  Those &quot;shared options&quot; should require at least one of the actions to be specified.  it's certainly possible I'm missing something, but I haven't found any way to do that with the currently available &quot;require&quot; options.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>cli --eat-food --quickly # allowed
cli --drink-water --slowly # allowed
cli --slowly # ERROR</p>
<p>An implementation might look like</p>
<p>...ArgGroup::with_name(&quot;consume-options&quot;).requires_group(&quot;consume-actions&quot;)...</p>
<p>or if done without groups, it might look like this:</p>
<p>...Arg::with_name(&quot;slowly&quot;).requires_any_of(&amp;[&quot;eat-food&quot;, &quot;drink-water])...</p>
<p>This rule would also allow something like</p>
<p>cli --eat-food --drink-water --slowly</p>
<p>In other words, the requirement is &quot;one or more.&quot;  It would be up to the rules around eat and drink whether those flags conflict with each other.</p>
