            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>This is not a issue, but more a question. I&#x27;m sorry if I chose the wrong place to ask questions. Is it possible to create dynamic flags, if yes, could you please provide a small example of parsing and using such a flags.</p>
<p>Desired format:</p>
<pre><code>$ app --help
app 1.0.0

USAGE:
    app [FLAGS] [SUBCOMMAND]

FLAGS:
        -fno-([a-z0-9\-]+)    Disables compiler optimizations
        -f([a-z0-9\-]+)       Enables compiler optimizations
        -W([a-z0-9\-]+)       Turns a warning off
        -w([a-z0-9\-]+)       Turns a warning on
    -h, --help                Prints help information
    -V, --version             Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    generate     ...

</code></pre>
<p>Thus, for example, user will able to use <code>app</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>app -Wimplicit-int -Winvalid-pp-token generate
</code></pre>
<p>Note: Here is one <code>-</code> and each flag definition provided in regexp form.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is fine for questions, I welcome them anywhere :smile:</p>
<p>What you&#x27;re looking for is supported as what clap calls options. Minus <code>-fno-([..])</code> which isn&#x27;t supported exactly, but a sort of workaround exists.</p>
<p>If you make an option with only a short, it&#x27;ll work exactly like you&#x27;re looking for</p>
<pre><code>app
.arg(Arg::from_usage(&quot;-f [optimization]    &#x27;Enables compiler optimizations&#x27;&quot;))
.arg(Arg::from_usage(&quot;-W [warning]         &#x27;Turns a warning off&#x27;&quot;))
.arg(Arg::from_usage(&quot;-w [warning]         &#x27;Turns a warning on&#x27;&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>Then one could also add a <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.27.1/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.validator"><code>Arg::validator</code></a> which checks the value against a regex.</p>
<p>Could be run as <code>$ prog -Wimplicit-int</code> just fine.</p>
<p>Once I get to a computer (I&#x27;m on mobile) I can explain the <code>-fno-</code> portion and how to use the workaround or potentially adding support for such.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks really nice. Thank you very much! The last think I need is <code>-fno-</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry it took me so long I got home late.</p>
<p>Right now, when clap encounters a single hyphen it looks so see if the next character is a flag or an option. If it&#x27;s a flag, it then looks at the next character to see if it&#x27;s also a flag, and so on and so forth. As soon as it encounters an option, it looks at the next character and begins parsing the value.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>-fno-</code> clap will see <code>-f</code> is a valid option, and parse everything else as a value. Now in your validator, or in the user code that collects the values, you could just say &quot;everything that starts with <code>no-</code> would be the same as  coming from <code>-fno-</code> which would only require changing the help message.</p>
<pre><code>.arg(Arg::from_usage(&quot;-f [optimization]    &#x27;Enables compiler optimizations (or disables if they start with \&#x27;no-\&#x27;&#x27;&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>So that&#x27;s the &quot;workaround&quot; but I understand that may be less than ideal.</p>
<p>So I&#x27;ve also been toying with the idea of adding an <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.27.1/clap/enum.AppSettings.html"><code>AppSettings</code></a> variant that allows X toolkit style flags and options (such as <code>find</code> with <code>-delete</code> or <code>-name</code>, etc.). This would allow one to declare <code>-fno-</code> in cooperation with the above args and achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>The downside to using this new setting, it would disable the ability to &quot;stack&quot; flags (such as using <code>-FzBod</code> being equivalent to <code>-F -z -B -o -d</code>). But if that&#x27;s unimportant to your use case, it would be a moot tradeoff.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It wouldn&#x27;t be changing the design, that&#x27;s the purpose of the AppSettings enum, to tweak behavior as an opt in feature :wink:</p>
