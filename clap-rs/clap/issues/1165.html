It is very unlikely that anyone just forwards the argument passed to the <code>Err</code> return value, so there's no benefit of offering users an owned <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: It clashes with a clippy lint, and I don't know how to act on it: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/issues/2434</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is kind of related to #848 and I plan on re-working the signature of these methods in v3 (see #1037).</p>
<p>The reason <code>validator</code> takes <code>String</code> by value is there is (was?) no way to convert from <code>OsStr</code> (which originates from <code>env::args_os</code>) to <code>&amp;str</code> because of the utf-8 validation. But <code>validator_os</code> has no such stipulation and can just use the <code>OsStr</code> directly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having looked at the the code, this is the only place validators play:</p>
<p>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/5b9dbee5db540f44c336c2db54ece444624c30ef/src/parse/validator.rs#L138-L159</p>
<p>Essentially, we could just replace</p>
<pre><code>vtor(val.to_string_lossy().into_owned())
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>vtor(val.to_string_lossy().as_ref())) // what was the correct function?
</code></pre>
<p>And change the signature for <code>Validator</code>.</p>
<p>This kind of change won't give us any perf improvement, but it will make the API uniform (both <code>os</code> and <code>str</code> versions will take a reference) and will open road to future improvements. @pksunkara What do you think?</p>
<p>Side note: as of now, if both <code>validator</code> and <code>validator_os</code> are present, <code>str</code> version takes priority (is executed first). I never saw anybody using both, but maybe me should disallow this? Or perhaps run <code>os</code> version only if <code>str</code> has failed?</p>

<p>I don't think it would make sense to have both, as all <code>validator_os</code> can handle anything <code>validator</code> can, but the reverse is not true. So I'm not sure there'd be a reason for a user to have both?</p>
