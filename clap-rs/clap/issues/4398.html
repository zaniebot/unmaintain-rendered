<h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>v1.64.0</p>
<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>v4.0.15</p>
<h3>Minimal reproducible code</h3>
<p>I copy-pasted the first example of <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_tutorial/index.html#configuring-the-parser">this page</a>, however all examples from that page that I've tried exhibit the same problem. I didn't manage to write a code where the <code>--help</code> flag worked.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use clap::Parser;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = &quot;MyApp&quot;)]
#[command(author = &quot;Kevin K. &lt;kbknapp@gmail.com&gt;&quot;)]
#[command(version = &quot;1.0&quot;)]
#[command(about = &quot;Does awesome things&quot;, long_about = None)]
struct Cli {
    #[arg(long)]
    two: String,
    #[arg(long)]
    one: String,
}

fn main() {
    let cli = Cli::parse();

    println!(&quot;two: {:?}&quot;, cli.two);
    println!(&quot;one: {:?}&quot;, cli.one);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code</h3>
<p><code>cargo run -- --help</code></p>
<p>Or <code>cargo build</code> followed with <code>./target/debug/foo --help</code></p>
<h3>Actual Behaviour</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>error: Found argument '--help' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Expected Behaviour</h3>
<p>It should print some help, like explained in the page:</p>
<pre><code>Does awesome things

Usage: 02_apps_derive[EXE] --two &lt;TWO&gt; --one &lt;ONE&gt;

Options:
      --two &lt;TWO&gt;  
      --one &lt;ONE&gt;  
  -h, --help       Print help information
  -V, --version    Print version information

</code></pre>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>I realize that this issue is similar to https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4392, but in this case, I don't know, it just never works. I also very confused, because the <code>--help</code> is the 101 of what this library does, I wouldn't expect it to straight up not work in all scenarios.
Interestingly, however, the <code>--version</code> flag works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>*Came to github trying to debug the same issue.</p>
<p>I ran into this same problem yesterday as well, and I fixed it by enabling the <code>help</code> feature flag on the crate. I think it's surprising that this can be disabled because it is one of the main selling points to using clap.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, we broke out help generation into a feature flag.  In the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#migrating">migration guide</a>, we have this comment about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update feature flags</p>
<ul>
<li>If default-features = false, run cargo add clap -F help,usage,error-context</li>
<li>Run cargo add clap -F wrap_help unless you want to hard code line wraps</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>While a main selling point, it isn't the only selling point and people have been wanting flexibility on this for a while.</p>
<p>For example, I am considering snapshotting my help in tests and building that in so that I have semi-automated help generation without the costs.</p>
<p>What I'm really looking forward to is https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3126 which will make it easier to piece meal remove features from clap.</p>
<p>As this was most likely a missing <code>help</code> feature flag, I'm going to go ahead and close this.  If there is something lingering in this, let me know and I can re-open.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, thanks for the hindsight.</p>
<p>I find it extremely surprising that activating/disabling a feature flag modifies the behavior of the code. For example, if you depend on <code>clap</code> with <code>default-features = false</code>, then add a dependency <code>foo</code> which itself depends on <code>clap</code> but without <code>default-features = false</code>, the behavior of your program will be modified just by adding this <code>foo</code> dependency.</p>
<p>If I can suggest a way better to do it, the user should explicitly attach the <code>#[command(help)]</code> attribute if they want the auto-generated help, and it would fail to compile if the feature flag is disabled.</p>

<p>I think this comes back to the other comment:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I'm more worried about the out-of-box experience than the <code>default-features = false</code> user, especially as I see <code>default-features = false</code> going away in the long term.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(sorry if I sound pushy, I'm not actually opinionated about this, happy to end the discussion at any point)</p>
<p>Personally I automatically put <code>default-features = false</code> on every single dependency I add. I've wasted so much time fighting with annoying feature flags interactions in the general Rust ecosystem in the past that I've decided to do this as a policy.</p>
<p>For this reason, I also don't provide feature flags for my (more recent) crates apart from <code>std</code>. I think that the trade-off between &quot;improved compilation time&quot; (having feature flags) and &quot;increased clarity for the user&quot; (not having feature flags) weights heavily on the side of not having feature flags at all.</p>
<p>I really see feature flags as one of the greatest mistakes of the Rust language in general.</p>

<p>I have the feeling that this is probably a decade away, if ever.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much of this is features themselves vs the UX not being fully developed.  For example, I've found <code>cargo add</code>, especially when crates use the <code>dep:</code> prefix to hide optional dependencies, a big help.</p>
<p>For a lot of feature uses, I do hope https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3243# goes through as an alternative.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm being optimistic but I'm hoping for next edition.  The cargo team is interested in solving the &quot;adding new default features without breaking&quot; problem and several of us on the cargo team are particularly hopeful for this solution.  I don't know about others but I've just not moved down my priority list enough to get to writing an RFC for it.</p>
