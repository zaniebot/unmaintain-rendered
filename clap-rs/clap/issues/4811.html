Rust Version
<p>1.62.1</p>
Clap Version
<p>v4.0.32</p>
Minimal reproducible code
<p>N/A</p>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<pre><code>cargo new --bin args
cd args
cargo add clap@=4.0.32
cargo +1.62.1 check
</code></pre>
Actual Behaviour
<pre><code>error: package `clap_lex v0.3.3` cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.64.0 or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.62.1
</code></pre>
Expected Behaviour
<p>Since the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v4.0.32/Cargo.toml#L26">MSRV for clap v4.0.32 is rust 1.60.0</a> I expect to be able to compile with the 1.62.1 compiler.</p>
Additional Context
<p>It looks like the version numbers for dependencies need to be constrained to prevent cargo from picking a version with an incompatible MSRV.  In this case clap_lex should be fixed to v0.3.0 since v0.3.1 bumped the MSRV to rust 1.64.0.  There may be other incompatibilities... this is just the first error presented.</p>
Debug Output
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like I&#x27;m able to build by adding the constraint described above to v4.0.32.</p>
<pre><code>-clap_lex = { path = &quot;./clap_lex&quot;, version = &quot;0.3.0&quot; }
+clap_lex = { path = &quot;./clap_lex&quot;, version = &quot;=0.3.0&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>however, I&#x27;m unable to create a pull request since there&#x27;s no branch at that point in the repo.  Would it be possible to tag a v4.0.33 with this change?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The way to solve this is for you to run <code>cargo update -p clap_lex --precise 0.3.0</code>.  Newer versions of <code>cargo</code> should include that suggestion in the error.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, crates can only be responsible that they can build for the MSRV but should not be responsible for all of  versions of dependencies to build for the MSRV</p>
<ul>
<li>One way is for everyone to treat a change to MSRV as a breaking change but this is quite disruptive and leads to multiple copies of crates in dependency graphs</li>
<li>Another way is to use version constraints, as you mentioned, but this has repercussions on the ecosystem, for example<ul>

<li>https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/p8clcx/how_to_fix_cargo_dependency_issue/</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideal long term solution is for cargo to handle this automatically which I&#x27;m working towards: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9930">rust-lang/cargo#9930</a></p>
