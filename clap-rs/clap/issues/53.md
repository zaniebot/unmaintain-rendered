# use &[&str] in "_all(Vec<&str>)" methods

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-04-02 03:49_

Allow slices in the `_all(&[&str])` methods instead of a `_all(Vec<&str>)` to not require an extra allocation.

This is going to be postponed, as I'm not sure the benefit is worth the break, or how much of a benefit there actually is...

Closing for now.
