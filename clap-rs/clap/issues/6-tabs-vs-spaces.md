# Tabs vs spaces

_@untitaker_

While creating #5 I've noticed that you use tabs. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-guidelines/blob/master/style/whitespace.md suggests that this is discouraged. Would you consider switching to that guideline?

Yes, I can switch over. I'll start working on that next, thanks!

It should be good to go now as of [418ead0](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/commit/418ead0b00fb85309246ebd611019892812e3210), I'll leave this open in case I missed anything. Thanks again, as this fixed a few formatting issues I'd been having trouble tracking down!
