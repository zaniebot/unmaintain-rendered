# Create a FAQ

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-09-06 15:58_

Link to it in the readme, but the FAQ should be a `FAQ.md` in the root directory.
- [x] Create a Wiki Page
- [ ] Create a FAQ.md
- [x] Link in README.md

As noted in #228

This should also probably be linked to, or maybe even duplicated in the wiki section.

I'd vote for in github's wiki section for the start. And once dust settles copy it over to lib.rs such that it is in the root of `rustdoc`'s documentation. Maybe also as a `FAQ.md`. Can rustdoc import this file in the docs?

With a makefile it can, which is how I used to import the readme into rustdoc.

The [wiki page](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/wiki/FAQ) has been started. I'll leave this issue open for a little bit to generate some traffic. Once we have some good additions/suggestions, etc. I'll put a link to it in the readme as well as create  `FAQ.md`

As a start, I used some of the questions from #228

Added headings differing usage and implementation related questions. Moved the lifetime one to the implementation section
