<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>master</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>As a software author using clap, I am interested in offering auto-completion for my tool. I am aware that clap_complete exists, which is great, but I could not find documentation for what users are expected to do with the output of clap_complete, for auto-completion to work in their shell.</p>
<p>All I could find so far are <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/583ba4ad9a4aea71e5b852b142715acaeaaaa050/clap_complete/examples/completion-derive.rs#L3-L14">two examples for zsh and fish</a>, but I think it would be useful if this information could be made available more visible in the documentation itself.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I would like to add this information https://docs.rs/clap_complete/latest/clap_complete/. For each supported shell type, one could show how the completion script is meant to be installed (or point to the relevant documentation from the said shell if it's too complicated to summarize).</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>I am willing to make a PR for it if it is deemed worth the effort.</p>
