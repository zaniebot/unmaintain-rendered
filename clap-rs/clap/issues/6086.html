Describe your use case
<p>As a software author using clap, I am interested in offering auto-completion for my tool. I am aware that clap_complete exists, which is great, but I could not find documentation for what users are expected to do with the output of clap_complete, for auto-completion to work in their shell.</p>
<p>All I could find so far are <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/583ba4ad9a4aea71e5b852b142715acaeaaaa050/clap_complete/examples/completion-derive.rs#L3-L14">two examples for zsh and fish</a>, but I think it would be useful if this information could be made available more visible in the documentation itself.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I would like to add this information https://docs.rs/clap_complete/latest/clap_complete/. For each supported shell type, one could show how the completion script is meant to be installed (or point to the relevant documentation from the said shell if it&#x27;s too complicated to summarize).</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p><em>No response</em></p>
Additional Context
<p>I am willing to make a PR for it if it is deemed worth the effort.</p>
