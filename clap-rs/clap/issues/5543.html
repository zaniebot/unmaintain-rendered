Clap Version
<p>4.5.7</p>
Describe your use case
<p><code>-V</code> and <code>--version</code> come with a message that is essentially <code>&quot;{name} {version}\n&quot;</code>, where version is <code>version</code> for <code>-V</code> and <code>long_version</code> for <code>--version</code>. On top of this difference in output, one might want to print out some license text on <code>--version</code> but not <code>-V</code>, or do some other things.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s technically possible to distinguish by parsing the output for <code>format!(&quot;{}&quot;, error.render())</code>, but that&#x27;s not super nice.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>A breaking change would be to have DisplayVersion and DisplayLongVersion. I guess since ErrorKind is non_exhaustive, adding DisplayLongVersion wouldn&#x27;t be breaking as long as it&#x27;s not emitted by default. (meaning it would require some flag to enable)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because I want to actually do something different after displaying the version. Specifically, I want to make -V show the version and --version show the long version <em>and</em> check for updates. Well, I already did, by checking <code>format!(&quot;{}&quot;, error.render())</code>.
Also, in the hypothetical case of showing licensing terms, that somehow feels wrong to put in long_version.</p>

<p><code>long_version</code> exists to control what is shown for <code>--version</code>, so it fits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--version show the long version and check for updates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is an interesting case.  Besides splitting up the ErrorKind, I am wondering what other options are.  Some I could think of</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually implement the flags separately</li>
<li>Allow providing custom <code>ArgAction</code>s so a user can implement a custom &quot;version&quot; within clap (which might help with other cases like #815)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can&#x27;t think of too much else.</p>

<p>I actually rejected that one for my use-case, because I&#x27;m deriving Parser on an enum (with subcommand_required=true), which doesn&#x27;t leave space for that, except if I add another layer to handle --help and --version.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s a variant of &quot;Manually implement the flags separately&quot; isn&#x27;t it?</p>

<p>Not too sure which part is the blocker here</p>
<ul>
<li>It shouldn&#x27;t be too much to move <code>Parser</code> onto a <code>struct</code> that wraps your enum</li>
<li>You can use <code>subcommand_required = true</code> with <code>Option&lt;Subcommand&gt;</code> so the derive works properly</li>
<li>You can mark the version flag(s) as excluding all and global so they mostly get the existing behavior</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>In the ideal case, the interface would allow for all existing actions to be implemented as if they were third party.  This would allow you to put all of that logic (license and update checks) in the call and then ask for the program to exit.</p>

<p>I didn&#x27;t mean it was a blocker, but it&#x27;s unappealing in the amount of boilerplate it requires for something that the gross hack I came up with dealt with in 2 lines of code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW I ran into this too while trying to do something similar to @glandium. I agree that in the ideal world I&#x27;d be able to pass in a callback or something similar.</p>
