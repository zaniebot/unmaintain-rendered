            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can you give your use case as to why you expect hidden subcommands to be not suggested?</p>
<p>The exact semantics of <code>hide</code> come up from time to time.  For example, we suggest hidden subcommands and arguments in completions (#1335).  In the new completion system, the proposal is to not suggest completing hidden items by default but to instead complete them if it looks like the user is intending to use the hidden item (#3951).</p>
<p>This latter case sounds similar to suggestions in errors which runs counter to this issue / #4852 which is why this merits further discussion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>so the tool I am working on has commands that is not intended to be run manually, at all. they are only intended to be invoked internally by the tool itself.</p>
<p>i am ok with only suggesting them when the user <em>do</em> intend to use them, but i don&#x27;t see how you can reliably detect user intentions.</p>
<p>i found this to be a problem because clap suggested things like <code>__subcommand</code> when i typed <code>sub</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was curious and tried to find a way to do so in #5097.</p>
<p>It adds <code>.didyoumean(false)</code> that filter out arguments from the suggestion logic. In combination with <code>.hide(...)</code> I think that would create what @weihanglo wants and we can extends for subcommands for @yshui.</p>
<p>Anyway just a suggestion instead of fighting for wether or not <code>hide(...)</code> should suggest or not.</p>

<p>There was more discussion in rust-lang/cargo#11702 and it is unclear what we want the behavior to be in that case.</p>

<p>Except this shifts the discussion to whether this part of the API pulls enough weight to justify itself.  We&#x27;ve been focusing recently on shrinking clap, in binary size, in compile time, and in API size.  The bigger the API is, the harder it is to find anything, making it less likely people will use any of the features in the API, lowering the value gained by having each piece of the API.</p>
