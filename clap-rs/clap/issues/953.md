# Add CI badges to Cargo.toml

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2017-05-09 22:08_

Cargo.toml publishes CI badges for tier 1 platforms (C-CI)

The Rust compiler regards tier 1 platforms as "guaranteed to work."
Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:

    Official binary releases are provided for the platform.
    Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.
    Landing changes to the rust-lang/rust repository's master branch is gated on
    tests passing.
    Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.

Stable, high-profile crates should meet the same level of rigor when it comes to
tier 1. To prove it, Cargo.toml should publish CI badges.

```toml
[badges]
travis-ci = { repository = "..." }
appveyor = { repository = "..." }
```
