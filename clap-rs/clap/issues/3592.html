<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.1.3</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Not much special context for the use case, reasoning behind the feature is given below.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Given the following code (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=19e608001b198271c876aaeb1ea04aaa">playground</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use clap::Parser;

#[derive(Parser)]
struct Args {
    #[clap(short)]
    arg1: String,

    #[clap(short)]
    arg2: String,
}

fn main() {
    let _ = Args::parse();
}
</code></pre>
<p>clap will successfully detect at runtime that <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code> have the duplicate short form <code>-a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>thread 'main' panicked at 'Command playground: Short option names must be unique for each argument, but '-a' is in use by both 'arg1' and 'arg2'', /playground/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/clap-3.1.3/src/build/debug_asserts.rs:100:17
note: [run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace](https://play.rust-lang.org/#)
</code></pre>
<p>With clap's derive interface, it seems like this could be caught at compile time when the proc macro executes on <code>Args</code>, by producing a compiler error if it picks up on duplicate short (or long) names.</p>
<p>This would give much quicker feedback for programmer error. Also, since clap only checks for argument uniqueness in debug mode, if you're only ever running a release build of your binary you won't actually hit this panic.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>I personally wouldn't mind it if the assertions were enabled in release builds, but the compile-time approach seems better as it avoids the runtime overhead.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>We were mostly only running our binary in release mode, and we went a few days with duplicate short arguments. When we hit the panic, it wasn't immediately obvious what was going on.</p>
