This would be very useful to support completions for a Repl. What do I need to learn to make this happen?

If you are doing a REPL, then I'm assuming you only care about the completion engine and not shell integration.  In that case, its a matter of updating the [completion parser](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/clap_complete/src/engine/complete.rs) to handle this.

To fully close this issue out, someone would need to explore how shell integration should be handled.
