            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I went to do a bit more dynamic generation (this time with the help text of one of my app's arguments), and ran into the same static lifetime issue as #28.</p>
<p>I can provide a more concrete example if you'd like, but I wanted to file this before I forgot.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No need for the example, I know what you mean :) I actually was thinking about this when implementing #28 I'll see what I can figure out, and post back with some answers!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me know if that works for you. If not, I may need a more detailed diagram of what you're trying to do ;) Master in the repo or 0.4.17 on crates.io is what you're after btw.</p>
