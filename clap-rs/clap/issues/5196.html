<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.4.6</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I want to be able to use this help message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">When this option is specified, the program will try to match the given
pattern with the filename and write extracted information to the
metadata.

You can use the following correspondence when writing your pattern
{n}  Artist &lt;-&gt; {a}
{n}  Title  &lt;-&gt; {t}
{n}  Album  &lt;-&gt; {m}
{n}  Year   &lt;-&gt; {y}
{n}  Track  &lt;-&gt; {n}

Default parser patterns are shown below and parsers tries each of them
in the given order:
{n}  1. {n} {a} - {t}
{n}  2. {n} {a} — {t}
{n}  3. {n}. {a} - {t}
{n}  4. {n}. {a} — {t}
{n}  5. {a} - {n} {t}
{n}  6. {a} — {n} {t}
{n}  7. {a} - {n}. {t}
{n}  8. {a} — {n}. {t}
{n}  9. {a} - {t}
{n}  10. {a} — {t}
{n}  11. {n} {t}
{n}  12. {n}. {t}
{n}  13. {t}
</code></pre>
<p>where first {n} are expected to be interpreted as \n and I want to have ability to &quot;escape&quot; other {n} to be able to see literally <code>{n}</code> in the output help message.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>To have escaping option to be used: for example <code>{{n}}</code> or <code>\{n\}</code> or something like that.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But for some reason <code>clap</code> replaces <code>{n}</code> even if I use builder pattern instead of deriving it. Any reason why is this the case?</p>
<p>P.S. Using <code>verbatim_doc_comment</code> doesn't change this behavior (although it's mentioned as a workaround in #2389).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It exists in the builder because that was the original intended use case.  Rather than partially back it out and then completely remove it, we've left it in as is until we can remove it.</p>
