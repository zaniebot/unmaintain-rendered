            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>Parser::update_from</code> and related functions were introduced into the derive API in clap v3 (ie they didn't exist in structopt).  They required a lot of work to get the basic semantics down for 3.0.0 (#2212, #2605) and since have continued to have issues for it (#4501, #4617, see also #3924).</p>
<p>However, it does seem like this does not have impact on build time or binary size which I had assumed it would.</p>
