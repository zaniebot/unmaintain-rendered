<ul>
<li>[X] I have searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[X] I have searched the existing issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>It's clear from the README and the Rust docs that there are two APIs.</p>
<p>What's unclear is which to choose, or whether it matters.</p>
<p>I remember when v3 was still in RC, there was an explanation that Builder is more performant and advanced. However, it is unclear whether that's still the case.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Add an explanation for the differences between the two APIs and why a dev would choose one or the other. If there is no difference, explain why there are two APIs.</p>

<p>One question will be where to put it., where are people likely to look to help steer them one way of the other.</p>

Builder API and Derive API links moved to subheadings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Might be good to add a Getting Started at some point but went ahead and put it under <code>About</code> for now.  Just felt weird writing such a short page to then link out to the &quot;real&quot; content.</p>
