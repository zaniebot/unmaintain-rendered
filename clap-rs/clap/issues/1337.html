<p>If some properties that you have aren't yet in CWL you can add them as &quot;vendor extensions&quot; and retain compatibility. We'd want to study your extensions for possible future inclusion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, I looked over the spec and I am really hesitant to support it. It will have too much noise compared to clap's yaml which will make it harder for users to use.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mr-c The main goal of <code>clap</code> is to provide a flexible an feature-full parser for command line arguments, but the full scope of CWL is way beyond this goal. I don't think we'll ever consider supporting all of it.</p>
<p>About CLI part only - well, if it's all about building <code>clap::App</code> from corresponding <code>cwl.yaml</code> file it can be seen as &quot;yet another format akin to YAML and TOML&quot;. We are considering to make use of <code>serde</code> (#1630). If/when we manage to implement it, you will be free to make your own implementation of it , like <code>serde_json</code> or <code>serde_yaml</code>.</p>
<p>Even if we decide not to support it, you are still free to make your own &quot;converter&quot; crate that reads <code>cwl.yaml</code> and builds the corresponding <code>clap::App</code>.</p>
<p>I'm closing this because I'm almost sure we don't want to maintain such an implementation in this repo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is pretty much exactly why I used the YAML feature to write <a href="https://github.com/luizirber/decoct/blob/b53cdc76070cc9997a1aecac410bff99262f9d0e/src/decoct.yml#L115">my CLI</a>. I had previously handwritten the equivalent command (<a href="https://github.com/luizirber/sourmash-cwl/blob/d76c15bd079c7625358ed271aeb9514702770f59/sourmash-compute.cwl">compute</a>) in CWL, and I think it would be extremely useful to have both more Rust CLIs in bioinformatics and larger adoption of CWL tool descriptions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have decided to deprecate the YAML API.  For more details, see https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3087.  I am assuming this would fall in the same category.  If there is interest in a data-driven API, it will likely be broken out into a <code>clap_yaml</code> and developed independent from the core of clap.</p>
