<ul>
<li>[X] I have searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[X] I have searched the existing issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>It would be good if the programmer could use other DSLs (data serialisation langauges) other than YAML, such as RON, JSON, TOML, etc.</p>
<p>I would very much like to use RON or JSON instead of YAML.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>There is a <code>ron</code> crate and I believe <code>serde</code> supports it.</p>
<p>I think DSL support should only cost compile-time and be baked into the binary, with no cost at runtime since it's essentially a declarative specification of the command-line arguments for the program.</p>
