# Using >2 dashes shows 2 dashes in the help menu.

### Make sure you completed the following tasks

### Code

This can be seen with cargo. Just run `cargo -----`, 

### Actual Behavior Summary

it will say,
`error: Found argument '--' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context`,
2 dashes, even with more than 2 dashes in the command. I am using cargo since it is readily available and uses clap.

### Expected Behavior Summary

`error: Found argument '-----' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context`,
