# Simplify Alias API / code

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2022-10-24 13:22_

Currently, we have visible and non visible aliases along with singular and multiple methods.

One way of simplifying this is if we had a `Alias<T>` that had a `hide(yes: bool)`  function.  `Arg::alias` would implicitly convert strings to `Alias` or people could directly construct an alias and set it to hidden.

This would change `Arg::alias` from hidden to visible.  The reason I'm suggesting that is to be consistent with our hiding of content.  Maybe a `visible` would be justified, unsure.
