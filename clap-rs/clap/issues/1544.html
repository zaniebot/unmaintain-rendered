            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s a proper place to ask, sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to contribute to <code>clap</code>, say, fix some issues, push some old PRs over the finish line and so on.
But as far as I see the <code>master</code> branch had not received any significant contributions for a long time so I suppose it&#x27;s not the branch I should be working on. I notice <code>v3-dev</code> and <code>v3-master</code> branches <em>do</em> have some effort being put in them so it seems one or both of them are the place I need to look at.</p>
<p>So what do I do?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CreepySkeleton thanks. Yes we have &quot;frozen&quot; the master branch, since we are focussing on 3.0 which is on the v3-master branch. You can pick any issue from the list and send a PR or a draft in case you need any help. Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Dylan-DPC Just noticed &quot;Important note on clap 3.0&quot;, this <em>is</em> documented after all. But perhaps we should change the tittle to &quot;Contributing to 3.0&quot; so it would catch an eye of contributors?</p>
