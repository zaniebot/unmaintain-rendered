Clap Version

Describe your use case
<p><code>AppSettings::Multicall</code> supports the use-case of hostname, which doesn&#x27;t have applets available as subcommands for the program when run by its base program name rather than via a link.</p>
<p>This is implemented by giving preference to matching against subcommand names.</p>
<p>This makes us unable to support programs whose name as a noun is the same as what it does as a verb.
e.g. <code>badger</code> may be a program that sends nagging reminders until you confirm you&#x27;ve done the task. It doing this is badgering you, so the command to initiate it doing this could be <code>badger badger foo@example.com</code>.</p>
<p>It may be a multicall executable because part of its behaviour involves running a subcommand e.g. it sends data from a socket via pipe so it implements a significant portion of the behaviour of <code>nc</code>. It normally starts this subprocess by running <code>badger nc</code>, but it may be better optimised than the system <code>nc</code> and so would be useful to install a link to badger as nc.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Add an additional flag to change the argv[0] matching behaviour to check against program name first.
This is a slight optimisation if the program name is expected to match more than a subcommand.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>We could WONTFIX this as being too obscure a use-case.</p>
<p>We could invert the behaviour so this is the default, and expect <code>hostname</code>-like programs to set their base program name to something they won&#x27;t be installed as and only install links to their applets.</p>
