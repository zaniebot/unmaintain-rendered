Describe your use case
<p>There are certain parameters that I would like to complete using paths. However, some of that paths aren&#x27;t relative to the Current Working Directory.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>It would be great if you could specify a base directory for Path-like completions. In a Utopian world, it would also be great to include an optional max-depth:</p>
<pre><code>pub enum ValueHint {
    // ...
    AnyChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    FileChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    DirChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    ExecutableChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>let start_path = PathBuf::from(&quot;/some/path&quot;);
let depth = 1;
let hint = Vault::Hint(start_path, depth);
</code></pre>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>The alternative that I&#x27;m exploring right now is rolling my own completion for <code>Path</code>, which isn&#x27;t ideal.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that <code>ValueHint</code> is specifically meant to capture native shell completions.</p>
<p>#1232 is our issue for allowing the user to provide custom completers which is blocked on #3166.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to close in favor of #1232 as we likely won&#x27;t support every case for users.  We can observe users and maybe pull some things in that are frequently used but I don&#x27;t want to speculatively keep this issue as open in case this ends up being one of the cases.  After the community has adopted #1232, if there is enough of a case that this pattern is common, we can re-evaluate then.</p>
