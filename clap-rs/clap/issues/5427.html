<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.4.7</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>There are certain parameters that I would like to complete using paths. However, some of that paths aren't relative to the Current Working Directory.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>It would be great if you could specify a base directory for Path-like completions. In a Utopian world, it would also be great to include an optional max-depth:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub enum ValueHint {
    // ...
    AnyChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    FileChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    DirChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    ExecutableChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let start_path = PathBuf::from(&quot;/some/path&quot;);
let depth = 1;
let hint = Vault::Hint(start_path, depth);
</code></pre>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>The alternative that I'm exploring right now is rolling my own completion for <code>Path</code>, which isn't ideal.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note that <code>ValueHint</code> is specifically meant to capture native shell completions.</p>
<p>#1232 is our issue for allowing the user to provide custom completers which is blocked on #3166.</p>
<p>I'm going to close in favor of #1232 as we likely won't support every case for users.  We can observe users and maybe pull some things in that are frequently used but I don't want to speculatively keep this issue as open in case this ends up being one of the cases.  After the community has adopted #1232, if there is enough of a case that this pattern is common, we can re-evaluate then.</p>
