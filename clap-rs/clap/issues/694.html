clap Version: 2.14.0</p>
<p>In one of my new projects, I noticed that it was dying with an error about the default argument value failing &quot;path is readable&quot; validation, even when I was trying to override it with an explicit argument.</p>
<p>I started working on a simplified testcase and found that this bug is very picky. If any of these conditions aren't met, it will act properly and validate either the default or the user-provided value but not both:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>global(true)</code> must be specified</li>
<li>A <code>default_value</code> must be specified</li>
<li>A <code>validator</code> must be provided</li>
<li>A subcommand must be defined and passed on the command line</li>
</ul>
<p>...but, if all of them are, it insists on validating both the default and the user-provided value.</p>
<p>It's possible there's more I could discover, but I'm sick and it's getting late, so here's how far I managed to minimize and pin down the test case so far:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">extern crate clap;
use clap::{App,Arg,SubCommand};

const DEFAULT_INPATH: &amp;'static str = &quot;/dev/sr1&quot;;

fn main() {
    App::new(&quot;testcase&quot;)
        .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;inpath&quot;)
            .global(true)
            .default_value(DEFAULT_INPATH)
            .validator(|x| {
                print!(&quot;Testing {}\n&quot;, x);
                if x == DEFAULT_INPATH {
                    print!(&quot;ERROR: Validator ran on default string\n&quot;);
                }
                Ok(())
            }))
        .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name(&quot;test&quot;))
        .get_matches_from(&amp;[&quot;testcase&quot;, &quot;/dev/sr0&quot;, &quot;test&quot;]);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I also just noticed that it's validating the default <em>after</em> the user-provided value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ssokolow@monolith testcase % cargo run

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was having computer issues last night and wasn't able to test this earlier. But now I've tested it.</p>
<p>As your minimal test is written, clap is functioning <em>somewhat</em> as intended. Here's what's happening in the test case above:</p>
<ul>
<li>clap gets an explicit value for <code>inpath</code>, and validates it</li>
<li>clap then reaches the subcommand <code>test</code></li>
<li>because <code>inpath</code> is global, there is effectively a <code>test &lt;inpath&gt;</code> as well.</li>
<li>Since <code>inpath</code> isn't required, the subcommand's <code>inpath</code> is empty and therefore gets the default value applied to it</li>
<li>clap then validates the default value of the <em>subcommand's</em> <code>inpath</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you'd like is for the value to propagated down through child subcommands? If so, that's a feature that could probably be added as an optional setting.</p>
<p>Edit: Incorrect data (fixed now)...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've taken a look at this, and it looks like my original explanation stands. Propagating those values down through the child <code>--inpath</code> args would solve this issue. But my hesitation some users may not want that behavior due to conflicting uses of a global argument. Imagine a command which uses a global arg, but the implementation means the context is different depending on which subcommand the value was provided to.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't use global args in this instance, and instead confine the <code>--inpath</code> to parent command</li>
<li>Instead of subcommands, use a single positional argument with predefined values (<a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.19.0/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.possible_values"><code>Arg::possible_values</code></a>) since you're not defining additional arguments on those subcommands and merely using them to differentiate between values.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of those approaches have their pros and cons. If you were planning on adding additional unique args to those subcommands option 2 isn't as feasible. Option 1 provides a slightly less flexible CLI.</p>
<p>Of course there's also the ability to add another <code>AppSettings</code> variant which allows propagating values down through subcommands. The only problem with this, is due to how it's implemented, it's not easily possible to propagate values <em>up</em> or <em>sideways</em> only down in the tree. So this setting could be a potential point of confusion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Option 2 is unfeasible for exactly the reason you stated. Processing CleanRip dumps from a Wii SD card is going to have options different from those for <code>/media/ssokolow/RETRODE</code> which, again, will be different from optical media, which will have their own special options if they're being dumped as audio or audio+data CDs. I just happened to nail down the common schema first.</p>
<p>As for option 1, it's not an acceptable user experience for when I dogfood it. I'd sooner include two separate argument parsers into my program with the first one's only purpose being to recognize global arguments and reposition them in the command line before passing it on to clap.</p>
<p>(I'm the &quot;good user experience at any cost&quot; type. The whole reason I'm using Rust is because the compile-time checks help me accomplish that goal.)</p>
<p>For comparison with another parser's solution, when I do this with <a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html"><code>argparse</code></a> in Python, it's accomplished via a mechanism analogous to OOP inheritance where an <code>ArgumentParser</code> is defined for the common arguments and then passed via a <code>parents=[]</code> argument when instantiating each subcommand's <code>ArgumentParser</code> instance.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I'm good adding the settings variant which propagates values down, that'd actually be a decently easy addition. I'll play with some implementations once I've got a little bit of time and post back here.</p>
