Clap Version
<p>4.3.19</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to build commands where there are multiple, mutually exclusive usages.  A good example of this is the <code>tar</code> command.</p>
<p>From the man page:</p>
<pre><code>tar {-c} [options] [files | directories]
tar {-r} -f archive-file [options] [files | directories]
tar {-t | -x} [options] [patterns]
</code></pre>
<p>The flags <code>-c</code>, <code>-r</code>, <code>-t</code>, <code>-x</code> change how the rest of the arguments are parsed.  This would be easy to accomplish with clap if those flags were instead subcommands, but I haven&#x27;t found a good way of doing it with flags.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>One potential solution would be to allow the presence of a flag to act as a subcommand.</p>
<p>Another solution would be to have a usage enum that could look something like:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, clap::Usage)]
pub enum TarUsage {
    #[usage(short_present = &#x27;c&#x27;)]
    Create(CreateArgs),
    #[usage(short_present = &#x27;x&#x27;)]
    Extract(ExtractArgs),
    #[usage(short_present = &#x27;t&#x27;)]
    List(ListArgs),
}
</code></pre>
<p>It would dispatch parsing of the remaining arguments to a different parser based on the presence of a flag.  The usage annotation could be expanded to set a default usage, or handle more complex conditions.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>The solution I&#x27;m using now is to just have every argument for all variants in one struct and put them all in <code>Option&lt;&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>A downside of this approach is that any code using the that struct has <code>.unwrap()</code>s everywhere.  It also requires writing a bunch of annotation rules describing when an argument is required or forbidden based on the presence of a flag.</p>
<p>I also need to use <code>#[command(override_usage = ...)</code> because the default usage string will be wrong.</p>
<p>I feel like this is a common type of command and the only approach I&#x27;ve found is not very good.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_cookbook/pacman/index.html">subcommand long flags</a>.  Though that example hasn&#x27;t been translated into the derive API, builder methods can be used as derive attributes (<a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html#terminology">reference</a>).</p>
<p>The one potential downside is that the subcommand names will remain visible (thought we had an issue for this but can&#x27;t find it).  A workaround is to use a <code>help_template</code> and not show the subcommands.  #1334 would be useful though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alternatively, if you are willing to dispatch the positional arguments yourself, you could represent <code>{ -c | -r | { -t | -x } }</code> as an <code>ArgGroup</code> and then have their respective flags <code>requires</code> the one from the arg group.  This will fall flat if there is a flag that needs to be used differently depending on the &quot;mode&quot;.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, using <code>#[command(short_flag = &#x27;...&#x27;, long_flag = &quot;...&quot;)]</code> on subcommand enum variants solved my initial problem.</p>
<p>I was also wondering if it&#x27;s possible to have a default subcommand that will be chosen when a subcommand flag isn&#x27;t present.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d also like be able to disable the non-flag version of a subcommand so they don&#x27;t conflict with positional arguments.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_cookbook/git_derive/index.html"><code>git</code> example</a> as <code>git stash</code> defaults to <code>git stash push</code>.</p>

<p>I know this has come up before but not finding a relevant issue.  Feel free to create one.</p>
<p>Since the original answer is handled, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and close this.</p>
