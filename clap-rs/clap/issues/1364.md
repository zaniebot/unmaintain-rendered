# Empty OPTIONS in -h if all options exist but all are hidden_short_help

---

_Issue opened by @FauxFaux on 2018-10-18 19:07_

### Affected Version of clap

2.32.0

### Bug or Feature Request Summary

If all of your option-taking arguments are `hidden_short_help`, I would expect the "OPTIONS" section to be absent (as if the flags did not exist). 

### Actual Behavior Summary

"OPTIONS:" shows up, and is not visually pleasing.

```
FLAGS:
    -f               
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:


ARGS:
    <FILES>... 
```

### Sample Code or Link to Sample Code

```rust
extern crate clap; use clap::App; use clap::Arg;
fn main() {
    App::new("demo")
        .arg(Arg::with_name("foo").short("f"))
        .arg(Arg::with_name("baz").short("z")
             .value_name("BAZ")
             .hidden_short_help(true))
        .arg(Arg::with_name("files")
             .value_name("FILES")
             .multiple(true))
        .get_matches();
}
```
