Clap Version

Describe your use case
<p>I have an app that has several subcommands, some of which are wrappers around other CLI tools. For example <code>casile</code> has several subcommands, but one of them is <code>casile make</code> that sets up a special environment and this passes all the remaining args to <code>make</code>. I have it setup something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    Make {
        target: Vec&lt;String&gt;,
    },
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> seems to be the best way to collect further arguments and pass them through to the subprocess. Since passing other flags to <code>make</code> is valid here the arguments beyond this point may or may not be filenames, and even if they are they may or may not exist yet which makes filename completion (as I would get if I made this a <code>Vec&lt;PathBuf&gt;</code> or similar not very useful.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I&#x27;d like to be able to specify something in the CLI that specifically called out the command for which to use completions for:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    Make {
        #[clap_complete(delegate=&quot;make&quot;)]
        target: Vec&lt;String&gt;,
    },
}
</code></pre>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what the exact ergonomics should be, but somehow I&#x27;d like the final generated completion scripts to delegate completions for arguments in this position to the completion script of a different external command.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p><em>No response</em></p>
Additional Context
<p>I&#x27;m not sure all supported shells have a way to handle this, but at least bash and zsh do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I looked at that issue before opening this, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s related. Implementing this does not require dynamic completion support. Delegating to the completions of another command is not at all the same thing as using the output of a command as completions, and the plumbing needed to make shells do this is different (and simpler).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We plan to completely change our completion system, see #3166.</p>
<p>Doing major re-work of our existing completions to fit this is a bit of a dead end and could put us in a design bind for when we get to the end state of #3166.</p>
<p>#3166 is also responsible for us tracking being able to add more dynamic completion state to arguments, like your proposed <code>delegate</code> attribute.</p>
