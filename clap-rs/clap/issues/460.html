<p>For header, which part do you mean, or where would you like it to go?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for pointing me to <code>after_help</code>, I was not aware of it.</p>
<p>I would like to change the header from:
<code>{name} {version}\n{author}\n{short description}\n</code>
to:
<code>{name} -- {description}</code></p>
<p>I know that I can remove the author and version easily by stripping <code>.version()</code> and <code>.author()</code> but I would also like to keep that information. Also, as shown above, I would like to change how it is organized.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently there isn't a good way to do this. But i like how you wrote it like a template, that may be something i could add pretty easily.</p>
<p>Ill have to knock out some of the other issues first, then I'll try to tackle this. Thanks! :+1:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That was also my idea. I think I can give it a try if you are fine with it. But I have a few open questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shall we have a template (A) only for the header or (B) for the whole thing?</li>
<li>Which fields should we have? name, version, author, short, about, If we go for (B) we would also need after_help (for backwards compatibilty), usage and related.</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah that'd be awesome if you give a shot!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'd say we start simple with just the header (i.e. <code>{name}</code>, <code>{version}</code>, <code>{author}</code>,  and <code>{about}</code>), but keep in mind the ability to add other sections to this templating system later.</p>
<p>For a second iteration I'd add <code>{usage}</code>, <code>{all-args}</code> (encompasses all auto-generated flags, options, etc.) and <code>{after_help}</code>.</p>
<p>Then perhaps as a third iteration, break down the <code>{all-args}</code> section further into <code>{flags}</code> <code>{options}</code> <code>{args}</code> <code>{subcommands}</code>. This way we can add to the system in a non-breaking way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have just pushed a large set of commits to my <a href="https://github.com/hgrecco/clap-rs/commits/template">template branch</a>. It is a major change to the way the Help is generated, including the possibility to use templates.</p>
<p>Look at the code and let me know what you think. If you decide to merge my branch I will add first another commit removing the old code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going through all the changes, and it may take me a few days based on my free time but it looks great so far! I'm excited for this change, and I'll post back with any changes or comments about the commits.</p>
<p>Great work!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hgrecco Just finished going through all the changes, and it looks great! I'm very, very excited about this feature! Whenever you're ready put in the PR!</p>
<p>If you get a chance, could do a rebase and change the commit subject line format so the appropriate changes get picked up in the changelog (i.e. just the ones you'd like picked up in changelog, not all commits need this). Here's the commit format:</p>
<p><code>TYPE(COMPONENT): MESSAGE</code> where <code>TYPE</code> is one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>feat - A new feature</li>
<li>imp - An improvement to an existing feature</li>
<li>perf - A performance related changed</li>
<li>docs - Changes to documentation only</li>
<li>tests - Changes to the testing framework or tests only</li>
<li>fix - A bug fix</li>
<li>refactor - Code functionality doesn't change, but underlying structure may</li>
<li>style - Stylistic changes only, no functionality changes</li>
<li>wip - A work in progress commit (Should typically be git rebase'ed away)</li>
<li>chore - Catch all or things that have to do with the build system, etc</li>
<li>examples - Changes to existing example, or a new example</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>COMPONENT</code> is optional, and may be a single file, directory, or logical component. Can be omitted if commit applies globally.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for all the time you've put into this!</p>
<p>Edit: You may also need to rebase onto the latest master :wink:</p>
