            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Based off an idea in #217</p>
<p>Hidden args and subcommands would not appear in the help messages or suggestions on errror.</p>
<p>They <em>would</em> still appear in usage strings on error.</p>
<p>I'm unsure about allowing them to be seen in groups or not. I'm leaning towards not displaying them in groups....but open to opinions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that's a good addition. We could even make that an <code>AppSettings</code> variant (<code>UnhideIfVerbose</code>). I think the initial implementation will just have hidden args/subcommands. Then we can add in the unhiding with verbose, because there's also a few oddities about that one which will make it more difficult to implement, but doing so is non-breaking ;)</p>

<p>The alternative is what we started with, tons of random methods which take a <code>bool</code> value. This somewhat pollutes the public API space, and makes finding &quot;settings&quot; more difficult. Using an enum creates a single place to look for &quot;settings&quot; which apply to an entire application, or subcommand. It also keeps the public API a little more clean (or at least will in 2.x once all the old methods are removed).</p>
<p>Also, I can't find the link but there is a Rust style guide which favors <code>setting(SettingsEnum)</code> over <code>some_setting(bool)</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The base functionality (i.e. without <code>--verbose</code> unhiding) should be a quick add, therefore I'm throwing this into the 1.4 milestone blocker</p>
