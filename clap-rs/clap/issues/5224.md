### Clap Version

4.4.8

### Describe your use case

I would like to exit program after printing help/version when user passes `--version` or `--help` flag using derive config:

```rs
/// Simple program to initialize Databases.
#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
pub struct Args {
    /// DB type to intialize
    #[arg(short, long, default_value = "all", value_name = "DB")]
    database: String,

    /// Scylla connection URI
    #[arg(short, long, default_value = "127.0.0.1:9042", value_name = "URI")]
    scylla_uri: String,

    /// Number of items to generate
    #[arg(short, long, default_value_t = 1000, value_name = "COUNT")]
    items: usize,
}

```

### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like to opt-in for process exit after printing help/version.

I had the same problem.
It should be a very common problem and should be written in the documentation. But after searching for a long time I found this issue and now I know it can be implemented, but I still don't know how to configure it.

I know that now.
Its default behavior consists of exiting the program.
