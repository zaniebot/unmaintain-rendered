# Error message templates

---

_Issue opened by @ghosty141 on 2020-03-08 17:14_

### Describe your use case

Since I'm using clap to create an interactive cl program, I'd like to skip whole "USAGE: " section since it shows very few useful information and takes up quite a lot of screen-space:
```
USAGE:
    myapp [SUBCOMMAND]

For more information try --help
```

### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be great to customize the error message. For example, select which parts should be shown (error, usage, additional information). 

### Alternatives, if applicable

For now just cutting off everything after "USAGE:" kinda works but it's not really pretty.


With some mentoring I'd maybe try to implement it myself if this is considered a good addition.

I believe [`clap::App::template`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.0/clap/struct.App.html#method.template) is exactly what you're looking for, isn't it?

Maybe it is and I don't exactly know who to use it but when I use .template("...") it does not change the error message that gets displayed when entering an invalid argument/subcommand.

_Renamed from "Customize "error: ..." message (e.g. argument not recognized)" to "Error message templates" by @epage on 2021-12-13 15:04_

Instead of a template, #3402 provides an example of a function that can be written to customize the error output.
