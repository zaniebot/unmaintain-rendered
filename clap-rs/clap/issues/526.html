            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Visible aliases for subcommands (from #522) can significantly widen the help display, and move subcommand descriptions far away from the subcommand name, making it harder to pair them up.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>    log                          Show the history of the patch series
    pull-request|request-pull    Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series
</code></pre>
<p>Please consider an alternate format that doesn't widen the display like this.  For instance, indent a bit and put the aliases underneath the main subcommand name:</p>
<pre><code>    log             Show the history of the patch series
    pull-request    Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series
      Alias: request-pull
</code></pre>
<p>Or with more than one alias:</p>
<pre><code>    log             Show the history of the patch series
    pull-request    Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series
      Aliases: req, request-pull
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Very true. What about formatting them as such:</p>
<pre><code>    log             Show the history of the patch series
    pull-request    Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series [aliases: req, request-pull]
</code></pre>
<p>To my eye, the newline and extra indent looks off...but that's also subjective :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</p>
<p>The other option I thought about was:</p>
<pre><code>    log             Show the history of the patch series
    pull-request    Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series
    req             Alias for 'pull-request'
    request-pull    Alias for 'pull-request'
</code></pre>

Either of those looks good to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is fixed with #530</p>
<p>Edit: I went with the <code>[aliases: one, two, three]</code> method as it was the least refactoring and still looks good to my eye.</p>
