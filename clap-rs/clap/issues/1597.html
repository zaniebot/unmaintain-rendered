<p>(Note: I'm using v2 right now, but I believe that v3 doesn't change this.)</p>
<p>Basically, the usage will use the placeholder <code>&lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;</code> or <code>[SUBCOMMAND]</code> depending on whether the subcommand is used, and it won't let you change this. Sometimes, it may actually be more beneficial to change this, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>USAGE:
    util list &lt;THING&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>as opposed to:</p>
<pre><code>USAGE:
    util list &lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would, but I haven't taken a proper look at the changes for 3.0 and don't know where it would properly integrate with that. I was under the assumption it'd just be a property on the thing that accepts subcommands.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran into a desire for this as well using <code>structopt</code>. My use case is that I want to require a certain value from a limited set of options (eg &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;lark&quot;) and in the case that one of those values is provided (&quot;foo&quot;, for instance) I need some other config as well.</p>
<p>A more concrete example using <code>structopt</code> (though any such changes would need to happen here first I'd assume):</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Clone, StructOpt)]
struct Opts {
    /// General arg 1
    #[structopt(long)]
    apple: u16,

    /// General arg 2
    #[structopt(long)]
    banana: u16,

    /// Required; may lead to other args needed
    #[structopt(subcommand)]
    thing: Thing
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, StructOpt)]
enum Thing {
    Foo,
    Bar,
    Lark {
        #[structopt(long)]
        other_opt: String
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, I want &quot;thing&quot; to be as close to a normal positional arg as possible, but to require other opts if one of them is selected. I'd therefore like to be able to rename SUBCOMMAND to something like THING so that it's clearer what is being selected.</p>
<p>If there is a better way to achieve this though, I'm all ears :)</p>
