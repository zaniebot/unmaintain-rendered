# Doc: Link to examples is broken

---

_Issue opened by @matthiasbeyer on 2016-07-15 12:52_

The crate doc links to 

```
https://kbknapp.github.io/clap-rs/clap/examples
```

which yields 404.

Thanks! Could you point me to where this link exists?

Seems to be fixed already. At least I cannot find the location where the links was wrong..
