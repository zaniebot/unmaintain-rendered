            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The domain https://clap.rs, previously listed in documentation and tutorials as the official site for the clap crate, now appears to be parked or hijacked.</p>
<p>Visiting the domain shows a generic page with ad links (see attached screenshot). This is potentially misleading or harmful to users.</p>
<p>It may be worth:</p>
<p>Updating all official links to point to https://docs.rs/clap</p>
<p>Issuing a warning in the README to avoid visiting clap.rs</p>
<p>Reclaiming or blocking the domain, if possible</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah we lost access to the domain clap.rs because the registrar we used changed acceptable payment methods and I no longer had a way that I could pay (being that I'm in the US).</p>
<p>Im totally open to re-engaging or if anyone has suggestions for a .rs registrar the project has funding to pay for a domain again.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep I'll remove that. The behind the scenes is I no longer have a way to pay for the .rs domain from our previous registrar, they stopped accepting any form of payment that I can give.</p>
