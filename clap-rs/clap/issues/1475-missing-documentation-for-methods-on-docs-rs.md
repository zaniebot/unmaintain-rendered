# Missing documentation for methods on docs.rs

---

_@saghm_

Hello! Apologies for eschewing the template, but this doesn't quite fit the expected pattern for an issue. It appears that all of the documentation for methods is missing in docs.rs (e.g. the [arg documentation](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.0/clap/struct.Arg.html)). All of the documentation seems to be there in the docs for 2.32.0, and cloning and running `cargo doc` locally seems to generate the documentation fine, so it's possible that this is an issue with docs.rs rather than this project, but I figured that I should file an issue here just in case.
