# Bash outputs everything as one completion, rather than a list of completions

_Issue opened by @epage on 2024-09-17 18:57_

This is with `clap_complete` 4.5.26, reproduced with `cargo` and the `exhaustive` example

I put the following in my `PATH`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

cargo run --manifest-path ~/src/personal/clap/clap_complete/Cargo.toml --example exhaustive -F unstable-dynamic -- "$@" 2> /dev/null
```
I then ran
```console
$ source <(COMPLETE=bash exhaustive)
$ exhaustive [TAB]
--generate
--help
--version
-h
-V
action
alias
help
hint
last
pacman
quote
value [CURSOR]
```
If I hit `[ENTER]`, it runs each of those values *as a command*
