- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.5.23

### Describe your use case

If there are many global options and few for a subcommands it can be hard to easily figure out which options are specific to a subcommand.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Splitting the option category into a option and global option would make distinguishing between global and subcommand specifiy options easy.

If this is important to `man`, should it also be important for `--help` and the user should use `help_heading("Global Options")`?

Note: use of `help_heading` is being discussed in #3363.

I didn't know about `help_heading`, I created another pr for that separates options based on `help_heading` #5854.

Going to go ahead and close in favor of #3363 then.  Let us know if there is a reason for this separately.
