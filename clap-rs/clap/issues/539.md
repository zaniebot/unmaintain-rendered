# Usage line for subcommands should include bin_name prefix

---

_Issue opened by @joshtriplett on 2016-06-23 21:53_

When showing the usage for a subcommand, clap only shows the subcommand name, not the command name before it.  For instance, given a command `command`, and a subcommand `sub`, `command help sub` will show:

```
sub
Subcommand about string goes here.

USAGE:
    sub [FLAGS] <arg>...
```

This should look like:

```
command sub
Subcommand about string goes here.

USAGE:
    command sub [FLAGS] <arg>...
```

This is also a bug, and I'm curious where this regressed. I should look like:

```
command-sub
Subcommand about string goes here.

USAGE:
    command sub [FLAGS] <arg>...
```

Why `command-sub` rather than `command sub`?

I think originally I modeled it after `git` where all subcommands in manpages have a hyphen separating commands.

I have a local branch with this fixed. I'm going to roll it up with a few of the other issues and push the PR.
