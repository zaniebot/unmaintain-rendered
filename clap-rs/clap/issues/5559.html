<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.5.8</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>creating a cli tool to run a server which could allow configuration via environment variables or toml</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>a toml features which allows a toml key to be specified in the arg macro:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Parser)]
pub struct Cli {
    #[arg(env = &quot;FOO&quot;, toml = &quot;foo&quot;)]
    foo: String
}
</code></pre>
<p>I think by default the priority should be passed argument, env, toml, default. though this should be configureable</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>the main alternative is to manually parse a toml file, the problem with this that that it is difficult to differentiate env or passed values from clap and the default</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>If this is a feature that there is support for I'd love to implement it</p>
