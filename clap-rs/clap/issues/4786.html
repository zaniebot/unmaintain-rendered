<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>master</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Sometimes there's a desire to create extra help text (e.g., in <code>before_help</code>) that's similar in structure to the autogenerated help text but written by hand. By 'similar in structure' I mean that, for example, headers/literals match the colours of autogenerated headers/literals and multi-line text is wrapped and indented properly.</p>
<p>There's already PR #4765 to allow <code>StyledStr</code> to accept user-styled text and output the proper escape symbols for the execution context. The advantage of using the already existing helpers is that it's durable to changes -- if the maintainers of clap decide to change headers from yellow/uppercase to blue/title-case, the manually written text will change too.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to submit a PR for this, but thought I'd open it as an issue in case discussion should happen first.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p><code>StyledStr::header()</code>, <code>::literal()</code>, <code>::warning()</code>, <code>::trim()</code>, <code>::indent()</code>, and so forth are exposed as public members of the impl and are made available to projects that depend on the <code>clap</code> crate.</p>
