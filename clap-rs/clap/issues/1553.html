            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The question we need to resolve with this is how to handle naming</p>
<p><code>App::help_heading</code> applies to future args</p>
<p><code>App::subcommand_help_heading</code> globally applies to subcommands as if you called <code>App::help_heading</code> at the start and never called <code>Arg::help_heading</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe if we changed the behavior so that</p>
<ul>
<li><code>App::help_heading</code> applied to future args <strong>and subcommands</strong></li>
<li><code>App::subcommand_help_heading</code> applied to the current subcommand like <code>Arg::subcommand</code><ul>
<li>We'd have to deal with what to name <code>App::subcommand_value_name</code> because that was mean to be parallel to the current behavior</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be a breaking change and one that doesn't offer a transition path with deprecations.  Any other ideas for how we could do this?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>App::help_heading</code> =&gt; <code>Command::help_heading_group</code></li>
<li><code>App::subcommand_help_heading</code> =&gt; <code>Command::help_heading</code> (similar to <code>Arg::help_heading</code>)</li>

<p>One concern with combining the arg and app help heading setting in one function is what to do when they have a common heading? How do we display the help?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One option I had been considering that I forgot until your post is <code>Command::next_help_heading</code>.</p>
<p>I worry people will just refer to what help headings as groups or categories, so using a <code>_group</code> suffix I don't think will convey the intent of &quot;all following are being grouped under the this heading&quot; (which I'm assuming is the intent of the suggestion).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think I am trying to convey that the function sets help heading for <strong>both</strong> args and subcommands. Maybe it's better if we just divide them into <code>args_help_heading</code> and <code>subcommands_help_heading</code>. But I think <code>next_help_heading</code> is better than <code>help_heading_group</code> definitely.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So to summarize the solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>App::help_heading</code> would<ul>
<li>Be renamed <code>App::next_help_heading</code></li>
<li>Will also apply to subcommands</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>App::subcommand_help_heading</code> would be removed</li>
<li><code>App::help_heading</code> would be added and acts like <code>Arg::help_heading</code> but for subcommands</li>
<li>We would need to add tests to make sure <code>next_help_heading</code> on a <code>derive(Subcommand)</code> behaves as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the downside to the name <code>next_help_heading</code> is in derives.  This is also getting me thinking that maybe we should provide some more flexibility by renaming our attribute from <code>clap</code> to <code>clap::app</code> and <code>clap::arg</code>.  This would allow a user to set app settings in the middle of the derive.  If that idea sounds like it has potential, I'll create a separate issue for further discussion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am trying to implement it. I am wondering where to place command that do not belong to any groups and the &quot;commands&quot; heading.
Option 1: commands not belonging to any group go to top</p>
<pre><code>Commands:
cmd1 ...
cmd2 ...

Group1:
cmd3
cmd4

Group2:
cmd5
cmd6
</code></pre>
<p>meaning placing commands not belonging to any group on top.
Alternatively, They could go to bottom. This makes more sense to me,
but maybe not to other people.</p>
<pre><code>Group1:
cmd3
cmd4

Group2:
cmd5
cmd6

Commands:
cmd1
cmd2

</code></pre>
<p>and what to do when heading is provided, but all commands are grouped:</p>
<pre><code>Commands:

Group1:
cmd3
cmd4
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd recommend doing what we do for Options.</p>
<p>However, before going to far down this, how do you plan to handle the <code>help</code> subcommand?  That is why I stopped this work before.  In clap v3, we had a bunch of specific helpers for overriding builtin arguments (<code>--help</code>, <code>--version</code>) and we simplified things a lot (improving performance and reducing binary bloat) by only supporting users disabling the built-in argument and providing it themself.  Currently, there isn't a way to do the same thing with the <code>help</code> subcommand.  My assumption is that we need to solve that problem first before we add custom help headings for subcommands.</p>

<p>Ok, makes sense. Arguments print heading and a list of ungrouped arguments on top, no heading if there are no ungrouped arguments.</p>

<p>With current implementation I have, it treats it as any other command. By default it is ungrouped. You can put it into a group if you wish (well, you can via builder, not sure about derive). Seems intuitive to me.</p>

<p>Also, you specify a help heading.  Argument groups are for associations and not visualization.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have an application for the work complete by @Fiedzia  and would like to see this feature incorporated into clap. @epage  has drawn my attention to the status of the change <code>waiting-on-design</code>. And so I will start by stating the re-stating the design as I understand it from this tread and addressing the outstanding question of what to do with the help command.</p>
<p>Expecting comment to follow 😄</p>
<h2>Design statements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>MUST provide that a custom section header can be specified for a command</li>
<li>MUST display all commands with the same section header together under that section header in help</li>
<li>MUST display any commands without a section header and auto-generated commands (e.g. help) first in the commands section</li>
<li>WILL NOT provide a facility to specify a section header for auto-generated commands such as help</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason was that with the help remaining under the original Command title if it was required that heading could be set using <code>subcommand_help_heading</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That would be a yes. However, reflecting on it, it does not meet the case where a user wants to place a heading on the help command only and leave the other commands under the default heading. I also sense that for you as a design statement its a MUST.</p>
<p>The implementation would require an API to capture the custom heading, say <code>custom_help_command_heading</code>.</p>
<h2>Revised design statements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>MUST provide that a custom section header can be specified for a command</li>
<li>MUST display all commands with the same section header together under that section header in help</li>
<li>MUST display any commands without a section header and auto-generated commands (e.g. help) first in the commands section</li>
<li>MUST provide a facility to specify a section header for auto-generated commands such as help</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional example to those <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1553#issuecomment-3478440572">here</a>:</p>
<h2>Output - custom help section</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Commands:
  test1     command under default heading

Custom help section:
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
</code></pre>
<h2>Derive Specification - custom help section</h2>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Subcommand, Debug)]
#[clap(custom_help_command_heading = &quot;Custom help section&quot;)
enum SubCmds {
     ///  command under default heading
    #[clap(name = &quot;test1&quot;)]
    test1,

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/epage">@epage</a> on 2025-11-05 17:46</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So let me step back and step through the initial proposal: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1553#issuecomment-991167908</p>
<p>We add a <code>Command::help_heading</code> that describes the current command's help heading, much like <code>Arg::help_heading</code>.</p>
<p><code>Command::next_help_heading</code> would be changed to apply to subcommands, not just arguments.  This would be a breaking change and would need to wait until clap v5.</p>
<p>We planned for <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> to be removed as redundant.  This would match <code>Arg</code> as there is no way to set a default for <code>Arg</code> help headings outside of <code>Command::next_help_heading</code> / <code>Arg::help_heading</code>.  As removal would be a breaking change, this would start as a deprecation.  Unsure whether that deprecation should wait for <code>Command::next_help_heading</code> being applied to subcommands.</p>
<p>So where does that leave <code>help</code>?  Let's look at precedence:  <code>--help</code> and <code>--version</code> are not subject to <code>next_help_header</code>
https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/cb49ebad046317a6bef22a553f6f1c8b7852853c/clap_builder/src/builder/command.rs#L4817-L4819</p>
<p>So to override the help heading for <code>--help</code> and <code>--version</code>, you need to disable the built-in versions and provide your own.</p>
<p>So for parity, the ideal would be if you could define your own <code>help</code> command and get the same behavior.  At minimum, this would require we add <code>CommandAction</code>, like <code>ArgAction</code>.  Note that this would be an action that runs when a command is first encountered and not pluggable actions after a command has run which has been requested from time to time (e.g. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap-nested">clap-nested</a>).  This is a larger effort with many unknowns to be worked out.</p>
<p>Maybe in the short term we could do as you said and could keep <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> or replace it with <code>Command::custom_help_heading</code> (name TBD).  Instead of an all-or-nothing replacement of <code>--help</code>, we used to provide overrides for specific parts, like <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.32.0/clap/struct.App.html#method.help_short"><code>App::help_short</code></a>.  So this would be us reverting back on our removing that approach.  Maybe that is ok as a hold over until the replacement becomes available?  If its short term and we already need to keep <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> for a little bit, maybe its better to not create a new concept but just encourage people to use the soon-to-be deprecated function?</p>

            <div class="timeline-header">Comment by <a href="https://github.com/jerusdp">@jerusdp</a> on 2025-11-06 08:09</div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we are making some progress.</p>
<p>The design as I see it  has three main topics :</p>
<ul>
<li>providing custom headings for user commands</li>
<li>providing a custom heading for help</li>
<li>breaking changes to plan for next release</li>
</ul>
<h2>High Level Design</h2>
<h3>Custom help headings</h3>
<p>Addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST provide that a custom section header can be specified for a command</li>
<li>MUST display all commands with the same section header together under that section header in help</li>
<li>MUST display any commands without a section header and auto-generated commands (e.g. help) first in the commands section</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide API <code>Command::help_heading</code> to set the current help heading and associated field (similar to <code>Arg::help_heading</code>).</p>
<h3>Custom command heading for <code>help</code> command</h3>
<p>Addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>MUST provide a facility to specify a section header for auto-generated commands such as help</li>
</ul>
<p>Create new API <code>command::custom_heading_for_help</code> rather than re-purposing <code>command::subcommand_help_heading</code>  as this will allow for the user to specify commands that they wish to specify under the default heading, custom headings and place <code>help</code> under a custom heading if desired.</p>
<p>If the  user requires a different default command heading <code>command::subcommand_help_heading</code> can be used to set that heading and <code>help</code> can be specified under a different custom heading.</p>
<h3>Changes deferred to new issue as breaking</h3>
<p>Addressing:</p>
<ul>
<li>WILL NOT change scope of command::next_help_heading to include subcommands (issue for v5)</li>
<li>COULD deprecate <code>command::subcommand_help_heading</code> in preparation for removal (issue for v5)</li>
</ul>
<p><code>command::next_help_heading</code> becomes a MUST to deliver consistency across subcommands and args.
<code>command::subcommand_help_heading</code> becomes a MUST to deprecate in favour of <code>command::next_help_heading</code></p>
<h2>Design Vision</h2>

<p>In theory, this is short-lived.  In theory, <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> is short lived.  I wonder if its worth having people migrate twice and if it would be

<p>I don't see it quite that way.
Considering the following phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1 - implementation of the designed referred to in this issue</li>
<li>Phase 2 - implementation of deferred changes</li>
<li>Phase 3 - Removal of API deprecated in Phase 2</li>
</ul>
<p>In phase 2 <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> is deprecated in favour <code>Command::next_heading</code>.  The <code>Command::custom_heading_for_help</code> API is retained allow the user to specify a separate heading for the help command while leaving other commands under the standard heading (or standard heading as modified by <code>Command::next_help_heading</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, if I understand it correctly then the assumption is that <code>Command::custom_heading_for_help</code> is short lived being deprecated when <code>CommandAction</code> is implemented to allow custom headings to be placed on the a <code>help</code> command in the same way as it is placed on the flags in the options today by implementing a custom help command.  This leaves me wondering what the prime driver for the arg solution was and whether solving the help heading is a side effect of a having a action to allow the substitution/renaming of the flags used for help and version. The test examples and document demonstrate the use of <code>-?</code> instead of <code>-h</code> as the help short flag and it seems reasonable as this is a common short cut, particularly on windows programs. I wonder if the same driver is there for the replacement of the help command?</p>
<p>With the proposed solution replacement of header for both command arg is tested as follows:</p>

<p>A consistency argument could be made to apply the same header as configured for the command to the arguments to avoid replacing the standard flags with custom &quot;look-a-likes&quot;.</p>
<p>This might look as follows and perhaps the &quot;Command::custom_heading_for_help()` API needs a better name to reflect that the change is applied to all auto-generated commands and options.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In that case and if the preferred solution for the <code>help</code> command is that the user provides a customised function requiring <code>CommandAction</code> which is not in scope for this change the initial proposal seems the most sensible rather than implementing something that will be short-lived: if you want to change the section under which the <code>help</code> is listed then you amend the <code>Command</code> heading.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The overall objective is to provide the user with a facility to place subcommands under more specific headings.</p>
<h3>Vision for final solution</h3>
<p>The final solution should align the behaviour for commands with that already configured for arguments, meaning that:</p>
<ol>
<li>that headings can be specified when a command is configured</li>
<li>that Command::next_help_heading can be used as a default heading for commands</li>
<li>that  a custom  <code>help</code> command can be configured (providing a custom heading if required)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Scope of this PR</h3>
<p>The objective for this PR is to provide a facility for the user to place their commands under a custom header to allow the grouping of commands such as might be seen in <code>git --help</code>.</p>
<p>The PR will not implement <code>CommandAction</code> which would be required to permit the user to replace the <code>help</code> command with a custom user <code>help</code> command which could be place under a custom header. The user can place <code>help</code> under a custom header by amending the default title using <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> placing the help command and the updated section at the top of the list of commands.</p>
<p>The will not change the scope of the  <code>Command::next_help_heading</code> to include processing for commands as this is a breaking change.</p>
<h2>Design Statements</h2>
<p>| Statement | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| MUST provide API to specify a custom section header for a user command | The key objective of the change |
| MUST keep commands with the same header together | |
| MUST display commands with no custom header under the default header | |
| MUST display help command under the standard header | To amend this the user should change the default header |
| WILL NOT change scope of <code>Command::next_help_heading</code> to include subcommands | |
| WILL NOT deprecate <code>Command::subcommand_help_heading</code> | It can be used to generate custom section heading for help |
| WILL NOT implement custom replacement of help | Future solution requiring <code>CommandAction</code></p>
<h2>High Level Design</h2>
<h3>Custom help headings</h3>
<h4>Addressing:</h4>
<ul>
<li>MUST provide API to specify a custom section header for a user command</li>
<li>MUST keep commands with the same header together</li>
<li>MUST display commands with no custom header under the default header</li>
<li>MUST display help command under the standard header</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide API Command::help_heading to set the current help heading and associated field (similar to Arg::help_heading). Document workaround for user to configure a custom heading on help command. Provide tests and examples that demonstrate the configurations.</p>
<h2>Design Vision</h2>
<p>This design allow the following comprehensive test to pass:</p>
