### Rust Version

rustc 1.72.0 (5680fa18f 2023-08-23)

### Clap Version

4.4.4

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
use clap::{arg, Parser};

fn main() {
    let _: Args = Args::parse();
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser)]
#[command(name = "CCExtractor")]

Originally based on McPoodle's tools. Check his page for lots of information
on closed captions technical details.
(http://www.theneitherworld.com/mcpoodle/SCC_TOOLS/DOCS/SCC_TOOLS.HTML)

This tool home page:
http://www.ccextractor.org
  Extracts closed captions and teletext subtitles from video streams.
    (DVB, .TS, ReplayTV 4000 and 5000, dvr-ms, bttv, Tivo, Dish Network,
     .mp4, HDHomeRun are known to work).

  Syntax:
  ccextractor [options] inputfile1 [inputfile2...] [-o outputfilename]
")]
#[command(
    help_template = "{name} {version}, {author}.\n{about}\n {all-args} {tab}\n
    An example command for burned-in subtitle extraction is as follows:
    ccextractor video.mp4 --hardsubx --subcolor white --detect_italics --whiteness_thresh 90 --conf_thresh 60
    
    Notes on the CEA-708 decoder: While it is starting to be useful, it's
    a work in progress. A number of things don't work yet in the decoder
    itself, and many of the auxiliary tools (case conversion to name one)
    won't do anything yet. Feel free to submit samples that cause problems
    and feature requests.

    Notes on spupng output format:
    One .xml file is created per output field. A set of .png files are created in
    a directory with the same base name as the corresponding .xml file(s), but with
    a .d extension. Each .png file will contain an image representing one caption
    and named subNNNN.png, starting with sub0000.png.
    For example, the command:
        ccextractor -out=spupng input.mpg
    will create the files:
        input.xml
        input.d/sub0000.png
        input.d/sub0001.png
        ...
    The command:
        ccextractor -out=spupng -o /tmp/output -12 input.mpg
    will create the files:
        /tmp/output_1.xml
        /tmp/output_1.d/sub0000.png
        /tmp/output_1.d/sub0001.png
        ...
        /tmp/output_2.xml
        /tmp/output_2.d/sub0000.png
        /tmp/output_2.d/sub0001.png
        ...

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

cargo run

### Actual Behaviour

error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\debug\rust_mini.exe` (exit code: 0xc00000fd, STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW)

### Expected Behaviour

It should print a nice help dialog

### Additional Context

Example repository: https://github.com/prateekmedia/ccerrorrustexample

This only happens in Debug mode.
This is a part of parameters for ccextractor and related to CCExtractor/ccextractor#1547
Also these parameters are only almost 3/4 of what I have in that file, so do note that.

### Debug Output

    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target\debug\rust_mini.exe`

thread 'main' has overflowed its stack
error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\debug\rust_mini.exe` (exit code: 0xc00000fd, STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW)

See also #4516 and #3524.

Drat, this being only on Windows makes it even worse.

The compiler is doing something very unexpected with stack allocations that we need to dig into and figure out.

This seems only to be a issue in debug mode, in release mode it seems to be fine.

_Comment by @hoytak on 2024-02-17 00:21_

Sharing my insight here as I hit this issue as well.  The default stack size on windows is 1MB (8MB elsewhere, usually) so setting it to 8MB manually in the build process fixed this issue.  This can be done by adding a build.rs file that sets the stack size on the linker on windows to 8MB.   

From https://github.com/xetdata/xet-core/blob/ed72349a0a98f8160f1afaea3bbacd2bb2743f75/rust/gitxet/build.rs: 

```
fn main() {
    let target_env = std::env::var("CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ENV").unwrap_or("".to_owned());
    if target_env == "msvc" {
        println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=/stack:{}", 8 * 1024 * 1024);
    }
}
```

However, to debug the issue while working on an osx machine, I found that setting a stack size of 512KB also triggered the issue for me.   This can be done using build.rs: 
```
fn main() {
  println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Wl,-stack_size,{:#x}",  512 * 1024);
}
```
With this, running the program through rust-lldb shows the places where the stack overflows, which (I hope) will help track down a fix.  For me, it was in the macro generated code, but I suspect a couple judicious uses of Box to move local objects from the stack to the heap could fix this and the related issues.

This seems to have regressed further in the latest version (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/pull/4357

Updating 4.5.38 to 4.5.39 causes argument parsing to stack overflow for rustup on Windows.

Hmm, `clap_derive` didn't change [between 4.5.38 and 4.5.39](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/compare/v4.5.38...v4.5.39) nor did functions they'd be calling during `augment_*`.

@ChrisDenton how are you collecting stack usage?  The main thing being done in `augment_*` is creating a lot of temporaries and its unclear what would fix this and not regress with random compiler changes.

Also, was this debug or release?
