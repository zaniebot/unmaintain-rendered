# Make `wrap_help` a default feature

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2023-07-17 13:08_

In clap v3, terminal wrapping was always available
- `wrap_help` wasn't about wrapping but auto-detecting the width
- `unicode` make it correctly detect unicode character widths

In clap v4, we restructured this
- `wrap_help` encompassed both wrapping and auto-detecting the width
- `unicode` remained the same

We also kept `wrap_help` as non-default,  moving wrapping from built-in to being non-default.

The theory behind it was that its a lot of code for processing for that some minor tweaks could make "good enough".

However, enough people seem to run into this being missing that we should probably make it default again.  Anyone who is optimizing for size likely has `default-features = false` and this won't affect.
