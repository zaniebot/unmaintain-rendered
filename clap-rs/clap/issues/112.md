# Usage suggestions for positional arguments should be in index order

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-05-08 01:53_

The order is displayed correctly everywhere except "suggested usage" (i.e. when a typo is made and the usage string is re-generated for _current_ usage). In this string it appears in alphabetical order which can be confusing.

[This line](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/4903adde618ce7e9ce9afbdd67ab6858b6b66161/src/app.rs#768) Should probably return a `BTreeMap<u8, &str>` where positional arguments are first in, with index as keys, and everything else is just a `key_counter += 1`. Or just use a FIFO queue of some type.

... Thinking out loud.

Eventually (read soon), I'd like to re-look at the use of data structures throughout `clap` and see if there are more efficient choices, (i.e. using perhaps using a more standard Map and just sorting only when needed)?
