            <div class="timeline-body">Rust Version
<ul>
<li>rustc 1.25.0 (84203cac6 2018-03-25)</li>
</ul>
Affected Version of clap
<ul>
<li>2.31.2</li>
</ul>
Steps to Reproduce the issue
<ul>
<li>define an arg like this: <code>.arg(clap::Arg::with_name(&quot;--test&quot;))</code></li>
<li>start a clap program with  ./app_name --test</li>
</ul>
Actual Behavior Summary
<pre><code>error: Found argument &#x27;--test&#x27; which wasn&#x27;t expected, or isn&#x27;t valid in this context

USAGE:
    wwrap [--test]

For more information try --help
</code></pre>
<p>As you see, the logging is kinda self-contradictory. &quot;We don&#x27;t accept --test because we only accept --test&quot;.</p>
Expected Behavior Summary
<p>runtime error at parse time, or any other solution giving correct error reasons</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>UPD: actually the error reason seems to be different. I didn&#x27;t provide a &quot;long&quot; name for an option, which is why it didn&#x27;t work. The &quot;Actual Behavior&quot; above seems to be misleading anyway, IMO, so I&#x27;m leaving the issue open.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like maybe the intent was to use <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.31.2/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.from_usage"><code>Arg::from_usage</code></a> instead of <code>with_name</code>. I agree it&#x27;s a slightly confusing message, but I can&#x27;t actually think of a better way to word it. Perhaps a debug lint if an arg name starts with a single or double hyphen?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to close this for now as it&#x27;s working as intended, and a lint against this would need a way to turn off the lint which is more complicated than I think this issue warrants.</p>
