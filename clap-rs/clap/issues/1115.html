            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the library and for this mail.</p>
<p>I would like to set flags similar to FIO application which allows to get
int and string for example 1M or 1MB 1G or 1g. Maybe this similar to
“subcommand” match library implementation.</p>
<p>How do you match string? With multiple if?</p>
<p>I find it difficult to use match outside main function. How to get value in
a function? Should I pass matches as argument or use macro get value inside
main and pass it?</p>
