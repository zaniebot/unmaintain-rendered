# subcommand names on windows are strange in help

_Issue opened by @freshstrangemusic on 2021-06-22 04:32_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Clap Version

2.33.1

### Describe your use case

The help text for subcommands on windows is formatted like `my-app.exe-subcommand` which is strange. e.g.

```rust
use clap::*;

fn main() {
  let app = App::new("my-app")
    .bin_name("my-app.exe")  # Fake Windows platform 
    .version("1.0")
    .about("my app does stuff")
    .subcommand(App::new("test").about("test subcommand"))
    .get_matches_from(vec!["my-app", "test", "--help"]);
}
```

[playground link](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=86af28eaff6d37da42f7450c4b5cd1a4)

produces:

```
my-app.exe-test 
test subcommand

USAGE:
    my-app.exe test

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
```

### Describe the solution you'd like

I would expect to show `<command> <version>` or `<command> <subcommand>` but not a mangled name. I'm not sure if there is an ideal here, but its very strange on windows.

There are two issues for this, #1431 #1382. Not sure why you are unable to see them when searching. Unless you did not search at all.
