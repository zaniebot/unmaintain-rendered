            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this was by design from not sorting the options as I wasn&#x27;t sure about what performance impact that would have. But since its also been causing issues with #4 I think I&#x27;m going to implement it.</p>
<p>Give me a day and I&#x27;ll push this in 0.5.12 once a have a second to add it.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to file the issue :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just to elaborate a little too, the help info is generated lazily only when <code>--help</code> (or by default <code>-h</code> unless the dev specifys their own <code>-h</code>) is found, so the performance isn&#x27;t too big of a concern at that point. Once I have this implemented I&#x27;ll post back.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is closed with #63 (v0.5.12 on crates.io or f4b2bf5 on master).</p>
<p>Arguments are sorted by name, this side steps some of the mess from determining if sorting by shorts, longs, names, or ones that have shorts but no longs and vice-versa, etc. But it allows the help-info to stay constant between runs which will be a big plus for #4</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks :)</p>
<p>The name sort does seem the most reasonable since it allows users of clap to group relevant flags regardless of the short/long flags.</p>
