### Clap Version

3.2.22

### Describe your use case

While I'm working with adding a `Serialize` impl at [clap-serde#46](https://github.com/aobatact/clap-serde/pull/46), I wanted to get hidden aliases separate from visible ones. Thought it is possible to get them by using `get_all_*_aliases` and `get_visible_*_aliases`, it would be efficient and convenient to have a `get_hidden_*_aliases` methods. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

Expose a `get_hidden_*_aliases` to `Command` and `Arg`.


### Alternatives, if applicable

Status quo and users get hidden aliases by subtracting `get_visible_aliases` from `get_all_*_aliases`.

### Additional Context

_No response_

Kind of like how clap switched from possible values being a `&str` to `PossibleValue`, I wonder if we should have an `Alias<T>` which has a `hide` method on it.
