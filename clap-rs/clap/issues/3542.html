<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.1.5</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have an option that supports multiple occurrences, but each occurrence is independent, and needs a minimum of 1 value passed to it.  I'm using <code>grouped_values_of</code> to get the groups of values. If I use <code>.min_values(1)</code>, then it requires that there is at least one value in total, not that there is one value per occurance.</p>
<p>Here's some example code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use clap::*; // 3.1.5

fn main() {
 let app = Command::new(&quot;test&quot;)
 .arg(Arg::new(&quot;example&quot;).short('x').min_values(1).multiple_occurrences(true).value_name(&quot;x&quot;));
 let matches = app.get_matches_from(&amp;[&quot;test&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;]);
 println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, matches);

}
</code></pre>
<p>This produces a successful match, but I want it to fail, because no argument is given to the second occurance of <code>-x</code>.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Ideally, <code>.min_values</code> would behave as I've described. And if the current behavior is unintentional , then this is probably a bug, and it might be worth changing. However, changing <code>min_values</code>'s behavior would technically be backwards incompatible, so it may be necessary to introduce a new api like <code>min_values_per_occurance</code> (and probably a similar <code>max_values_per_occurance</code>).</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>The only alternative I know of is to have the application check that enough arguments are provided to each group returned by <code>grouped_values_of</code> rather than letting clap do the validation for me.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>See https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/pull/960#issuecomment-1059998122.</p>

<p>I had thought we had an issue for this (because I was aware of this and agree that this should change).</p>
<p>However, I worry about people relying on this and we'd need to wait until 4.0, though we might be able to do it earlier as part of the <code>unstable-v4</code> feature flag.</p>
