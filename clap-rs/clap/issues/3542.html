Clap Version
<p>3.1.5</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I have an option that supports multiple occurrences, but each occurrence is independent, and needs a minimum of 1 value passed to it.  I&#x27;m using <code>grouped_values_of</code> to get the groups of values. If I use <code>.min_values(1)</code>, then it requires that there is at least one value in total, not that there is one value per occurance.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s some example code:</p>
<pre><code>use clap::*; // 3.1.5

fn main() {
 let app = Command::new(&quot;test&quot;)
 .arg(Arg::new(&quot;example&quot;).short(&#x27;x&#x27;).min_values(1).multiple_occurrences(true).value_name(&quot;x&quot;));
 let matches = app.get_matches_from(&amp;[&quot;test&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;-x&quot;]);
 println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, matches);

}
</code></pre>
<p>This produces a successful match, but I want it to fail, because no argument is given to the second occurance of <code>-x</code>.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Ideally, <code>.min_values</code> would behave as I&#x27;ve described. And if the current behavior is unintentional , then this is probably a bug, and it might be worth changing. However, changing <code>min_values</code>&#x27;s behavior would technically be backwards incompatible, so it may be necessary to introduce a new api like <code>min_values_per_occurance</code> (and probably a similar <code>max_values_per_occurance</code>).</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>The only alternative I know of is to have the application check that enough arguments are provided to each group returned by <code>grouped_values_of</code> rather than letting clap do the validation for me.</p>

<p>I had thought we had an issue for this (because I was aware of this and agree that this should change).</p>
<p>However, I worry about people relying on this and we&#x27;d need to wait until 4.0, though we might be able to do it earlier as part of the <code>unstable-v4</code> feature flag.</p>
