            <div class="timeline-body">Rust Version
<p>rustc 1.17.0-nightly (6eb9960d3 2017-03-19)</p>
Affected Version of clap
<p>2.21.2</p>
Expected Behavior Summary
<p>Be able to get a typed value for an argument using standard functions (and thus also through local type inference).</p>
Actual Behavior Summary
<p>A macro must be used, which also <em>requires</em> explicitly stating the desired type.</p>
Sample Implementation
<pre><code>pub trait TypedGet {
    fn parse&lt;S: AsRef&lt;str&gt;, T: FromStr&gt;(&amp;self, name: S) -&gt; Result&lt;T, String&gt;
        where T::Err: fmt::Display;
}

impl&lt;&#x27;a&gt; TypedGet for ArgMatches&lt;&#x27;a&gt; {
    fn parse&lt;S: AsRef&lt;str&gt;, T: FromStr&gt;(&amp;self, name: S) -&gt; Result&lt;T, String&gt;
        where T::Err: fmt::Display
    {
        let raw = self.value_of(name).ok_or(&quot;parameter not found&quot;.to_string())?;
        T::from_str(raw).map_err(|e| e.to_string())
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, I used <code>parse</code> for its alignment with the function exposed on strings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Three quick thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#x27;d probably make  the trait <code>TypedValue</code> to go along with the <code>value_of</code> methods</li>
<li>There should also be an <code>OsStr</code> equivilant, or we&#x27;ll need to decide how this&#x27;ll work with the <code>value_of_os</code> and <code>value_of_lossy</code> methods.</li>
<li>We&#x27;d need to also figure out multiple values (<code>values_of</code> and their <code>_os</code> and <code>_lossy</code> counterparts).</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve forked the repro to start looking at adding this. The macro doesn&#x27;t currently support <code>OsStr</code>, so I&#x27;m not planning on doing that in method form. I am looking at <code>values_of</code>, since there is a <code>values_t!</code> macro today.</p>
<p>I have some questions about the desired return type.</p>
Error Type
<p>There are 3 options for the error type:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>clap::Error</code> - this is consistent with the current <code>values_t!</code> macro, but completely suppresses the error returned by the invoked <code>FromStr</code> impl. That seems suboptimal.</li>
<li><code>T::Err</code> - this would expose the error returned by the parser, but doesn&#x27;t account for the possibility of failures in clap&#x27;s conversion from <code>OsStr</code> to <code>&amp;str</code>.</li>
<li><code>String</code> - this can pipe either kind of error back through, but is impossible to match on or otherwise handle, and it requires that <code>T::Err: std::fmt::Display</code>, which may not always be true.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#x27;t have a good answer here, especially since <code>clap::ErrorKind</code> doesn&#x27;t have a <code>__Hidden__</code> variant and therefore extending it could break existing users who depend on an exhaustive match.</p>
Return Structure (Fail-fast)
<ol>
<li><code>Result&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;, __&gt;</code> - the method would abort on first error.</li>
<li><code>Vec&lt;Result&lt;T, _&gt;&gt;</code> - the method would process all arguments and return the collection of successes and failures.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the return structure, I&#x27;m leaning towards option 1: The caller can invoke <code>values_of</code> and map those through <code>FromStr::from_str</code> if they want to provide more detailed errors to the caller.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@TedDriggs thanks for taking a swing at this! Apologies for the late reply, I was travelling the past week. As for your questions, here&#x27;s my thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error Type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would lean option 1 because we could also add an impl to resolve the error <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/3f44dd4b91d15ec9287eb236e2d3a2fd068afad1/src/errors.rs#L880-L884">as we do with errors arising from <code>std::fmt</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&#x27;t have a good answer here, especially since clap::ErrorKind doesn&#x27;t have a <strong>Hidden</strong> variant and therefore extending it could break existing users who depend on an exhaustive match.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#x27;s two options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-use the <code>ErrorKind::ValueValidation</code> or perhaps more appropriately <code>ErrorKind::InvalidValue</code> which is correct-ish provided the docs are updated as well.</li>
<li>We add the variant, being that I would unbelievably surprised if someone was actually relying on exhaustive matching here being that it would mean they&#x27;re handling each of clap&#x27;s error types manually. I believe this is the type of breaking change that is also in line with Rust precedents of allowing a minor breaking change that no code in the wild is using or likely to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, doing a quick ripgrep through all the crates on crates.io and looking through Github yields none. I know this doesn&#x27;t represent 100% coverage especially considering clap is made for binaries and not libs, and not all projects use Github but I still think it&#x27;s telling.</p>
<p>Having said this, I also don&#x27;t want to go this route unless all other options have worse downsides.</p>
<p>Technically there&#x27;s a third option of waiting until 3x (which I&#x27;m actively working on as we speak, but don&#x27;t have a good idea for release candidates yet. I&#x27;m planning on within the next 2 months, but life can always throw curveballs....in fact I&#x27;m typing this at about 1/8th normal speed due to a cast on my hand).</p>

<p>I 100% agree. 👍</p>
