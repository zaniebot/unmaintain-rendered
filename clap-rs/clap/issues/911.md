# Doc feature flag to document all features

---

_Issue opened by @SuperFluffy on 2017-03-21 10:07_

When writing the doc string in #910 I noticed that while I reference `App::from_yaml`, it is not contained in the resulting documentation. Only when passing invoking `cargo doc --feature yaml` will cargo also build the documentation for that method.

To fix this and similar feature-related issues, we could include a feature `doc` or `all` which contains all the possible features.

I am not sure how we can make `docs.rs` pick the appropriate flags though.

I'd like this. But I'm also not sure how to provide flags to docs.rs. Pinging @onur
