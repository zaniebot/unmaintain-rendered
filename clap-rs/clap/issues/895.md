# ArgRequiredElseHelp has lower priority than missing required arguments

---

_Issue opened by @iKevinY on 2017-03-11 08:59_

As of v2.20, `ArgRequiredElseHelp` doesn't properly take precedence over missing required arguments (the same issue as described in #362). This was working as expected in v2.19.3.

### Affected Version of clap

v2.20.0, v2.20.5, 814b12644ef7cbd41fd64a940bb09dd2b9486494

### Expected Behavior Summary

Full help page is printed when no arguments are provided.

### Actual Behavior Summary

`error: The following required arguments were not provided:`

Thanks for reporting this! Could you check if current master (what will be 2.21) is also affected?

Seems like current `master` is also affected (tested under 814b1264).
