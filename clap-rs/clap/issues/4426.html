<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.0.18</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>As far as I'm aware, <code>short</code> and <code>long</code> overrides the implicit positionalness and there is no way to have both on</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>for example, if I want to have <code>prog a b c</code>, <code>prog -f a b c</code>, and <code>prog --foo a b c</code> to be equivalent</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Parser)]
struct Opts {
    #[arg(short, long, position, num_args = ..)]
    foo: Option&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>Using <code>replace</code> from <code>unstable-replace</code>, but I have to deal with the quirks of <code>replace</code> and also use an unstable feature</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(replace(&quot;-f&quot;, [&quot;&quot;; 0]), replace(&quot;-foo&quot;, [&quot;&quot;; 0]))] // not sure how to create explicitly typed slices so I had to create this abomination
struct Opts {
    #[arg(short, long, num_args = ..)]
    foo: Option&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or having 2 separated fields and combine them manually, which seems overly complicated</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Parser)]
struct Opts {
    #[arg(short, long, num_args = ..)]
    foo: Option&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
    foo2: Option&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I feel like trying to support both without a very strong motivation will add complexity to clap for a case that should be pretty rare in CLIs.  I also feel that this isn't a pattern we should be encouraging by making things easier.</p>
<p>Users have the building blocks they need to implement this themselves by putting the two arguments into a group which will be made easier with https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2621.</p>
<p>Without more, I'm going ahead and closing this as unplanned.</p>
