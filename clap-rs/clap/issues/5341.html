            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I came across a problem with the uutils coreutils package where the powershell completions didnt work, https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/5933, and was directed here. I discovered this is because in the generated ps1 file the line [CompletionResuIt]::new('seq', 'seq', [CompletionResultType]::ParameterValue, '') exists, this line seems to cause the completions to fail and fall back on completing files, i also noticed this is not an issue and everything works as intended when adding something here, be it ' ' or anything else.
I dont know how this and i have never used clap so i dont know what to do to try to replicate it. But i can duplicate the issue in for example rustups completion by replacing it an empty string in one of the completion elements.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here's a minimal example as cargo script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#!/usr/bin/env -S cargo +nightly -Zscript
```
[dependencies]
clap = &quot;4.4.18&quot;
clap_complete = &quot;4.4.10&quot;
```

use clap::Command;
use clap_complete::{generate, Shell::PowerShell};

fn main() {
    let mut cmd = Command::new(&quot;test&quot;).subcommand(Command::new(&quot;foo&quot;).about(&quot;&quot;));
    generate(PowerShell, &amp;mut cmd, &quot;test&quot;, &amp;mut std::io::stdout());
}
</code></pre>
<p>Upon further inspection, I do think we have to fix this in uutils as well, but I think <code>clap_complete</code> should be aware that an empty about breaks completion and fall back to something else.</p>
