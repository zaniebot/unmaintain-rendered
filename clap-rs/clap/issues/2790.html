Clap Version
<p>2.33.3</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Clap currently automatically disables coloring support on Windows because Windows has not historically supported ANSI color codes and clap doesn&#x27;t feel like using crossterm instead. However, the current version of Windows does support ANSI codes, and furthermore statically linking the MSVCRT on the current version will let the built binary support colors on prior versions. I am on the current version of Windows, so I would like to be able to use the coloring support Clap already has.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Add an opt-in feature <code>force-colors</code> that will prevent auto-disabling ANSI colors on Windows.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>Use an arbitrary cfg flag instead, so that only the binary&#x27;s build environment can set it and not their dependencies.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I hadn&#x27;t seen that, great! However, it would be great if this behavior was back ported to v2 as well, which would probably take the shape I described.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My understanding is we&#x27;re only backporting critical fixes.  To put in context, its been over a year since the last commit to <code>v2-master</code>.</p>
