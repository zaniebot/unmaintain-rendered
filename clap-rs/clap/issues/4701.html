<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.1.0</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>In clap v4, we switched the derive's implicit <code>Arg::id</code> to be the literal field name to avoid confusion over <code>_</code> -&gt; <code>-</code>.  This can cause ambiguities across flattens, even if the longs are made unique.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>What if we qualified these fields by their type?</p>
<p>The biggest problem for <code>Arg::id</code> is discoverability.  For naive cases (no flattening), which is more obvious, an unqualified name or a qualified name?  For non-naive cases, I think the user could understand the use of qualified names.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>Do nothing.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>#4699 has a related problem with variant structs in an <code>ArgGroup</code>.  Since this is new design work, we've noted in #2621 to set the <code>Arg::id</code> according to <code>Variant::field</code> which inspired this issue.</p>
