# Ability to alias arguments

---

_Issue opened by @andreastt on 2016-09-23 10:08_

It is possible to provide (hidden) aliases for subcommands currently, but not for regular arguments. When you have a program that needs to rename an argument it would be useful to have the ability to provide hidden aliases for it.

I wonder if someone is doing this work already.. 🤔  cc/ @kbknapp 
Otherwise I would love to start looking at it and contribute at some point 😺
