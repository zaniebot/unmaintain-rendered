<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.2.5</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I finally got around to looking into upgrading off Clap 3.x now that it's possible to have colorized <code>--help</code> output again and realized &quot;Waitaminute... why should I have to go digging through the docs and spend time becoming proficient in writing new themes when there's only <em>one</em> theme I want... the one that I currently have by staying on Clap 3.x?&quot;</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Can we please get a <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/3.2.22/clap/_derive/_cookbook/index.html">cookbook</a> entry with some code I can just copy-paste to preserve that old behaviour, similar to how, when Twitter Bootstrap switched to flat design, they offered a supplementary CSS file that would re-enable the old look and feel if added?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another suggestion that came up in #3186 and reddit is that we provides presets for the old colors.</p>
<p>However, I feel that the old colors are a dead end (particularly yellow for help headings) and I'm wanting to encourage people to think about what colors they use, rather than blindly copy or opt-in to the old ones, so I'm included to reject this.</p>

<p>(Given that I'm lazy and busy, I'll just stay on 3.x longer because I can't currently justify the time to familiarize myself with the API so I can manually replicate the output of an old build's <code>--help</code>.)</p>

<p>I'm not forcing; I'm just not helping.  This is a common practice in API design to adjust where burdens are felt to encourage specific behavior.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Except when I tried to engage with people to find an acceptable combination, no one participated.  So I'm shifting that burden to the community.  We'll see what patterns develop and what of them are acceptable for pulling into clap.</p>

<p>In clap's case, my main concern is the amount of work to catch up to an API change. (i.e. How much API churn is likely.)</p>
<p>I suppose I should just keep waiting for now. No need to get adventurous.</p>
<p>Also, I just noticed that you appear to have a typo in the <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_features/index.html">_features</a> page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>unstable-unstable-styles:</strong> Custom theming support for clap</p>

<p>What if transcribing the old color scheme into the new API emerges as the dominant pattern?</p>
<p>Visual design <em>is</em> a skill unto itself and, if people don't have that and feel that the old one was &quot;good enough&quot;, they might just transcribe it to the new API and move on.</p>

<p>Thanks. I've had about half a dozen GitHub Dependabot PRs sitting untouched for a couple of months now because I just haven't had time to familiarize myself with the details of updating my Clap 3.x schemas and that'll make it easier to fit in.</p>
