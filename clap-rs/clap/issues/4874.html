Clap Version
<p>4.2.5</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I finally got around to looking into upgrading off Clap 3.x now that it&#x27;s possible to have colorized <code>--help</code> output again and realized &quot;Waitaminute... why should I have to go digging through the docs and spend time becoming proficient in writing new themes when there&#x27;s only <em>one</em> theme I want... the one that I currently have by staying on Clap 3.x?&quot;</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Can we please get a <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/3.2.22/clap/_derive/_cookbook/index.html">cookbook</a> entry with some code I can just copy-paste to preserve that old behaviour, similar to how, when Twitter Bootstrap switched to flat design, they offered a supplementary CSS file that would re-enable the old look and feel if added?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another suggestion that came up in #3186 and reddit is that we provides presets for the old colors.</p>
<p>However, I feel that the old colors are a dead end (particularly yellow for help headings) and I&#x27;m wanting to encourage people to think about what colors they use, rather than blindly copy or opt-in to the old ones, so I&#x27;m included to reject this.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not forcing; I&#x27;m just not helping.  This is a common practice in API design to adjust where burdens are felt to encourage specific behavior.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Except when I tried to engage with people to find an acceptable combination, no one participated.  So I&#x27;m shifting that burden to the community.  We&#x27;ll see what patterns develop and what of them are acceptable for pulling into clap.</p>

<p>In clap&#x27;s case, my main concern is the amount of work to catch up to an API change. (i.e. How much API churn is likely.)</p>
<p>I suppose I should just keep waiting for now. No need to get adventurous.</p>
<p>Also, I just noticed that you appear to have a typo in the <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_features/index.html">_features</a> page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>unstable-unstable-styles:</strong> Custom theming support for clap</p>

<p>What if transcribing the old color scheme into the new API emerges as the dominant pattern?</p>
<p>Visual design <em>is</em> a skill unto itself and, if people don&#x27;t have that and feel that the old one was &quot;good enough&quot;, they might just transcribe it to the new API and move on.</p>

<p>Thanks. I&#x27;ve had about half a dozen GitHub Dependabot PRs sitting untouched for a couple of months now because I just haven&#x27;t had time to familiarize myself with the details of updating my Clap 3.x schemas and that&#x27;ll make it easier to fit in.</p>
