# Allow using a completion-specific candidate description over the candidate's help message in rust-native completions

---

_Issue opened by @ModProg on 2023-08-01 10:41_

Some shell completions, such as `fish` and `zsh` allow displaying a help message.

Currently, we use the short help, but this might not always be appropriate due to the constraints of the completion.

We could consider adding a separate `complete_help`  to any command, argument, or possible value, this would be the first line of the short help by default, but could be overridden either to disable, or to replace with a custom message.

This does pose some complexity as it adds an additional field to everything with a help or about.

`complete_help` would be blocked on the plugin system being publicly exposed

btw we now have unstable support for the plugin system, unblocking this.
