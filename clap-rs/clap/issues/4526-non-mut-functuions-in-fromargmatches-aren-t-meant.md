# Non-mut functuions in `FromArgMatches` aren't meant to be there?

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2022-11-30 02:33_

The mut versions were added in #3742, specifically 1446be8a891ad5e9dbd2345a943b22bc054a4226.  I think the non-mut versions were supposed to be removed in clap 4.0.0 but were overlooked.
