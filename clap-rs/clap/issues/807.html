            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! First off, sorry for not following the template! The default sections seemed to be geared towards bug reports, and I honestly didn't think that any of them applied to my issue. As for the request...</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to specify that an argument requires any one (or more) of multiple other arguments. Right now, I can do so manually in my application logic, but from looking over the documentation, I don't think there's currently a way to tell clap to do this on its own. Ideally it would look pretty similar to <code>Args::requires_all</code>, only it would reject the input only if none of the specified arguments are passed in.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to consider this! I completely understand if the balance of work to implement vs. priority means this won't be implemented for a while.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No worries on the template, it's really just there for bug reports :+1:</p>
<hr />
<p>This can be accomplished with an <code>ArgGroup</code></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let app = App::new(&quot;foo&quot;)
    .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;base&quot;)
        .requires(&quot;others_group&quot;))
    .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;opt1&quot;)
        .long(&quot;opt-1&quot;)
        .takes_value(true))
    .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;opt2&quot;)
        .long(&quot;opt-2&quot;)
        .takes_value(true))
    .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;opt3&quot;)
        .long(&quot;opt-3&quot;)
        .takes_value(true))
    .group(ArgGroup::with_name(&quot;others_group&quot;)
        .args(&amp;[&quot;opt1&quot;, &quot;opt2&quot;, &quot;opt3&quot;]));
</code></pre>
<p>Let me know if that works for you :wink:</p>
