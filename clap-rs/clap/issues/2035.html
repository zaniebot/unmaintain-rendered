Describe your use case
<p><code>clap</code> emits its own error messages. They look quite nice, they have color, all that good stuff. Maybe I want to take advantage of this feature - perhaps instead of using <code>panic!</code>, or manually emitting a message to stderr and then exiting, I want to emit an error message that matches the ones <code>clap</code> gives.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is <strong>consistency</strong>. When your error message looks different from <code>clap</code>&#x27;s, it kind of feels weird to the end user. I&#x27;ve never encountered a utility that has different error messages when parsing arguments than when running the program itself, and it would be weird to make the developer try to <em>mimic <code>clap</code></em> instead of offering them an API for it.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>My use case specifically would benefit from a <code>panic!</code>-like solution that emits an error message of my own choosing and then exits. However, that&#x27;s a very minimal solution and there are better ones, see below.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>(package names might not be 100% accurate as I&#x27;m using file paths)</p>
<p>Really any way to format error messages in the same style as <code>clap</code> would be nice. For example, you could just make <code>clap::output::fmt::Colorizer</code> public. Although, if you do that, you should make <code>clap::parse::errors::start_error</code> public too.</p>
<p>Making these things public would benefit consumers of your API as they&#x27;d be able to format their error messages and color their messages the same way as <code>clap</code> does, allowing the application to look more consistent. They could even use the <code>Colorizer</code> for general output.</p>
<p>However, since these things are implementation details at the moment it&#x27;s possible that yet another solution could be implemented instead, more well-suited to consumers of <code>clap</code>&#x27;s API. I could come up with many such solutions, but I think it should be up to the maintainers of <code>clap</code>.</p>

<p>I like the proposal, but I think I would wait until after we&#x27;re done with the refactorings and stuff.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is a reasonable goal, but you are in the process of refactoring, why not make this change while you can? Major version 3 still isn&#x27;t fully released, so you have more freedom. Once the version 3 API is stabilized, you can&#x27;t make any more breaking changes (like renaming that method for example).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because it&#x27;s not yet decided what the colorizer will look like. Once we&#x27;re settled on that, we can make it public and document.</p>
<p>If you have any alternative solutions, I&#x27;m all ears.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In clap3, we now have a <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/3.0.0-beta.5/clap/struct.App.html#method.error"><code>App::error()</code></a> (added in #2890) which provides the full clap-style error message, including the usage, recommendation for help, and <code>WaitOnError</code> support (#2967), unlike <code>with_description</code>.  It does not provide a smart usage (adapting to your specific command or to your place in a subcommand hierarchy) and it doesn&#x27;t expose the coloring API to end users (the clap boiler plate does get colored though).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @epage that works quite nicely for my case at least (not OP).</p>
<p>Small paper-cut for future users: youhave to pre-construct the error or clone their app because once <code>get_matches</code> is called it consumes the entire <code>App</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    let mut app = clap::App::new(&quot;app&quot;)
        .subcommand(
            clap::App::new(&quot;run&quot;)
                .about(&quot;a silly subcommand but makes my app look nice&quot;)
                .arg(clap::Arg::new(&quot;COMMAND&quot;).required(true)),
        );  
    let subcommand_error = app.error(
        clap::ErrorKind::MissingSubcommand,
        &quot;Missing subcommand which wasn&#x27;t expected. Did you mean &#x27;run&#x27;?&quot;,
    );  
    let matches = app.get_matches();
    if let Some(subcommand) = matches.subcommand_matches(&quot;run&quot;) {
        subcommand.value_of(&quot;COMMAND&quot;).expect(&quot;command was not provided&quot;);
    } else {
        subcommand_error.exit();
    }

<p>Do we want to keep this open to address those 2 issues? Or you want to create new issues to track them?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d recommend users opening the issues in response to their usage of <code>App::error</code> so we are collecting more real world use cases and not just us extrapolating what all is needed and making our backlog too big to handle.</p>
