<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.1.8</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have these arguments:</p>
<pre><code>struct RebaseArgs {
    /// Rebase only this revision, rebasing descendants onto this revision's
    /// parent(s)
    #[clap(long, short)]
    revision: Option&lt;String&gt;,
    /// The revision to rebase onto
    #[clap(long, short, required = true, min_values = 1)]
    destination: Vec&lt;String&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>I want to require at least one rebase destination. I first tried <code>require = true</code> and <code>min_values = 1</code> separately, but neither seemed to do what I wanted. The combination did seem to work, though. However, now I just noticed that it would allow <code>-d x y z</code> to be interpreted as multiple destinations. What I wanted was to allow <code>-d x -d y -d z</code> (and disallow positional arguments).</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>It would be nice to be able to set <code>min_occurrences</code> (just like you can set <code>max_occurrences</code>) and have clap validate it for you.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>The application code can do the validation itself, which is what I'll do for now.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, somehow <code>required = true</code> seems to be enough. I have no idea why I thought that wasn't enough when I tried it a couple of days ago. Sorry.</p>
