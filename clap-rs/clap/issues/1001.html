            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>rustc 1.20.0-nightly (6d9d82d3d 2017-07-14)</p>
<h3>Affected Version of clap</h3>
<p>clap 2.25.0</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p><code>program file subcommand</code> runs</p>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<pre><code>error: The subcommand 'file' wasn't recognized
	Did you mean 'nile'?
</code></pre>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce the issue</h3>
<p>Call a clap_app with a positional argument that looks like a command name.</p>
<h3>Sample Code or Link to Sample Code</h3>
<pre><code>    let matches = clap_app!((&quot;Something&quot;) =&gt;
        (@arg FILE: +required &quot;File to examine&quot;)
        (@setting SubcommandRequiredElseHelp)
        (@subcommand nile =&gt; (about: &quot;Whatever&quot;))
    ).get_matches();

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I agree this is annoying, if the values supplied have the possibility of being close to a subcommand, I'd compile <em>without</em> the <code>suggestions</code> feature. If that isn't an option, there are several <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.26.2/clap/enum.AppSettings.html"><code>AppSettings</code></a> variants that help with this issue, such as making subcommands required, or disallowing args between subcommands.</p>
<p>I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this issue, but in order to provide suggestions, we <em>have</em> to check if the values supplied are similar to something.</p>
