### Rust Version

rustc 1.63.0 (4b91a6ea7 2022-08-08)

### Clap Version

clap v4.0.6

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
use clap::Parser;

#[derive(Debug, Parser)]
#[clap(version, author)]
struct Args {
    #[clap(long, short)]
    host: String,
}

fn main() {
    let args = Args::parse();
    
    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```


### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

1. cargo run

### Actual Behaviour

```
Running `target/debug/clap4-test`
thread 'main' panicked at 'Command clap4-test: Short option names must be unique for each argument, but '-h' is in use by both 'host' and 'help' (call `cmd.disable_help_flag(true)` to remove the auto-generated `--help`)', /.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/clap-4.0.6/src/builder/debug_asserts.rs:121:17
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```


### Expected Behaviour

i.e. clap v3

```
     Running `target/debug/clap4-test`
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    --host <HOST>

USAGE:
    clap4-test --host <HOST>

For more information try --help
```

### Additional Context

When defining an attribute with the same short value as help, i.e. `h` the arg no longer replaces the help attribute, but creates a conflict. This worked in clap 3 and according to the latest docs, this should still be the case.

https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/builder/struct.Arg.html#method.short
