Clap Version
<p>4.5.0</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I know there are: <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3513">clap-rs/clap#3513</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3117">clap-rs/clap#3117</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/5050">clap-rs/clap#5050</a>, <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/4556">clap-rs/clap#4556</a>, but there are no solutions (in the issues).</p>
<p>I personally came across this limitation too.</p>
<p>I have multiple ways to specify password:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, clap::Args)]
#[group(required = true, multiple = false)]
struct ReqPassphrase {
   #[arg(long, default_value_t)]
   passphrase: String,

   #[arg(long)]
   pass_stdin: bool,

   pass_fido: bool,

   pass_fido_rp: String,

   #[arg(long)]
   pass_fido_uid: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>and some subcommands need to know old passphrase and new:</p>
<pre><code>   AddKey {
      #[command(flatten)]
      new_passphrase: ReqPassphrase,

      #[command(flatten)]
      old_passphrase: ReqPassphrase,
   },
</code></pre>
<p>which obviously fails to compile.</p>
<p>How can I implement this without copy-paste? Why are all the issues above closed?</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>The simplest one: is to provide prefix as an attribute, for example in my case I could provide prefix <code>old_</code> and <code>pass_stdin</code> would become <code>old_pass_stdin</code></p>

<p>If the reason the issue is closed is unclear, the thing to do would be to post on that issue, rather than open a new issue.</p>
<p>Going to close in favor of the linked issues so we can keep the discussion in one place, rather than creating more places.</p>
