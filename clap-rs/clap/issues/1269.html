            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looking for something akin to the dynamic options feature of the golang cli package</p>
<p>https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin/blob/master/README.md#additional-api</p>
<p>More specifically I would like an alternative to the existing clap API that let's you configure a static array of arg option values that would let me instead provide a fn type that yields a dynamic list.</p>
<p>Bonus points if this could factor into claps current support for tab completion</p>
<p>I would be interested in working on an implementation with some coaching on what the key areas in clap would need to change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is covered by #1232 and #568</p>
<p>It's something I very much want, I just have some other priorities to get 3.x-beta out the door first :wink: I'm going to close this in favor of the other two issues. Feel free to discuss there and we can work on implementation!</p>
