There are a couple ways of doing this with different trade offs
- External subcommands
  - You have to validate the subcommand name yourself
- `#[arg(trailing_var_args = true, allow_hyphen_values = true)]`
  - Some flags can still be used before the captured set starts
- `#[arg(last = true)]`
  - Requires `--` before the captured arguments

`#[arg(trailing_var_arg = true, allow_hyphen_values = true)]` seems to work as desired thank you very much!!!

Clap is as awesome as Python's Click, well done 🙂
