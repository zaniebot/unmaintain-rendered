<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.0.18</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>Currently, I have a &quot;non-DRY&quot; solution for what happens when my Clap CLI executable is run without anything passed to it. I noticed there is an <code>arg_required_else_help</code> method on the <code>clap::builder::Command</code> API which is great if you want to display the <code>help</code> message when nothing is passed. If the <code>arg_required_else_help</code> option is not set to <code>true</code>, then nothing happens when you run your Clap CLI app. My problem is that I want something to happen when nothing is passed but I don't want to display the <code>help</code> message in this instance.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I'd like to create an <code>arg_required_else</code> method on the <code>clap::builder::Command</code> API that takes a function that defines the functionality the user wants to run when nothing is passed to their Clap CLI app.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    fn testaroo() {
        println!(&quot;A custom message would go here.&quot;);
    }
    
    fn arg_required_else(f: fn()) {
        f();
    }
    
    arg_required_else(testaroo);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>A custom message would go here.
</code></pre>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p>I'm relatively new to Rust and am using Clap for one of my applications. I am looking to DRY up <a href="https://github.com/badjr13/laydown/blob/main/src/lib.rs#L169">this part</a> of one of my apps, but before I wrote something custom, I thought <code>arg_required_else</code> would be an excellent addition to the <code>clap::builder::Command</code> API. It would solve my problem and seems like an API that would be useful to users of Clap.</p>
<p>I'm reaching out not only for this request for a feature but also for input on the best way to implement this. I'm happy to write the code, but I want to do so in a way that is idiomatic Rust and fits the Clap codebase too. Should it be a method that takes a function? A method that takes a closure? Should it be done another way?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Generally, people use <code>ArgMatches::args_present()</code> for this.</p>
<p>At the moment, clap doesn't do callbacks for application logic and we'll need to consider the wider needs for that if we go down that road (for example, what <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap-nested">clap-nested</a> provides for subcommands)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>btw one improvement that could be made is to have the docs for <code>arg_required_else_help</code> suggest using <code>ArgMatches::args_present</code> if custom behavior is needed.</p>
