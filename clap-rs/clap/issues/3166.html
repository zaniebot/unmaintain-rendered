<hr />
<p>#3022 was a tipping point for me in realizing that maybe our current approach to completions doesn't work.  We effectively have to implement a mostly-untested parser within each shell.  Examples of other problems that seem to stem from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2729</li>
<li>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2750</li>
<li>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2145</li>
<li>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1822</li>
<li>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1764</li>
</ul>
<p>If we take the approach of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/">argcomplete</a> where we do the parsing in our core code, rather than in each completion script, this will help us share parsing logic between shell, share some or all parsing logic with clap itself, and make a subset of the logic more testable.</p>
<p>We also need to decide whether to morph the existing parser into supporting this or create a custom parser (since the needs are pretty special).  If we do a custom parser, we should probably do https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2915 first so we can reuse lexing logic between clap and the completion generation.  I've also been considering https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2912 which would allow reusing the completion logic with any CLI parser.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-argumentcompleter?view=powershell-7.2</p>
<p>The block receives</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you specify the Native parameter, the script block must take the following parameters in the specified order. The names of the parameters aren't important because PowerShell passes in the values by position.</p>
<ul>
<li>$wordToComplete (Position 0) - This parameter is set to value the user has provided before they pressed Tab. Your script block should use this value to determine tab completion values.</li>
<li>$commandAst (Position 1) - This parameter is set to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the current input line. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.language.ast">Ast Class</a>.</li>
<li>$cursorPosition (Position 2) - This parameter is set to the position of the cursor when the user pressed Tab.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The block provides <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.completionresult?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0">CompletionResult</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CompletionResult object allows you to provide additional details to each returned value:</p>
<ul>
<li>completionText (String) - The text to be used as the auto completion result. This is the value sent to the command.</li>
<li>listItemText (String) - The text to be displayed in a list, such as when the user presses Ctrl+Space. This is used for display only and is not passed to the command when selected.</li>
<li>resultType (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.completionresulttype">CompletionResultType</a>) - The type of completion result.</li>
<li>toolTip (String) - The text for the tooltip with details to be displayed about the object. This is visible when the user selects an item after pressing Ctrl+Space.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like Powershell can fit within rust-driven completions and provide the full feature set.</p>

Looking at argcomplete, it seems they had to use their <a href="https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete/blob/efe11f30290fbd298aa5e6505556bb0ab1596ea0/argcomplete/my_shlex.py">own shlex implementation</a>.

<p>Anything unchecked in the &quot;Remaining work&quot; section is up for grabs; just post here that you are getting started on it.  The highest priority is the support for each shell as that will help gauge the feasibility and provide feedback on the API.  The rest is flushing out parsing implementation.</p>
<p>I should split those out into individual issues to make it easier for people to coordinate on those (and to add bounties) but I probably won't have time for another week or so.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alright, had a busy week, so I'm only getting back around to this now.</p>
<p>I've looked at the work done in #3656, and it looks like the next steps to add zsh and fish support would be to pull some of the functionality out of <code>clap_complete::dynamic::bash</code>, and adapt it to the other shells to provide the same functionality. Am I correct in assuming that?</p>
<p>I'd look at <code>argcomplete</code> for the other implementations here, since the current one also seems to be coming from there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, the cobra code is very well documented and easy to adapt.</p>
<p>One thing I was wondering about is the way options like <code>space</code>/<code>no-space</code> are passed to the completion command. cobra deals with this in a pretty involved way by encoding all options (compile-time and run-time) into a bitfield, and then parsing that bitfield in their completion script. It wouldn't be too hard to adapt this, but I feel like there isn't a clear definition of what options we even want to offer and the completion output would have to be changed, so that's probably better for another PR.</p>
<p>For a start, I would try to keep the features that are implemented for bash.</p>
<p>Should I open a new issue for zsh communication for questions like these, or is there some chat/forum where we could discuss them?</p>

<p>Yeah, the cobra code is very well documented and easy to adapt.</p>
<p>One thing I was wondering about is the way options like <code>space</code>/<code>no-space</code> are passed to the completion command. cobra deals with this in a pretty involved way by encoding all options (compile-time and run-time) into a bitfield, and then parsing that bitfield in their completion script. It wouldn't be too hard to adapt this, but I feel like there isn't a clear definition of what options we even want to offer and the completion output would have to be changed, so that's probably better for another PR.</p>
<p>For a start, I would try to keep the features that are implemented for bash.</p>
<p>Should I open a new issue for zsh communication for questions like these, or is there some chat/forum where we could discuss them?</p>

<p>I created https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3916.  We can also talk on rust-lang zulip on the WG-CLI stream</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey all, just wanted to drop a link to my own hand-rolled implementation of Rust-native argument completion for <code>clap</code>. The code is all MIT licensed. I wrote this to support a feature I wanted in $work project, and now that we went open-source, I can actually link to my effort on this issue.</p>
<p>https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm/blob/main/support/clap_dyn_complete/src/lib.rs</p>
<p>Note that I wrote this code a few years back, before the recent uptick in investments in resolving this issue, and may not reflect the current approach <code>clap_complete</code> is taking.</p>
<p>This implementation is not fully-featured by any means, but it does include support for several different shells (zsh, fish, powershell), various <code>clap</code> constructs, and support for dynamic runtime completions + async support (which $work project uses to dynamically suggest fields based on the return values from async RPC calls).</p>
<p>I'm quite interested in getting this sort of functionality working in <code>clap_complete</code>, but I unfortunately don't have time to do so myself. Folks should feel free to crib any/all functionality from this implementation, in case any of it is useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@daniel5151 looking over that, some differences in approach</p>
<ul>
<li><code>clap_dyn_complete</code> completes using the index into the string rather than an index into an array of arguments.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@epage, glad to see you took a look through the code!</p>
<p>A few additional thoughts, in response to your analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>clap_dyn_complete</code> completes using the index into the string rather than an index into an array of arguments.  This allows mid-word completions and I assume avoids <code>COMP_WORDBREAKS</code> problems (<a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/3920">Support flags with values in native completions #3920</a>) at the cost of needing to re-implement quoting.  I wouldn't be surprised if we need to switch to that but wanting to see how viable our current approach is</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This was quite important to me, as the key completion I wanted to support was akin to navigating a virtual directory listing (i.e: completing <code>--remote-path foo/bar/baz</code>, and I wanted to be able to support completions after any intermediate <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>But you're right - I certainly recall wrestling with nuances around quoting and shell arguments. Not sure I ever solved it cleanly.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>clap_dyn_complete</code> offers native async support.  That makes it a lot heavier weight but can offer better concurrency for longer operations</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>IIRC, async support was purely a nice-to-have. I'm sure some more judicious use of block_on could've worked just as well (at least, for my use-case).</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>clap_dyn_complete</code> delay creates custom completers.  The use case isn't too clear to me (<code>complete</code> would just be called once, why not just do the expensive stuff there?)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe part of the rationale here was that I wanted to plumb-through some shared context into different completion handlers without needing to use a global static.</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that I basically wrote this implementation &quot;for fun&quot; at $work, I wasn't super keen getting bogged down in forking / digging through <code>clap</code> internals to get things up and running. I did the best I could with the API surface that was already available.</p>
<p>And of course - the only performance consideration I had in mind when writing <code>clap_dyn_complete</code> was &quot;does it run well enough for the CLI in our project&quot;, which I'm sure wouldn't scale well to sorts of massive CLIs that exist out in the wild.</p>
<hr />
<p>But yeah, ultimately, I only wrote <code>clap_dyn_complete</code> because there was a brief lull at $work, and I thought it'd be a fun little QOL feature to hack on. I'm sure many of my design choices wouldn't translate to a robust, &quot;productized&quot; version of dynamic argument completions.</p>
<p>My goal here was to simply call-out some prior art in this space, and have <code>clap_dyn_complete</code> serve as yet another reference point for any folks actively involved in driving this issue forwards from the <code>clap</code> side.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@daniel5151  Thank you for sharing. Regarding the issue of allowing completion in the middle of words and with <code>COMP_WORDBREAKS</code>, the current <code>clap_complete</code> doesn't handle it very well. I’ll take a look at your approach.</p>
<p>I’ve tried using bash built-in functions like <code>__init_completions</code> in scripts to mask certain characters, and it successfully entered the common complete logic. However, it seems that bash’s post-processing of completions has some special handling. For example, when completing <code>--flag=</code>, it turns the <code>--flag=bar</code> completion into <code>--flag=--flag=bar</code>.</p>
<p>@epage , I have an important deadline on December 2nd, so during this period, I might only push some of the previous PRs. However, I’ve been following the community’s progress on <code>clap_complete</code> and I will accelerate the effort in December.</p>
<p>And thanks for your involvement, @calebbourg . I’ve contributed to the <code>clap_complete</code> project as well. Feel free to reach out to me via email or zulip https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/421156-gsoc/topic/Project.3A.20Move.20cargo.20shell.20completions.20to.20Rust if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Nothing specific really. It is mostly that I'm excited for rust-native completion and think it will solve a lot of problems I encounter.
(And therefore reference it as potential future solution for some issues)</p>
<p>The example that lead to me searching it <em>this time</em> was the idea for letting https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch dynamically complete archive formats.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also I definitely want to contribute to this at some point, but haven't really found the time to deep-dive into how the completion engine works and stuff 🙂</p>
<p>Native completion is a really cool idea for <code>clap</code> and I'm really excited for it!</p>

<p>It would be nice if we can use rust-native completion there. One of the blocker (apart from the ones already mentioned in issue) is the support for partial completions. i.e. <code>sr&lt;TAB&gt;</code> completes to <code>src/</code> (without space) instead of <code>src/ </code>.</p>
<p>I think this should probably a blocker for release as most path completions rely on this, unless this is already supported and I missed it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@nkitsaini #5587 is our issue for handling of trailing space.  It sounds like there is some shell-specific behavior there as I don't see that with bash.</p>
<p>Also, <code>SubcommandCandidates</code> only completes the initial external subcommand and doesn't complete arguments within the external subcommand.  We'll be exploring that as part of cargo if no one else gets too it sooner.  We need to be able to have at least somewhat functioning completions with aliases and external subcommands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also came across a bug in PathCompleter where it doesn't respect the filter provided. So if you only want to complete files not folders using PathCompleter::file() it will still complete both. This one is easy fix though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsure what this is referring to.  If you mean <code>PathCompleter::file().filter()</code>, then <code>filter</code> overides the filter applied in <code>file()</code>, rather than concatenates.  It might be good for us to change <code>filter</code> to being a new constructor.</p>
<p>If you mean <code>PathCompleter::file</code> returning directories, that is because we don't exhaustively enumerate every directory to see which may return a file, so we return them to further discover files.  We sort them alter and don't allow you to annotate them with further information in <code>map</code>.</p>

<p>Nice. So once #5587  is resolved, the <code>SubcommandCandidate</code> should kind of work as follows?</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">#[clap(name = &quot;cli&quot;, add = SubcommandCandidates::new(|| { vec![
    CompletionCandidate::new(&quot;git &quot;), #  # binary, full completion

<p>That is what I gathered. This would be amazing when supported!</p>

<p>Yeah I got confused there, my bad. I had added a filter <code>filter(|x| x.file_name().starts_with(&quot;s&quot;))</code> and was seeing directories that didn't start with &quot;s&quot;, I didn't notice the directory vs file distinction.</p>

<p>Whether the trailing space is included in the completion candidate or not is something to be figured out in that issue and through the implementation.  However, we expect to support it somehow.</p>
