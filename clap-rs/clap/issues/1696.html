                        colored = colorize output according to the `color`
                        parameter value;
                        Threshold values for colorized output can be
                        configured via
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_UNIT`, `RUST_TEST_TIME_INTEGRATION`

                        Expected format of environment variable is
                        `VARIABLE=WARN_TIME,CRITICAL_TIME`.

        --ensure-time   Treat excess of the test execution time limit as
                        error.
                        Threshold values for this option can be configured via
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_UNIT`, `RUST_TEST_TIME_INTEGRATION`
                        and
                        `RUST_TEST_TIME_DOCTEST` environment variables.
                        Expected format of environment variable is
                        `VARIABLE=WARN_TIME,CRITICAL_TIME`.
                        `CRITICAL_TIME` here means the limit that should not
                        be exceeded by test.


The FILTER string is tested against the name of all tests, and only those
tests whose names contain the filter are run.

By default, all tests are run in parallel. This can be altered with the
--test-threads flag or the RUST_TEST_THREADS environment variable when running
tests (set it to 1).

All tests have their standard output and standard error captured by default.
This can be overridden with the `--nocapture` flag or setting RUST_TEST_NOCAPTURE
environment variable to a value other than &quot;0&quot;. Logging is not captured by default.

Test Attributes:

    `#[test]`        - Indicates a function is a test to be run. This function
                       takes no arguments.
    `#[bench]`       - Indicates a function is a benchmark to be run. This
                       function takes one argument (test::Bencher).
    `#[should_panic]` - This function (also labeled with `#[test]`) will only pass if
                        the code causes a panic (an assertion failure or panic!)
                        A message may be provided, which the failure string must
                        contain: #[should_panic(expected = &quot;foo&quot;)].
    `#[ignore]`       - When applied to a function which is already attributed as a
                        test, then the test runner will ignore these tests during
                        normal test runs. Running with --ignored or --include-ignored will run
                        these tests.

</code></pre>
<p>which was despairing.</p>
<h2>What I did</h2>
<p>Now, indeed, I got myself a solution which is very ad-hoc to the situation. Please note that I have no specific idea how <code>clap</code> works, and here are my thoughts: (1) Binary built by <code>cargo test</code> first checks options/flags that was fed through cli interface, then (2) <code>clap</code> works with the same line as (1). Importantly, (1) does its sanity check so that if any undefined (by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html">cargo-test</a>) option or flag is fed, (2) doesn't even get the chance to parse.</p>
<p>Thus, my solution is using a option that both <code>cargo-test</code> and <code>clap</code> recognizes, say <code>-q</code> (replacing <code>short: t</code> to <code>short: q</code> in above <code>tests/cli.yml</code>). This will turn on <code>--quiet</code> option with respect to <code>cargo-test</code> and enable option for user-defined subcommand, <code>fuzz_ast_printer</code> as specified in <code>tests/cli.yml</code>. I could even just use argument itself without any flag/option.</p>
<p>Still, there is a problem for this ad-hoc solution: default options for <code>cargo-test</code>, e.g. <code>--nocapture</code>, <code>--ignored</code> don't work any longer. I wonder if this is the design of <code>clap</code>, or something we can improve.</p>
<p>Lastly, but not least, what I really want to do is getting arguments from command line as neat as clap offers. So, if there's any better or similar work around for this situation, please feel free to yell at me.</p>

<p>It's very tempting offer ;) I don't generally need a permission to yell at people, but thanks, I'll keep it in mind when I feel like yelling.</p>
<p>Let's start with some theory first.</p>
<p><code>#[test]</code> tests aren't supposed to take CL arguments, let me tell you. A <code>#[test]</code> function is <em>not</em> a binary on it's own, an <code>.rs</code> file is a binary. It can contain multiple tests. Besides, those binaries is immutable-ish, in a sense that they have all the stuff needed to test compiled <em>within</em>. You aren't supposed to pass command line args to these biaries, neither you have the ability to do so. Let me elaborate the later statement.</p>
<p>Recall how <code>tests/cli.yml</code> looks like:</p>
<pre><code> name: fuzz
 settings:
     - AllowExternalSubcommands
     - AllowLeadingHyphen
 subcommands:
     - fuzz_ast_printer:
         args:
             - runtime:
                 help: Sets Csmith runtime directory
                 takes_value: true
             - test_file:
                 short: t
                 help: Sets the test file to use
                 takes_value: true
                 required: true
</code></pre>
<p>And what was the output you saw from <code>cargo test fuzz_ast_printer -- --help</code>?</p>

<p><strong>They do not match in the slightest.</strong></p>
<p>The reason they do not match is - your code is not the one executed first. The binary <code>libtest</code> generates has it's own CLI (see the output) which is <em>competing</em> with your <code>clap::App</code>. This CLI is defined somewhere <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/libtest/blob/dbf328db62eacebe1aa719fa806c729bafa319b3/libtest/lib.rs#L457">there</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you want to crank it up, you're going to have to produce a CLI which is <em>compatible</em> with the one from <code>libtest</code> (heavens no!). I strongly <em>do not</em> advise this approach, I'm very well convinced that you're doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Could you please elaborate on what you're trying to achieve? What is the problem you're attempting to resolve with CLI args passing to tests?</p>

<p>Note that I gracefully specified <code>nocaputre</code> flag in <code>tests/cli.yml</code> so that it works, however not for <code>quiet</code>. So, let me state the problem again: While <code>libtest</code> already specifies their options, if one wants to use <code>clap</code> in <code>#[test]</code> as usual way (in <code>main.rs</code>), one may have to copy and paste all the flags in <code>libtest</code> to make it working. (and IMO, this is what user wants for any crate to do it for them)</p>

<p>I think this is what's preventing you from understanding the issue. <code>libtest</code> doesn't specify a CLI <em>already</em> but rather specifies <em>yet another CLI that works with the same <code>std::env::args()</code> your <code>clap::App</code> does</em>, emphasis on &quot;the same args&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's see what's happening step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>The test binary gets run. OS puts all the CLI args somewhere <code>std::env::args()</code> gives you access to. This <em>somewhere</em> is effectively immutable, let's call this place <code>args</code>.</li>
<li>The CLI parser <code>libtest</code> has generated (<code>lib-cli</code> for short) checks that the <code>args</code> is valid (in it's own understanding), and if it isn't, aborts the program.</li>
<li>Your test code gets run. Your <code>clap::App</code> defines <em>yet another CLI</em> that checks that the <code>args</code> is valid (in it's own understanding), and if it isn't, aborts the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>You see? <strong><code>args</code> must be valid for both <code>lib-cli</code> and <code>clap::App</code></strong>. This is why you have to &quot;copy and paste all the flags in libtest to make it working&quot;, because they both parse <em>the same</em> CL array the binary has got.</p>
<p>This is not a problem with clap, honestly, it's just you're trying to squeeze a CLI parser in somewhere it doesn't belong to. It's going to be the same with <code>clap</code>, <code>getopts</code> (libtest uses it btw), <code>docopt</code>, you name it.</p>
<p>Now, let's get back to your <em>real</em> problem - why do you want to pass the file path to a <code>#[test]</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CreepySkeleton I really appreciate the elaborations about the issue. What we decided to do is that rather build another binary for testing purpose with distinct <code>.yml</code> configuration for <code>clap</code>. We now deeply understand that <code>cargo test</code> doesn't take any arguments from outside. It made our project still neat and simple. I personally learned nitty-gritty details of <code>cargo</code>, which is exciting:) Thanks again for your comments and everything!</p>
