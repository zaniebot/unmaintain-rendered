            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to make the <code>textwrap</code> crate an optional dependency, so that those who don't care that much about the nice formatting wouldn't need to install the transitive closure of the dependencies of <code>textwrap</code> (most notably, <code>libc</code> and <code>winapi</code>).</p>
<p>This would also cut down on the quantity of <code>unsafe</code> used (again, transitively) by the dependent crates, should they choose to opt out of pretty help text wrapping.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks like we'll need to discuss this one a bit more. Here's the complete problem scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>The doc says that with feature<code>wrap_help</code> enabled, it will wrap the text respecting the actual with of the terminal rather than assuming 120 columns. It also says that this feature will build the <code>term_size</code> crate as a dependency.</li>
<li>This would make me assume that <code>term_size</code> is not necessary when this feature is disabled. However, <code>textwrap</code> is a non-optional dependency, and it has <code>term_size</code> as a non-optional dependency itself. This means that <code>term_size</code> is always a dependency.</li>
<li>Does this mean that <code>textwrap</code> should also make <code>term_size</code> an optional dependency; better yet, a non-dependency? As far as I can tell, that crate does not internally rely on knowing the terminal width; it merely provides a convenience callthrough/adaptor interface for <code>term_size</code>. I think that it is poor code organization to hard depend on a crate that is not used directly, only for the sake of providing a convenience adaptor for it.</li>
<li>Consequently, I think I'll have to go to the <code>textwrap</code> crate's author and ask him/her to remove <code>term_size</code> as a dependency before I can continue implementing this PR.</li>
</ul>
