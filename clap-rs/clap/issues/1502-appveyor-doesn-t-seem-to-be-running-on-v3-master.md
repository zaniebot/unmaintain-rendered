# appveyor doesn't seem to be running on v3-master

---

_Issue opened by @erickt on 2019-06-20 15:11_

It appears that [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kbknapp/clap-rs/history) is not running on the v3-master, which is how I suspect the windows target broke. Would it be possible to fix this?

Thanks. But soon we will be merging v3-master to master so that should take care of it.

`master` is working, should we close this?
