Rust Version
<p>rustc 1.77.0 (aedd173a2 2024-03-17)</p>
Clap Version
<p>clap = &quot;4.5.4&quot;</p>
Minimal reproducible code
<p>Copied directly from: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/9d14f394ba22f65f8957310a03ae5fd613f89d76/examples/demo.rs</p>
<pre><code>use clap::Parser;

/// Simple program to greet a person

    /// Name of the person to greet
    #[arg(short, long)]

</code></pre>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<p>Run the code.</p>
Actual Behaviour
<p>It has a bunch of compile errors.</p>
Expected Behaviour
<p>I&#x27;d expect a file named <code>demo.rs</code> to work in isolation.</p>
Additional Context
<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing. I&#x27;m sure someone who knew what they were doing would have more success than I am.</p>
Debug Output
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Generally, the examples are written to be viewed from rustdoc.  For example, see https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/#example for the discussion on <code>demo.rs</code></p>
<p>If you want to bypass that, to understand examples, you need to look at the context of the <code>Cargo.toml</code>.  See
https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/9d14f394ba22f65f8957310a03ae5fd613f89d76/Cargo.toml#L117-L119</p>
<p>As this is working as expected and people do have a path forward, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and close this.  If there is a reason for us to reconsider, let us know!</p>

<p>Perhaps a message along the lines of the following would be beneficial:</p>

<p>These examples are not meant to function in isolation, and are only suplemental material to the following tutorial(s):</p>
