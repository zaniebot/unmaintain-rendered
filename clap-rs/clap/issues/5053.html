Rust Version
<p>rustc 1.73.0-nightly (8771282d4 2023-07-23)</p>
Clap Version
<p>4.3.19</p>
Minimal reproducible code
<pre><code>/// short
///
/// ```bash
/// $ echo hi
/// $ echo ih
/// ```
#[command(version, about)]
struct Command;
</code></pre>
Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code
<p>cargo run -- --help</p>
Actual Behaviour
<p>puts the whole code block on one line, and includes ```bash and ``` in output</p>
Expected Behaviour
<p>puts each line in the code block on its own line, strips the ```bash and ```, possibly specially formats/highlights the code.</p>
Additional Context
<p>using verbatim_doc_comment solves half of this issue</p>
<p>somewhat similar to <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2389">clap-rs/clap#2389</a></p>
<p>sidenote: clap version can not be found with grep clap Cargo.lock as instructed in the bug report form</p>
<pre><code>grep &#x27;name = &quot;clap&quot;&#x27; Cargo.lock -C1</code></pre>
<p>works</p>
Debug Output
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2389#issuecomment-1002370465 mentions fenced code blocks, so i somewhat agree (even though i disagree with most of the later suggestions of that specific comment). i simply did not find that part of the discussion when searching for doc test or code example.</p>
<p>as for differences: this is a subset of the full markdown spec that could be implemented without doing the entire thing, so if that is a direction you are interested in pursuing its different, if you intend to have full markdown support then, as i said, its just a subset of that.</p>
<p>i don&#x27;t know how the actual code is structured, and it would need to check for a backspace in front of ``` too, but basically this does the trick:</p>
<pre><code>let mut strip_newlines = true;
lines.map(|line| {
if line.contains(&quot;```&quot;) {strip_newlines = !strip_newlines}; (strip_newlines, line)
})
.do_the_strip
.filter(|(_, line)| !line.contains(&quot;```&quot;)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For another project, I&#x27;ve written a code-fence subset of a markdown parser.  The overall need is bigger than that in terms of we need to correctly parse hard vs soft newlines.  For that, we should use a more general parser than picking at this problem a piece a time.</p>
