# Non string default parameters

---

_Issue opened by @jbreitbart on 2018-03-11 11:57_

I am not sure if this is a real issue or just me being stupid. I am wondering if it is possible to support non string-default parameters. Currently it seems like I have to do

```
    let cpus_str = num_cpus::get().to_string();
    let matches = App::new("heat-rs")
        .arg(
            Arg::with_name("threads")
                .long("threads")
                .short("t")
                .help("Number of threads")
                .default_value(&cpus_str)
                .required(true),
        )
        .get_matches();
```

but the string looks superfluous. Is there any reason why I cannot set an integer default value?

Not a stupid question at all! Currently clap only handles strings. Strings in, strings out. You can use something like [`structopt`](https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt) (which uses clap internally) to use Rust types. 

It's not an exact answer to your question, but should help.

Also note that `structopt` is in the process of being merged into clap proper ;)
