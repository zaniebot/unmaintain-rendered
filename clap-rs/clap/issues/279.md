# Feature: Allow matching on argument group

---

_Issue opened by @Diggsey on 2015-09-24 18:12_

Within an argument group, only one of the arguments may be present, so it's useful to be able to match on that group.

This should be implemented similarly to subcommand matching: the name of the group is passed in, and an `Option<&str>` is returned, containing the name of the argument within that group if it exists.
