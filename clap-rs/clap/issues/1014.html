            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is subjective, I know, but personally I think that'd be a good more code to maintain for only a little benefit. In small programs this may look nicer, but in larger scenarios I think it'd get lost in the noise.</p>
<p>I'm going to close this since I don't have the bandwidth to maintain code doing this, but I'm open to discussion if there's an argument to made as to why it'd be better (in all cases) to do this.</p>
