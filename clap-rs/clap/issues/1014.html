Expected Behavior Summary
<pre><code>    --free &lt;space&gt;    Ensure filesystem has at least this much free space. (ex: 9.5%, 10G)
    -o     &lt;option&gt;    Additional system-specific mount options. Be careful!

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is subjective, I know, but personally I think that&#x27;d be a good more code to maintain for only a little benefit. In small programs this may look nicer, but in larger scenarios I think it&#x27;d get lost in the noise.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to close this since I don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to maintain code doing this, but I&#x27;m open to discussion if there&#x27;s an argument to made as to why it&#x27;d be better (in all cases) to do this.</p>
