# required_if() appears in help menu like if it's always required 

---

_Issue opened by @ghost on 2018-10-12 21:28_

### Rust Version
rustc 1.29.2 (17a9dc751 2018-10-05)

### Affected Version of clap
clap = "2.32.0"

### Bug or Feature Request Summary
<del>Be able to have multiple arguments for one index and only one is expected to be used and one of them can take a value.
Is this already possible or could this be added?
<del>
It would then look like this in the help menu:
App [ARG] ...
<del>
ARG:
--foo1
--foo2=VALUE

EDIT: Im now using required_if() as a solution but in the help menu it looks like that the argument is always required. must be caused by the fact that I need to make the conditional argument required as otherwise Im getting an error that its not required. Is there any way to insert a indexed argument as conditional argument?

I think he means using `required_if` is not giving out useful info during `--help`.

As this was opened against clap 2 and I can't reproduce it with clap 4, I'm going to go ahead and close it.  If someone does reproduce this, please be sure to include the code to reproduce the issue and the actual output along with the expected output.
