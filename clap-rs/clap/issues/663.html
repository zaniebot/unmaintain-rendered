            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When compiling Clap 2.11.1+ with Rust 1.9.0, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>[...]/clap-2.12.1/src/errors.rs:857:35: 857:46 error: no method named `description` found for type `std::fmt::Error` in the current scope
[...]/clap-2.12.1/src/errors.rs:857         Error::with_description(e.description(), ErrorKind::Format)
</code></pre>
<p>If I had to guess, this is because of 58512f2fcb430745f1ee6ee8f1c67f62dc216c73.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This could be because of colliding <code>clap::Error</code> and <code>std::fmt::Error</code>. Could you point to the code causing this error and I can see if both those structs are in scope?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah ok my mistake, I missed the Rust 1.9 part of the title. Since current <code>stable</code> is 1.11 I can't mark this as a bug. I believe even the rust-lang-nursery crates only have a requirement to compile two stable releases behind as well.</p>
<p>However having said that, if someone knows how to detect <code>rustc</code> version and conditionally compile particular functions based on those findings I'm not against gating that method on anything prior to Rust 1.9.</p>
<p>@i80and is there a reason you can't update to the latest stable?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My project is OpenBSD-focused, and since rustup doesn't support OpenBSD, it would be obnoxious to use a non-packaged version.</p>
<p>However, I understand that this isn't really your problem, and it's probably not worth adding kludges for this since 2.11.0 will work fine for the remainder of the Rust 1.9.0 lifecycle.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@i80and if compiling a OpenBSD port isn't a problem for you, you could checkout the -current version of <code>lang/rust</code> and rebuild it for OpenBSD 6.0. The version is 1.11.0 and I expect it to be buildable without problem under 6.0.</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /usr/ports/lang/rust &amp;&amp; cvs up -A
$ pkg_add -a llvm cmake g++%4.9
$ make
$ doas make install

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Just for documentations sake because I just ran into this with rustc 1.10.0. The problem is because <code>std::fmt::Error</code> on began impl'ing <code>std::err::Error</code> in rustc 1.11.0.
See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.11.0/std/fmt/struct.Error.html#method.description"><code>std::fmt::Error</code></a> and https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/commit/58512f2fcb430745f1ee6ee8f1c67f62dc216c73#diff-1a3079550f2751fb09d74ca85b9d5dcbR829</p>
<p>Naturally updating to the latest stable will fix the problem for me also, I just hadn't gotten around to it yet.</p>
