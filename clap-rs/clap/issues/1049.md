# Hidden subcommand

---

_Issue opened by @artemshein on 2017-09-18 12:55_

Is there a way to define a hidden subcommand?

_Comment by @AdrienChampion on 2017-09-18 12:57_

With [`hidden`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.26.2/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.hidden).

@AdrienChampion I don't get it: subcommand is not an Arg, it's an instance of App, right?

My bad, I answered too quickly.

It sounds like you can do that with [`AppSettings`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.26.2/clap/enum.AppSettings.html). See `AppSettings::Hidden` and `AppSettings::HidePossibleValuesInHelp` for instance. I have to say I've never used that though.

Oh, thank you, it's exactly what I need! Missed it somehow...
