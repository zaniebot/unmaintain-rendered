            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm very interested in this.  This is currently basically impossible to emulate manually and it makes long help texts very hard to read because when the term wraps, it does not align with the start of the message.</p>
<p>As an example from an app i have:</p>
<pre><code>        --use-dsymutil         Invoke dsymutil on encountered macho binaries to extract
the symbols before uploading.  This requires the dsymutil binary to be available.
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a working local stash of this feature. The downside is that's a naive implementation and doesn't wrap by word, i.e. some words get cut in the middle. I'm going to continue playing with this as I have some ideas to improve it and at least get it to wrap where it's aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>@mitsuhiko your example above will end up outputting:</p>
<pre><code>        --use-dsymutil         Invoke dsymutil on encountered macho binaries to extract
                               the symbols before uploading.  This requires the dsymutil 
                               binary to be available.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Finally, after some back to the drawing board moments I have this working in a whitespace respecting way (i.e. it doesn't cut words in the middle). I'm updating tests now, and should have a PR in tonight. Once merged I'll go ahead and put out 2.2.0.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>PR is in, here's a screenshot of what the term wrapping looks like using some arbitrary test options and flags. Term width is 66:</p>

<p>Edit:
There's also the option to place the text on the line following the option, flag, or argument indented once (a la, some getopts/docopt style formatting for long help strings). This could also be applied <a href="http://kbknapp.github.io/clap-rs/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.next_line_help">per argument</a>, or <a href="http://kbknapp.github.io/clap-rs/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#examples-15">application/command wide</a>.</p>
