# Could not downcast to type alias

---

_Issue opened by @2moe on 2023-01-13 13:13_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Rust Version

rustc 1.68.0-nightly (61a415be5 2023-01-12)

### Clap Version

4.0.32

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
use clap::Parser;
type OptVal = Option<String>;

#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
struct Cli {
    #[arg(long, value_parser = ["turbo", "auto", "slow"])]
    mode: OptVal,
}

fn main() {
    let args = Cli::parse();
    dbg!(&args.mode);
}
```

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

cargo r -- --mode auto

### Actual Behaviour

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Mismatch between definition and access of `mode`. Could not downcast to core::option::Option<alloc::string::String>, need to downcast to alloc::string::String
', src/main.rs:117:11
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

### Expected Behaviour

```
[src/main.rs:21] &args.mode = Some(
    "auto",
)
```

### Additional Context

If I don't use OptVal type, and use `Option<String>`, I won't have this problem.

### Debug Output

```toml
[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.0.32", features = ["derive", "wrap_help", "unicode"] }
```

That application is defined to require a subcommand, so if one isn't specified you get that error.

To make something optional (arg, subcommand), you need to wrap it in an `Option`.  One way to think of it is there isn't a way to construct `Cli` right now as what will we put in the `run` field when no subcommand is specified.

@epage Thanks. 
I have amended this issue and I am not sure if this is appropriate.
 For `type OptVal = Option<String>`, clap will not resolve this type alias(`OptVal`), but will resolve `Option<String>`.
Is this an intentional approach?

_Comment by @epage on 2023-01-13 14:49_

Clap does a textual comparison on the type to determine what behavior is assumed so people can override it, so type aliases are intentionally treated as unique types. #4626 is discussing changing / improving the situation.

As this is expected behavior, I'm closing this out.
