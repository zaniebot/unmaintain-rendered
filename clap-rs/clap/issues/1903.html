<li>[x] Searched the <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions">discussions</a></li>
<li>[x] Searched the closed issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I'm looking to use the help menu to replace creating a separate man page. To not bombard users with info, I'd like to include detailed information when they use the long --help flag for sections that need more detail. As a random example of more detail, if you &quot;man curl&quot;, you'll see sections at the end explaining error codes that you wouldn't see with &quot;curl --help&quot; and I think {before/after}<em>help</em>{short/long} would provide that location.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<pre><code>let myapp = App::new(&quot;My App&quot;)
    .after_help(&quot;footer message&quot;)  // this already exists
    .before_help(&quot;header message&quot;)  // this already exists

    .after_help_short(&quot;a concise footer&quot;)  // proposal, could be redundant with after_help
    .after_help_long(&quot;a much longer footer&quot;)  // proposal
    .before_help_short(&quot;a short header&quot;)  // proposal, could be redundant with before_help
    .before_help_long(&quot;a verbose header&quot;)  // proposal
</code></pre>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>make man pages or a hook into cargo doc from clap, although I think the suggested solution is easier.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this would be implemented as <code>{after,before}_help_long</code> and allow the current <code>{before,after}_help</code> serve as the <code>short</code> so that we don't have redundant APIs. This also would go along with the <code>short</code> somewhat being the default in <code>clap</code> as with all other settings that where both a <code>long</code> and <code>short</code> co-exist.</p>
