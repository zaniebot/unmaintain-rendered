# What branch to contribute (document contributing process)?

---

_@CreepySkeleton_

I'm not sure whether it's a proper place to ask, sorry for any inconvenience.

I'd like to contribute to `clap`, say, fix some issues, push some old PRs over the finish line and so on. 
But as far as I see the `master` branch had not received any significant contributions for a long time so I suppose it's not the branch I should be working on. I notice `v3-dev` and `v3-master` branches *do* have some effort being put in them so it seems one or both of them are the place I need to look at.

So what do I do?

@CreepySkeleton thanks. Yes we have "frozen" the master branch, since we are focussing on 3.0 which is on the v3-master branch. You can pick any issue from the list and send a PR or a draft in case you need any help. Thanks

@Dylan-DPC Just noticed "Important note on clap 3.0", this _is_ documented after all. But perhaps we should change the tittle to "Contributing to 3.0" so it would catch an eye of contributors?

I have created #1550 so this wouldn't be needed. Thanks
