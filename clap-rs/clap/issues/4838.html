Clap Version
<p>4.2.2</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I currently have a manual test written that calls <code>debug_assert</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    pub fn test_clap() {
        use clap::CommandFactory;
        super::Bit::command().debug_assert();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;d like to, instead, provide a <code>test</code> argument to the <code>#[command]</code> derive, and have clap generate this test for me:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Parser, Debug)]
#[command(name = &quot;bit&quot;, test)]
pub struct Bit {
</code></pre>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Please add a <code>test</code> argument for the <code>#[command]</code> derive that generates a test calling <code>debug_assert</code>.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>As another alternative, clap could generate this test by default, on the theory that it doesn&#x27;t do any harm if not building/running tests, and it&#x27;s likely what the user wants. (In that case, though, there should probably be an option <code>test = false</code> just in case the user is doing something strange.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we did this automatically, we&#x27;d want to do it only for the <code>Parser</code> trait as that communicates &quot;top-level&quot;.  Anything not-&quot;top-level&quot; is more likely for the user to be doing something strange.</p>
<p>On a first pass, I&#x27;d want to treat that as a breaking change though which means it would be delayed to v5.  A <code>#[command(test)]</code> would allow access now.</p>
<p>Another alternative is for clap to unconditionally call <code>debug_assert()</code> when doing a top-level build.  This would require building the whole tree of commands.  As we want consistent runtime behavior between debug and release and building all could mask things, we&#x27;d likely want to do a <code>clone</code> and then <code>debug_assert</code>.  I would expect the different in runtime performance in debug builds to not be bad enough to be a problem though I might want to ping the deno people as they are currently trying to optimize start up times even further (#4774) and so they are more likely to notice and care about debug performance.</p>
