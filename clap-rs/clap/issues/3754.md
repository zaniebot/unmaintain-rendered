We have intentionally decided to not enumerate every possible attribute in the derive documentation due to the maintenance burden of that.  Instead the derive reference [explains how raw attributes work](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.1.18/examples/derive_ref/README.md#terminology) and reminds people when looking at [Command attributes](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.1.18/examples/derive_ref/README.md#command-attributes) that raw attributes exist, linking to the relevant documentation for using those raw attributes.

Ok, I only came up with this because somebody asked about it here https://users.rust-lang.org/t/clap-derive-required-flags-or-options-that-are-exclusive-to-each-other/75998/4 .

I've created https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4090 to further discuss the documentation of raw attributes as this keeps coming up
