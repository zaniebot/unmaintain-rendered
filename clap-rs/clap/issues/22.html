            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Argument assertions to determine if incompatible options have been used are currently evaluated inside arg.rs within the individual method. This allows for certain assertions to pass, that shouldn't, depending on the order in which argument options are listed.</p>
<p>Although assertions should normally be evaluated as soon as possible, all options must first be present. Thus assertions need to be moved to app.rs inside the <code>arg()</code> method.</p>
