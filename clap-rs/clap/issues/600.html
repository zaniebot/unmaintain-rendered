            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it's generally best to make cmdline parsing as simple and short as possible.</p>
<p>In that spirit I'd like to propose adding a way to initialize version/authors
implicitly since this would add make it more difficult to build an app without cargo
(although you could just define the 2 env variable manually) and since
App::new doesn't depend on it currently I thought people might be opposed to
changing it.</p>
<p>Instead how about adding a new method App::new_with_defaults?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think is a fine idea. I'd like to hear a few more opinions on the matter before adding it, primarily around the naming. I think <code>new_with_defaults</code> is kind of long. Maybe just <code>App::with_defaults(name)</code>?</p>
