<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.1.15</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I want to limit the maximum given arguments with a proper error message for the user when too many arguments are provided.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Instead of <code>ErrorKind::UnknownArgument</code> I would like <code>max_values</code> to return a new error kind like <code>ErrorKind::TooManyValues</code> mirroring the behavior of <code>min_values</code> with its error kind <code>ErrorKind::TooFewValues</code>.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With <code>TooFewValues</code>, there is a definitive case for us to identify and report an error: the parser was looking for more values and didn't see them.</p>
<p><code>TooManyValues</code> is a bit trickier because the parser exhausted one argument and is processing the next, finding it doesn't exist.  We'd need to match against a trailing argument that took a value but there are no more positional or subcommands afterwards.  The error also might not make sense for an argument that just takes one value.   Or maybe it does.</p>
<p>Then it comes to the implementation.  Our parser isn't in a great state right now though hopefully some in going refactors will improve things a bit.</p>
<p>This isn't a &quot;no&quot; but that parts of the design need to be figured out and that we might wait for some refactorings before its practical to implement.</p>
