### Describe your use case

I'm trying to figure out how to use `#[command]` on a derived `Parser`. Docs for `#[arg]` seem to exist, so I was expecting these as well. It's a shame there's probably not a surefire way to ensure these are exhaustive, since they are macro attributes, but still beats reading through all the examples for what `#[command]` takes.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Document `#[command]`.

More information is needed on what is missing as we do cover this in the documentation

This is covered in the tutorial
- https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_tutorial/chapter_1/index.html
- https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_tutorial/chapter_2/index.html#subcommands

And in the reference
- https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html#command-attributes

And in the cookbook
- https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_cookbook/cargo_example_derive/index.html
- https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_cookbook/git_derive/index.html

I was just expecting it since there are docs at the top level under `arg`. Maybe just put a link in the `command` macro docs so people like me don't get lost?

There are not top-level docs for `#[arg()]` but for `arg!` which is a macro to use the builder API by example.  Similarly, there are top-level docs for `command!` which is also for the builder API.

Oh, that makes sense. Sorry for the confusion. Macro docs in Rust still confuse me.

rustdoc has no support for proc macro attributes which makes things more difficult in general.  The above links are my experimentation in making up for that problem.
