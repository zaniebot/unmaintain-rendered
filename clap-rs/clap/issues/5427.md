# Support Base Path for ValueHint::*Path types

---

_Issue opened by @Swivelgames on 2024-03-26 02:24_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

4.4.7

### Describe your use case

There are certain parameters that I would like to complete using paths. However, some of that paths aren't relative to the Current Working Directory.

### Describe the solution you'd like

It would be great if you could specify a base directory for Path-like completions. In a Utopian world, it would also be great to include an optional max-depth:

```rust
pub enum ValueHint {
    // ...
    AnyChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    FileChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    DirChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    ExecutableChildPath(PathBuf, Int),
    // ...
}
```
```rust
let start_path = PathBuf::from("/some/path");
let depth = 1;
let hint = Vault::Hint(start_path, depth);
```

### Alternatives, if applicable

The alternative that I'm exploring right now is rolling my own completion for `Path`, which isn't ideal.

Note that `ValueHint` is specifically meant to capture native shell completions.

 #1232 is our issue for allowing the user to provide custom completers which is blocked on #3166.

I'm going to close in favor of #1232 as we likely won't support every case for users.  We can observe users and maybe pull some things in that are frequently used but I don't want to speculatively keep this issue as open in case this ends up being one of the cases.  After the community has adopted #1232, if there is enough of a case that this pattern is common, we can re-evaluate then.
