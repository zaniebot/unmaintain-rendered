To be honest it was a somewhat random decision. Conceptually I like the idea that any derivatives also be open source so I can learn better or new ways to go about it. But I also don't have a problem re-releasing under a different license if others find something more suitable to their needs.

Argument parser is an important part of any command line application. IANAL, but I think having clap under GPL will force not only forks of clap, but also applications that merely use it to be GPL(-compatible?).

That is a good point. I will be re-releasing clap under the MIT license.
