# More Resettable builder methods

---

_Issue opened by @ModProg on 2022-09-02 18:45_

## Command
### Application-wide Settings
- `term_width`
- `max_term_width`
**Also what is the actual difference in behavior, I feel the documentation is lacking**


### Command-specific Settings
- [x] `bin_name`
- [x] `display_name`
- [x] `author`
- [x] `about`
- [x] `long_about`
- [x] `after_help`
- [x] `after_long_help`
- [x] `before_help`
- [x] `before_long_help`
- [x] `version`
- [x] `long_version`
- [x] `override_usage`
- [x] `override_help`
- [x] `help_template`
- [x] `next_help_heading`
- [x] `next_display_order`, this one uses `Option` currently
- [ ] `replace`, this one uses `IntoIterator`, maybe passing `Vec::new()` would be the same behavior
- [x] `short_flag`
- [x] `long_flag`
- [ ] `aliases`, `IntoIterator` 
- [ ] `short_flag_aliases`, `IntoIterator` 
- [ ] `long_flag_aliases`, `IntoIterator` 
- [ ] `visible_aliases`, `IntoIterator` 
- [ ] `visible_short_flag_aliases`, `IntoIterator` 
- [ ] `visible_long_flag_aliases`, `IntoIterator` 
- [x] `display_order`, default is 999, possible to set manually
- [ ] `external_subcommand_value_parser`
- [x] `subcommand_value_name`
- [x] `subcommand_help_heading`

Theoretically the `bool` switches also, though not necessary, as long as the default is known they can be manually reset.

I feel like `name` should not be resettable as it would have dramatically different semantics than any other resettable

yes that's why I put it seperately, I agree that only values that can be optionally set should be unsettable

I completed the list for `Command`

If you leave `term_width` at default (or reset it), clap will see how wide your terminal is and then cap that by `max_term_width`.

I had to look at the code to make sense of it.


I'm looking at update the docs but I feel like there is a typography / CSS term of phrase that would apply here to help clarify it but I can't think of what it would be

#4212 for `max_term_width` documentation

I think I'll skip any of the iterables for now.
