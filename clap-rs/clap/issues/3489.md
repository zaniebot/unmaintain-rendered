# Derive API tutorial refers to Builder API concepts rather than the derive API attributes

_Issue opened by @edmorley on 2022-02-18 16:41_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Rust Version

N/A

### Clap Version

3.1.0

### Minimal reproducible code

N/A

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

1. Visit https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.1.0/examples/tutorial_derive/README.md#configuring-the-parser
2. Read the first few sections and compare the readme explanations to the linked code

### Actual Behaviour

The tutorial text says:

> You use the `Command` the start building a parser.

...and later:

> You can use `command!()` to fill these fields in from your Cargo.toml file.

(and so on, there are several more similar usages)

These are the builder API, not the derive API.

### Expected Behaviour

 I would instead expect the derive tutorial to mention the actual derive attributes seen in the example:
https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/v3.1.0/examples/tutorial_derive/02_apps.rs

...such as `#[derive(Parser)]`, `#[clap(name = "MyApp")]` etc.

### Additional Context

_No response_

### Debug Output

_No response_
