Clap Version
<p>4.4.9</p>
Describe your use case
<p>As a distro maintainer, I want to ship shell completions for all shells shipped by my distro. Even if a package ships completions generated with clap_complete,  the ones for nushell for example aren&#x27;t included, because  people only take the ones listed in clap_complete directly. See <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/minijinja/pull/403">mitsuhiko/minijinja#403</a>/files#diff-cea125128a0bc3a52233a2d72ca6519778801f05f6e5c45612dcf6045c1c0075R33-R37, to see why.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I&#x27;d like to move clap_complete_nushell and clap_complete_fig into clap_complete itself. This way, it&#x27;s easier to generate completions for everything.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>It would also be possible to keep them in separate crates, which are then depended upon by clap_complete, with that inclusion being hidden behind feature flags.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is intentional as we aren&#x27;t as committed to the same level of support for these shells.  If we had this model back when Elvish was added, it would be in a separate package as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, when #3166 is stabilized, we might be changing what shells are supported in <code>clap_complete</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to hide the shells with less commitment behind a feature flag like &quot;experimental_shells&quot; then? That&#x27;d still make it a lot easier to package completions for those tools as a package maintainer for distros.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Its easier to manage the support level as a distinct package, rather than dealing with moving a package in and out (e.g. <code>clap_complete_nushell</code> was started outside of the clap project).</p>
<p>Also, with #3166, there will be shells (like fig) that will be incompatible with what <code>clap_complete</code> will turn into.   When we make the transition to shell-native completions to rust-native completions, I expect we&#x27;ll migrate all of the shell-native completions into individual packages which will be at a lower level of support.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So that means there won&#x27;t be a way to iterate over all shells anymore in the future? Then package maintainers would have to do a lot more patching to ensure all shell completions are built.</p>
<p>I understand why that makes sense from a clap PoV, but as a distro maintainer this does make my life a bit harder.</p>
<p>On a more positive note: Very much looking forward to rust-native completions :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Isn&#x27;t this a choice for the CLI maintainer?  It seems odd for a distro to be trying to extend a program beyond what the maintainer supports.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, but the patches for those CLI tools often come from distros to the upstream repo. The cases I&#x27;ve seen are more that the upstream maintainers aren&#x27;t even aware that they could improve their UX by providing (more) completions or a man page. There&#x27;s probably a dozen or so cases where I&#x27;ve packaged CLI tooling and upstreamed generation of completions and man pages so that we could ship them in Void Linux.</p>
<p>Ideally, the patch does land upstream, but providing a man page and cli completions auto-generated from a clap definition where the patch does not land upstream does occasionally happen too. Considering we&#x27;re not changing how the tool itself works, I think that&#x27;s fine too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are actually two distinctions for us to make:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>integrated into <code>clap_complete</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>enabled by default</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking more on this, there are multiple considerations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The expected longevity / popularity of the shell</p>
</li>
<li><p>Our ability to maintain support for the shell (e.g. problems like <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/5729"><code>clap_complete::env::Elvish</code> generates code deprecated in 0.18, removed in 0.21 #5729</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whether we should automatically add to the compatibility surface of callers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For that last one, if we add new shells to <code>Shell</code>, existing applications will get it for free by upgrading, whether they want it or not. I wonder if we should extend <code>Shell</code> in breaking releases and we should likely shrink it from where it is currently at to be very conservative.</p>
