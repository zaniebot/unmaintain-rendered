            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The documentation for <code>args_override_self</code> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specifies that all arguments override themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which would seem to imply that it makes it so that args with the <code>Append</code> action  would only respect the last option given. But that doesn't appear to be the case (thankfully). This should probably be more specific that it applies to SetTrue, SetFalse, and Set. (how does it impact Count?).</p>
<p>Relatedly, the documentation for <code>override_with</code> still says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: All arguments implicitly override themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is no longer true by default right?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for reporting this! I don't think clap was ever very clear on that but I've tried to make the distinction a bit clearer now.</p>
<p>I've also fixed that the comment about the default; missed that when doing the last minute behavior switch before clap 4</p>
