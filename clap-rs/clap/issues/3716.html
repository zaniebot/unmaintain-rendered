<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>3.1.9</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p><code>cargo</code> (and other things like git) allows for surfacing third-party completions https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/9fa2bba6791f9df06a13dbfe18bf7add9b9b2d1b/src/etc/_cargo#L341 (for zsh anyway) by assuming they are defined as <code>_cargo-&lt;name&gt;</code>. It would be a nice feature if <code>clap_complete</code> could generate a similar &quot;catch-all&quot; branch for the purposes of delegating to completions provided by external commands. Currently, I'm generating completions then invoking some <code>sed</code> magic to insert my own catch-all branch, but this is a little fragile (and I only have it working for zsh).</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>My preferred solution would be something that would enable me to customize the way completions are generated in such a way that  a &quot;good enough&quot; catch-all block was generated for me, though I realize <code>generate</code> doesn't have a builder, so adding a flag like <code>allow_fallback</code> or whatever would be a breaking change.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>Possible alternatives include</p>
<ul>
<li>a hook/template into the completion generation so arbitrary text could be added</li>
<li>a separate function that allows for the generation of the catch-all branch (to not break current users)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

<p>I feel like there is too much policy in a &quot;good enough&quot; fallback to have one at the <code>clap_complete</code> level.</p>
<p>The big issue is ideally we'd tag the Arg or Command with special behavior.  We are looking at supporting that soon-ish.  Say we go with the hook option you mentioned, we are looking at supporting <code>arg.set(clap_complete::shell::BashCompleter::new(&quot;...&quot;))</code> and the <code>clap_complete</code> could check if that exists and get its value.</p>
