Clap Version
<p>master</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I have a Subcommand enum and I&#x27;d like to add an argument that is used with all of them.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Normally in Rust, when you have a field used with all variants of an enum it&#x27;s common to define a struct that has the enum as an inner field. Something like so:</p>
<pre><code>struct MyType {
    common_field: String,
    kind: MyTypeKind,
}

enum MyTypeKind {
    A,
    B {
        some_field: String
    },
    // ..
}
</code></pre>
<p>I think it would be nice if this same pattern could be used with clap like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Parser)]
pub struct Cmd {
    #[clap(long)]
    common_arg: String,
    // &quot;forwards&quot; the subcommand implementation to this field that implements Subcommand
    // a struct needs to have a field with this annotation for the derive to impl Subcommand
    #[clap(bikeshed)]
    kind: CmdKind,
}

#[derive(Parser)]
pub enum CmdKind {
    A,
    B {
        #[clap(long)]
        some_arg: String,
    },
    // ..
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would behave the same as if <code>Cmd</code> was <code>CmdKind</code> with <code>common_arg</code> as a field in every variant.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>I&#x27;m aware of two alternative solutions:
Adding the argument to each variant manually. This makes the argument cumbersome to maintain and access.
Moving the argument &quot;up&quot; one level. This makes it more convenient for the developer, but makes the CLI&#x27;s user experience worse, as the placement of the arg when using the CLI or reading the help output is off.</p>
Additional Context
<p>A potential issue with the suggested solution is that a struct and one of its subcommand variants could have arguments with the same names. I&#x27;m not sure how clap deals with conflicts like that in general, hopefully it&#x27;s not a blocker if this feature is otherwise desireable.</p>
<p>When searching for related issues I got hundreds of results even when trying to use more specific wording, sorry if I missed an existing one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My bad, it seems like if <code>Cmd</code> is a struct I can just leave out the <code>#[clap(subcommand)]</code> annotation and it&#x27;ll work as I&#x27;d like it to.</p>
<p>Previously I had something like</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
struct Cli {
    #[clap(long)]
    arg: String,
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    cmd: Cmd,
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
enum Cmd {
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    MySubcommand(MySubcommandEnum),
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
enum MySubcommandEnum {
    A,
    B { some_arg: String },
}
</code></pre>
<p>and now</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
struct Cli {
    #[clap(long)]
    arg: String,
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    cmd: Cmd,
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
enum Cmd {
    // no #[clap(subcommand)] here
    MySubcommand(MySubcommandStruct),
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
struct MySubcommandStruct {
    #[clap(long)]
    common_arg: String,
    #[clap(subcommand)]
    kind: MySubcommandEnum,
}

#[derive(Debug, Parser, Clone)]
enum MySubcommandEnum {
    A,
    B { some_arg: String },
}
</code></pre>
<p>Sorry for the noise, though maybe someone with the same problem will find this issue later and find it helpful.</p>
