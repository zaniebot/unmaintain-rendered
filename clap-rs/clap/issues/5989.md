### Additional Context

Going to the docs homepage: [https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) and clicking on the builder reference link just takes you to the same page (i.e. same as a refresh). I was expecting to be redirected to the reference like I was for the corresponding [derive](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html) reference link

The current page is the reference for the builder API

Probably being too clever with that link but I feel something should be there. Maybe `current page` (no link)?

Oh I see thanks, that wasn't super obvious to me but maybe was to others. I do like the idea of making that obvious for noobs like me :D

I’ve also been confused by this several times in the past. I mean, I sort of get it when I think about it, but it’s not what I intuitively expect to see when I click on a “builder reference” link. Most of the text on that landing page isn’t even specific to the builder API, nor would I call it a reference except for the list of types/traits/macros at the bottom.

Perhaps it would be more helpful to link specifically to the rustdoc pages of `Command` and `Arg`, since those are the closest equivalent for the derive reference page in that they’re where I usually go to look up how to do something that I assume must be supported but I don’t know what it’s called.

I like the idea of having it link to `Command` as that is the start of everything.
