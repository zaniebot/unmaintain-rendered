# Positional arguments similar to command names get confused with commands

---

_Issue opened by @g2p on 2017-07-17 23:32_

### Rust Version

rustc 1.20.0-nightly (6d9d82d3d 2017-07-14)

### Affected Version of clap

clap 2.25.0

### Expected Behavior Summary

`program file subcommand` runs

### Actual Behavior Summary

```
error: The subcommand 'file' wasn't recognized
	Did you mean 'nile'?
```

### Steps to Reproduce the issue

Call a clap_app with a positional argument that looks like a command name.

### Sample Code or Link to Sample Code

```
    let matches = clap_app!(("Something") =>
        (@arg FILE: +required "File to examine")
        (@setting SubcommandRequiredElseHelp)
        (@subcommand nile => (about: "Whatever"))
    ).get_matches();
```

While I agree this is annoying, if the values supplied have the possibility of being close to a subcommand, I'd compile *without* the `suggestions` feature. If that isn't an option, there are several [`AppSettings`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.26.2/clap/enum.AppSettings.html) variants that help with this issue, such as making subcommands required, or disallowing args between subcommands.

I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this issue, but in order to provide suggestions, we *have* to check if the values supplied are similar to something.

This may be fixed with 2.27.1 however my concerns above still stand :wink:
