# Possible values verification doesn't work

---

_Issue opened by @grossws on 2015-09-29 23:31_

Can be reproduced using [example 11_only_specific_values](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/master/examples/11_only_specific_values.rs). 
### actual

If invoked with any value (other than `fast` and `slow`) it triggers panic:
    `thread '<main>' panicked at 'internal error: entered unreachable code', src/main.rs:32`
### expected

Some error message, graceful exit and usage info printed.

Offending lines are most likely [here](https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/master/src/app/app.rs#L2590-L2592)

I'll fix in the morning if someone hasn't beaten me to it by then :wink:

@grossws Once #289 merges I'll release 1.4.3 to crates.io
