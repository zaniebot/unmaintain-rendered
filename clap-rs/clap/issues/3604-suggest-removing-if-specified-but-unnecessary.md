# Suggest removing `--` if specified, but unnecessary

_Issue opened by @nazar-pc on 2022-04-02 17:42_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Clap Version

3.1.6

### Describe your use case

Users are sometimes confused by help message generated by Clap in case `--` was used where it was not expected:
```
$ ./app -- --dev --tmp
error: Found argument '--dev' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

        If you tried to supply `--dev` as a value rather than a flag, use `-- --dev`
```

### Describe the solution you'd like

In this particular case the suggestion should be to remove `--` instead of adding one more, like this:
```
$ ./app -- --dev --tmp
error: Found value '--dev' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

        There is an flag with the same name, try to remove `--`
```
