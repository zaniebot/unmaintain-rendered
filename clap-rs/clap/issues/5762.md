### Clap Version

4.4.8

### Describe your use case

It would be nice to for the long `--help` string to show if a sub-command has been marked as the default when the sub-command is non optional.

### Describe the solution you'd like

The current behavior is to just list all of the sub-commands as such 

```rust
#[derive(clap::Subcommand, Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub enum Subcommand {
    Show,
    Import,
    Config,
    #[default]
    Browse,
    Run {
        path: PathBuf,
    },
}
```

```
Usage: kadeu [OPTIONS] <CONFIG> <COMMAND>

Commands:
  show     
  import   
  config   
  browse
  run      
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

What would be nice is for the help message to feature this instead

```
Usage: kadeu [OPTIONS] <CONFIG> <COMMAND>

Commands:
  show     
  import   
  config   
  browse (default)
  run      
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
```

I don't know how feasible this can be, but I believe this could be a nice addition

The strange there here is clap has no concept of a `#[default]` subcommand.

The closest to that is the `git stash` pattern which we demonstrate in our [git cookbook entry](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_cookbook/git_derive/index.html) where the default is flattened into the parent command
