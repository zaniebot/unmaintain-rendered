            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In Diesel CLI we are using a global argument in combination with subcommands. I'd expect <code>matches.value_of(&quot;ARG&quot;)</code> to return the argument regardless of where it appeared. However, in Diesel CLI (which is using clap 2.24.2), running <code>diesel migration run --database-url something</code> will complain that the argument isn't present. Running <code>diesel migration --database-url something run</code> works.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sgrif apologies for the late reply, I've been out of town. Looking at the diesel source, this looks like a bug on clap's end. It should be a quick fix though. Let me see if I can get it put together today.</p>

<p>To fix it, you'll have to bubble all these values back up just <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/3224e2e1cd4927935f44081c1ca686d95f267790/src/app/parser.rs#L1074">prior to validation occurring</a>.</p>
<p>Some edge cases to watch out for would be <code>program --global-arg some_value outer --global-arg other_value</code> where multiple values aren't true. But this <em>should</em> just work because validation will occur <em>after</em> propagation.</p>

<p>To solve it, you'll probably just need to add some recursive calls to <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/3224e2e1cd4927935f44081c1ca686d95f267790/src/args/arg_matcher.rs#L23"><code>ArgMatcher::propagate</code></a> down through all subcommands.</p>

<p>Since I'm not sure when I'll be able to finalize 3.x with my crazy work schedule right now, I'd rather fix them in 2.x in the mean time. I saw your comment in the PR about lack of time as well, so I can pick up where you left off. Thanks for starting this though 👍</p>

<p>I would take the failing tests in #1060 and start with <code>second_subcommand_can_access_global_arg_if_global_arg_is_in_the_middle</code> as it will probably be easier to solve. It <em>may</em> be as easy as looping through all <em>matched</em> subcommands and recursively calling <code>propagate</code>.</p>
<p>If you run into any questions, feel free to ping me on Gitter since I'll get those notifications on my cell phone as well.</p>
