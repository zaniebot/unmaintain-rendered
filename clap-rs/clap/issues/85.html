            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Current API is quite verbose, I'm considering using common short names to save some key strokes and cut back on the the verbosity. Things such as <code>value</code> -&gt; <code>val</code>, etc. There are also several method names which have several synonyms that would fit. Once this is stabilized I will start considering a 1.0 release (along with a Rust 1.0).</p>
<p>This would ultimately be a breaking change (if names are changed), but legacy methods will be left in until a proper deprecation period has passed.</p>
<p>If anyone has ideas of overly verbose method names that should be changed, let's here it :)</p>
<p>Main methods I'm considering are those of <code>ArgMatches</code> but those of <code>Arg</code> and <code>App</code> could also change if needed. I'm also not apposed to leaving all method names as is, I believe being too verbose is better than too short.</p>
