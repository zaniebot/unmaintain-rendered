            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like it would be more efficient to parse the usage string at compiletime rather than build time since it is invariant.  I don't know if this could be done with macros or if codegen would be needed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@derekdreery it would be <em>slightly</em> faster, but to my knowledge it's not really feasible without syntax extensions or some sort of codegen. Since most of that requires nightly, I just haven't put too much time into it yet. Once these things stabalize it's on my radar to implement something like this.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the performance increase is pretty minimal, as <code>clap</code> parses everything <em>almost</em> as fast not using an arg parsing library at all. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/kbknapp/fb28a49d7a0fe8b8e400">this gist comparing arg parsing methods</a> (which should be taken with a grain of salt, because the options for that CLI are decently simple).</p>
