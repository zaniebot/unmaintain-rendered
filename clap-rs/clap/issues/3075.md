# `App::about` and `Arg::help` are inconsistent

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2021-12-07 21:54_

We have `App::about`, `Arg::help` and `PossibleValue::help`.

Should these be more consistent?

See a [prior discussion](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2937) for more context

**Original Issue after epage/clapng#17**

[*Transfered from clap-rs*](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2937)

When a user "knows" what they are looking for, they browse directly to it.  As a user with clap3, when I'm looking to set the help description for an argument, I'm looking for `help` something in the `Arg` table of contents, but it wasn't there until beta.5 and its deprecated (Issue: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1823, PR: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/1840).  So in a way, https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/pull/2718 has been helping but its of limited time until the next major release.

We have conflicting needs:
- We want consistency within clap so its easier to move from one piece to another (the old `Arg::help` is analogous to `App::about`)
- We want to be clear in our terms (does `help` refer to just a help description or the entire help, especially a problem in `App`)
- We want to be discoverable
  - Which `about` hasn't been for me
  - In terms of past clap users, "do nothing" is discoverable
  - In terms of past structopt users, they don't care since they use doc comments :)
  - In terms of what people might be familiar with:
    - python's [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)'s equivalent is `App::description` and `Arg::help`
    - golang's [kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong)'s equivalent is `App::description` and `Arg::help`
    - cpp's [boost::program_option](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/doc/html/boost/program_options/option_description.html)'s equivalent is `Arg::description`
    - rust's [gumpdrop](https://docs.rs/gumdrop/0.8.0/gumdrop/)'s equivalent is `Arg::help`

The question is what do we prioritize and how should we resolve this?

*I figured a discussion would be more appropriate rather than trying to lump this in with https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2164*
