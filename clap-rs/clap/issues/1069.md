# Macro cuts arg name on hyphens

---

_Issue opened by @Keats on 2017-10-16 20:35_

### Affected Version of clap
2.26.2

### Expected Behavior Summary
An arg with a long name of `base-url` should create a `base-url` arg

### Actual Behavior Summary
The arg is called `base` in the compiled version.

### Sample Code or Link to Sample Code
```
(@subcommand build =>
       (about: "Builds the site")
        (@arg base_url: -u --base-url +takes_value "Force the base URL to be that value (default to the one in config.toml)")
)
```

Using the non-macro version of `App` does work.

This is an issue with the Rust macro system in general and not anything clap can affect (to my knowledge). The [workaround](https://docs.rs/clap/2.26.0/clap/macro.clap_app.html#shorthand-syntax-for-args) is to use `--("base-url")` which will result in `--base-url`.
