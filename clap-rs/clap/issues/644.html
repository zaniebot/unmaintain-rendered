            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My use case here is I&#x27;m making a debugger for an emulator, and I use clap as my command handler and <a href="https://github.com/murarth/linefeed">linefeed</a> as my readliner. Linefeed has a way to do tab completion in it, so it would be nice if I could get at all the subcommand/options/whatever from clap.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not against this, it just may be a while before I can get to something like this. So I&#x27;ll keep it in the issue tracker for implementation, but need to knock out some other items first.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you look at <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/26d5207728115174f39fc995707c70d5591b1929/src/completions.rs">src/completions.rs</a> there&#x27;s not inherently private about how it&#x27;s done, but exposing those methods at this time would be a messy API. Namely the <code>get_*_for_path()</code> methods are how it&#x27;s finding options, subcommands, etc. So one could almost copy/paste that into user code and get same affect until I&#x27;m able to get a good API for this.</p>
