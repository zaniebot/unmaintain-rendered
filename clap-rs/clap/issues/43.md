# Allow App names with hyphens ('-')

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-03-29 19:42_

Currently application names with a hyphen '-' get replaced with a space ' ' when displaying usage strings. This is ideal for determining subcommands, but the original application name, or subcommand name should allow '-'s.
