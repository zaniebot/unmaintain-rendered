# Missing newline at the end of help

---

_Issue opened by @mb64 on 2019-08-27 20:35_

I have the following `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    clap::App::new("app").print_help().unwrap();
}
```
It outputs no newline at the end, so the bash prompt appears like this:
```
[me@my-computer clap-test]$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
     Running `target/debug/clap-test`
app 

USAGE:
    app

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information[me@my-computer clap-test]$ 
```
Instead of:
```
[me@my-computer clap-test]$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
     Running `target/debug/clap-test`
app 

USAGE:
    app

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
[me@my-computer clap-test]$ 
```

I'm using the latest version (2.33.0).  It also happens on the playground: [here's a playground example.](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&code=fn%20main()%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20clap%3A%3AApp%3A%3Anew(%22app%22).print_help().unwrap()%3B%0A%20%20%20%20println!(%22%3C-%20there%20is%20no%20newline%20here%22)%0A%7D)

@mb64 are you still having this issue? I just checked and it works as expected. Could be something related to your shell?

This is still an issue.  It does not work as I expect, so we must have different expectations.  In terms of the raw data written to stdout by clap, I would expect it to output `... help stuff ...\n`; however, it outputs `... help stuff ...` without a final newline – neither in the playground, nor with the current master.

If you compare that to any other program, you can see that e.g. `ls` outputs with a final newline, and `rustc` outputs with two final newlines to make a blank line at the end.

The difference is like `echo -n` vs `echo` (on *nix – I don't know of any Windows equivalent).

**Edit:** I just tested it on the `v3-master` branch, and it works fine (outputs `...help stuff...\n`).

I can confirm this is fixed in `master`, so closing.

Do you have any plan to fix this issue on v2? @CreepySkeleton

No, only in v3.
