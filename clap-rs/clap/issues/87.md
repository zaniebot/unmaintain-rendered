# suggested API improvement: make `Arg::possible_values()` more flexible

_Issue opened by @Byron on 2015-04-29 15:11_

Currently it enforces the usage of `Vec<&str>`, which makes it harder to use for people who prefer different means of passing this information. They could have a statically allocated array for instance, which contains enumerations, which in turn implement `AsRef<str>` to allow a light conversion.

I suggest to have a look at [this method's signature](https://github.com/Byron/yup-oauth2/blob/master/src/device.rs#L177) which uses an iterator over items that convert into a `&str`, allowing all sorts of inputs. Internally, you can still easily create the `Vec` you require by using [`Iterator::collect()`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.collect)

Thanks for the suggestion! I'll get to work on this as this is an issue I thought about tackling with #53 I'll post back here with the changes :+1:

I just finished this, I'm committing it to master, and once I finish a few of these other issues I will bump the crates.io version.

Great, I will use it right away from master, as it helps me to get feature complete in regards to argument parsing. But for today, I am totally done, empty even :D.
