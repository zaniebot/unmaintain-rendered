            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently only one sub-command may be used per match. For example:
Assume <code>myapp</code> has two subcommands <code>one</code> and <code>two</code>, and each of those has <code>subone</code> and <code>subtwo</code> respectively.</p>
<pre><code>myapp
    |-one
    |   |-subone
    |-two
        |-subtwo
</code></pre>
<p>Meaning currently you can only run the following permutations</p>
<pre><code>$ myapp one
$ myapp one subone
$ myapp two
$ myapp two subtwo
</code></pre>
<p>This issue proposes using a <code>..</code> syntax to mean &quot;Back up one level&quot; meaning you could then add these additional permutations to valid uses</p>
<pre><code>$ myapp one ..two
$ myapp two ..one
$ myapp two subtwo ..one
$ myapp two subtwo ..one subone
$ myapp two ..one subone
$ myapp one ..two subtwo
$ myapp one subone ..two
$ myapp one subone ..two subtwo
</code></pre>
<p>This could also lead to <code>....</code> meaning up three levels or any multiple of <code>..</code> adding an additional level.</p>
<p>This will be labeled <code>maybe</code> because I'm unsure of <em>why</em> would need something like this other than combining multiple invocations of a program into a single call... I'll think on this one for a bit and see how it turns out.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is this feature still feasible with the current <code>clap</code> architecture? If so, is the proposed design the best choice?
I really need this feature and I am willing to contribute to the project. Where do I start?</p>

especially since implementing a workaround is not that easy (I tried)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For some weird reason I did not think to search issues here before posting a similar question on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ci2r3d/multiple_subcommands_with_structoptclap/</p>
<p>Does the &quot;wont do&quot; label refer to the particular way it was thought of in the OP or will there never be an option of parsing multiple subcommands?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue was from 4 years back. I'd suggest create a new issue so that we can discuss it again. Or if you wish and have time, feel free to go ahead and implement it (on v3-master)</p>
