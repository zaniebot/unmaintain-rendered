            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There seems to be other similar issue related to <code>requires</code>, but just posting this simple one which seems to have a slightly different <code>SubCommand</code> origin:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate clap;
use clap::{Arg, App, SubCommand};

fn main() {
    let app = App::new(&quot;bah&quot;)
        .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;environment&quot;)
            .short(&quot;e&quot;)
            .takes_value(true))
       .subcommand(SubCommand::with_name(&quot;query&quot;)
            .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;component&quot;)
                .required(true)
                .requires(&quot;environment&quot;)));
    let _ = app.get_matches();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>requires</code> call inside the subcommand is what&#x27;s causing the crash when you try to use the <code>query</code> subcommand on  your executable.</p>
<p>Rust 1.21.0, clap 2.27.1</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I thought it may have been related to the double require (I really wanted a <code>.requires</code> method on the <code>SubCommand</code> itself), but it seems to crash even without that. But with the double require, you can&#x27;t even view the help without it crashing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>clap treats <code>bah</code> and <code>query</code> as separate entities. There isn&#x27;t currently a way to require that a parent command&#x27;s argument was used. I would recommend either using <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.27.1/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.global"><code>Arg::global(true)</code></a> on <code>environment</code> or moving it into the <code>query</code> subcommand.</p>
<p>The <code>panic</code> is by design. If it did output the help message, this error could go undetected. <code>environment</code> doesn&#x27;t actually exist as far as <code>query</code> is concerned.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I think that makes sense. Didn&#x27;t know there was a way to push it into each subcommand with <code>global</code>, that&#x27;s a nicer solution that works. Thank you.</p>
