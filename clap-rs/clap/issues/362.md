# ArgRequiredElseHelp should take precedence over required args

---

_Issue opened by @WiSaGaN on 2015-12-17 09:26_

Currently, if we have required args present and no args are provided at run-time, clap will output an error message even if ArgRequiredElseHelp is set in the app setting.
Providing the usage without error is more friendly in this case, especially when we supply ArgRequiredElseHelp.

Thanks for taking the time to file this, I agree it should work that way. We should have this fixed and put up a new version shortly!
