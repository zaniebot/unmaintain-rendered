            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As of Clap 3.0.14, the output of clap_mangen is different on quite a few points from the <code>--help</code> output that are just confusing and don&#x27;t appear to be configurable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>[ ] The subcommand output assumes <code>command-subcommand</code> style multi-entry binaries. The help output does not, and the help output seems to be a better match for what Clap actually does right now. I don&#x27;t see any docs on getting a multi-entry binary system setup to even build such apps, much less generate the related subcommand man pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Subcommand args are not included. Given the inability to generate subcommand man pages this seems like a must. Issue #1334 is related, but for help pages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] In the man page, subcommands are <code>command &lt;subcommands&gt;</code>, in the help pages they are <code>command SUBCOMMANDS</code>. The latter appears to be configurable, but the former doesn&#x27;t follow suite. They should probably match by default and be configured together.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Version flags are not included in the man page, they are in help.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Options are in a different order. For example I have an app with <code>-h, --help</code> and <code>-d, --debug</code> flags. In the man page help is shown first, in the help output debug is shown first.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Man page suggests long args use <code>--option=OPTION</code>, help suggests <code>--option &lt;OPTION&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>[ ] Man page puts default values on same line with option, help content puts it at the end of the explanation block.</p>
</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, they are different.  <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2914">clap-rs/clap#2914</a> will allow us to reuse help generation for man pages but there was interest in getting man generation going before that.</p>
<p>Could you open individual Issues for each of these as handling disparate problems in one issue makes things harder to track?</p>

<p>We&#x27;d welcome these being opened as distinct issues in the future.</p>
