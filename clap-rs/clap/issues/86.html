            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just reopen this one to send a message :): I just tried it with the latest (the one that uses Boxes internally), and was unable to validate that this fixes the issue. The point is that the Box doesn&#x27;t make a difference here. After all, it seems rust tries to allocate one <code>App</code> structure on the stack per call that returns one, which is basically every method you call.</p>
<p>Therefore I highly recommend undoing commit e5613ec1563bfa1e6f2981fa892e5823c8184a95 as it changes the performance characteristics of the implementation, without having any positive side-effect.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please let me know.
You can also jump to the last 10 minutes of <a href="http://youtu.be/lYe--RXqNJc">this video</a> to see what I was doing to come to the conclusion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think there is anything you can do except for getting rid of the builder pattern as is. Naively I&#x27;d think returning an <code>&amp;mut App</code> would do the job, but last time I tried that I got lifetime issues. Since it was many weeks ago, it might be worth trying that again due to changed borrowchk semantics.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The original design used <code>&amp;mut App</code>, but there were issues because some items were owned and had to be transferred to the <code>ArgMatches</code> struct upon calling <code>get_matches()</code>...but this was also a while back. I&#x27;m going to re-look into the issue and see if things have changed (either with <code>clap</code> or Rust) since I last checked ;)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I changed to a borrowed builder pattern but that actually created more problems than it solved. The main issue stems from subcommands...so being that you do have a work around for the time being, I&#x27;m going to close this with a post-poned label until I can figure out another method.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for trying. Do you have the intermediate result around somewhere, maybe in a branch so I could have a look ? I was always wondering why the &amp;mut builder pattern doesn&#x27;t really work ... in C++ for instance returning references is the default way for example, and even the borrow checker should consider it safe.</p>
<p>What I see there is that one would have to store the initial App object somewhere, and then go ahead with building it:</p>
<pre><code>// something along these lines
let mut app = App::new(&quot;program&quot;);
app.about(...).arg(...).arg(...);
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yep that&#x27;s the exact issue, because subcommands are really just apps you gave to store them separately then add them to the app, so if you have a large subcommand tree it becomes far less ergonomic.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve pushed patch-86 if you want to take a look.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this will work, but only so if one is willing to drastically change the &#x27;nestability&#x27; of clap entirely.</p>
<p>For example, invocations like this ...</p>
<pre><code>let matches = App::new(&quot;MyApp&quot;)
                .version(&quot;1.0&quot;)
                .author(&quot;Kevin K. &lt;kbknapp@gmail.com&gt;&quot;)
                .about(&quot;Does awesome things&quot;)
                .args_from_usage(&quot;-c --config=[conf] &#x27;Sets a custom config file&#x27;
                                 [output] &#x27;Sets an optional output file&#x27;
                                 [debug]... -d &#x27;Turn debugging information on&#x27;&quot;)
                .subcommand(SubCommand::new(&quot;test&quot;)
                                        .about(&quot;does testing things&quot;)
                                        .arg_from_usage(&quot;[list] -l &#x27;lists test values&#x27;&quot;))
                .get_matches();
</code></pre>
<p>... would now look like this to work:</p>
<pre><code>let mut app = App::new(&quot;MyApp&quot;);
app.version(&quot;1.0&quot;)
   .author(&quot;Kevin K. &lt;kbknapp@gmail.com&gt;&quot;)
   .about(&quot;Does awesome things&quot;)
   .args_from_usage(&quot;-c --config=[conf] &#x27;Sets a custom config file&#x27;
                       [output] &#x27;Sets an optional output file&#x27;
                       [debug]... -d &#x27;Turn debugging information on&#x27;&quot;);

let mut sc = SubCommand::new(&quot;test&quot;);
sc.about(&quot;does testing things&quot;)
  .arg_from_usage(&quot;[list] -l &#x27;lists test values&#x27;&quot;);
app.subcommand(sc);

let matches = app.get_matches();
</code></pre>
<p>I would argue that that the second form is actually more readable, and is an effective means of preventing stack-related issues. After all, one would re-use the <code>let mut sc</code> binding for all subcommands, which should lead to just one additional instance of an <code>App</code> to be held on the stack at all times.</p>
<p>A strong indicator against doing that would be that most people are used to the <em>feature complete</em> builder pattern, and would thus be confused if they can&#x27;t nest at first. Also the stack-size should be great enough for 99% of the programs out there, and hurting usability for the majority of people to benefit 1% seems wrong.</p>
<p>Considering workarounds (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29937697/building-a-large-app-with-clap-causes-thread-main-has-overflowed-its-st">via Thread</a>; <a href="https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs/blob/d2a4e2ff8b16cb848869cc07b6c5a9107fb0a929/gen/youtube3-cli/src/main.rs#L9996">data-driven builder</a>) for the remaining 1% are well-defined and easy to implement, I&#x27;d also not pursue this issue further.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, because I think for the 99%, the nest-ability is easier and working I&#x27;m going to leave it as is for now. I&#x27;m going to continue looking into this though.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if it&#x27;s more to two with highly nested subcommands, than the builder pattern itself. Reason I&#x27;m thinking that is I&#x27;ve done some naive testing with several hundred &quot;builder settings&quot; with no stack overflows. So I&#x27;m also curious where the line is. I have sit some SO issues with poor recursive calls though with relatively little in the current stack frame (compared to several instances of a <code>App</code> struct). I could be totally wrong though :)</p>
<p>The one method I&#x27;ve considered adding, and perhaps I will if I get some extra time this week, is to have a separate <code>App</code> struct which uses the borrowed builder pattern. This would allow usage similar to your example, but instead of importing <code>clap::App</code>, it&#x27;d probably be something like <code>clap::bb::App</code> There&#x27;s still some portions I&#x27;d have to figure out, or move around, but if I do that, I&#x27;ll let you know here so you can test it out and see if it happens to fix the SO issues for you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see you want to achieve the best possible quality, and I&#x27;d be the last to not appreciate that, but: Does it make sense to invest time into something the fewest of us would encounter, or could easily workaround ? Maybe adding a section to the docs explaining the problem and showing solutions to it could already help.
Something I would be afraid of is the added complexity that comes with solving this 1% issue, which at least has potential to do more harm then good in the long run.
If I were you, I&#x27;d probably want to go ahead and implement interesting features, like maybe &#x27;did you mean&#x27; for subcommands and flags. Actually I wanted to have a PR ready for that yesterday, but didn&#x27;t even start working on it as my body decided to be affected by some virus or so :(. Of course I am still not fine, but try to get back into the workflow.</p>
