Clap Version
<p>3.1.15</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Usually the env <code>$SHELL</code> is something like <code>/usr/bin/bash</code> or <code>/bin/fish</code>. I want clap support this env variable. It is more convenient to use. Right now I need add some code like below before clap parse env variables.</p>
<pre><code>    env::var(&quot;SHELL&quot;).ok().map(|x| {
        PathBuf::from(x)
            .file_name()
            .map(|x| env::set_var(&quot;SHELL&quot;, x))
    });
</code></pre>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I wish clap can handle this internally, so I don&#x27;t need add this to my every project. #4296 just moved this part code into <code>FromStr</code> for <code>Shell</code> right now. It is a little ugly right now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As I said in #4296, putting this in <code>FromStr</code> is a no-go.  Instead let&#x27;s focus on the underlying needs.</p>
<p>I remember seeing an application using clap that parsed <code>SHELL</code> and then had some other logic for windows.  I&#x27;m wishing I could remember which that was as it would help provide insight into other use cases to see what else we might want to support.</p>
<p>My thinking is that we would have</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Shell::from_shell_bin(path)</code><ul>
<li>We would want to use <code>file_stem</code>, instead of <code>file_name</code>, in case thats relevant for windows support (unsure what all cygwin does)</li>
<li>We&#x27;ll probably want our own match statement in here in case there are divergences between SHELL and <code>Shell</code></li>
<li>This would return an <code>Option&lt;Shell&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Shell::from_env</code> which just calls <code>Shell::from_shell_bin(std::env::var_os(&quot;SHELL&quot;))</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If that was fd, the logic was basically &quot;if the SHELL environment variable isn&#x27;t set, and you are on windows, assume powershell&quot;.  I don&#x27;t use windows, but I think that is probably a decent assumption.  If it is in cygwin or WSL, then SHELL would probably be set.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&#x27;t think about is if  SHELL is set correctly  in  powershell on a unix-like system. I would hope it is, but I don&#x27;t actually know.</p>
<p>Should we have any fallback for any other OSes? I fairly confident SHELL is pretty reliable on linux. I think it should be reliable on Mac, but I&#x27;m not as confident there. I don&#x27;t know about more exotic systems.</p>
<p>There is also the question of what <code>Shell::from_env</code> would return. <code>Option&lt;Shell&gt;</code> would probably be simplest, but would an application want to know more details about why it failed to determine a shell (was it because SHELL wasn&#x27;t set, or because the SHELL didn&#x27;t contain a supported shell)?</p>
