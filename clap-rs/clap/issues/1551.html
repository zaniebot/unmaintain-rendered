            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Bug or Feature Request Summary</h3>
<p>I have this example use case, in my program I will be accepting 120 arguments, but no more. Ideally, I would want Clap's intelligent suggestions around them, but I don't want to type an array of 120 items, instead I want to type the 6 characters and get all their permutations generated for me. To clarify, an example program needs to accept <code>abcdef</code> passed in any order. These are fine: <code>./program --req abcdef | ./program --req bacdef</code>, but this is not fine <code>./program --req abcdefg</code> (Note that this feature request is exclusively for TOML Clap)</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>I want to be able to do this by adding one line like <code>permuations: &quot;accepted&quot;</code> or something in the similar fashion.</p>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>Now, the programmer would have to resort to filling up an array of <code>n!</code> items in TOML, which is not ideal.</p>
<hr />
<p>This use-case sounds a bit contrived, but nevertheless I believe there exist projects that can benefit from this. Please, let me know your thoughts too and thanks for working on clap.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Matelasse If you're still interested, could you please explain your use case to us? It sounds like a really rare case and I'm not sure we want to go into it.</p>
