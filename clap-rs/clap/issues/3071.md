# Migrate structopt issues

---

_Issue opened by @epage on 2021-12-07 21:47_

By taking on the code, we've likely taken on the issues already reported in the structopt repo.  We should not lose track of that by bringing the issues over here.

https://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import can help

Do we plan to run this on schedule? What's the process we want to implement?

This is mostly focused on the backlog. I am subscribed to the repo, so I can catch new issues as they arise but I'm assuming the focus will mostly shift over to here.
