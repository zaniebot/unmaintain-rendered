# Lifetime of possible values and PossibleValueParser

---

_Issue opened by @liningpan on 2022-08-07 16:47_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the [open](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues) and [rejected](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AS-wont-fix+is%3Aclosed) issues

### Rust Version

rustc 1.62.1 (e092d0b6b 2022-07-16)

### Clap Version

3.2.16

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
use clap::{command, Arg};

fn main() {
    let possible_values: Vec<&str> = vec!["abc", "def"];
    let app = command!().arg(Arg::new("example").possible_values(&possible_values));
    let matches = app.get_matches();
    println!("{:#?}", matches);
}

```

### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

I'm trying to build a dynamic command line interface, where possible options are read from a config file. This is currently possible as `.possible_values()` requires `'help` lifetime, but the new `PossibleValueParser` implementation requires `'static` lifetime. 

### Actual Behaviour

### Expected Behaviour

N/A

### Additional Context

### Debug Output

We can't add lifetimes to `PossibleValueParser` without a breaking change and on next breaking change, we're hoping to remove lifetimes completely, see https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1041.
