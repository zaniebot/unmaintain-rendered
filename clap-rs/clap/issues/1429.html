            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can't claim this to be an important issue, and cross-compiling will be the workaround....but it surprised me that this problem exists with (only among my dependencies) clap, and not with the other dependencies of my project (which are many, including serde and others).</p>
<p>So, I thought it might indicate something you'd be interested to check on?</p>
<h3>Rust Version</h3>
<p>rustc 1.32.0 (9fda7c223 2019-01-16)</p>
<h3>Affected Version of clap</h3>
<p>2.27.1</p>
<h3>Bug or Feature Request Summary</h3>
<p>I would like to build my project natively on my raspberry pi (I have done some cross-compiling from my Mac, but it would fit this project much better if I could compile everything on Pi).</p>
<p>Clap is the only dependency I have that I can't get to build on pi. It seems to just take forever or lock-up (or exhaust resources of) my pi.</p>
<h3>Expected Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>cargo build of my project succeeds</p>
<h3>Actual Behavior Summary</h3>
<p>cargo build just locks up pi and I loose ssh connection when it starts building clap
cargo build -j 1 just locks up pi and I loose ssh connection when it starts building clap</p>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce the issue</h3>
<p>Clone clap to a raspberry pi (I have tried on Zero W, plus B)
'cargo build' or 'cargo build -j 1'</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It depends on <em>which</em> Pi I try it on (on at least one it builds, on another no).
On the Zero W it exits with &quot;(signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill)&quot;, probably Out-Of-Memory I guess, but hard to tell.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, it was failing on 2.72.1 and is now fixed, so something has improved in the meantime.
closing issue.</p>
