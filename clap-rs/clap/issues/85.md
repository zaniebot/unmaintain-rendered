# Solidify API for 1.0

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-04-29 03:43_

Current API is quite verbose, I'm considering using common short names to save some key strokes and cut back on the the verbosity. Things such as `value` -> `val`, etc. There are also several method names which have several synonyms that would fit. Once this is stabilized I will start considering a 1.0 release (along with a Rust 1.0).

This would ultimately be a breaking change (if names are changed), but legacy methods will be left in until a proper deprecation period has passed.

If anyone has ideas of overly verbose method names that should be changed, let's here it :)

Main methods I'm considering are those of `ArgMatches` but those of `Arg` and `App` could also change if needed. I'm also not apposed to leaving all method names as is, I believe being too verbose is better than too short.
