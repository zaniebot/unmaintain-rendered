# Implement `#[clap(external_subcommand)]`

---

_Issue opened by @CreepySkeleton on 2020-02-04 16:19_

I'm not exporting it directly from structopt because it doesn't seem to work, but I'll get to it later.

Structopt issue: https://github.com/TeXitoi/structopt/issues/130

Chosen implementation:
```rust
enum Opt {
  #[clap(name = "known")]
  KnownCommand {
    // …
  },

  #[clap(external_subcommand)]
  Other(Vec<String>),
}
```

I tried to take it as is, it didn't work for some reason. I'll get to it a bit later, after I'll have dealt with my current list of things to do.

Yeah, was just noting it down here for future reference.
