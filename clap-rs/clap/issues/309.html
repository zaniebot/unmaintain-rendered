            <div class="timeline-body"><p>IMO this is a bit too much quoting:</p>
<pre><code>error: The following required arguments were not supplied:
        '&lt;pattern&gt;'
</code></pre>
<p>Either <code>'pattern'</code> or <code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> would be enough.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This was originally set up because of args that have spaces in them (<code>-x &lt;value&gt;...</code>, or <code>-y &lt;value1&gt; &lt;value2&gt;</code>etc.) so that people wouldn't be confused and think perhaps it's two arguments missing a <code>\n</code></p>
<p>For now, I'd say we leave the current implementation, but I'm open to opposing arguments if you can sway me :wink:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would this be printed like this:</p>
<pre><code>error: The following required arguments were not supplied:
        -x &lt;value&gt;
        -y &lt;value1&gt; &lt;value2&gt;

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've been thinking about this specifically since you mentioned it, and the more I think about it the more I agree with you. The quoting does add additional noise for little to no gain.</p>
<p>I think what I was originally &quot;worried&quot; about could otherwise be passed off as poor CLI design anyways...and I'm not sure we need to be in the business of catering to every edge case. The &quot;poor design&quot; I'm thinking of is a single positional argument with more than one value.</p>
<pre><code>error: The following required arguments were not supplied:
        &lt;pos1&gt;
        &lt;pos2_val1&gt; &lt;pos2_val2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But like I said, that's a stretch and super edge case.</p>
<p>I'll edit this title and remove quoting from certain instances tracking for 1.4.6. @birkenfeld (and all) what's your thought on quoting inside error sentences? I.e. <code>error: The argument '-a' can't be used with '-b &lt;value&gt;'</code>?</p>
