            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like tcclap is based on CLAP (C++). Both look pretty different from clap-rs. This library was a from scratch write, although it very loosely originates from clapp-py (by me) and ideas from one of Go's popular argv parser.
I'm not super familiar with the C++ world so it's hard for me to say much more about those two libraries you mention. :/</p>
