            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wanted to know how to hide a Clap CLI that I made via its <code>derive(Parser)</code> macro. So I went to docs.rs/clap-derive and searched both the tutorial and the reference for the strings &quot;hide&quot; and &quot;hidden&quot;. They didn't show up anywhere.</p>
<p>Later when searching through discussions, I found the <code>#[clap(hide = true)]</code> solution, and I was surprised it wasn't in the docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>hide</code> is a &quot;raw&quot; attribute and we do <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/index.html#terminology">suggest people look to the builder API for raw attributes</a>.</p>
<p>Improving this situation is being explored in  https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/4090</p>
<p>Closing in favor of that.</p>
