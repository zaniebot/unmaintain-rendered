            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have just came across <code>clap</code>, and the first thing I tried was to use the <code>derive(Clap)</code> feature from the README, but it seems that is not actually working, and also the README mentions <code>examples/01d_quick_example.rs</code>, which does not seem to exist.</p>
<p>My guess is that this is either a new feature, or a deprecated one, but I cannot tell which one.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a very very new feature that is work-in-progress. Don't look at those examples, they are not polished yet. Also we are about to rework the derive so it may become a little bit different from what's in the examples. Clap v3-beta will be released by the end of the month, you'll see the kind-of-final version then.  </p>
