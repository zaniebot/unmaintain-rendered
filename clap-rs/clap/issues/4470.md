# possible bug? clap 4 no longer outputting colored help when compiled with the `color` feature

_Issue opened by @EverlastingBugstopper on 2022-11-09 18:59_

Hi! I'm attempting to update a repository from clap 3 to clap 4 (https://github.com/apollographql/rover/pull/1404) and I'm noticing that the output of `cargo run -- --help` is no longer colored! I tried to manually enable the color feature, in addition to setting `ColorChoice::Always`, but the output of the help command is still grayscale.

In the docs, it looks like the only thing you can do is to _disable_ colored help output, so I'm not sure exactly what's going on!

Thanks 😄

`color` is generally a shorthand for "any terminal styling" which we are still providing.

Can you confirm that text is being bolded and underlined?  If so, then this is expected behavior though we have [issues in the 4.x milestome for customizing this](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A4.x)

Ok! I still see coloring enabled for errors and other things - the help text is bolded with no color, wasn't sure if "more neutral palette" meant "no color at all" in the changelog.

Since this is the expected behavior I'll close this issue - thanks for the quick response 😄
