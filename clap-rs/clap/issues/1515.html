            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is the plan for clap_generate? It’s currently not compatible with v3-master, hasn’t been released, and hasn’t had any activity in a year.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to find any roadmap or discussion around that crate. Would it make sense to readd that functionality to this repo?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's difficult to maintain compatibility between 2-3 projects in a way that's within our bandwidth (sadly). If you can fix the compatibility issues, we would appreciate a PR :) Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whats the motivation for keeping them separated then? It seems like an unhelpful split if it makes keeping things compatible more difficult.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@rharriso the reason it's kept separated because it was started independently of clap and better to keep them separately as it wouldn't initially depend on clap releases and hence clap won't be a bottleneck.</p>
