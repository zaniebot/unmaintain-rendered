            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is the plan for clap_generate? It’s currently not compatible with v3-master, hasn’t been released, and hasn’t had any activity in a year.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to find any roadmap or discussion around that crate. Would it make sense to readd that functionality to this repo?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s difficult to maintain compatibility between 2-3 projects in a way that&#x27;s within our bandwidth (sadly). If you can fix the compatibility issues, we would appreciate a PR :) Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whats the motivation for keeping them separated then? It seems like an unhelpful split if it makes keeping things compatible more difficult.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@rharriso the reason it&#x27;s kept separated because it was started independently of clap and better to keep them separately as it wouldn&#x27;t initially depend on clap releases and hence clap won&#x27;t be a bottleneck.</p>
