<p>Path forward</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a crate with these, and other related cargo env variables</li>
<li>Port clap over to this crate</li>
<li>Deprecate the <code>crate_*</code> macros, pointing people to that crate</li>
</ol>

<li>[X] I have searched the existing issues</li>
</ul>
Clap Version
<p>3.0.0-beta.4</p>
Describe your use case
<p>I&#x27;m proposing removing the convenience macros for getting information from <code>cargo</code> at build time. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crate_license</code></li>
<li><code>crate_version</code></li>
<li><code>crate_authors</code></li>
<li><code>crate_description</code></li>
<li><code>crate_name</code></li>
</ul>
<p>None of these utilize anything inside of <code>clap</code> and simply call out to checking environment variables that <code>cargo</code> populates at compile time.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>These would be prime candidates for spinning off into a crate dedicated to such information about Cargo. I&#x27;d actually be kind of surprised if a crate with this functionality doesn&#x27;t already exist. If one doesn&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;m not against hosting one inside the clap-rs org, but being that it&#x27;s not actually clap related this repository is probably a bad fit.</p>
<p>I propose we deprecate for v3, and remove for v4. That gives us time to either find a crate to suggest or pull these macros into one ourselves.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<ul>
<li>We keep these macros unchanged as they&#x27;re small and self contained</li>
</ul>
Additional Context
<p>I&#x27;m open to suggestions and thoughts on the matter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would agree but we use them in <code>app_from_crate!</code> and as far as I understand from looking at people creating issues about this part of the code these are really widely used for most the non-popular clis.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>app_from_crate!</code> could use whatever crate these would get spun off into so I&#x27;m not too concerned from that angle.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m more worried that because these aren&#x27;t clap related, what if people want more cargo metadata exposed? These started as just <code>crate_version!</code> but have since grown to a few more. Sure they&#x27;re not big or complex, but I think they&#x27;d fit better into a crate dedicated to that functionality.</p>
<p>I also agree they&#x27;re pretty widely used which I think adds support to us taking it slow <em>if</em> we move forward (deprecate for a while, remove in a future major release), and also adds support to us creating the crate in our org with an identical API to make the transition painless.</p>

<p>With #2835, we have replacements (builder, derive, from usage) that we can point people to as the recommended approach.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Good point. My point was just to deprecate for 3.0 like @pksunkara mentioned, but you&#x27;re correct we could deprecate anywhere in the 3.x lifetime. I&#x27;ll place this at the 3.1 milestone as a placeholder for &quot;decide on this sometime in 3.x&quot;</p>
<p>And of course we&#x27;re not locked into spinning these out, I&#x27;m open to suggestions and opinions on the matter too.</p>

<p>For context, I&#x27;m recommending in <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/2617">clap-rs/clap#2617</a> that we provide built-in transition paths for users via deprecations to streamline the upgrade process.  We can do breaking changes but ideally we have a deprecation windows first</p>

<p>IIRC, people actually use those underlying macros directly instead of <code>app_from_crate!</code> and created some issues around them.</p>

<ul>
<li>I recommend the <code>crate-ci</code> org for this</li>
<li>We should cross-link with <a href="https://github.com/ALinuxPerson/build_script">build_script</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/shadow-rs">shadow</a> for other cargo related APIs</li>
<li><code>build-env</code> and <code>cargo-env</code> names are taken.  The next best I can think of is <code>pkg-env</code>.</li>
