Clap Version
<p>4.4.7</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Imagine a CLI shipped to multiple environments (i.e. both development servers and laptops). Some features (i.e. subcommands) only make sense in one or the other environment. I&#x27;d like to <em>disable</em> (instead of hide) the irrelevant subcommands. The condition is not (cannot be) <code>const</code>.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Instead of</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Command {
    ...
    #[clap(hide = is_laptop())]
    SomeSubcommand { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;d love to write</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Subcommand)]
enum Command {
    ...
    #[clap(disable = is_laptop())]
    SomeSubcommand { ... }
}
</code></pre>
Alternatives, if applicable
<ul>
<li>Conditional compilation is not an option because the condition is not <code>const</code>. Even if it was, it&#x27;d mean we&#x27;d need conditional compilation around both the definition of the enum item, <em>and also</em> every place the enum value is used, which is not great ergonomically.</li>
<li>We could maybe split out the conditional parts into a separate struct, maybe use Builder mode, and flatten that into the main subcommands enum? Again, not great ergonomics.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A workaround for this is to conditionally</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the subcommand</li>
<li>Error if the subcommand gets activated</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its possible to do, is there a reason we need to build this in directly to clap?</p>
<p>We have to weigh</p>
<ul>
<li>Features</li>
<li>API overload (API too large to find the feature you need, creating diminishing returns for each feature we add)</li>
<li>Build time</li>
<li>Binary size</li>
</ul>
<p>This feels like a less common case such that a native solution might not be justified when balancing out these competing demands.</p>
<p>That said, I think the way I would do this is to instead focus on a <code>CommandAction</code> system like our <code>ArgAction</code> which we&#x27;ve wanted to generalize with user actions.  There is less built-in functionality to Commands so it has been a lower priority.  With user-provided actions, you could create and action that conditionally errors.  I think this would also be true if we made the validation plugin system we&#x27;ve talked about.</p>

<p>Yep, I buy that.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that&#x27;d lead to neater code than raising failures where the subcommand happens to be handled.</p>
<p>I guess it&#x27;s possible (now, explicitly; or later, in a custom action / validator) to raise a &quot;no such command&quot; error, such that this case would be mostly indistinguishable from a situation where the subcommand <em>actually</em> didn&#x27;t exist?</p>
