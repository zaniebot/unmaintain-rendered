<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>master</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have a crate where I want to wrap <code>clap</code> along with some other common utilities in a 'batteries-included' extras crate for personal use (also on crates.io as <code>qu</code>). Currently, users of the crate have to depend on <code>qu</code> and <code>clap</code>, because I cannot ask <code>clap::Parser</code> to use an alternative path to <code>clap</code>.</p>
<p><code>serde</code> get round this by having a <code>crate</code> attribute that is used instead of <code>::serde</code> when present. This allows users to do <code>#[serde(crate = ::mycrate::serde)]</code> and generate serde derives without the user having serde as a dependency.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>I'd like clap to support the <code>crate</code> attribute on the top level, and use that as the path to <code>clap</code> if present.</p>
<h3>Alternatives, if applicable</h3>
<p>Do nothing - in which case the paper-cut of having to add <code>clap</code> when using libs that generate <code>clap::Parser</code> derives.</p>
<h3>Additional Context</h3>
<p><em>No response</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In #2921 and #2258, we had decided to take a different re-export approach and not fully qualify the clap name.</p>
<p>If we are to switch our approach or support both, we should have more details of the trade offs between each.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, thanks for the links, sorry I missed them when searching.</p>
<p>So I <em>think</em> that using the approach in #2921 covers all the use cases I had in mind, apart from pathological clashes where the downstream user chooses the name <code>clap</code> for something. I'll experiment with this for a few days then close the issue/pr.</p>
