### Clap Version

master

### Where?

https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/blob/master/examples/22_stop_parsing_with_--.rs

### What's wrong?

There is code, but the feature itself/what the code is supposed to do/what the expected output is, is not documented in the code.

### How to fix?

Document what this feature is for, and what the resulting output of the code is (and maybe why).
