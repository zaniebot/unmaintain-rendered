# Complete "unknown" arguments using the `UnknownArgumentValueParser` suggestion

We can check if a flag uses `UnknownArgumentValueParser` as its value parser and include the "suggested" argument as another candidate.

The main question for this is how to access the `TypedValueParser` so it can be casted to the right type.
