# tag/release v2.33.2 in github?

---

_Issue opened by @jensim on 2020-08-06 05:11_

### Clap version

2.33.2

### Where

https://crates.io/crates/clap
https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/v2.33.2

### What's wrong

Latest 2.x.y-release 2.33.2 in crates io is not tagged in github, so i cannot directly see the release notes for it.

### How to fix

Create a GH release with release notes
