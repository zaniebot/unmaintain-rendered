This is a known issue, however there isn't a great way to solve it ergonomically for all cases in a non-breaking way. 3.x should be able to fix this.

For now you have to add `\t` manually.

```rust
	let args = App::new("cmd")
		.usage("\
\tcmd [options] --ping
\tcmd [options] --off
\tcmd (--help | --version)")
		.get_matches();
```

It looks like this is resolved.

In the changelog for clap3

> App::override_usage no longer implies a leading \t, allowing multi lined usages
