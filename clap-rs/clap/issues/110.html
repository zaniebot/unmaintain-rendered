            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <em>v0.8.0</em>, text coloring was introduced which I generally am a great fan of. Having it in usage strings seems like something I definitely want to have.</p>
<p>The first implementation of it applies it to the entire output of the usage string, which doesn&#x27;t help one to focus on what&#x27;s actually the problem.
Therefore I would recommend to use color (and/or bold text) only to highlight portions of it, like the required parameters that were missing. This could also be used to highlight suggestions in a friendly color.
Of course, a disclaimer shall be placed here that this is a somewhat cosmetical issue which is to some extend subjective. This issue is nothing more than a suggestion.</p>
<p>As a side-note, thanks for implementing everything with dependencies in a feature-gated fashion to allow an opt-out, which is what I chose as an <a href="https://github.com/Byron/google-apis-rs/commit/294da41a308e4f4125db876c5b24084ae8cfcb5f">intermediate solution</a> in my case. Generally, that&#x27;s a great practice that I will adopt were adequate as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree. Perhaps the entire string being red is a bit much. I want avoid having rainbow output though where errors are one color, suggestions another, regular out another, etc.  Perhaps a good middle ground would be the error and suggestions are red, the usage and &quot;for more information&quot; string are regularly formatted.</p>

Thanks for taking care.</p>
