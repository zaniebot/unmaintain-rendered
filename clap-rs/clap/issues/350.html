            <div class="timeline-body"><p>With <a href="https://github.com/Geal/nom">nom</a> recently reaching 1.0 I'm wondering if using would be any benefit to this project. Particularly in the test-ability, performance, and maintainability.</p>
<p>Because I'm very unfamiliar with it, but slowly reading through it, this may be slow going.</p>
<p>Perhaps initially evaluating on the <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/41bd23300de7e84d288b161073079e4fb9d49373/src/usageparser.rs">from_usage parser</a>.</p>
<p>To be clear, in order to be merged into mainline it needs to <strong>not</strong> impact performance at all (which I don't believe will be an issue), and must improve at least one of the items above.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From the one side - we can rewrite parser no <code>nom</code> and make it more clear.
From the other - <code>nom</code> is new dependency.</p>
<p>As for me - I'm pretty much for rewriting :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I understand the new dep thing, but if we can make the code more readable, concise, testable, and performant then I'm all ok using a new dep. If we can do all the above by just re-writing the parser I'm good with that too. But I would imagine handwriting a new parser might be re-implenting things already solved in<code>nom</code></p>
<p>Also <code>chomp</code> looks promising too but the fact that it's less established and pre-1.0 means I'd lean towards <code>nom</code> all things being equal.</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not really advocating using <code>nom</code> in master yet, more just testing to see if it's something we should start using.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In all honesty using an iterator in the usage parser is silly, but I guess it made sense to me when I did it. We'd probably get way better performance using a real parser, which is what I'd really like to explore. Whether that's using something like <code>nom</code> or home rolled? Let's try them both and see what looks/performs best! :smile:</p>
