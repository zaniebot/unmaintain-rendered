            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Considering the attempt for an IRC channel wasn&#x27;t all that successful. How about a more scheduled meeting? The channel remains open for any discussion at any time regardless on scheduled discussions. I have been the only member for the past 11 days.</p>
<p>I personally have nothing urgent to discuss.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I&#x27;ve been swamped with work and class lately :( I&#x27;m going to try and start idling in there more often. Weekends work best for me, but perhaps for the time being we just create an issue here to schedule a meeting (at the pre-determined time) if we have something to discuss. I.e. if there isn&#x27;t something that needs to be discussed for a week, no issue is created.</p>
