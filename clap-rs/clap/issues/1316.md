# Allow removal of the auto-generated version and help arguments

---

_Issue opened by @blinry on 2018-07-08 20:50_

I'd like to be able to use something like `app.version_short(None)` to remove the auto-generated short form of the version argument, but keep the long one.

Background: I'm developing a tool which uses `-h` for something else, and I'd like to remove `-V` for symmetry reasons, as well.

You can add an argument which uses `V` as the short, and clap won't generate the short version. If you'd like it to just be gone, you can also make that argument hidden.

i.e.

```rust
Arg::with_name("remove_ver").short("V").hidden(true);
```

That works, the only difference being that when using `-V`, there's no error message. But it seems like the best option for now. Thanks!
