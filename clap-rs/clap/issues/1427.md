### Rust Version

rustc 1.33.0 (2aa4c46cf 2019-02-28)

### Affected Version of clap

2.32.0

### Bug or Feature Request Summary

Clap should either escape special characters when printing them or allow a message to be set that is printed instead of the default.

For my case, one of my default values is a newline. I would like it to print `"\n"` in the help menu but instead it literally places a new line.

Additionally another default I have is a space. I would like that printed as `" "`.

Can we first get on board with the precise list of escape characters we want to detect? Does it mean "any unprintable character" or just something like [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character#JavaScript)?

I'm leaning very heavily to "just a small list of common ASCII escapes". I don't want to wander into unicode depths, and I doubt anyone wants unprintable unicode code points in default values anyway.
