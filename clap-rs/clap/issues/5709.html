            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>-Zrustdoc-scrape-examples</code> flag is being <a href="https://docs.rs/crate/clap/4.5.16/builds/1325757">ignored on docs.rs</a> due to rust-lang/cargo#11430, which requires users to explicitly indicate that examples which rely on dev-dependencies should be scraped. (This avoids breakage because <code>cargo doc</code> does not normally require dev-dependencies.)</p>
<p>If the maintainers still want to use this feature, you can add <code>doc-scrape-examples = true</code> to one <code>[[example]]</code> configuration, for instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[example]]
name = &quot;demo&quot;
required-features = [&quot;derive&quot;]
doc-scrape-examples = true
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I'm fixing that, I hope its realized that opt-in for this is unsustainable.  clap is a bit unique with its examples and manually specifies most.  Having to manually specify examples in all of my projects won't work.  https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6945 would help but then I still have to make sure I set this in every <code>Cargo.toml</code> in every repo I maintain.  Thats with knowing about this and I overlooked this even though I saw the PRs going through the Cargo repo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes I totally agree with the maintenance burden. My goal is to get <code>-Z rustdoc-scrape-examples</code> (or whatever it turns into once stabilized) to implicitly mean &quot;I accept that <code>cargo doc</code> will include dev-dependencies&quot;. Your comment helps me advance the case.</p>
