Clap Version
<p>4.5.4</p>
Describe your use case
<p>What if the user of myapp could access a help page in their own language?</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>For example a user could type in:</p>
<pre><code>myapp -h fr
</code></pre>
<p>to get the French version of the help page.</p>
<p>and developers of myapp would only need to add one more argument in order to add the translation like so:</p>
<pre><code>struct Cli {
    #[arg(help = &quot;Does thing&quot;, help(fr,&quot;Fait la chose&quot;))]
    thing: bool,
}
</code></pre>
Alternatives, if applicable

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We have #380 for allowing clap to be localized.</p>
<p>Switching <code>--help</code> to accepting an argument would be a breaking change for applications.  We could limit the scope to just applications that want support for more than one translation but that also means adopting translations is a breaking change.</p>
<p>I also generally view command-lines as something for state that can change run to run but I would expect this to be something to change by the user, rather than by the invocation instance, and seems like something that belongs in config.</p>
<p>This also feels like its verging on clap becoming a bespoke localization framework and I&#x27;d rather smooth out the path for people to choose what localization framework works for them.</p>
<p>With all of that, I lean towards closing this in favor of #380.  If there is a reason we should re-evaluate this, let us know!</p>
