# Add explanation for choosing between Derive and Builder APIs

---

_Issue opened by @allan2 on 2022-01-22 23:16_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Describe your use case

It's clear from the README and the Rust docs that there are two APIs.

What's unclear is which to choose, or whether it matters.

I remember when v3 was still in RC, there was an explanation that Builder is more performant and advanced. However, it is unclear whether that's still the case.


### Describe the solution you'd like

Add an explanation for the differences between the two APIs and why a dev would choose one or the other. If there is no difference, explain why there are two APIs.

Good idea!

One question will be where to put it., where are people likely to look to help steer them one way of the other.

What do you think about a new short page for section 2?
Builder API and Derive API links moved to subheadings.

2. Getting Started <-- a new short page explaining how to choose between the two APIs
    - Builder API
    - Derive API

Might be good to add a Getting Started at some point but went ahead and put it under `About` for now.  Just felt weird writing such a short page to then link out to the "real" content.
