<p>This bug was reported to ripgrep: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/616</p>
<p>Note that I don't <em>necessarily</em> think this can or should be fixed. In particular, these sorts of algorithms often involve heuristics, and making one case better may make other cases worse. Regardless, I wanted to shuffle this off to you in case there was something here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for pinging me and taking the time to file this! I've been swamped lately and haven't viewed my notifications in quite some time :smile:</p>
<p>I'm <em>pretty sure</em> this is due to the heuristics used in <a href="https://github.com/dguo/strsim-rs"><code>strsim</code></a> which is actually quite tweakable. I'm currently using a <a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/569ced1f3d7036c3d6b3090a77e64161bfe1a01c/src/suggestions.rs#L22-L26">moderately arbitrary configuration</a>, so it almost certainly can be improved. It's also code from two years ago (according to <code>git blame</code>), and <code>strsim</code> has changed and added features since then.</p>
<p>In this particular case if we discounted all matching characters in sequence, and only &quot;compared&quot; the remainder I'm sure it'd be more accurate. But I don't know if that would change other cases without a bit of testing.</p>
<p>So I'll leave this open in case someone wants to take a stab at it. Although, with the issues I've got in the backlog it'll be a low priority issue for me.</p>

<p>But yes, the issue @BurntSushi is fixed. It recommends <code>--files-without-match</code> now. Should I still write a test for this?</p>
