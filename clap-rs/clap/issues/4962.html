Clap Version

Describe your use case
<p>My GUI application has an internal shell with multiple clap::Commands. In some parts of the app I want to show a list of all commands and their descriptions, but the <code>get_about</code> method returns a <code>&amp;StyledStr</code> that won&#x27;t fit everywhere a <code>&amp;str</code> does.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>I would like a reference to the internal <code>String</code> so I can pass it to my GUI library directly instead of having to allocate a new <code>String</code> every time with <code>StyledStr.to_string()</code> or having to keep a separate copy.</p>

<p>In seeing more of your use case, I&#x27;m actually thinking a <code>as_styled_str</code> would not fill your needs.</p>
<p><code>as_styled_str</code> may included styled text which you wouldn&#x27;t want to render without converting to HTML or stripping.</p>
<p>Is there a reason you can&#x27;t just do <code>cmd.get_about().to_string()</code> and then do the relevant pass a reference to that string around?  Granted, it could run into ownership issues depending on your architecture.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, in all of this you can make the assumption within your application that the text has no ANSI formatting (for now, for derive users we might do more formatting on their behalf) but I would like to focus on solving the general use case problem before narrowing down on suggesting a hack for your specific application.</p>

<p>There&#x27;s no reason, that&#x27;s actually what I&#x27;m doing now. It just occurred to me that it&#x27;s a waste that I need to keep two copies of the same string for each command: one is separate from the command and the other is inside of it, but inaccessible. I&#x27;m assuming the Command&#x27;s internal String is not mutated to apply format to it, in which case it wouldn&#x27;t be possible to obtain a reference to the original one and this use case wouldn&#x27;t make sense anymore.</p>
