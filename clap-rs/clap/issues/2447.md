# Add support for other DSLs

---

_Issue opened by @throwaway1037 on 2021-04-20 15:12_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Describe your use case

It would be good if the programmer could use other DSLs (data serialisation langauges) other than YAML, such as RON, JSON, TOML, etc.

I would very much like to use RON or JSON instead of YAML.

### Describe the solution you'd like

There is a `ron` crate and I believe `serde` supports it.

I think DSL support should only cost compile-time and be baked into the binary, with no cost at runtime since it's essentially a declarative specification of the command-line arguments for the program.

I apologise. I searched for "support" because I expected something like "Add support for XYZ."
