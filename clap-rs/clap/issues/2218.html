            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>print_help()</code> and other similar variants conceptually just print information to some output based on the already-configured <code>App</code>, and therefore it is quite unexpected for them to be mutating the <code>App</code> and take a <code>&amp;mut self</code> reference. For a typical command-line tool which might want to print-help-and-exit deeper inside the program due to other errors not directly handled by <code>clap</code>&#x27;s argument validation, this forces <code>App</code> to be passed by <code>&amp;mut self</code> everywhere for no good apparent reason, and thereby makes other unrelated parts of the code more complex.</p>
<p>I looked at the implementation, and it seems this is due to some &quot;propagation of globals and settings&quot;, which I understand to be lazy operations which need to be done once and could have been done at another time and/or because they are conceptually not mutating the app should be hidden behind a <code>&amp;self</code> read-only reference. I might be wrong here, as I am no <code>clap</code> expert, but I see no good argument from a user standpoint as to why a print function would mutate anything.</p>

<p>I understand that how the implementation is lazily doing some ops may be a performance reason, but in my opinion that doesn&#x27;t warrant making the public interface mutable. Isn&#x27;t that precisely what interior mutability is for? I can&#x27;t find the official reference I took that from, but here&#x27;s another one : https://ricardomartins.cc/2016/06/08/interior-mutability</p>

<p>There are a few general cases that call for interior mutability, such as:
