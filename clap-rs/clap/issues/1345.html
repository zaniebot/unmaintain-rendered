            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maintainer's notes:</p>
<p>Proposed implementation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename <code>ValueType</code> to <code>ArgSource</code></li>
<li>Add a function to look up the <code>ArgSource</code></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>I've a situation where it would be nice to know whether a value has come from a default value or from an environment variable. The workaround is simple but involves rechecking the <code>ArgMatches::value_of</code> against the environment variable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd agree if the value from a configuration file is mandatory. Perhaps, though, it would be nice to have a default so it's not required in the configs?</p>
<p>In order of decreasing precedence a value can come from command line, environment, configuration file, default. If a value is set in the configuration file, a clap match will only override it if it came from the environment, not if it was a default. So it would be nice to be able to differentiate.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Serde does offer <code>#[serde(default)]</code> to use the <code>Default::default()</code> implementation as a fallback, but in this case you'd probably need to move all default values to functions that may be accessed by both <code>Default::default()</code> implementation and clap <code>default_value</code> binding.</p>
<p>But I think this would prevent the avoidance of <em>the default as a fallback from being used</em>, which may be valuable during production, I think.</p>
<hr />
<p>I agree it'd be nice to fine pick precedence between various inputs.<br />
This crate has some merging operations of structopt/clap and deserialized information, may worth take a look: https://github.com/dalance/structopt-toml</p>
