# Prompting in Clap

---

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Clap Version

master

### Describe your use case

I am writing a configuration cli, and I want that when an option is not passed, it prompts you for it. I am porting my cli from Clikt (kotkin)  to rust because clikt is slow.

### Describe the solution you'd like

like in clickt, when you define an option, you can say that when you do not provide the option, it prompts you for it. If this feature is not added in clap, could you give me a workaround please.

### Alternatives, if applicable
