            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Clap version</h3>
<p>3.0.0-beta.1</p>
<h3>Where</h3>
<p>Readme, module docs, docs.rs homepage.</p>
<h3>What's wrong</h3>
<p>All of the docs for derive appear to be in the examples folder, which you have to know is different to the main examples folder, and that it follows a different strategy. The docs for the derive module are not useful.</p>
<p>Please link https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/clap_derive/examples from everywhere. Or merge the &quot;main&quot; examples with the derive examples?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, we know about it. And about a million of other things. We will be sweeping through the documentation when the time comes, but right now we're preoccupied with other stuff to deal with.</p>
<p>I'm closing this particular issue in favor of #1652 , but if you could give us a hand and fix a link or two, we would very much appreciate it!</p>
