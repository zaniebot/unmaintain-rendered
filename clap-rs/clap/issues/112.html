            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The order is displayed correctly everywhere except &quot;suggested usage&quot; (i.e. when a typo is made and the usage string is re-generated for <em>current</em> usage). In this string it appears in alphabetical order which can be confusing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/blob/4903adde618ce7e9ce9afbdd67ab6858b6b66161/src/app.rs#768">This line</a> Should probably return a <code>BTreeMap&lt;u8, &amp;str&gt;</code> where positional arguments are first in, with index as keys, and everything else is just a <code>key_counter += 1</code>. Or just use a FIFO queue of some type.</p>
<p>... Thinking out loud.</p>
<p>Eventually (read soon), I'd like to re-look at the use of data structures throughout <code>clap</code> and see if there are more efficient choices, (i.e. using perhaps using a more standard Map and just sorting only when needed)?</p>
