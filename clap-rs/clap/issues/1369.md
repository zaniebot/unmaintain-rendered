# Allow use of global args after subcommand

_Issue opened by @stevenroose on 2018-11-01 10:09_

I can't find the `AppSetting` to allow this. 

Basically I want the top-level `App` to specify arguments that can be placed after the subcommand as well. Like if I specify `-v` for verbosity on the top level, currently I need to do `app -v command --other=42`. I want to be able to do `app command --other=42 -v`.

Whoops. Found `.global(true)`. :)
