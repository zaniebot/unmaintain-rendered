            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you look at a repo like <a href="https://github.com/ssokolow/quicktile/">this</a>, you'll notice that there's a link to the website at the end of the description. (Set via its own separate field when editing the description)</p>
<p>People used to poking around GitHub look for the website link there and, if we're tired and in a hurry, we might miss that there's a website link in the README portion of the page.</p>
<p>I don't see any link to https://clap.rs/ when I look there and it really should be added.</p>
