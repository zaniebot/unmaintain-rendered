# Allow version to be propagated globally through subcommands

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-07-15 03:45_

Another issue pointed out by [SShrike](https://github.com/SShrike), so more thanks to him! This also goes along nicely with #156  :)

If one does wish to have versions available to all subcommands, but wishes to use the same version throughout, it's tiresome to repeat `App::version(&str)` for all of them, especially if you have a lot or non-standard versions.

This issue requests an `App::global_version(bool)` which will propagate the `App::version` value down through the command hierarchy.
