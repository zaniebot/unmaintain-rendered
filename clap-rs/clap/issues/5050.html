<h3>Clap Version</h3>
<p>4.3.19</p>
<h3>Describe your use case</h3>
<p>I have a group of four arguments that repeat three different times with different names and descriptions. Right now, I have to manually duplicate the arguments with different names and descriptions, and then I manually transform each group of four back into a struct. I'd like to have a struct deriving <code>Args</code> that contains those four arguments, and flatten three copies of it into a parent struct, calling <code>mut_arg</code> on the child along the way.</p>
<p>Right now, this doesn't work because the arguments all get inserted first, and will conflict, before <code>mut_arg</code> runs.</p>
<p>Also, even if this <em>did</em> work, it'd require calling <code>mut_arg</code> four times, once for each child argument.</p>
<h3>Describe the solution you'd like</h3>
<p>Based on discussion with @epage: could we implement the combination of <code>flatten</code> and <code>mut_arg</code> in a different way, by first turning the child struct into a full standalone <code>Command</code>, <em>then</em> running the supplied <code>mut_arg</code> on that <code>Command</code>, and <em>then</em> merge the <code>Command</code> into the parent <code>Command</code>?</p>
<p>In addition, could we have a <code>mut_args</code> that runs on <em>all</em> arguments of the child struct? That'd make it easy to systematically modify <code>id</code>, <code>long</code>, and <code>help</code>, for every argument.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The overall need for flattening was brought up in #3117 but the design was deemed too complicated and rejected.</p>
<p>The thing we overlooked in our discussion over zulip which is brought up in #3117 is that we need unique <code>Arg::id</code> and changing ti behind clap_derive's back will break the <code>FromArgMatches</code> impls because they will be using the original name.</p>
<p>There are other ways that this design could be useful, like with #3221 and #3513.</p>
<p>In #3513, I was concerned about not being able to uniquify the <code>Arg::id</code> and how that might frustrate people more than not doing the feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think this gives me a way to express a thought I was having that I couldn't put into words before. Maintainership requires managing expectations. I worry that implementing this, though it helps some people, will make it harder for us to manage expectations for reusable structs and adapting this combination of features to people's needs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting. When flattening a struct into a parent struct, does the child's impl still need to be used, or could the parent become responsible for filling in the fields merged from the child using its own IDs?</p>
<p>I'm still interested in a design that would allow for flattening multiple copies of the same struct into a parent while using different argument names, IDs, help text, and potentially other changes. I'm not at all attached to any particular implementation path for doing so, though.</p>

<p>The parent would need to know the field IDs, their clap type, how to consstruct the struct, etc.</p>

<p>So far I've not been able to come up with a feasible design that can deal with how little each side knows about the other without geting into more complex (and runtime vs compile time) trait interactions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it help if flattenable structs had to do a <em>different</em> derive, like <code>derive(ArgsTemplate)</code>, and/or a different attribute than <code>flatten</code>?</p>
<p>Would it help if flattenable structs had a const-generic template parameter that augments the ID? (That has usability issues, but it seems better than nothing.)</p>
<p>Would it help if the combination of flatten and modification just always resulted in doing some things at runtime rather than compile time? At least for my use cases, a tiny bit of runtime overhead when parsing arguments would not be a problem.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Right. And it can easily get all that at runtime, but not at compile time from a separate derive...</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you mean a different derive + trait, then that is just another way of expressing the same idea of &quot;pass information at runtime&quot;.  Personally, extra trait and derive doesn't seem like the ideal way because that makes the user experience worse</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The derive would need to recognize that it should use this, on both sides.  Most likely an attribute.  We need to add attributes more related to generics (e.g. wanting to make parsing generic over the help system), just haven't decided on how to express all of that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>My more general concern is that there are a lot of these one off cases for more runtime communication between derives and being hesitant in drawing the line for where it is acceptable to do so and where to say no, so I've just always said no.</p>
<p>Without the extra trait mentioned above, we also have to be careful of compatibility, not just of trait definition changes but codegen changes for interacting with by-hand impls of the traits.</p>
<p>More specifically, whether we get the information from a generic parameter or from a runtime parameter, we need to do string joins to pass into clap which requires the <code>string</code> feature flag.  Making a derive feature like this dependent on a feature like that feels like it'd be confusing.  I also have a lot of users wanting further push down on build times and binary sizes, so I have to balance the different interests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Many subcommands in <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-sq"><code>sq</code></a> have one or more ways to designate a certificate.  This can be done by fingerprint (<code>--cert</code>), by email address (<code>--email</code>), etc.  Further some subcommands use a prefix (e.g., <code>sq encrypt</code> has <code>--recipient-cert</code>, and <code>--recipient-email</code>).  I was able to build a data structure that can select a subset of a set of known arguments, can add an optional prefix, and can be flattened into a clap subcommand.  The key is using generic types and <code>typenum</code>.  <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-sq/-/commit/16aaab33b96790c36e0ad1990e3a2050102641ad">My solution is here</a>.  You can see how it is applied to <code>sq encrypt</code> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-sq/-/commit/437ae24917b4434990d6f7a97aa9c0241d0a5628">in this commit</a>.</p>
<p>I'd be happy if the solution were a bit simpler, but I'm happy that it works.  I think something like this would also solve your problem, @joshtriplett.</p>
