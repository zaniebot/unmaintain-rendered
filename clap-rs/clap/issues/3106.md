# Result aliases cause compilation failures in rc.0

---

_Issue opened by @spire-ffoston on 2021-12-09 11:23_

### Please complete the following tasks

- [X] I have searched the [discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Rust Version

rustc 1.57.0 (f1edd0429 2021-11-29)

### Clap Version

3.0.0-rc.0

### Minimal reproducible code

```rust
use std::{error::Error};
use clap::{Parser};

type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>;

#[derive(Parser)]
enum Opts {
    Option1,
    Option2
}

fn main() {

}
```


### Steps to reproduce the bug with the above code

Attempt to compile the associated code.

### Actual Behaviour

```
error[E0107]: this type alias takes 1 generic argument but 2 generic arguments were supplied
 --> tools/src/bin/dummy.rs:7:10
  |
7 | #[derive(Parser)]
  |          ^^^^^^
  |          |
  |          expected 1 generic argument
  |          help: remove this generic argument
  |
note: type alias defined here, with 1 generic parameter: `T`
 --> tools/src/bin/dummy.rs:5:6
  |
5 | type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>>;
  |      ^^^^^^ -
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Parser` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0107`.
error: could not compile `tools` due to previous error
```

### Expected Behaviour

Compiles as expected

### Additional Context

Cargo expand shows that the generated derive macro code uses an unscoped `Result` type instead of an explicitly scoped definition.

```rust
impl clap::FromArgMatches for Opts {
    fn from_arg_matches(__clap_arg_matches: &clap::ArgMatches) -> Result<Self, clap::Error> {}
```

### Debug Output

_No response_
