# Roadmap to 3.x

---

_Issue opened by @davidMcneil on 2019-12-10 19:52_

I asked this a while back on the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/kbknapp/clap-rs). Feel free to close the issue and move further discussion there if that venue is more appropriate.

Thanks for the outstanding library! These questions are asked purely with the desire to help in getting `clap` to 3.x, and not an attempt to nag for its completion.

Is the work to get `clap` to version 3.x well-suited for community contribution? If it is something the community could help with, would it be possible to get a roadmap of outstanding work? I found the v3 tracking issue #1037. However, that seemed mostly for internal use and was last updated a while ago. I realize this is not a small ask as creating a roadmap can be substantial effort. Thanks in advance for your time!

There are 2 things that are keeping us away from a release:
- [ ] Ensure that clap-derive is compatible with clap
- [ ] Alias to subcommand (https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1603)

Sorry for the delayed response

@Dylan-DPC I think this is much longer than that :)

Yeah, I am working on triaging the issues and assigning them to 3.0 milestone and that will be the roadmap

_Comment by @CreepySkeleton on 2020-02-01 11:10_

Yeah, I'm doing thte same thing :)

I mean those are not holding back the release. Also if they are backwards compatible, the changes can be added in a minor release later.

Yeah, I agree. But I think that obvious and severe bugs must be closed prior to it, even if not breaking.

I agree. I have been trying to move as much as stuff to 3.1 milestone.

So, there are now 2 milestones [3.0.0-alpha.3](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/milestone/78) and [3.0.0](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/milestone/76) which should work as a roadmap. Please feel free to comment if you want to see some issue as part of these milestones.
