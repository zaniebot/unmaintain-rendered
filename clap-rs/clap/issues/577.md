# Correctly bubbling exit codes

---

_Issue opened by @dsoprea on 2016-07-09 02:11_

It looks like CLAP methods often return integers, which I can only assume represent exit codes, and yet any integers returned by the user-defined subcommand handlers will seemingly be ignored (with the process always returning (0)). Is there _actually_ support for the user-defined handlers to return non-zero?

Thanks.

Disregard. Wrong CLAP project.
