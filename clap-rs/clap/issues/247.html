            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These could be good additions now that we have more collaborators.</p>
<p>Homu, I&#x27;m unsure about because Github protected branches essentially do the same thing? I&#x27;m not sure what Homu would give us over protected branches (i.e. no merge until all tests pass, etc.)</p>
<p>Highfive, does an auto assign to PRs. If someone wants to re-assign (due to someone else with more knowledge on a subject, available time, etc.) comment with <code>r? @&lt;USER&gt;</code>. <strong>If a PR needs my review</strong>, please <code>r? @kbknapp</code> me so I can check it and I will :+1: when good. (for minor doc changes, examples, this <strong>isn&#x27;t</strong> really required).</p>
<p>I will also be assigning others for my own PRs so that I don&#x27;t merge anything dumb into master.</p>
<p>Todo:</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] Add Homu (...<em>maybe</em>)</li>
<li>[x] Add Highfive (his/her name is @yo-bot for those who care :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The only thing I can find that Homu may give us that we don&#x27;t already have (with protected branches and @yo-bot ) is that it won&#x27;t start CI until the PR is accepted by someone. This is a benefit, but of questionable quantity.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@homu also handles merging after checks are satisfied - while in this time, the merge may still be cancelled. And shows who approved the merge (in the git log).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think using highfive to assign PR adds to PR conversation much waste messages.
It is useful when we can aprove commits or PR using bot, when it can auto-asssign lables.</p>
<p>Also as @james-darkfox replied it is useful for email comments, but is anyone of us usign email for now?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Considering the lack of quotes and &quot;Alice said foo&quot;, would appear that none of us are using github via Email.</p>
<p>@homu can approve commits, wakes up travis to test builds, waits for travis to return status, and merges. @homu may get a bit verbose but well worth it. <strong>VERY</strong> good bot.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I use comments from email occasionally. Also yo-bot should auto assign PRs which is nice because it alerts you to a PR being filed.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll look at adding homu as well because the more I think about it, not bugging Travis until someone has accepted a PR is kind of nice. Also it should re-run Travis once aa different PR is merged to ensure there are no new conflicts.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding homu is incredibly easy. http://homu.io/ type in &quot;kbknapp/clap-rs&quot;, click register, allow application (github). Done. The harder step is setting up travis, which has already been done.</p>

<p>Just as an update. <code>@yo-bot</code> will auto-assign a random reviewer for PRs. Once a PR is good you can use the <a href="http://homu.io/">homu commands</a> to accept the PR. <strong>If the PR passes all tests, accepting will auto-merge if no changes have been made/other PRs accepted.</strong> If it&#x27;s a major change, or something that you think I&#x27;d like to review, I&#x27;d appreciate someone <code>r? @kbknapp</code>ing me first :wink: Also, you can un-accept a PR with <code>@homu r-</code> FYI</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re auto-random-selected by <code>@yo-bot</code> to review a PR, but don&#x27;t have time or someone is more well versed in whatever the PR deals with, please assign someone else for review (either via <code>r? NAME</code> or manually via github...doesn&#x27;t matter to me).</p>
<p>Hopefully these changes will put us a more streamlined path...not that there has been any problems :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:</p>
<p>Also, I&#x27;m starting some intense classes soon, so my time will be somewhat limited for a bit. But I&#x27;ll make a valiant effort to review everything and stay plugged into the conversations and decisions. If it appears I&#x27;ve missed anything, or you&#x27;ve been waiting a while for me to answer please don&#x27;t hesitate to shoot me an e-mail (or assign the issue/PR to me which will generate an e-mail).</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> @james-darkfox had a good comment in #261 regarding if I submit something and one of you are assigned as the reviewer. If it&#x27;s something I submit, and you review it saying it&#x27;s good to go you can <code>@homu r+</code> it, no need to re-assign back to me. I just want to make sure my work gets checked too :wink:</p>

<p>This is <strong>perfectly fine behavior, and expected until 2.0 is official</strong></p>
