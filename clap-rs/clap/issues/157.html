<p>If one does wish to have versions available to all subcommands, but wishes to use the same version throughout, it's tiresome to repeat <code>App::version(&amp;str)</code> for all of them, especially if you have a lot or non-standard versions.</p>
<p>This issue requests an <code>App::global_version(bool)</code> which will propagate the <code>App::version</code> value down through the command hierarchy.</p>
