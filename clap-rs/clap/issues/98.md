# Add named valued to `from_usage` methods

---

_Issue opened by @kbknapp on 2015-05-04 04:00_

To allow something like

``` rust
Arg::from_usage("[myopt] -o --opt <mode> <file> 'some help text'")
```

This would parse as
Name: `myopt`
Short: `o`
Long: `opt`
Values: `<mode> <file>`
Multiple: `false`
Required: `false`
Number of Values: `2`

Some items to be determined are how to parse when an explicit name does not precede the values (Required `true`, or `false`, use the first value for determining? Use Long as name? etc.)
