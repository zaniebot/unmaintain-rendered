Clap Version
<p>not using one myself</p>
Describe your use case
<p>Some of the existing tools use clap to parse command line options, at some point clap started using fancier formatting: colors and extra empty lines between commands. Colors used by clap look ugly in my terminal color scheme and extra empty lines make it so options that would otherwise fit on a single line easily take 2-3 pages making it harder to use.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>An environment variable that I can set globally in order to achieve <code>DisableColoredHelp</code>-like effects. And ideally a formatting like this, but without colors.  https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2906#discussioncomment-1646705</p>
<p>Bad since it uses 1/5 of the horizontal space which I have plenty and 3x as much vertical space as needed and this causes whole help to take up several pages making it annoying to write a command</p>
<pre><code>        --locked
            Require Cargo.lock is up to date

        --offline
            Run without accessing the network

</code></pre>
<p>Good, uses 3x less vertical space, uses about as much horizontal space as the previous setup, still well within 80 columns</p>
<pre><code>        --locked       Require Cargo.lock is up to date
        --offline      Run without accessing the network
</code></pre>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>NO_COLOR environment variable, setting it globally is not an option since I do want to keep it enabled.</p>
Additional Context
<p>I&#x27;m using a slightly modified color scheme and a slightly larger than usual font size.</p>

<li>Please provide more constructive feedback than something being &quot;ugly&quot;.  Why is it ugly?  Is there a way to make it not ugly?  etc</li>

<p>Hmm... Both are cosmetic things, both related to something mostly end user must deal with and don&#x27;t have any control of. But if I must pick - colors are more important to fix.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I saw it, went though everything: I even linked one of the comments myself, it doesn&#x27;t offer any solutions to a problem I&#x27;m having. There are links but none of them talks from the end user point of view.</p>

<p>That&#x27;s not really an option. In an extreme case I&#x27;m using them all and convincing everyone to get rid of the colors. Even if I succeed (which I won&#x27;t) - this renders whole coloring machinery in clap useless. Some apps could be already dead with maintainers nowhere to be seen. There are some more realistic solutions including making private or public app fork (see ormolu/fourmolu in Haskell over ability to configure some things) or doing some shell script magic that would nuke the colors for the apps I do care about.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share a point of view of someone who actually needs to read the help to understand how to use something. Authors tend to know how the thing works and use it at most as a reference.</p>

<p>With my monitor/colorscheme/glasses/color perception I need to strain my eyes to read the green part of a screenshot I linked. I can add more screenshots but without glasses/eyes/color perception it won&#x27;t help.</p>
