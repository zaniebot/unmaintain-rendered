Describe your use case
<p>Some people prefer to separate short/long/alias options with just a space:</p>
<pre><code>-h --help  show help text
</code></pre>
<p>..instead of a comma and a space:</p>
<pre><code>-h, --help  show help text
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m personally undecided which way is Better(tm) or that the difference <em>matters</em> enough to support both, but I couldn&#x27;t find any issue/discussion for it so I wanted to at least create an issue to capture any decision/rationale.</p>
Describe the solution you&#x27;d like
<p>Maybe just this issue existing as-is with a wontfix, if that&#x27;s the decision.</p>
<p>Or a boolean, somewhere. (I don&#x27;t yet have enough Rust experience to have opinions/preferences about where.)</p>
<p>Or even let people pass a custom separator string to override the <code>&quot;, &quot;</code>. For example, some people might strongly feel that two spaces (with or without a comma) improves readability even more.</p>
Alternatives, if applicable
<p>Getting over it. Having an epiphany that &quot;, &quot;-separation is better actually.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think the Rust program which is using <code>clap</code> can do anything (unless there&#x27;s more capability than I know about to monkey-patch/hook/intercept stuff)? Seems like at best someone would have to intercept the string once it has already been formatted, in a separate process, and try to delete only the correct separator commas (as opposed to any that are in the prose, such as in option descriptions).</p>
Additional Context
<p>Over the year I&#x27;ve noticed both used by command-line tools. For example, Docopt supports both - the first example on the Docopt website does space-only, the second does comma+space.</p>
<p>The tradeoffs are small either way. It can be simpler to mechanically parse the space-only way: the most basic of split-by-whitespace will do it, without needing to then check for and trim off the <code>,</code> - but any serious help-text parser would have to handle both variants anyway. It saves one character, but that only barely matters to a small minority of people who regularly use CLIs on their phones or tightly split their screen real-estate vertically.</p>
<p>The comma sometimes seems to help me with visual parsing, other times it feels like it just adds visual noise. When there&#x27;s whitespace below the comma and the characters right before it don&#x27;t poke below the line (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), the comma is visually distinct in a way that sometimes sticks out to me even when scrolling or when my eyes are focused on something else in the area. I do think that in the common/general case, the comma helps visual parsing.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that the <em>meaning</em> of a comma is extremely clear, it might help interpretation for those not yet familiar with CLI help text conventions.</p>
