            <div class="timeline-body">What&#x27;s wrong
<p>It&#x27;s been consistently being reported that our documentation is hard to navigate. Many people come to the bugtracker to ask for a feature that <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1738">is already implemented</a> or <a href="https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/1751">can be achieved by using a set of related features</a>.</p>
<p>It is apparent to me that our docs talk about &quot;what&quot; only, but they also should tell &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;. The docs.rs is mostly about <em>possibilities</em>, but what people (especially beginners) seek for is <em>applications</em> and <em>common usages</em>.</p>
<p>Examples help, but they can only cover so much. Also, examples show &quot;how&quot;, but they can hardly explain &quot;why&quot;. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to generalize a specific example further.</p>
<p>I would like to stress the &quot;beginners&quot; part here. The first thing many Rust newbies that come from other languages look for is &quot;command line parser&quot;. Obviously, they get directed here (also to <code>getopts</code>, but <code>clap</code> is the most popular choice). What they need is a guide about</p>
<ul>
<li>How to properly build your app using clap</li>
<li>Best practices</li>
<li>The features people use most (groups, subcommands, raw arguments, conflicts, requirements)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, they get a few quick examples from the Readme, a few more elaborative examples, and a <strong>big</strong> set of methods they need to <em>glue together not yet knowing how things work here</em>. This makes the learning curve even more abrupt.</p>
How to fix
<p>We need something like <a href="https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html">rust-cli book</a>, but centered on CLI args&#x27; parsing part and clap-specific.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Sweep through the readme and make it <em>shorter</em>. Readme is an advertisement, not documentation.</li>
<li>[ ] The book.</li>
<li>[ ] Cross-link mutually related methods on docs.rs. Make descriptions more elaborative.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;d rather go with something like</p>
<pre><code>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ASKED YOU QUESTION ON &lt;link to chat&gt; FIRST. 
Maintainers are few, and their mental health is fragile.
</code></pre>
<p>Or something like that. Concise, draws attention, and, <em>I hope</em>, not rude.</p>
