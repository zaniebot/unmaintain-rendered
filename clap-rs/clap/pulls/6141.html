            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an attempt to make mangen respect the display order for args. (not yet for subcommands) The implementation is minimalistic with as few changes as possible. It's probably not be quite what we want to merge, which is why I've marked it as draft.</p>
<p>The failing tests also show that currently the change reorders too much. I will probably have dig a bit deeper to understand why this happens, but maybe somebody knows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is an interesting idea to always store the arguments in sort-order.  We wouldn't want to do this on <code>push</code> though as that can be quite slow (unless we are finding the location that matches the sort order and inserting directly there').  We'd instead want to do this in <code>_build</code>.</p>
<p>The question is if this display-only decision should be made always, when most of the time the display is not being used.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, I also realised that is probably not quite what we want, so I changed it with the second commit.</p>
