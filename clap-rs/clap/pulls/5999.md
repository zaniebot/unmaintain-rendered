# feat(help): Merge lists of short and long aliases

---

_Pull request opened by @cenviity on 2025-05-11 10:35_

Short aliases are displayed before long aliases, consistent with the order of the short and long argument variants at the start of each line.

Based on [this suggestion][1] from @epage.

How about we simplify this down so that we always log the `debug!` messages and `extend` so we don't need peeking?
