# ValueEnum fallback

<!--
Thanks for helping out!

Please link the appropriate issue from your PR.

If you don't have an issue, we'd recommend starting with one first so the PR can focus on the
implementation (unless its an obvious bug or documentation fix that will have
little conversation).
-->

Would fix #5885 if `EnumValueParser` were actually using `ValueEnum::from_str` instead of apparently shipping it's own implementation here: <https://docs.rs/clap_builder/4.5.26/src/clap_builder/builder/value_parser.rs.html#1119-1135> not sure what the best remedy is... supporting fallback explicitly in the `ValueEnum` trait? or making `EnumValueParser` respect `ValueEnum::from_str`.
