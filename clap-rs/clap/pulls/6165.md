# fix(help): Correctly calculate padding for short-only args

_Pull request opened by @epage on 2025-10-29 14:13_

This manifests in two ways
- If a value is taken, we double the padding
- If `ArgAction::Count` is used, we don't account for `...` and crash

Fixes https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/6164
