# docs: Added example for figment toml config

---

_Pull request opened by @Hecatron on 2025-10-25 17:56_

Hi,
I was having a dig around the issues and discussions for clap for a way to layer a configuration via default values, then a a toml file, then clap using command line arguments (in that order)

  * https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions/2763

I've discovered one way to do this just using the derive api and figment, so I've added in an example just to show how it works. It does require using `serde_default_utils`, `serde`, `figment`
But I think this might be a common use case.
