# docs(concepts): Introduce a concept-focused document for clap

_Pull request opened by @epage on 2025-09-19 20:51_

People have requested this but its difficult to decide what is worth discussing and the structure without identifying problems that are trying to be solved by this.
In seeing #6134, I realized we can use this to address common support issues.

<!--
Thanks for helping out!

Please link the appropriate issue from your PR.

If you don't have an issue, we'd recommend starting with one first so the PR can focus on the
implementation (unless its an obvious bug or documentation fix that will have
little conversation).
