# fix(parser): Dont report missing flags as present 

---

_Pull request opened by @epage on 2025-02-11 19:31_

When we switched flags to `ArgAction::SetTrue`,
we overlooked updating `args_present`.
Because of the default value for `ArgAction::SetTrue`,
`args_present` will always report true when a flag is defined.

I went with the trivial implementation for now.  We could proactively
track this but was unsure about correctness vs overhead and so I thought
I'd have those using it pay for it.

Looking over uses on github, this will fix a couple bugs but should
otherwise be unnoticeable.

Fixes #5860
