# zsh: fix passing arguments in dynamic completion

---

_Pull request opened by @mernen on 2025-05-11 22:14_

Fixes #5979 for good.

I'm not familiar with zsh, and its completion engine is *completely* different from Bash's, but my experiments suggest it's really just a case of proper array expansion, which is more or less the same thing on both shells.
