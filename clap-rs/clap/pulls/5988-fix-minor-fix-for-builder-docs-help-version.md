# fix: minor fix for builder docs (help -> version)

---

_@cordx56_

Fixed the doc comment in the builder.
The fixed part appears to be `version`, not `help`.   

I created a PR without an associated issue because this seems to be an obvious and simple mistake. 

edited: sorry for forgetting `committed`
