# docs(tutorial): Experiment with a flat layout 

---

_Pull request opened by @epage on 2025-01-20 20:47_

With the new-ish rustdoc header sidebar, hopefully this will make this
layout easiest to deal with.

By having everything on one page, people are less likely to miss
something, especially if they use their browsers search.
