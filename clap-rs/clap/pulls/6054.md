### [`v0.1.21`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0121---2025-04-09)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.20...v0.1.21)

##### Fixed

- `Divan::skip_exact` behaved incorrectly in `v0.1.19`.

##### Changed

- Improved handling of internal code around filters and those responsible for
  sacking the people who have just been sacked have been sacked.

### [`v0.1.20`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0120---2025-04-09)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.19...v0.1.20)

##### Fixed

- `Divan::skip_regex` accidentally dropped
  [`regex_lite::Regex`](https://docs.rs/regex-lite/latest/regex_lite/struct.Regex.html)
  and behaved incorrectly in `v0.1.19`.

### [`v0.1.19`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0119---2025-04-09)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.18...v0.1.19)

##### Fixed

- \[`cargo-nextest`] no longer skips benchmarks with argument parameters (\[[#&#8203;75](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/issues/75)]).

##### Changed

- Organized positive and negative filters into a split buffer.

### [`v0.1.18`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0118---2025-04-05)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.17...v0.1.18)

##### Added

- Support for \[`cargo-nextest`] running benchmarks as tests.

- \[`prelude`] module for simplifying imports of \[`#[bench]`]\[bench\_attr],
  \[`#[bench_group]`]\[bench\_group\_attr], \[`black_box`], \[`black_box_drop`],
  \[`AllocProfiler`], \[`Bencher`], and \[`Divan`].

- Support `wasi` and `emscripten` targets.

### [`v0.1.17`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0117---2024-12-04)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.16...v0.1.17)

##### Changed

- Set \[MSRV] to 1.80 for \[`LazyLock`] and new `size_of` prelude import.

- Reduced thread pool memory usage by many kilobytes by using rendezvous
  channels instead of array-based channels.

### [`v0.1.16`](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0116---2024-11-25)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/compare/v0.1.15...v0.1.16)

##### Added

- Thread pool for reusing threads across multi-threaded benchmarks. The result
  is that when running Divan benchmarks under a sampling profiler, the
  profiler's output will be cleaner and easier to understand. (\[[#&#8203;37](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/issues/37)])

- Track the maximum number of allocations during a benchmark.

##### Changed

- Make private `Arg::get` trait method not take `self`, so that text editors
  don't recommend using it. (\[[#&#8203;59](https://redirect.github.com/nvzqz/divan/issues/59)])

- Cache `BenchOptions` using `LazyLock` instead of `OnceLock`, saving space and
  simplifying the implementation.

### [`v0.2.15`](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#0215-2025-06-13)

[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/compare/0.2.14...0.2.15)

\===================
This release fixes a bug where error values were being constructed during
parsing even in the success case. This was a regression introduced in `0.2.14`
as a result of trying to improve compilation times. Thankfully, fixing this
regression doesn't seem to meaningfully impact the amount of IR generated by
compiling Jiff.

Bug fixes:

- [#&#8203;385](https://redirect.github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/pull/385):
  Fixes a performance regression for parsing.
