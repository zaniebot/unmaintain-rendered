            <div class="timeline-body"><p>E.g. I tried running the release script at Ruff earlier and this happened (none of those &quot;PRs to my fork&quot; actually exist, the links are all 404s):</p>

<p>This is because my git remotes were set so that <code>origin</code> pointed to my fork, and <code>upstream</code> pointed to the upstream <code>Ruff</code> repo:</p>
<pre><code>(rufflease)⚡ % git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/AlexWaygood/ruff (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/AlexWaygood/ruff (push)
upstream    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff (push)
</code></pre>
