# Allow changelog for version to be updated with new pull requests in-place

---

_Issue opened by @zanieb on 2023-11-08 17:31_

If you've already editorialized a changelog and want to append any new pull requests to the relevant sections, you should be able to run `rooster changelog --write --merge`. However, the changelog update design only allows replacing an entire section for a version.
