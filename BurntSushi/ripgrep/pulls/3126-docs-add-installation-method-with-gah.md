# docs: Add installation method with gah

---

_@marverix_

Hello!
This PR adds to the documentation installation method using [gah](https://github.com/marverix/gah):
> gah is an GitHub Releases app installer, that DOES NOT REQUIRE SUDO! It is a simple bash script that downloads the latest release of an app from GitHub and installs it in ~/.local/bin. It is designed to be used with apps that are distributed as a single binary file.

I appreciate the contribution, but I don't think `gah` is popular enough for me to include in an already long list.
