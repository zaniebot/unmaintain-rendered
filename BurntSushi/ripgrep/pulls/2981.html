<p>They are the same solution. The only difference is my suggested changes include the necessary commands to install and enable to the EPEL repo. The instructions in #3124 skip that, which means any users who haven&#x27;t already installed EPEL will get an error message.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d request you use my changes for clarity.</p>

<pre><code>$ docker run -it centos:centos7.9.2009 bash
[root@4e490518fea9 /]# sudo dnf install -y ripgrep
bash: sudo: command not found
[root@4e490518fea9 /]# dnf install -y ripgrep
bash: dnf: command not found
[root@645ee29121d3 /]# yum install ripgrep

Could not retrieve mirrorlist http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&amp;arch=x86_64&amp;repo=os&amp;infra=container error was
14: curl#6 - &quot;Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error&quot;


 One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown),
 and yum doesn&#x27;t have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
 safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work &quot;fix&quot; this:

     1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.

     2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
        upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
        distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
        packages for the previous distribution release still work).

     3. Run the command with the repository temporarily disabled
            yum --disablerepo=&lt;repoid&gt; ...

     4. Disable the repository permanently, so yum won&#x27;t use it by default. Yum
        will then just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it
        again or use --enablerepo for temporary usage:

            yum-config-manager --disable &lt;repoid&gt;
        or
            subscription-manager repos --disable=&lt;repoid&gt;

     5. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
        Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
        so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
        slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
        compromise:

            yum-config-manager --save --setopt=&lt;repoid&gt;.skip_if_unavailable=true

Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: base/7/x86_64
</code></pre>
<p>So that means neither PR works for CentOS. And the status quo doesn&#x27;t seem to work either, although <code>yum</code> is at least available.</p>
<p>And for Rocky:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it rockylinux:9.3.20231119-minimal bash
bash-5.1# sudo dnf install -y ripgrep
bash: sudo: command not found
bash-5.1# dnf install -y ripgrep
bash: dnf: command not found
bash-5.1# yum
bash: yum: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>OK, so the status quo nor these PRs work here either.</p>
<p>I cannot tell whether these are problems with the docker images or with the Linux distro. I&#x27;ve worked with CentOS in production before (many many years ago), and all I remember is that it was a constant headache.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m just going to remove these Linux distros from the README. If someone can provide an authoritative source that I can trust on the recommended installation steps, I&#x27;ll be happy to revisit it.</p>

<p>Just to clarify: all you need to do is install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repo. Then you can install ripgrep. It&#x27;s literally just one extra step.</p>

<p>The <code>crb</code> repo probably isn&#x27;t necessary (it wasn&#x27;t needed on the <code>rockylinux:9.3</code> image I tested) so that could be my unnecessary addition, or it could have been necessary for whatever version I was running when I wrote the PR.</p>
<p>Either way, thank you.</p>
<p>To get ripgrep included in the base RHEL repo I think it would need to be pulled by Red Hat from (upstream) Fedora. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s very unlikely, though, since it&#x27;s already in the EPEL repo. Red Hat want to keep Enterprise Linux as trim as reasonably possible because it&#x27;s explicitly meant to be a very stable server OS.</p>
<p>EPEL is very commonly used in RHEL so it&#x27;s <em>almost</em> as good as having it in the base repo. Even common tools like emacs, htop, iftop, unrar, etc. are only found in EPEL.</p>

<p>I just said that the copr repo is no longer needed.  It made sense to include the instructions for a random copr that most people wouldn&#x27;t be familiar with.  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to duplicate the setup instructions for the most common third party repo for RHEL/CentOS systems.</p>

<p>Hi, I&#x27;m the authoritative source.  I&#x27;m an elected member of the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/epel-policy-steering-committee/">EPEL Steering Committee</a>.  I also lead the Red Hat EPEL team (part of the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cle/">CLE team</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You also need to do dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I linked to the official EPEL instructions.  The setup setup steps vary between distros and versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The crb repo probably isn&#x27;t necessary</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many packages in EPEL have dependencies in CRB.  When it&#x27;s not set up at the start, EPEL maintainers later get bogus bug reports for missing dependencies.</p>
<p>Here is verification that the combination of the official EPEL setup and #3124 work on CentOS 10.</p>

It is recommended that you run /usr/bin/crb enable to enable the CRB repository.
