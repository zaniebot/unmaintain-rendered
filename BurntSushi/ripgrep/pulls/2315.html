            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Dependabot automatically files PRs for updatable dependencies. As configured it watches all workflow files in <code>.github/workflows</code> for possible updates to any of the Actions depended upon.</p>
<hr />
<p>It also supports updating rust dependencies, but I've kept this minimal to gauge interest. See https://github.com/eminence/terminal-size/pull/42 for an example of a PR you'll also automatically receive after merging this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmm, okay, I'll give this a try, but might end up removing it if it's too noisy. I didn't know Dependabot existed for GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I do not want to enable this for Rust dependencies. I do update them occasionally, but I like to do it manually and deliberately. With Dependabot, I'll feel like I'm running in a hamster wheel. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, if you have the lock file committed, Dependabot can be a bit overwhelming. Would be great if it could be configured to submit a single PR updating all dependencies in one go to cut down on the hamster wheel a bit.</p>
<p>For Github Actions it shouldn't be particularly noisy. You'll get a few PRs initially but actions update to a new major version relatively rarely.</p>
