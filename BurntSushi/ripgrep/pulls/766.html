            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This commit adds 256-color and 24-bit truecolor support to ripgrep.
This only provides output support on ANSI terminals. If the Windows
console is used for coloring, then 256-color and 24-bit color settings
are ignored.</p>
<p>This PR is based on #452. In the interest of getting it merged, I did a bit of cleanup.  Namely, on Windows, unsupported colors are just ignored instead of falling back to white. I also improved the error reporting when attempting to parse RGB/256-color settings.</p>
<p>I did manual QA on Windows and Linux and everything seems to be working as I&#x27;d expect! Thanks @tiehuis!</p>
