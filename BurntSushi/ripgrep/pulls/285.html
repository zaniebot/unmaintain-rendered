            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi this updates docs to resolve #284, #193, #54, #75, #91, #48. Explains the combined use of <code>-g</code> and <code>--files</code> flags to replicate the <code>-g</code> option in ag/ack.</p>
<p>Looks like I used a later version of pandoc to compile the docs that perhaps did things a little differently. It complained about using sed&#x27;s <code>-i</code> flag (<code>sed: -i may not be used with stdin</code>).</p>
<p>Please let me know if any issues/suggestions from your end.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and thanks again for building ripgrep!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi thank you for your review! Made those changes. Let me know if what I did with the commit message isn&#x27;t what you meant? Also I escaped the &lt; and &gt; characters around <code>&lt;glob&gt;</code> in <code>rg.1.md</code> because it appeared that not escaping them made them not appear in <code>rg.1</code>. Please me know if this was a mistake?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@YPCrumble Looks good to me! I verified that <code>rg.1</code> looks right by running <code>man -l doc/rg.1</code>.</p>

<p>Almost. Ideally, simple PRs like this should just be a single commit. You can do this by amending your previous commit and force pushing your branch, and that commit message is what should contain <code>Fixes #284</code> in it. I just went ahead and did that for you though. Thanks again!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi got it - thanks for the explanation and making that adjustment for me. Didn&#x27;t realize I can just take a look at the docs without compiling the code. Glad to have been able to contribute!</p>
