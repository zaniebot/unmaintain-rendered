# Add `*.rake` extension to list of Ruby file types

---

_@zachahn_

Hello!

This PR adds the `.rake` extension to the Ruby type. It's a pretty common file extension in Rails apps—in my experience, the `Rakefile` is often pretty empty and only sets some stuff up while most of the code lives in various `.rake` files.
