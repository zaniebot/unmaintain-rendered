            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We currently implement globs by converting them to regexes, and in doing so, sometimes use grouping. In all but one case, we used non-capturing groups. But for alternations, we used capturing groups, which was likely just an oversight. We don&#x27;t make use of capture groups at all, and while they usually don&#x27;t have any overhead, they lead to weird cases like this one: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/1059">rust-lang/regex#1059</a></p>
<p>That particular issue is also a bug in the regex crate itself, which is fixed in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/pull/1062">rust-lang/regex#1062</a>. Note though that the bug fix in the regex crate is required. Even with this patch to globset, memory usage is reduced (by about half in rust-lang/regex#1059) but is not returned to where it was prior to the regex 1.9 release.</p>
