            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The first commit is an oversight I spotted immediately after having #239 accepted.</p>
<p>The second one is just a minor divergence between the documentation and the actual code (<a href="/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/851799f42be4409d4e2498960725e11d0514a0e7/src/args.rs#L667"><code>Args::threads()</code></a>). I'm assuming the code has the actual intended cap, as it's not too uncommon to find desktop machines with 12+ logical cores, it's still low enough not to accidentally overwhelm a modest (albeit modern) CPU, and it seems to be the more recent commit.</p>

<p>Thanks for noticing this. The docs did indeed get out of sync. Note though that the default isn't necessarily 12, it's just <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/src/args.rs#L667"><em>capped</em> at 12</a>.</p>
