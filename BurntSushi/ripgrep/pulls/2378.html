            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The underlying Rust issue<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50619">1</a> was recently re-introduced and re-fixed.
Rather than wait for a new Rust release, apply effectively the same fix
as a workaround in the ignore crate itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My PR review latency is very high, so this sort of strategy tends not to work so well unless we happen to get lucky and I see and respond to it quickly. But in this case, it looks like a few Rust releases have come out since the issue was re-fixed, so I think we can avoid bringing this in.</p>
