Please follow the style of the surrounding code and wrap to 79 columns (inclusive). If the link is too long, that's okay, but it should go on its own line. (Just follow the surrounding style.)

Also, sorry, I'm just noticing this now, but this URL has the version number in it. Could we replace it with a URL that doesn't have a version in it? Otherwise it's just going to bitrot. If there is no such URL, then I'd say to just remove it.
