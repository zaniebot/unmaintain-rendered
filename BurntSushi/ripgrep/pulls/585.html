            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This commit Fixes a bug where the <code>StandardStream</code> type isn't <code>Send</code> on
Windows. This can cause some surprising compile breakage, and the only
motivation for it being non-Send was dubious. Namely, it was a result of
trying to eliminate code duplication.</p>
<p>This refactoring also eliminates at least one &quot;unreachable&quot; panic case
that was a result of trying to eliminate code reuse, so that's a nice
benefit as well.</p>
