            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This syntax does not exist in <code>git</code>, so it is not documented in <code>man gitignore</code>. There is
a question of whether it <em>should</em> exist, but as long as it does, it should be documented
somewhere.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I&#x27;m especially interested in documenting the lack of empty alternatives, since the reason I
started looking for documentation is that I couldn&#x27;t figure out whether <code>-g .git{,/*}</code> <em>should</em>
work.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I like this syntax, but I&#x27;d prefer it if it was only valid in the command line (as opposed to ignore files), FWIW. That is, as long as having a slightly different syntax in the command line doesn&#x27;t introduce too much complexity.</p>
