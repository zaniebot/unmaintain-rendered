            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since this workflow specifies <code>runs-on: ${{matrix.os}}</code>, the <code>os</code> parameter needs to be defined for every build run.</p>
<p>Even though <code>include</code> is defined just for <code>pinned-musl</code> and <code>stable</code>, the other <code>build</code>s will still run—<code>include</code> is just saying &quot;when these parameters match existing jobs, include some additional ones&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also added <code>sudo</code> to your <code>apt-get</code> command here—when running steps directly on the VM (as opposed to Docker), you&#x27;re not running as root, and so password-less sudo can be used where needed.</p>

<p>Ahhhh, I see now. I had commented out some of the builds in order to debug and build out the CI stuff incrementally. Thank you so much for the clarification and fix!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You&#x27;re welcome! I&#x27;m working on trying to get a fully passing workflow here—I think I need to install <code>zsh</code> as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@jclem Oh I wouldn&#x27;t worry about a fully passing workflow too much. Just getting the CI running again is fantastic! There&#x27;s quite a bit more work required to move ripgrep over to GA that I still have to do anyway. :-) Thank you though!</p>
