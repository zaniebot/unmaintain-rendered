See [the Device Tree spec](https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3/source-language.html) for more information. It is basically a format that describes the hardware that can be found on systems, used mainly in embedded land to describe boards. The I in DTSI stands for "include". Linux and bootloaders contain many of those files.

**I have not tested the patch as I do not have a Rust dev environment.** Sorry about that.

Please do ask if I have forgotten any information, and thanks for the project!
