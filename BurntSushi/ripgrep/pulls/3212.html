            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was comparing the work being done by fd and find and noticed (with strace -f -c -S calls) that fd was doing a ton of failed statx calls. Upon closer inspection it was stating .jj even though I was passing --no-ignore. Eventually I turned up this check in Ignore::add_child_path that was doing stat on .jj regardless of whether the options request it.</p>
<p>With this patch it'll only stat .jj if that's relevant to the query.</p>
