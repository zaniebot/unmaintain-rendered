            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, yes it's plain text. Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p>https://github.com/rstacruz/tps_reporter/blob/master/data/sample.taskpaper</p>
<p>Here's the spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TaskPaper’s file format is fairly simple. Here’s how TaskPaper reads a file:
• Files are expected to use the UTF-8 encoding and use ‘\n’ to separate lines.
• A task is a line that begins with a hyphen followed by a space ('- ') which can
optionally be prefixed (i.e indented) with tabs or spaces. A task can have zero or
more tags anywhere on the line (not just trailing at the end).
• A project is a line that isn't a task and ends with a colon (':'), or a colon (':\n')
followed by a newline. Tags can exist after the colon, but if any non-tag text is
present, then it won’t be recognized as a project.
• A note is any line that doesn't match the task or project rules.
• Indentation level (with tabs, not spaces) defines ownership. For instance, if you
indent one task under another task, then it is considered a subtask. Tasks and
notes own all objects that are indented underneath them. Empty lines are
ignored when calculating ownership.
• A tag has the form &quot;@tag&quot;, i.e. it starts with an &quot;at&quot; character (&quot;@&quot;), followed by a
run of non-whitespace characters. A tag can optionally have a value assigned to
it. The value syntax immediately follows the tag word (no whitespace between)
and is enclosed by parentheses: '(' and ')'. The value text inside can have
whitespace, but no newlines. Here is an example of a tag with a value:
@tag(tag's value)</p>

<p>Also a lot of other applications support it:
http://support.hogbaysoftware.com/t/what-other-apps-support-taskpapers-file-format/1114</p>
<p>It comes up a lot for a search on Github (in shell aliases etc), over 133 repos and 21,409 code results:
https://github.com/search?q=taskpaper&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93</p>
<p>I think it's worthy of inclusion, in summary. Cheers!</p>
