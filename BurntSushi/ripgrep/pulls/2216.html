            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This adds installation instructions for the <a href="https://mpr.makedeb.org">makedeb Package Repository</a>, an AUR-like platform for Debian and Ubuntu based systems.</p>
<p>The MPR is a personal project of mine, but I thought it'd be helpful to include it here so people know its an option.</p>

<p>I'll note that your project page doesn't appear to load for me (note that I am behind a VPN):</p>
<pre><code>$ curl 'https://mpr.makedeb.org'
curl: (35) OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to mpr.makedeb.org:443
</code></pre>
<p>Separately from that, I personally haven't heard of the <code>makedeb</code> project before, which makes me pause before including it in the installation instructions. I'd prefer it reach a bit more of a critical mass before recommending it here. Apologies for being vague, but it is difficult not to be in such things.</p>

<p>I'm assuming it's something with your VPN, it loads just fine on my end. I'd try without it if you're still curious.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's fair enough. The MPR has about 300 packages at the moment, but makedeb itself has been growing in popularity. It's definitely more of a niche thing, as the project was only started about a year ago.</p>
<p>Thanks regardless though! I thought I'd just throw this out and see what happened.</p>
