<p>I thought it might help reduce the number of invalid/incomplete reports</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s one i put together, probably needs edited for formatting/wordiness. I don&#x27;t think you can see how it renders from this PR, so i&#x27;ve attached a screen-shot below</p>
<p>Obv the feature-request template could be converted as well if you like it</p>
<p>Possible concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>This feature is considered beta (though it&#x27;s been available for 2 years now)</li>
<li>The formatting of the file is a little weird due to interactions between YAML and GFM</li>
<li>It could be annoying for more advanced users</li>
<li>I&#x27;m not sure how scalable it is to list out common issues on the report page</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice, thank you for doing this. I didn&#x27;t even know about this feature of GitHub.</p>
<p>I will admit that I am a little unsure of doing this. I always hate filling out forms like this myself. But it&#x27;s worth a try because I spend an amazing amount of time just trying to get people to include relevant information. (Although that&#x27;s not specific to ripgrep.)</p>
