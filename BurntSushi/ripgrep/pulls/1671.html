            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I mostly wrote this code to suit my own need of an efficient way to visit all the paths matched by a glob. As such it might not be suitable for inclusion in this crate, so feel free to close this. However I thought it might be useful :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
<p>This adds <code>Glob::compile_parent_matcher</code>, which returns a regex that matches not just the globs paths, but all parent paths as well. For example the regex for the glob <code>a/b/*</code> would look something like <code>^a(?:b/(?:/.*)?)?$</code>. By using this regex as a filter in <code>walkdir</code> or similar, it will avoid traversing directories unnecessarily.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I think this is an interesting idea, but I think I'd want to consider the feature a bit more holistically before adding public APIs. I might very well circle back around to this at some point (likely not soon though). But for now, I'm going to close this.</p>
