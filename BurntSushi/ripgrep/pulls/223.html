            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This adds a new walk type in the <code>ignore</code> crate, <code>WalkParallel</code>, which
provides a way for recursively iterating over a set of paths in parallel
while respecting various ignore rules.</p>
<p>The API is a bit strange, as a closure producing a closure isn't
something one often sees, but it does seem to work well.</p>
<p>This also allowed us to simplify much of the worker logic in ripgrep
proper, where MultiWorker is now gone.</p>
