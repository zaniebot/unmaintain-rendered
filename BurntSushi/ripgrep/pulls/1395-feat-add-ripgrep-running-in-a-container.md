# Feat: add ripgrep running in a container

---

_@mbologna_

Add the instructions to run `ripgrep` in a Docker container.

Thanks, but I'd rather keep the installation instructions limited to things that have a history and will fairly reliably be updated. Maybe check back in after a few releases and we can see about putting a link to your repo then.
