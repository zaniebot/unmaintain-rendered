# Create Colour Choice struct to adjust colours depending on platform 

---

_@cetra3_

Relates to https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/96 but actually paves the way to have it configurable in the future as per this enhancement: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/51

Could expand upon this to include attributes for each of the types of colours.

I've kept the spelling american for consistency.

Could you squash this please? I think the first commit in this PR can be dropped completely.

Otherwise this looks great! Thank you. :-)
