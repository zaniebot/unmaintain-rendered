# Add vimrc to vim and vimscript types

---

_@keith_

This adds `*vimrc` to the vim and vimscript file types. Often this will
match `~/.vimrc` but given how unambiguous this is I think matching
more potential options like `~/.ideavimrc` (Intellij's vim plugin
configuration file) and others makes sense.
