            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, so you&#x27;re proposing that we have two names for the same file type. I&#x27;d like to avoid this, but we do have precedent for it, so I guess we can merge.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure if Rust will allow for this, but if there were a way to have multiple keys for each type, we could avoid having two distinct entries for it.
Probably something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>const DEFAULT_TYPES: &amp;&#x27;static [(&amp;&#x27;static [&amp;&#x27;static str], &amp;&#x27;static [&amp;&#x27;static str])] = &amp;[
  (&amp;[&quot;cs&quot;, &quot;csharp&quot;], &amp;[&quot;*.cs&quot;]),
  (&amp;[&quot;md&quot;, &quot;markdown&quot;], &amp;[&quot;*.markdown&quot;, &quot;*.md&quot;, &quot;*.mdown&quot;, &quot;*.mkdn&quot;])
]
</code></pre>
<p>If this is possible, it would also require some slight refactoring of the rg type checking module.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m actually fine with the duplication in source code for now. What concerns me more is the UX. That is, having multiple ways to refer to the same thing. (With that said, of course your suggestion is better and that looks like valid Rust to me, but it&#x27;s fine to leave it as is for now.)</p>

<p>At least the <code>Type</code> matcher itself could be made to duplicate the definitions, even if they aren&#x27;t duplicated in the source code, so I think that&#x27;s fine.</p>
