            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fixes #740</p>
<p>I ran into one issue that i didn&#x27;t consider, which is that <code>--replace</code> won&#x27;t work properly with this option (since it treats zero-width matches the same as any others). That&#x27;s kind of a shame i think (if for no other reason than it would make the unit tests more accurate), but i suppose people can use <code>sed</code> if they really need that functionality.</p>
<p>I made it override with <code>--count</code> since it seemed relatively safe and intuitive to me. Don&#x27;t feel strongly about it though.</p>
<p>Also, in hind sight maybe it&#x27;s not worth mentioning that it&#x27;s equivalent to adding a <code>^</code> pattern, since it&#x27;s just an implementation detail that isn&#x27;t really useful to anyone. Let me know if you agree and i&#x27;ll remove it.</p>
<p>Some of the changes here might conflict with #728, but only slightly if so.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm I kind of feel like <code>--passthru</code> should conflict with <code>--count</code>, no? They are somewhat mutually incompatible flags. I could be convinced though! Maybe explain this a bit more?</p>
<p>I agree with the other conflicts. Thanks for thinking about that!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I agree that we shouldn&#x27;t mention <code>^</code>. I could see the implementation changing for example to support <code>--replace</code> by implementing this flag differently. (e.g., By not modifying the regex.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess i feel like option conflict errors are pretty heavy-handed and disruptive, and they should only be used if it&#x27;s likely that the user would be confused by the behaviour otherwise;  if not, they should just override each other or be ignored.</p>
<p>In this case, i don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason to expect <code>rg --passthru -c</code> to do anything but print the count. And that&#x27;s consistent with stuff like <code>rg --line-number -c</code>, which feels similarly unambiguous to me.</p>
<p>(There is a difference here in that <code>rg -c --passthru</code> actually disables <code>-c</code>, whereas <code>rg -c --line-number</code> just ignores the <code>--line-number</code>. If we do keep the non-conflicting behaviour, i think i should actually change it so that it just checks <code>!self.is_present(&quot;count&quot;)</code> when it adds the pattern in <code>args.rs</code>.)</p>
<p>That&#x27;s my inclination, anyway — like i said, i don&#x27;t feel super strongly about it. If you aren&#x27;t feeling it i&#x27;ll change it obv</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmmm... I am conflicted. But you&#x27;re right, we already have this problem today with other flags. I&#x27;m fine with the behavior in this PR, and adding <code>!self.is_present(&quot;count&quot;)</code> sounds good.</p>
