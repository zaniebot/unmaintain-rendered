<p>OpenTofu is a community-led fork of Terraform following Hashicorp's license changes perceived as a long-term issue in general (the same kind that happened with ElasticSearch, Redis, …). It was launched by the Linux foundation and supported by quite some other actors, cf. https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-opentofu and https://opentofu.org/</p>
<p>It rely on many common files extension as such, as it wants to remain compatible (for the time being), but also have its own: https://opentofu.org/docs/language/files/</p>

<p>I'd say it's probably the case yes, although it'd need a check to be sure it doesn't skip on some specific config files (or if it doesn't matter if those are included).
I guess it'd also require checking if the type definitions here allows to write an &quot;extend&quot; where we build a type from merging another one with new entries, instead of repeating things, and that it'd anyway need another PR, making this one good for review.</p>
<p>EDIT: Reordered entries for better ordering logic.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tend to let projects languish with minimum involvement, and then when I get the time and motivation, I do as much work as I can on just that project. In the case of ripgrep, I'm working through the opened PRs. Instead of leaving feedback and waiting for folks to respond (which I try to do at all times), most PRs require very modest touchups in order to merge. So I just do it myself. And instead of opening new PRs for every single instance of this, I create one branch and &quot;roll&quot; all the PRs into that one.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/dotfiles/blob/275005b705fc42b92bfca5627ccd69e705648f7b/bin/hub-rollup">little script</a> that takes a PR number and applies the PR's commits on to my current branch. Then I touch up the commit history and so on, while preserving the original author's name.</p>
<p>Once I'm ready, I put this branch as its own PR. Once merged, it will close out all of the PRs that rolled up into it. <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1884">Here's a past example.</a></p>
