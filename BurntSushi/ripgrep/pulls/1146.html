            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>trim_right</code> method is deprecated in favor of <code>trim_end</code> for
<code>std::string::String</code> to more naturally support right-to-left
languages. The <code>trim_end</code> method was introduced in Rust 1.30.0, and the
current stable version is 1.31.1, so it feels safe to make the change
at this point in time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you, but the code churn isn't worth it at this time. I don't know whether there will be a ripgrep 0.10 patch release or not, which must continue to compile on the same Rust version as 0.10.0. Feel free to re-submit once ripgrep has bumped its minimum Rust version though!</p>
