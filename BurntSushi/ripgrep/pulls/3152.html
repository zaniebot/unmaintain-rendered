            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I believe the current stable version of Debian packages 1.85 rustc. So
if the next release of ripgrep uses a higher MSRV, then I think Debian
won't be able to package it.</p>
<p>It also turned out that I wasn't using anything from beyond Rust 1.85
anyway.</p>
<p>It's likely that I could make use of let-chains in various places, but I
don't think it's worth combing through the code to switch to them at
this point.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Quick question: why not add a <code>rust-toolchain.toml</code> file in order to avoid accidentally using the new features?</p>
<p>Is it to benefit from the newer compiler perf improvements for instance?</p>

<p>But yes, this is one reason why I always use the latest nightly.</p>
