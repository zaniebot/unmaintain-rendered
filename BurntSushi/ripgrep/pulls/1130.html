            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This should fix #1106</p>
<p>When determining if file names should be output despite --with-filename not being set explicitly the length of the paths array should be larger than 0 rather than 1 to activate file name output.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on this bug! But I don&#x27;t think this is right. <code>rg foo file</code> should not be printing the file path by default.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I obviously also didn&#x27;t call <code>cargo test</code> yesterday. This should be better. At least <code>cargo test</code> doesn&#x27;t complain locally as it would have done yesterday.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for this attempt! Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t quite right. The issue was a bit more subtle than this. See https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/a7f2d482342eb2250b5a32ee03a8fe16990228dc for more details!</p>
