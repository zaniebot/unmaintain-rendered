            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a somewhat basic implementation of <code>-f-</code> (#7), with unit tests, just to start a discussion. Your suggestions are very welcome, of course!</p>
<p>Changes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The internals of the <code>pattern</code> function have been refactored to avoid code duplication, but there's a lot more we could do.  Right now we read the entire pattern list into a <code>Vec</code>.</li>
<li>There's now a <code>WorkDir::pipe</code> command that allows sending standard input to <code>rg</code> when testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not yet implemented: aho-corasick, or any kind of sensible support for other extremely large inputs.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me get this far, and for any further suggestions!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All right, let's do this! I'll merge this one before #233 to save you some pain.</p>
<p>I don't have a release plan written down right now, but my vague thoughts are to get this, #233 and another PR fixing various color bugs merged before putting out a <code>0.3</code> release.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@emk Just a heads up, in the process of rebasing #233 I found one thing that I didn't consider during review that I just went ahead and fixed. Specifically, we should permit multiple uses of <code>-f/--file</code> <em>in combination</em> with multiple uses of <code>-e/--regexp</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @BurntSushi, just a reminder that you may want to update your <a href="http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/">blog post</a>, which says in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ripgrep doesn’t yet support searching for patterns/literals from a file, but this is easy to add and should change soon.</p>
