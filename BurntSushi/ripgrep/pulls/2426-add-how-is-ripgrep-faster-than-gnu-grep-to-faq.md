Thanks, but I'm not quite sure about this. I wrote it as a reddit comment, and I'm not really sure it fits as-is in this FAQ. Plus, the answer is _supposed_ to be addressed by my [blog post on ripgrep](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/).

Totally up to you! Reddit can just be a poor archive and having info like
this out there is great. As we saw from that mailing list.

See message above. In theory I'm not opposed to an FAQ item about this, but the answer is hard to write succinctly.
