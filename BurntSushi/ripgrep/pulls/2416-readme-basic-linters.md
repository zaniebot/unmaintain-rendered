# README - Basic Linters

---

_@Olshansk_

I cloned the repo and VSCode automatically complained about various linting issues addressed below, along with some quality-of-life improvements

- Added a Table of Contents using [VSCode's Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- Added `bash` syntax highlighting to the code snippets
- Removed `$` from code snippets so we can copy-pasta into termianl
- Fixed heading `##`

I appreciate the effort, but I don't think I want _any_ (or at least most) of the changes in this PR.
