            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It should in theory make ripgrep start slightly faster (less allocations in docopt and in the two <code>lazy_static!</code> uses within ripgrep itself), though it's in the noise for me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I don't at all buy that this has any impact on startup time. (The number of allocations perform by, say, building the regex itself is going to dwarf the one used by <code>lazy_static!</code>.) Because of that, I don't think it's worth adding a new feature for it. It will be nice once we get <code>const fn</code> on stable Rust, but we can wait for that. Thanks anyway!</p>
