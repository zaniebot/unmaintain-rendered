            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This feature solves a major reason I was skeptical of using ripgrep, so I think it’s good to mention it in the section about why one should use it.</p>
<p>I use backreferences a lot, so I had previously thought that ripgrep would provide no speed advantage over ag, since I would always have <code>-P</code> enabled. But when I saw <code>--auto-hybrid-regex</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/11.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#1100-2019-04-15">11.0.0 changelog</a>, I learned that ripgrep can use it to speed up simple queries while still allowing me to write backreferences.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Great idea! I like it.</p>
<p>Note that even when using PCRE2, ripgrep could very well be faster than ag. ripgrep's optimizations span a much broader category than just &quot;faster regex engine.&quot; :-) Plus, with ripgrep, you get proper Unicode support (even with PCRE2) by default.</p>
