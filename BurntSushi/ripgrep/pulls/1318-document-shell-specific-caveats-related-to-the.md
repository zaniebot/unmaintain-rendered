# Document shell-specific caveats related to the `--replace` flag

I ran into this issue today, so I thought it'd be nice to document it for others :smiley:

(I only noticed it because my shell highlights expanded variables thanks to [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)…)
