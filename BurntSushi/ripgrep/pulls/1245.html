            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These two should be made exclusive with each other, probably by breaking them out into a group with <code>+ '(max-column-preview)'</code> or similar</p>
<p>Also, i would suggest the description <code>show preview for long lines (with -M)</code> — that matches the wording for similar options, and might be a little clearer</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Kind of a nit-pick, but describing the affected functionality differently between the enable and disable options feels a little odd (and inconsistent with other options)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@okdana Thanks very much for your review. :-) I think everything you pointed out should be fixed! And thanks for testing the preview functionality. I'm near certain that there will be bugs there because correctly testing the color spans was more work than I wanted to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@okdana If all goes well with the max column preview, I'm contemplating turning it on by default in ripgrep 12. You were completely right about it being the &quot;expected&quot; behavior here. (I've put it in my .ripgreprc.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, actually, on reflection, do you think it should be <code>--max-columns-preview</code> (with an <code>s</code>) instead? That was the name you originally suggested in #1078, and it seems to make sense since it enables a <code>preview</code> for <code>--max-columns</code>. I'm sure you put some more thought into the name, but i thought i'd bring it up now, just in case, before it's completely set in stone</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think I thought about it too much. I just felt like <code>--max-column-preview</code> sounded better in my head. Do you like <code>--max-columns-preview</code> better?</p>
