Could you add the word "unofficial" somewhere in this text. Maybe, "there's an unofficial playground." Just so folks are clear that it isn't maintained as part of the ripgrep project.

Also, could you follow the stylistic convention of the surrounding text and wrap lines to 79 columns (inclusive)?
