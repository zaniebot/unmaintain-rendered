            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi! <a href="https://crates.io/categories">crates.io now supports categories</a>, which are a curated list
of topics aimed at helping an end-user coming to crates.io looking for
&quot;a crate to do ______&quot;.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re sending pull requests to selected crates to add categories in order to help
populate the categories and seed their usefulness. We&#x27;ve made a guess at the best
category/categories for this crate; if it doesn&#x27;t fit, please feel free to take
a look at <a href="https://crates.io/categories">all the available categories and their descriptions</a> and
<a href="https://crates.io/category_slugs">the slug values that should be specified in your Cargo.toml</a> and pick
different ones. If you have a category in mind that isn&#x27;t available, you can
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/blob/master/src/categories.toml">send a PR to this file on crates.io</a> to propose additional
categories.</p>
<p>Crates can have up to 5 categories, and uploading categories to crates.io
currently requires publishing a new version with a cargo nightly from 2017-01-18
or later (it needs to contain <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3301">this PR</a>).</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve <a href="http://integer32.com/2017/01/20/categories-and-ci-badges.html">published a blog post</a> with further details about categories.
The blog post also talks about the new crates.io support for CI badges, which
you may be interested in adding as well.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<p>Sure! Are you able to amend my commit? I&#x27;m... not 100% sure how to easily amend my commit from the UI 😊</p>
