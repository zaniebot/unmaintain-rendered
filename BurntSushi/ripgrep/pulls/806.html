            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I went through the code (and searched the WWW) to understand what the <code>intense</code> parameter does in <code>termcolor</code>. Hopefully I've captured the intent behind them to the best of my understanding.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not an ANSI expert, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">Wikipedia (see 8-bit section)</a> seems to just classify these as &quot;intense&quot; colors. I don't know where the canonical documentation is for this though.</p>
<p>I think your Windows description looks good though!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmm... I looked at the same page and got confused by the fact that the escape sequence was for 256-colors. Sorry about that. It does say that he sequence of numbers we're using (9-15) are for high intensity colors.</p>
<p>I also scoured the web and couldn't find the canonical documentation for it. 😞</p>
<p>I'll just change it to say: &quot;On Unix-like systems, this will output the ANSI escape sequence that will print a high-intensity version of the color specified.&quot; (We could use the word gaudy, which is what those colors look like to me but we probably don't want to.)</p>
<p>I understand that's a very vague description, but I cannot come up something better unfortunately.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Haha! Yes, that wording sounds good. :) If another enterprising individual can make these descriptions more precise in the future, then that's great, but these will do for now!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The macro is misleadingly named. The 'intense' colours are the standard 8 with the bold/intense parameter set (e.g., <code>\e[1;35m</code> for intense magenta), or in the 8-bit set (indexed from <code>0</code>) they are <code>8</code> through <code>15</code>. <code>write_intense!()</code> simply uses the more comprehensive foreground/background colour sequence which supports the standard 8, the intense 8, and then 240 more pre-defined colours. If you did <code>write_intense!(&quot;5&quot;)</code> you'd get non-intense magenta, and if you did <code>write_intense!(&quot;251&quot;)</code> you'd get a pre-defined medium grey. ~~I think you should even be able to do <code>write_intense!(&quot;255;0;255&quot;)</code> for 24-bit magenta, since it uses the same leading sequence.~~</p>
<p>Actually, the last part is wrong. It puts a <code>5</code> in so you can't do 24-bit. Sorry</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah basically my understanding is that on Unix &quot;intense&quot; is just another variant of a predefined color, where as on Windows it's an actual setting that is toggled on the console.</p>
