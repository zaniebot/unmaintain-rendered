            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @BurntSushi ,</p>
<p>first of all let me say that I use <code>rg</code> every day, it replaced everything else and it&#x27;s good to know to use the best of the best! Thanks you so much for making it, and even more for maintaining it!</p>
<p>Homebrew for quite some time was a black box to me! I was using it, but had no idea how to bring my own programs in. A random perusal of the <code>ripgrep</code> repository finally gave me the hints I needed to implement a tap for <a href="https://github.com/Byron/termbook"><code>termbook</code></a>.</p>
<p>After a few releases I realized that I was quite annoyed by the additional maintenance burden - now I had to wait for travis to build the binaries, download the archives, and update hashes.
Judging from you commit-history on <code>pkg/brew</code>, it&#x27;s a manual process for you, too.</p>
<p>So I thought: let&#x27;s fix this, and make it as easy as a single program invocation, fire and forget.
For <code>termbook</code> it&#x27;s just <code>make update-homebrew</code>, and for this repository, and due to a lack of a better place, it is the following:</p>
<pre><code>./ci/update-homebrew-formula.sh 0.8.1
</code></pre>
<p>The script is to be executed manually for now, and can certainly serve as basis for even more automation.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you find it useful, or if you need some changes to make it more suitable for <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I can also ask you how it&#x27;s possible to get a program into homebrew core? Is it as easy as a PR?</em></p>

<p>Yes, but they do have certain criteria. They won&#x27;t add a formula unless the software is stable, widely used, and well maintained; they often judge that based on things like GitHub star/fork counts and commit frequency. They also discourage submitting your own project, or at least they consider it a red flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I left a comment, but yeah, I might take this! I haven&#x27;t been overly burdened by updating them manually, and there is a script in the <code>ci</code> directory that gives me the sha256 sums.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think it&#x27;s more easily understood when it&#x27;s clear how I am using it.</p>
<p>My goal is to not have the feeling to have to wait for something.</p>
<p>I <code>git tag X</code> and push tags. Now travis will eventually produce the binaries, in any order. Instead of waiting around for the right time, I run <code>./ci/update-homebrew-formula.sh X</code> and just let it wait for me.</p>
<p>Eventually, after a long enough time, I go back and commit and push the updated brew file.
Something that might be useful here is to also <code>commit &amp;&amp; push</code> in the script itself, so that it is truly fire &amp; forget.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Byron Thanks for submitting this PR, I really appreciate it. :-) I think I&#x27;m just going to stick with what I have for now, but I may make improvements inspired by your work. I do admittedly like the idea of running the script and just letting it do its own thing.</p>
