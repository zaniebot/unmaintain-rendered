            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When generating completions for PowerShell, the latest version of clap will use the short parameter help.</p>
<p>PowerShell ISE, VSCode w/ the PowerShell extension, and PSReadLine 2.0.0 will all display this help when completing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure I understand this change. The <code>Cargo.lock</code> already indicates that the latest version of clap is being used.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>More like I don't understand Cargo. I made an incorrect assumption, other dependency resolvers I've worked with wouldn't have used the version I was expecting.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem harmful, but feel free to close if you don't want to merge.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah I see. Mostly, what I wanted to know is if you were observing the problem with the auto completion files even though the latest version of clap was being used.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think the idea here is that <code>Cargo.toml</code> specifies the minimum version of clap that ripgrep works with, for flexibility. With that said, CI doesn't run against the minimum version, so the numbers in the <code>Cargo.toml</code> become somewhat misleading.</p>
<p>I'm going to close this out for now, but I do expect to be bumping the minimum clap version at some point soon, since it has new features I'd like to use.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
