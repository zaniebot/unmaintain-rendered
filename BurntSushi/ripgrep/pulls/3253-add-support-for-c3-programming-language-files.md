It took me a good several minutes of hunting around to figure out whether this was an open source project or something proprietary. I generally don't include proprietary file types in the default list.

In any case, I eventually found a link to C3's repository buried on their web site, and it's only there that I found its license: https://github.com/c3lang/c3c

Can you point to any projects using C3? I've never heard of it.

@BurntSushi , You can see C3 here:  https://c3-lang.org/. and a list of projects using C3 at: https://github.com/tonis2/Awesome.c3
