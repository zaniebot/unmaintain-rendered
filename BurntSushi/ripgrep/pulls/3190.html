            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Somehow, the JSON printer seems to have never emitted correct summary
statistics. And I believe #3178 is the first time anyone has ever
reported it. I believe this bug has persisted for years. That&#x27;s
surprising.</p>
<p>Anyway, the problem here was that we were bailing out of <code>finish()</code> on
the sink if we weren&#x27;t supposed to print anything. But we bailed out
before we tallied our summary statistics. Obviously we shouldn&#x27;t do
that.</p>
<p>Fixes #3178</p>
