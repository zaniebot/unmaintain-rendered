# Add Clone / Debug instance for GitignoreBuilder and GlobsetBuilder

---

_@FlorentBecker_

The clone instance for GitignoreBuilder is useful when building a gitignore line-by-line from user input, checking that they match some file as they are added. GitignoreBuilder and GlobsetBuilder look plain enough to have a clone instance.
