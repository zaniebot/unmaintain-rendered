<p>I think I prefer this one over #962. But I'm ok with either getting merged (but we don't need both).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tmccombs Other than the fact that this PR doesn't pass CI? No. I don't have the bandwidth to review subtle ignore-related problems right now. I will not merge fixes to those bugs without first very carefully thinking through the problem (again) and the fix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tmccombs Thanks so much for working on this, but for now, I'm going to explicitly punt on fixing these bugs for now (including #962). They're generally low priority for me, and I'd like to fix them when I do a more holistic rethink of how the <code>ignore</code> crate should be structured. Right now, the invariants with respect to file paths are just all over the place and are impossible for me to reason about.</p>
<p>I'm going to close out this PR and #962 in order to keep the PR review clean and to better express my intent. I'll leave #829 and #278 open with the intent of trying to address them later.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
