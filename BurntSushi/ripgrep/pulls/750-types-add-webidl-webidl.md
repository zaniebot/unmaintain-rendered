Thanks! Mozilla actually exclusively uses that extension: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=webidl&path=

@evilpie you mean only mozilla uses that extension? because there are also lots of .idl files in there too

I mean Mozilla exclusively uses `.webidl` to mean Web IDL files. `.idl` is used for XPIDL files.
