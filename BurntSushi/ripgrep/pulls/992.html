            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Complete <code>--no-pre</code> — and then break pre/zip options apart since not all of them should be exclusive.</p>
<p>(The CI script doesn't account for completion specs that are marked with a <code>!</code>, which is why the tests didn't break when <code>--no-pre</code> was added. I could change that, but i think my concern at the time was that those 'negatory' options wouldn't always show up in the usage help. idk, probably not a big deal either way)</p>
<p>(Edit for posterity: I realised that i explained the issue backwards before: The script didn't complain about it being added because it only checks the 'top-level' options in the usage help (the ones that start a new section). It ignores the ones that are in the body of a help section. The reason it doesn't complain about them being added <em>afterwards</em> is what i explained above.)</p>
