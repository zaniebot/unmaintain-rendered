            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This updates clap to version 3.1.0 following this migration guide
https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/releases/tag/v3.0.0</p>
<p>As far as I can tell it still works the same as before and it passes all the tests.
but the tricky part is the subtle changes section and I am unsure if it still follows all the same expected behavior as before</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, sure thing!
How would I go about doing that? I tried to do <code>git rebase -i master</code> without much luck.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, rebase is the answer. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to mentor someone through that. Perhaps someone else can help?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm going to pass on this and stick with clap 2.x for now. I didn't do the upgrade to clap 3 in the first place because I knew clap 4 was just around the corner. And I'm now considering switching to lexopt.</p>
<p>In general it's a good idea to get sign off from maintainers before doing big changes/refactors like this, because I think I probably could have save you the effort.</p>
<p>Thank you for the work though. I appreciate it.</p>
