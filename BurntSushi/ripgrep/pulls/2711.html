            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem is that in Ignore::matched, the perfix &quot;./&quot; is stripped from files. In Ignore::matched_ignore, the directory path is then stripped from file paths. Now imagine we have a hidden file &quot;./.foo&quot; and pass &quot;.&quot; as the search path. &quot;./.foo&quot; gets first stripped to &quot;.foo&quot; and then it would have been stripped to &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p>I am not completely sure though whether this is the best way to fix it. One could also check earlier whether the directory path is &quot;.&quot; and then change it to &quot;./&quot;. I don't know which is the best way regarding performance; the current fix is just at the place where it breaks. What do you think?</p>
<p>The implications of this problem (at least the ones I noticed) are that when grepping (including hidden files and passing <code>.</code> as search directory) in a subdirectory <code>a/b</code> of <code>a</code>, and <code>b</code> has a hidden file <code>.foo</code>, which is ignored in a ignore file in <code>a</code>, the contents of <code>.foo</code> are shown.
I put in https://github.com/taeruh/debug_file_paths a minimal debugging example to show that.</p>
<p>Issue #829 is similar, but I am not sure about how much it is related.</p>
