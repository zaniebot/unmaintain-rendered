            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems the entry for ugrep in this table was copied-and-not-updated from the previous table. The timing measurements indicate that the correct command was measured, so I considered this the most likely command that was used.</p>
<p>I'm unable to be 100% sure obviously.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, looks like a copy &amp; paste error. I double checked the timings again and they are still correct for this particular benchmark.</p>
