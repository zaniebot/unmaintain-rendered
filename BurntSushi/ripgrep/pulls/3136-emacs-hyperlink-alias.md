Enables emacs users to have hyperlink support with named emacs hyperlink type

Thanks, but is the `emacs://` scheme something official? I couldn't find it being defined anywhere.

Yes, please include a link to some authoritative source supporting this. Because once it's added to ripgrep, removing or changing could be difficult. So it's important to be sure that this is correct.

Feel free to re-open this when there is a good source for this alias.

Hi Andrew,

Maybe we could suspend this. I'm working with the emacs community to
discuss adding this uri handler.


Sorry about the delay letting you know.

Sincerely,

Jimi
