            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This upgrades the minimum required version of Rust to 1.29 in order to fix #916 (Zombie processes cause <code>rg --files</code> to hang in <code>/proc</code>).</p>
<p>I have manually confirmed that the bug is fixed when compiling ripgrep with 1.29.</p>
<p>It's probably better to merge this just before the next release in order for the current Rust version to still be in present in the README(?).</p>

<p>Ah right yeah. Basically, to keep things sensible, I'd like to make sure any <code>0.x.y</code> releases build on the same version as the <code>0.x.0</code> release. So I won't bump the minimum Rust version until I know the next release is <code>0.11</code>.</p>
<p>I will just do that as part of the normal release process, so I'm going to close this. In theory, it could be months before a <code>0.11</code> release. :) Thank you for the reminder though and staying on top of this!</p>

<p>Ah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>ripgrep 0.10 was six days early :smile:</p>
