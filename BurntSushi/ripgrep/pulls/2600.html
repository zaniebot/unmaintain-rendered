            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We drop our MIPS target because it no longer works.<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/c788378d6fe407f4774df98a78436cea5d98525b">1</a> We were previously using it as a means of testing ripgrep in a big endian environment. So to achieve that without MIPS, we test on powerpc64 and s390x. (No particular reason to do both, but why not.)</p>
<p>We also add aarch64 as a proxy for at least ensuring everything works for the same architecture as Apple silicon. It's not a guarantee that everything works, but it seems better than nothing until we can actually test Apple silicon in CI.</p>
