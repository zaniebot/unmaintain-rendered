# ignore/types: Add scdoc

Homepage: https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc/

It's reasonably popular especially among freedesktop/wayland projects, [a github search for `*.scd` files has 48k results](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A*.scd&type=code) (which is an underestimate since these many projects in these communities are hosted on freedesktop gitlab, codeberg, sourcehut, etc.).
Not sure how much `*.scdoc` actually gets used, for comparison it only has [83 github results](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A*.scdoc&type=code), the format name is short enough that its natural to use it as an extension so it seems worth including.
