# Spelling

---

_@jsoref_

This PR corrects misspellings identified by the [check-spelling action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling).

The misspellings have been reported at https://github.com/jsoref/ripgrep/commit/6f02d056716a116b643da1de4b53c6f15118fc38#commitcomment-42625778

The action reports that the changes in this PR would make it happy: https://github.com/jsoref/ripgrep/commit/983d6fac0cac8cf37ceaa1a51a96e821fe6ab771

Note: this PR does not include the action. If you're interested in running a spell check on every PR and push, that can be offered separately.

If you did want to submit a PR that enabled the spell check action, then I'd be willing to give that a try, thanks!
