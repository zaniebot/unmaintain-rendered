            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Added option to get list of paths. I got into trouble trying to work with list of files in neovim (leaderf or other), when the list of files I wanted to search over was very long.  I believe it solves <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/273">BurntSushi/ripgrep#273</a> .</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you, but there are numerous issues with this PR as-is. The flag doesn&#x27;t follow ripgrep&#x27;s naming convention. Errors are squashed. The documentation for the flag is very insufficient. There are no tests. This also won&#x27;t handle the case of file paths that contain invalid UTF-8. And perhaps more that I haven&#x27;t noticed yet.</p>
<p>If you want to try to fix these things that would be great, but this is likely something I&#x27;ll get to eventually myself if not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the comment. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>It was quick-and-a-bit-dirty patch . I don&#x27;t really know rust (chatgpt wrote half of it) .
I see what I can do. I can improve documentation and naming, but won&#x27;t add tests. As it is just too much giving complete lack of knowledge in language, and I am busy as it is.</p>
<p>I feel like in any case it would be better to leave it up to you. But you can let me have a week and will try to get to it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I&#x27;m going to close this out. I think this PR is pretty far from what this should ideally look like. I will very likely tackle this myself at some point.</p>
