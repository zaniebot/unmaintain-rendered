            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We would like to use the ignore crate in <a href="https://github.com/servo/mozjs">mozjs_sys</a> to tell cargo to rebuild
SpiderMonkey on filesystem changes in its own sources, but we don't
want to bring crossbeam-channel and whatnot in the build for such a trivial
operation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @nox! I'm going to close this PR now for procedural reasons, but I'm not necessarily opposed to it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, are you still interested in using <code>ignore</code>? Apologies for taking so long to respond to this, but I was on a bit of a hiatus.</li>
<li>Secondly, I'm a little confused about avoiding <code>crossbeam-channel</code> here. <code>crossbeam-channel</code> is one of the lighter weight dependencies of <code>ignore</code>, and itself does not bring in much else. <code>regex</code>, <code>globset</code> and friends are much heavier. So it seems a little weird to me to go through all this trouble just to cut out <code>crossbeam-channel</code>. Maybe you could say a bit more about this?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>
