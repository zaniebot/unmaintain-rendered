            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR should provide a graceful way to clean-up after sudden interruption by user.
It relies on libary <code>clonablechild</code> to provide way to wait and kill child in parallel
I looked briefly at code but haven't found anything bad with it.</p>
<p>Decided to go with setting particular environment variable instead if hidden variable.
I believe we can choose careful variable that could ensure more or less almost 100% that there will be no collision.
This way we do not need to bother correcting clap parsing and just have modification in main function.</p>
<p>I would appreciate help in testing on linux though</p>
<p>cc @BurntSushi @seabadger</p>
<p><strong>UPD</strong>: For now it seems to bring some issues to tests as it is always reseting terminal color and therefore the extra character at the end that breaks tests</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@DoumanAsh Unfortunately, I think there are problems with this PR as-is, and I'm not sure that they are easy to solve.</p>
<p>First and foremost, if ripgrep exits successfully, then there the term colors should <em>never</em> be reset. Namely, if ripgrep runs successfully to completion, then it will have reset the colors on its own already.</p>
<p>Secondly, we shouldn't be resetting the colors if we didn't actually use them. This probably requires parsing <code>argv</code> and asking whether colors are actually going to be enabled or not, which might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we could emit colors <em>only</em> if the child is killed by <code>^C</code>, which I think should be apparent in the exit code?</p>

<p>Agree and corrected.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, at first i thought about it but then it leads us to parse CLI arguments twice...
I thought there would be no problem to just reset color anyway as it wouldn't affect terminal overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps we could emit colors only if the child is killed by ^C, which I think should be apparent in the exit code?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure whether there is any special exit code for such cases?
WinAPI docs do not mention anything about it, but in my tests Crtl-C always triggers to return code 1.
I'm not sure how reliable it is.</p>
<p><strong>UPD</strong>: We can though set flag in our handler of <code>^C</code> and determine through it whether user requested termination or not.
But it would require first to update library code as it accepts only <code>Fn</code> closures.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not quite sufficient. Even if it accepted a <code>FnMut</code> (which it could, I don't know why it doesn't), then the <code>'static</code> bound will likely thwart your efforts to mutate a reference from inside the closure. In particular, the handler is run on a different thread. Instead, you should use an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html"><code>AtomicBool</code></a>, which will work in a <code>Fn + 'static</code> bound.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi So how would you like to see solution to this problem?
As per your suggestion i moved reset to be done only when return code is non zero.
But what about initial parsing of arguments you suggested? Should i also do it? I'm a bit reluctant to do double parsing of arguments because there is no harm in resetting colors even if user requested no colors.</p>
<p>Is there something else you would like to point out?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@DoumanAsh I would like to experiment with @jethrogb's ideas in #281. I will get around to it eventually, but until then, I'd request we just hit pause on this PR unfortunately.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, that's false. If a terminal doesn't support escape codes, then I imagine the escape code might show up as visible to the end user. We shouldn't be printing color codes if the end user requested that we shouldn't.</p>
