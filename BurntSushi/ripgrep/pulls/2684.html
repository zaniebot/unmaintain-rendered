<li><p>Stop using <code>-n __fish_use_subcommand</code>. This had the effect of ignoring options if a positional argument has already been given, but that&#x27;s not how ripgrep works.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Only suggest negation options if the option they&#x27;re negating is passed (e.g., only complete <code>--no-pcre2</code> if <code>--pcre2</code> is present). The zsh completions already do this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take into account whether an option takes an argument. If an option is not a switch then it won&#x27;t suggest further options until the argument is given, e.g. <code>-C&lt;tab&gt;</code> won&#x27;t suggest options but <code>-i&lt;tab&gt;</code> will.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Suggest correct arguments for options. We already completed a fixed set of choices where available, but now we go further:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Filenames are only suggested for options that take filenames.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>--pre</code> and <code>--hostname-bin</code> suggest binaries from <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>-t</code>/<code>--type</code>/&amp;c use <code>--type-list</code> for suggestions, like in zsh, with a preview of the glob patterns:

</li>
<li><p><code>--encoding</code> uses a hardcoded list extracted from the zsh completions. This has been refactored into a separate file, and the range globs (<code>{1..5}</code>) replaced by comma globs (<code>{1,2,3,4,5}</code>) since those work in both shells. I verified that this produces the same list as before in zsh, and the same list in fish (albeit in a different order).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice thank you! I made one small change to ensure that <code>include_str!(&quot;encodings.sh&quot;)</code> is only included once. I&#x27;m not sure if the compiler would automatically de-duplicate them, so I&#x27;d just rather do it myself. I also wrapped stuff to 80 columns.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t personally test these sorts of things (well, I do test zsh because I use it), so I&#x27;m just going to merge it as-is and we can always improve it as feedback comes in.</p>

<p>I think the intent here is good but unfortunately completions aren&#x27;t &quot;config-file-aware&quot; which is kinda annoying. For example, I have <code>--max-columns-preview</code> in my <code>.ripgreprc</code> file and if I want to disable it for a particular invocation of ripgrep, now I have to type <code>--no-max-columns-preview</code> out each time.</p>

<p>I think it&#x27;s fixable by reimplementing <code>__fish_contains_opt</code>. I&#x27;ll look into that.</p>

<p>I didn&#x27;t really look at the code, and i&#x27;m not familiar with fish conventions, but this description is actually the <em>opposite</em> of how the zsh function behaves</p>
<p>In general with zsh completion you assume that if the user&#x27;s already given a flag on the command line, they probably don&#x27;t want to see other flags whose effects are exclusive with it, whether that&#x27;s direct negation like <code>--pcre2</code>/<code>--no-pcre2</code>, multi-state settings like <code>--case-sensitive</code>/<code>--ignore-case</code>/<code>--smart-case</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This assumption is built into how <code>_arguments</code> specs are defined, so most functions that use <code>_arguments</code> work that way. And i think that&#x27;s usually reasonable, though it does become annoying particularly with aliases, which zsh by default expands and interprets as if they were typed out by the user</p>
<p>As far as i know there isn&#x27;t a standard way of bypassing that behaviour when it&#x27;s not desired</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned, if the above description is accurate, this is actually not how the zsh function works, so there&#x27;s already a disconnect</p>
<p>The point about completion not being config-file-aware <em>does</em> apply to the zsh completion, but since the function can only use that information to <em>take away</em> options it would otherwise offer, i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth trying to account for it (and afaik 99% of functions don&#x27;t). Users will just sometimes see possibilities where they wouldn&#x27;t if the options were typed directly on the command line</p>
<p>I do wish i could fix the alias problem i mentioned, because it causes similar misbehaviour. e.g. if the user has <code>alias rg=&#x27;rg --pcre2&#x27;</code>, then it will not complete <code>--no-pcre2</code>, or vice versa — unless they work around it with the option <code>complete_aliases</code> and/or with manual <code>compdef</code>s, but those are arguably even more annoying. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible, though</p>
<p>Anyway, i would suggest that each function try to follow the conventions expected by its respective shell&#x27;s users, whatever that may be in fish&#x27;s case</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, I see now. I conflated that conditional handling with this feature:</p>
<pre><code>  # ripgrep has many options which negate the effect of a more common one — for
  # example, `--no-column` to negate `--column`, and `--messages` to negate
  # `--no-messages`. There are so many of these, and they&#x27;re so infrequently
  # used, that some users will probably find it irritating if they&#x27;re completed
  # indiscriminately, so let&#x27;s not do that unless either the current prefix
  # matches one of those negation options or the user has the `complete-all`
  # style set. Note that this prefix check has to be updated manually to account
  # for all of the potential negation options listed below!
  if
    # We also want to list all of these options during testing
    [[ $_RG_COMPLETE_LIST_ARGS == (1|t*|y*) ]] ||
    # (--[imnp]* =&gt; --ignore*, --messages, --no-*, --pcre2-unicode)
    [[ $PREFIX$SUFFIX == --[imnp]* ]] ||
    zstyle -t &quot;:completion:${curcontext}:&quot; complete-all
  then
    no=
  fi
</code></pre>
<p>zsh&#x27;s behavior is indeed very different from what I implemented.</p>
<p>Fish completions commonly omit negation flags entirely. At least that&#x27;s what the completions for curl and HTTPie do. Making them conditional seems better than that, and once it&#x27;s config-aware I don&#x27;t see significant downsides.</p>
<p>Hiding them unless the user has entered a prefix (like the above) is possible but definitely unconventional for fish completions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aye okay, I agree that it makes sense to do the conventional thing for each shell. That makes the most sense to me in terms of what users are going to expect.</p>
<p>I defer to Fish users to implement what is conventional though.</p>

<p>Parsing the config file and inserting its contents into <code>argv</code> is really trivial (at least it would be in the zsh function), but keep in mind that actually getting the config path can only work some of the time. e.g. if you do (assume the fish equivalents here)</p>
<pre><code>% export RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config
% rg -&lt;TAB&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>then it&#x27;s no problem, the completion function has access to that value, but if you do</p>
<pre><code>% RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=$mypath/config rg -&lt;TAB&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>it won&#x27;t work reliably because your completion function can&#x27;t just unilaterally execute the user&#x27;s variable expansions and command substitutions, and maybe can&#x27;t even see that assignment in the first place (zsh functions can&#x27;t afaik)</p>
<p>In zsh, this possibility is basically ignored. But it&#x27;s not that common to use environment variables to suppress completion possibilities in zsh functions. And the ripgrep FAQ does explicitly mention that second construction as a way to pass the config-file path, so i thought i should mention</p>
<p>You would also need to pre-check the command line for <code>--no-config</code> ofc</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s unconventional for zsh as well. I just kind of made it up tbh. Would be fine from a convention perspective to change or get rid of it, if someone wanted</p>
