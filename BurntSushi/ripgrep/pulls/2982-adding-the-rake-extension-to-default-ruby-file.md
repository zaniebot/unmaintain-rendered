# Adding the .rake extension to default Ruby file types

---

_@melopilosyan_

Rake can read from [multiple `.rake` files](https://github.com/ruby/rake/blob/master/doc/rakefile.rdoc#label-Multiple+Rake+Files) other than the `Rakefile` (already listed). And they are widely used in Ruby projects.

Let's also include the `.rake` extension for completeness.
