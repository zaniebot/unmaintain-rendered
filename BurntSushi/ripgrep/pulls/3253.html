            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It took me a good several minutes of hunting around to figure out whether this was an open source project or something proprietary. I generally don't include proprietary file types in the default list.</p>
<p>In any case, I eventually found a link to C3's repository buried on their web site, and it's only there that I found its license: https://github.com/c3lang/c3c</p>
<p>Can you point to any projects using C3? I've never heard of it.</p>
