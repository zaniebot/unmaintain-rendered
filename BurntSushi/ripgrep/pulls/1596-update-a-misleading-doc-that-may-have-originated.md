# Update a misleading doc that may have originated from a bad copy/paste

---

_@andysalerno_

It seems like `fn walker_parallel` in `core/args.rs` has a documentation copy/pasted from the `fn walker` above it.  Updated the documentation to be (IMO) more accurate.

It's my first contribution -- apologies if I'm not following some convention.
