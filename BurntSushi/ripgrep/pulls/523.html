            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The primary motivation for this commit was rust-lang/cargo#4189 where dropping a
<code>wincolor::Console</code> would call <code>CloseHandle</code> to close the console handle. Cargo
creates a few <code>Console</code> instances so it ended up closing stdout a little
earlier as intended!</p>
<p>The <code>GetStdHandle</code> function returns handles I believe aren't intended to be
closed (as there's no refcounting). I believe libstd doesn't close these
handles.</p>
<p>This commit also moves to calling <code>GetStdHandle</code> on demand which libstd changed
to doing so recently as well, preventing caching of stale handles that change
over time with calls to <code>SetStdHandle</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All right, I buy it!</p>
<p>I feel like there was a reason why I wasn't re-creating the console, but my guess is that it was an attempt at a premature optimization.</p>
