@matkoniecz Even though you've approved the PR, "First-time contributors need a maintainer to approve running workflows." One more thing for you to click, it seems.

I am not a maintainer (Github hints at this by showing my approval as gray, not green, also I lack "maintainer"/"owner" badge similar to your "author" badge).
