            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There was no short option for <code>--hidden</code>, I assume because <code>-H</code> is already taken by <code>--with-filename</code> from the original <code>grep</code>, and <code>-h</code> should always be <code>--help</code>.</p>
<p>The fact is, a lot of times when searching recursively in a directory, <code>--hidden</code> is needed to show files that start with an <code>.</code> (dot).</p>
<p>So doesn&#x27;t it make sense to use a dot for the short flag?
<code>rg -. PATTERN</code>.</p>
<p>The only software I&#x27;m aware that uses <code>-.</code> is <code>feh</code>, however there seems to be no semantic relation with the dot itself, in contrast with <code>ripgrep</code>&#x27;s.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey, thanks for the great software, I&#x27;ll understand if think that this flag is weird, it was also weird for me at first glance, so no hard feelings if you just decline it :smiley: .</p>
<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if <code>-.</code> is portable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I like the cleverness of this, but I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about it. It pushes my weirdness budget, personally. I am potentially in favor of having a short flag for <code>--hidden</code>, although personally, I tend to use <code>-uu</code> instead. However, this does have the side effect of also ignoring gitignore files, which I suppose may be undesirable. But usually if I want to search hidden files, I&#x27;m probably wanting to search things in gitignore too.</p>
<p>As far as portable, <code>-.</code> wouldn&#x27;t have any technical issues with being portable. With that said, using a leading <code>.</code> to indicate that a file is hidden is a Unix convention, and I don&#x27;t know how Windows users would feel about it. (On Windows, a file being hidden is I think an actual attribute of the file&#x27;s metadata.)</p>
<p>@okdana What are your thoughts on this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>-a</code> is the closest thing to a standard for this, but obv that&#x27;s taken. <code>-.</code> isn&#x27;t a portability issue for <code>rg</code> itself (as long as you continue to use an argument-processing library that supports it), but it&#x27;s possible that some external software like wrapper scripts and completion functions might not handle it well? I&#x27;m pretty sure zsh will, don&#x27;t know about bash, fish, or anything Windows-related. <code>.</code> isn&#x27;t special to any shell, though, afaik, so it does have that going for it.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s definitely a logic to it, but it&#x27;s weird. And it sets a precedent.</p>

<p>I assume that everything will work with <code>zsh</code>, <code>bash</code> and <code>fish</code>, I also tried searching for <a href="https://github.com/derf/feh">feh</a> issues with the <code>-.</code> flag in the whole git history and issues/PRs sections, and I found nothing, but again, I know nothing about the <code>Windows</code> side of it :disappointed: .</p>

<p>I personally think that offering a short flag as an extra option of usage will always be better than not offering a short flag option at all, if <code>unix</code> users can use it and enjoy it, that&#x27;s a great thing.</p>
<p>It would be even better if someone could figure out a better option that could satisfy all the user base, however I&#x27;m out of ideas (I would suggest something with <code>clap</code>&#x27;s short options aliases, but... this feature does not exist yet, weird).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I&#x27;m still a little unsure, I decided to accept this. I like the connection between <code>-.</code> and hidden files, even though it is a bit Unixy.</p>
