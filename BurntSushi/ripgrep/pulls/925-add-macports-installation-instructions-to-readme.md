# Add MacPorts installation instructions to README

---

_@ylluminarious_

I just saw the recent addition of BSD installation instructions to the README file. So I thought, what the heck, why not add installation instructions for Macports as well?  :smiley:

This is a tiny change, so I think it should be okay to merge.

Could you please wrap this to 79 columns inclusive? If the URL is too long, then just put the `[...](...)` on its own line.

Thanks for adding this! I didn't know ripgrep was available in MacPorts. I have one small formatting nit.
