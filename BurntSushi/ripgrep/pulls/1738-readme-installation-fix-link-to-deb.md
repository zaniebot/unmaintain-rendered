# README: installation: fix link to .deb

---

_@tleb_

Small fix, updating the `.deb` link in the install commands. Also, a `.deb` can be installed using `apt install ./foo.deb`, should this be recommended instead?

I don't know..? I don't change things for the sake of change. If you have a compelling reason to change it, then please open a new PR and we can consider it.
