            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A few issues here.
It seems to fail a test in CI because the QEMU version is old and it does not support ARM very well.</p>
<p>There are at least a few ways to fix this(that I can think of):</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no QEMU ppa - so, either it is created by someone(I personally don't know how) or have a precompiled QEMU archive be downloaded.</li>
<li>Switch the ARM build to another CI, like Azure Pipelines and have it there run on a newer version of Linux?</li>
<li>Disable some tests on ARM(cfg over some tests)?</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross"><code>cross</code></a> also supports running tests in QEMU through a newer Dockerfile(QEMU from Ubuntu 18.04).
<code>ripgrep</code> should probably switch to that in order to support a lot more targets.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I don't know when (or if) I'll get a chance to dig into this. Honestly, it is <em>not</em> a goal of mine to support lots of targets. Every target added means a higher chance of something going wrong in the release process that I have to debug, and the release process is already laborious enough. If people really want ARM binaries, then they'll need to setup their own infrastructure for building them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm unfortunately going to close this. I just don't have the bandwidth to maintain releases for more targets. Sorry. If you wanted to maintain this on your own in a separate repo, and it was kept up to date, I would be willing to link it from the README.</p>
