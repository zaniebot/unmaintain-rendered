            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Snaps are a new application packaging approach that allows for better isolation. This PR introduces a snapcraft.yaml file that allows building ripgrep snaps using the <a href="http://snapcraft.io">snapcraft</a> tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm. I'm honestly not sure when I should merge this or not. I know that at least as of right now, I have a hard enough time maintaining the brew formula (I'm not a Mac user), so I worry that this will bitrot easily. In particular, I've never used or heard of this tool.</p>
<p>Is there an established way of maintaining snaps out-of-tree? I think that's what I would prefer at the moment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tasdomas @BurntSushi Since snapcraft (the snap package builder) can pull source from git it can live out-of-tree. I was actually trying out building a snap package today before I saw this pull request :)</p>
<p>I believe the only change required to the yml file would be the following.</p>
<pre><code>parts:
  rg:
    plugin: rust
    source: git://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
    source-tag: 0.2.6

</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also, i'm not sure how common is it for snap packages to be used outside of Ubuntu for now, but I guess now they offer installation on arch, fedora and opensuse so that should cover a lot of different flavors!</p>
