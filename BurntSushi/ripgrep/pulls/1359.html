            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but since I am not involved in the Scala community, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable merging this. Firstly, this is a breaking change. Breaking changes are themselves fine, but I always want to be judicious about them. Secondly, I don&#x27;t know whether this is the right change or not.</p>
<p>Could you perhaps gather opinions from folks in the Scala community about whether this is okay or not?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think filter only sbt files is a very useful feature, since there can be a lot of these files in large Scala projects. How do you feel about adding <code>*.sbt</code> back to Scala file type, and just add the new <code>sbt</code> type?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@MaT1g3R I&#x27;m not quite sure how I feel about it. It is very easy to just write <code>-g &#x27;*.sbt&#x27;</code> (or define your own file type via an alias or <code>.ripgreprc</code>). ripgrep generally doesn&#x27;t have file types for every possible build system within every programming language, and I&#x27;m not sure if I want to start that precedent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since <code>gradle</code> is grouped under groovy, I think it&#x27;s reasonable that <code>sbt</code> is its own file type, since <code>sbt</code> is more of a programming language than a config file.</p>
<p>Adding this change will introduce the file type to other programs like <code>fd</code>. <code>fd</code> doesn&#x27;t seems to be configured via <code>.ripgreprc</code> (It would be weird if it did)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m going to close this because I haven&#x27;t received any credible guidance on whether removing <code>sbt</code> from the Scala type is appropriate or not.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d probably be okay with having a separate <code>sbt</code> type that overlaps with <code>scala</code>.</p>
