# File types: add Crystal and Kotlin + expand Perl + Ruby

---

_@chocolateboy_

This PR adds support for two new file types:

* [Crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal)
* [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin)

And adds a few common filename patterns to two existing file types:

* Perl
* Ruby
