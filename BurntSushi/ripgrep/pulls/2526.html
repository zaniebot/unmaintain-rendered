            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR resulted in a quite big MSRV bump (to 1.70.0) - given that this crate is still on the 2018 edition, was this intentional? 1.70.0 is <em>very</em> recent (it's the current stable Rust).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep tracks the latest stable release. It's documented in the README and this policy was decided based on feedback from distro maintainers: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1019</p>
<p>The specific edition is mostly irrelevant. It's a detail that will eventually get changed, but it doesn't necessarily change in concert with everything else unless it needs to be. I maintain dozens of crates. I don't always keep MSRV and edition updated in synchronous lockstep. It's just too much to keep track of.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And honestly, the security warnings from github about <code>atty</code> are just absurd. It would have been great if @softprops could have just released a new version of <code>atty</code> to squash those, but that isn't what happened. There's the <code>is-terminal</code> crate which fixes the issues in <code>atty</code>, but its dependency tree is sprawling so there's no way I'm taking a dependency on it. So my only options left are to just depend on what's in std (which is compatible with ripgrep's MSRV policy) or fork <code>atty</code>, fix its issues and maintain yet another crate. I'm not keen on the latter.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the clarification! Makes sense to me. I was just surprised by the big bump, that's all, so I wanted to ask.</p>
