            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Recent changes introduced by version 0.4.19 require rust 1.63. This formalizes that requirement.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/e95254a86f484eec663be4714924d91d3cf39cb8#commitcomment-95170910 for more context</p>
<p>See https://github.com/rust-lang/api-guidelines/discussions/231 for community discussion for how changes to MSRV impact versioning. Would be nice to bump MINOR to avoid compatibility issuers, however ignore is pre-v1, so you can do what you want.</p>

<p>This is not accurate in the Cargo ecosystem. Bumping the leftmost non-zero number in a version results in a semver incompatible change. <code>ignore</code>&#x27;s leftmost non-zero number is the minor version, so bumping that would result in putting out a semver incompatible release. I have no desire to do such things and will never do it just because of an MSRV bump. So even though <code>ignore</code> is pre-v1, it is not &quot;you can do what you want.&quot; Bumping the patch version still needs to produce a semver compatible release.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not quite ready to make a decision about this. And in particular, whatever decision I do make, I&#x27;d like to apply it to all the crates in this repo. Maintaining different MSRVs for each sounds like a maintenance burden to me.</p>

<p>Don&#x27;t blame ya, MSRV compatibility is an unsolved issue. https://blog.illicitonion.com/rust-minimum-versions-semver-is-a-lie/</p>

<p>One MSRV for all crates sounds sensible, that way the CI can catch it and us developers don&#x27;t need to think about it.</p>
<p>FYI tools like https://crates.io/crates/cargo-msrv exists to help detect which rust version is required for a given codebase.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
