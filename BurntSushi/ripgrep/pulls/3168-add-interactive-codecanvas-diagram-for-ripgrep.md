# Add interactive CodeCanvas diagram for ripgrep

---

_@Abdulnaser97_


I was trying to understand how `ripgrep` works under the hood so I created a diagram for it using [code-canvas.com](http://code-canvas.com). I think it will be pretty helpful for contributors to quickly onboard to the inner-works of `ripgrep`.

Here is the generated diagram for `ripgrep` grouped by the application's use-cases and their runtime data flows: 
[Open ripgrep's interactive diagram](https://www.code-canvas.com/?session=unauthenticatedGithub&repo=ripgrep&owner=Abdulnaser97&branch=codecanvas-diagram-1759603911463&OnboardingTutorial=true)

I built code canvas to simulate a senior engineer who have been working on `ripgrep`'s codebase for pretty long and can explain to you any functionality of the repository visually through diagrams.

Here is what users are saying about codecanvas

"I used to spend 4 hours asking GPT how a use case in a codebase works and I keep going back and forth until I am able to draw a diagram to summarize my understanding,
CodeCanvas gives me that diagram in 40 seconds"

Some Notes:

- The diagram is already generated for `ripgrep`, completely free, no monthly subscription. Consider it as my contribution to help fellow contributors lower their context onboarding friction before they can start contributing.
- The diagram file is stored in the repository itself, so the readme link will only work after merging. Until then, you can view the diagram from the link I shared above.
- Read the [1 pager guide](https://docs.code-canvas.com/updating-diagram) to learn how to refine simulations to capture specific codebase logics you might want to cover.
