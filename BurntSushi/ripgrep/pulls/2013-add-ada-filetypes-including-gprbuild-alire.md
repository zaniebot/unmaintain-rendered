# Add Ada filetypes, including gprbuild & alire

---

_@TamaMcGlinn_

*.adb and *.ads are the usual extensions for Ada source code,
and *.gpr indicates a GPRbuild project file used for Ada, and
these days often being combined with alire for package dependency
resolution. Alire stores a bunch of files named alire.toml in
different directories in your (gitignored) cache/dependencies/...
