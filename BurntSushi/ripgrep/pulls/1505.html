            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The homepage and repo urls for <code>ignore</code> and <code>globset</code> manifest keys weren't updated when the project structure changed, leading links from https://docs.rs and https://crates.io to 404s.</p>
<p>Sorry about the PR on the new globset repo, I happened to find it first before this crates directory.</p>
