            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This configuration will enable the use of dev containers to work on an environment that has Rust tools preconfigured from the <a href="https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/rust">Rust base image</a>. This configuration is based on the spec at https://containers.dev/ and works with the reference cli, the VS Code Dev Container extension (to run locally on a machine with Docker installed), or in various cloud based development environments including GitHub Codespaces.</p>
