            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This commit adds opt-in support for searching compressed files during
recursive search. This behavior is only enabled when the
<code>-z/--search-zip</code> flag is passed to ripgrep. When enabled, a limited set
of common compression formats are recognized via file extension, and a
new process is spawned to perform the decompression. ripgrep then
searches the stdout of that spawned process.</p>
<p>Closes #539</p>
<hr />
<p>This PR is based on work in #751. Most of that PR was kept unchanged, with one exception: we need to more carefully manage the subprocess. I will leave comments on #751 explaining it.</p>
