# Add a few more R relevant extensions

Not sure if there was a reason the r key was duplicated, if so I can revert that change.

I think some other tool (ack? ag?) was using `rr` so I copied that, but I agree that `r` makes more sense, especially since we have a dedicated flag for specifying types. In any case, thank you!
