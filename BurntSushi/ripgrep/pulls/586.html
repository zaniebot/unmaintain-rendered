<p>This is a Unix-only workaround, until the larger refactoring mentioned in that issue is done. I&#x27;m not sure what our current behavior is on Windows, but this should&#x27;t change it in any case. Are there any cases where rg has side effects, where a sudden termination like this might not be a good idea?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems like a fine idea, thanks!</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think anything bad can come from terminating pre-maturely. In particular, anyone should be able to <code>^C</code> ripgrep at any time to make it stop immediately, which basically uses the same method employed (terminate the process via a signal).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sad to see another <code>unsafe</code> in ripgrep proper, but this is a temporary work-around, the risk is basically nil and it solves an annoying UX problem.</p>
