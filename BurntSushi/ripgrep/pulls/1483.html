            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmm, I'm not so sure about this. I don't know anything about svelte, but looking at your link, svelte files look more like HTML files to me. In particular, the <code>js</code> type in ripgrep does <em>not</em> contain HTML files, even though they can contain Javascript inside them.</p>
<p>Would others care to weigh in on this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi well, svelte files looks pretty much the same as <code>*.vue</code> files, which mask is in <code>js</code> category</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>for me personally it is more convenient to have both <code>vue</code> and <code>svelte</code> in js, but it is arguable of course</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zarkone I think it'd be a useful exercise to evaluate this addition on its own. It could have been a mistake to add vue to js, I don't know. Are svelte (or vue) files <em>principally</em> Javascript?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>principally no, i think. This files contains html,css and js -- all mixed</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All right, so if it's not principally Javascript, then I'm not quite sure I feel comfortable putting it under the <code>js</code> type.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to be overruled by this, but I think I'd want to see some consensus from relevant stakeholders.</p>
