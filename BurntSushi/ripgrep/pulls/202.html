            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This PR introduces a new sub-crate, <code>ignore</code>, which primarily provides a
fast recursive directory iterator that respects ignore files like
gitignore and other configurable filtering rules based on globs or even
file types.</p>
<p>This results in a substantial source of complexity moved out of ripgrep's
core and into a reusable component that others can now (hopefully)
benefit from.</p>
<p>While much of the ignore code carried over from ripgrep's core, a
substantial portion of it was rewritten with the following goals in
mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reuse matchers build from gitignore files across directory iteration.</li>
<li>Design the matcher data structure to be amenable for parallelizing
directory iteration. (Indeed, writing the parallel iterator is the
next step.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Fixes #9, #44, #45</p>
