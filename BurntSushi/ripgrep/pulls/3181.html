            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Building it can consume resources. In particular, on Windows, the
various binaries are eagerly resolved.</p>
<p>I think this originally wasn&#x27;t done. The eager resolution was added
later for security purposes. But the &quot;eager&quot; part isn&#x27;t actually
necessary.</p>
<p>It would probably be better to change the decompression reader to do
lazy resolution only when the binary is needed. But this will at least
avoid doing anything when the <code>-z/--search-zip</code> flag isn&#x27;t used. But
when it is, ripgrep will still eagerly resolve all possible binaries.</p>
<p>Fixes #2111</p>
