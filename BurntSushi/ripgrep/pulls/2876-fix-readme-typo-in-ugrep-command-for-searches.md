# Fix README typo in ugrep command for searches without literal optimization opportunities

---

_@hjmeijer_

It seems the entry for ugrep in this table was copied-and-not-updated from the previous table. The timing measurements indicate that the correct command was measured, so I considered this the most likely command that was used.

I'm unable to be 100% sure obviously.

Yeah, looks like a copy & paste error. I double checked the timings again and they are still correct for this particular benchmark.
