# Add `patch` printer

---

_@BatmanAoD_

Proof-of-concept for a grep-printer that works in conjunction with `--replace` to generate `patch` files, as suggested [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/74#issuecomment-251377251).

@BurntSushi It's essentially context for the comment I just added to that thread. I wanted to see what it would actually take to generate patch output as suggested.

I think the links from the comment will still work if the PR is closed, so I'll go ahead and close it.
