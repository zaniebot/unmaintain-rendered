            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This implements the suggestion made in #23 to provide an option to ignore nested git repositories.</p>
<p>A nested git repository is identified by the presence of a .git file or directory. It's a directory in the regular case, but it's a file for git worktrees and git submodules.</p>
<p>This option is disabled by default.</p>
<p>I'm open to suggestions for better names for things. In particular I'm not sure about the name <code>ignore_nested_git_repo</code> used in <code>IgnoreOptions</code> and <code>IgnoreBuilder</code> because the concept of 'nesting' is outside of that layer; it has no knowledge of the level of a <code>DirEntry</code> and relies on the calling code to make sure that the level 0 directory is never ignored.</p>

Anyone can pick this back up if they want.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, the maintainer has little time to review PRs, and merges them by rollups when he finds time for that. I'd let this open if you still want this to be merged.</p>
