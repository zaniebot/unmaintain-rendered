            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So as I was learning and going through the codebase, I came across <code>try!</code> a lot. Thinking it was a new macro/syntax I had to learn, I searched the Internet for it only to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.try.html">learn</a> that it was an earlier alternative to the newer <code>?</code> operator, which should be preferred nowadays.</p>
<p>As a result of this, I have changed all usages of the <code>try!</code> macro to the newer <code>?</code> operator in the codebase.</p>
<p>My reasoning is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest edition (2nd) of the Rust Programming language book teaches newcomers about the <code>?</code> as the shortcut for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-">propagating errors</a>.</li>
<li>I also find that <code>?</code> is easier to parse and read than <code>try!</code> and is much less of an overhead on my brain. (Note: Subject to personal taste.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I did not want to create a new issue for this since I assume we only want to do that for actual issues with RipGrep and not changes we want to make to the codebase. So I went ahead and created a PR instead.</p>
<p>Please feel free to close this PR if you all feel otherwise and are OK with letting <code>try!</code> remain as such. Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome, thanks! I did indeed want to do this change at some point. For some history, ripgrep was written before <code>?</code> was stabilized (or somewhere around then). Even after <code>?</code> was stabilized, I wanted to continue supporting older versions of Rust. But enough time has passed, and ripgrep&#x27;s minimum version is well above Rust 1.13 now anyway.</p>
<p>There are dependencies of ripgrep (like the regex crate) that still aim to support Rust 1.12, and therefore can&#x27;t use <code>?</code> yet.</p>
