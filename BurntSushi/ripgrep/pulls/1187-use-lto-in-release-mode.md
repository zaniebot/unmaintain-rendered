# Use LTO in release mode

_@lilianmoraru_

LTO in release mode, for your consideration :)

Sorry, but I'm going to have to decline. This has already been [discussed](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/325).

If there's new evidence to bring to the table, then I'd be happy to review and revisit it.

Your link now sheds light on why I have to wait so long for alacritty to compile. Sigh.
