            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>-Syu</code> flag will do a full system upgrade and then install the package, which is not necessarily the desired behavior. Only the <code>-S</code> flag is necessary to install a single package.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's true that you only need -S but then again telling people to do -Syu is the safer bet because we do not support partial upgrades and we regularly get problems with that in IRC. You can take it out but someone will find a way to do a partial upgrade.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Perhaps so but I'm sure it says that somewhere. Anyway, I think @BurntSushi should accept this patch and then we'll just hope that no idiot turns up that manages to break something.</p>
