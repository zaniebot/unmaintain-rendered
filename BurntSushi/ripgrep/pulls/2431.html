            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This fixes <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/issues/746">sharkdp/fd#746</a>. &quot;fd&quot;: uses &quot;ignore&quot; crate from this repo. Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create parallel walker with &quot;follow links&quot; option enabled.</li>
<li>Create broken symlink with the name broken_symlink, for example.</li>
<li>Add &quot;broken_symlink&quot; to ignored files.</li>
<li>Get walker dir entry results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expected: walker doesn&#x27;t return dir entry result for the link.
Actual: walker returns error result for the link.</p>
<p>Note that I didn&#x27;t fix similar bug in single-threaded walker. I&#x27;m new to Rust so it&#x27;s a bit difficult for me, but if it&#x27;s required for this PR to be merged, I&#x27;ll fix single-threaded walker too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve opened #2552 for this. I&#x27;m not sure this is the right way to fix this issue, and the fact that the single threaded case isn&#x27;t fixed means I don&#x27;t want to bring this in as-is. I looked and fixing the single threaded case appears tricky.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to close this for now in favor of tracking #2552 as a bug. Since I don&#x27;t consider this to be a high priority bug, I&#x27;m going to defer fixing this until I&#x27;ve had a chance to overhaul <code>ignore</code>&#x27;s internals.</p>
