            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This fixes the bug when the filename of a compressed file starts with the <code>-</code> character and it gets passed to the decompression tool, but gets treated as an option instead of file.</p>
<p>In the best case, the option would be invalid and the decompression tool would finish with an error. In the worst case, the filename that looks like a valid option could potentially overwrite or remove data as a side effect.</p>
<p>All decompression tools in use here follow the convention that everything after <code>--</code> is treated as a filename.</p>
