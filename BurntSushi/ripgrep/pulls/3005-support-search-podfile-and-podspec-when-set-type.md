@BurntSushi Hi, would you mind spending a while reviewing this PR?

I can find no reference that these files are actually evaluated as Ruby code. Examples I see certainly _look_ like Ruby, but authoritative sources seem amazingly vague.

If you can find a better source that these are definitively Ruby, then I'd be happy to re-open this PR.

It's also possible this might be something that warrants a different file type.
