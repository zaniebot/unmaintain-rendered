Please remove this change. It's just an example. It is an intentionally old version. I want fewer places where I need to update the version, not more.

Okay sure thing, I also submitted another pull request which changes the link of the releases section to the latest one, I apologize if that wasn't meant to be updated either.

https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/5645f7a2981421ce3f0905a8b4df15187caa9670
I accidentally pushed them in the same pr, I'm new to contributing sorry. is there a way for you to just merge one commit if you wanted to or do I need to make another pull request. Even if you don't merge it please let me know so I don't make this mistake in the future.

Ideally you would just rebase the branch and drop the commits you don't want to include. Following some "git rebase tutorial" might help.
