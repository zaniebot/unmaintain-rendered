            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pursuant to the discussion in #324. The new implementation breaks the <code>termcolor</code> API by renaming the <code>Stdout</code> type to <code>StandardStream</code>, which now has two constructors <code>stdout()</code> and <code>stderr()</code> rather than a single <code>new()</code>. <code>StdoutLock</code> is changed analogously.</p>
<p>Implementation was very straightforward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pkgw OK, this looks much better, thank you. :-) And a major thanks for staying patient with me!</p>
<p>I think this looks good to go, but I would like to see this squashed down to one commit before merging. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aw, I kind of liked how the commits had a very clear logical progression through the needed changes, but it&#x27;s really no big deal to me. Squashed and re-pushed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pkgw Yeah, one commit makes things easier to revert or consider one group of logical changes. Ideally, every commit builds and passes tests. This is also important since I&#x27;ve switched to a &quot;no merges ever&quot; model a couple months ago.</p>

<ol>
<li>Could you please add <code>[breaking-change]</code> to the commit message.</li>
<li>Could you also add <code>Fixes #324</code> to the commit message.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks! (I really should get a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> in place...)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Was actually <em>just</em> about to inquire about a new release ... nice! I notice that the <code>termcolor</code> README.md still say that you should write</p>
<pre><code>[dependencies]
termcolor = &quot;0.1&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>which should probably be updated to the new version, given the new features?</p>
