# add `is_path_ignored` API

_@yonip23_

Hey @BurntSushi,
Following up on https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2630, this PR implements the discussed API.
I thought since I have the code already, why not proposing this change 🙂 
I understand that it's not completely aligned with your agenda, so I'll take no offense if you decide not to merge this PR.
Cheers 🍻

Thanks, but yeah as I said, this isn't something I'm willing to maintain right now. I don't have the bandwidth for it. This is far from as simple as just merging it.
