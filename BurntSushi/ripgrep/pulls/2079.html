<p>Could you please reflow the text so that it wraps to 79 columns? Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wish there were a way to have CI bleat about 79 column violations, but it's not a rule I enforce 100% strictly. e.g., URLs and sometimes even code going over 79 columns is okay when that's the clearer path. But alas, such cases call for human judgment.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe some bot that would comment on PR &quot;you added new lines in XXX file longer than N characters, typically this is unwanted, see this contributing.md section for more info. You probably should reflow text so that it wraps to 79 columns.&quot;?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just checked and I see no CONTRIBUTING.md file at all (if that docs exist somewhere then making link-only CONTRIBUTING.md is still a good idea to make easy to find them).</p>
<p>For bot itself - I have seen some code coverage monitor bots posting, Visual Studio Code has some bot actions on issue tracker (automatically and triggered). See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/137641#issuecomment-975481667 https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-github-triage-actions</p>
<p>But I have no direct experience with maintaining, making or using something like that.</p>
