            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why did you mark this as resolved? I didn&#x27;t sign off on this. Please remove this from this PR.</p>
<p>I went to their <a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com">web site</a>, and I got immediately spammed with blinking messages. I found no obvious high level description of how it works. I&#x27;m immediately skeptical of this tool.</p>
<p>It is poor decorum on your part to try sneaking stuff like this into unrelated PRs. Please don&#x27;t do it again on any of my repositories.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You&#x27;ve marked several of my comments as resolved, but they aren&#x27;t actually resolved. Please don&#x27;t do that. You also haven&#x27;t addressed all of my feedback. And finally, please remove the &quot;whitesource&quot; crap from this PR. Do not try to sneak things like that into an unrelated PR again. If you seriously want ripgrep to consider it, then open a new issue and make a convincing argument for its utility.</p>
<p>Finally, now that I actually <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jerem-ferry/+archive/ubuntu/rust">look at the PPA</a>, it looks like it is not being updated. It is still offering ripgrep 0.10.0. Therefore, I&#x27;m not sure I want to advertise it in the README at all.</p>

<p>There are still other lingering issues, but I&#x27;m not interested in doing this back-and-forth with you again. Additionally, since the PPA isn&#x27;t updated, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to add it to the README.</p>
