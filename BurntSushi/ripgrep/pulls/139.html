            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because there have been several comments on the builds provided by @BurntSushi <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/10#issuecomment-250612979">having <code>simd-accel</code> enabled</a>, vs <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/5268">HomeBrew using rust stable to build</a>.  I thought I would create this PR to enable the BurntSushi/ripgrep repo to be used as a Homebrew tap.  This would allow those who are tracking these releases (built with rust nightly?) to have easy updates, at least until the official Homebrew build can enable <code>simd-accel</code>.</p>
<p>Another aside, this PR removes the non-64-bit releases from the <code>Formula</code>.  This is because everything Mac OS 10.7 and newer has to be running on an x86_64 cpu.  If you want to continue supporting non-64-bit installs, I can add it back to this PR.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not a Mac user so I hadn&#x27;t realized this. I&#x27;ll also remove the binary from the Github releases too. (An easy decision, given that it has been causing problems lately.)</p>
