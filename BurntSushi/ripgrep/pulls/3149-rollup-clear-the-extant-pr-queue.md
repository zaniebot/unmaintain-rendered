# rollup: clear the extant PR queue

---

_@BurntSushi_

This rolls up a number of outstanding PRs into one.

Where possible, I preserved author information in each commit.

Most non-trivial PRs required changes. Instead of letting the PRs go
through more rounds of feedback, I find it more efficient to just lump
everything in all at once.
