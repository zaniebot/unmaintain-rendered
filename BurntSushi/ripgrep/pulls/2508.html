            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Whoops, I hadn't noticed #2439 was already proposing a <code>graphql</code> type. I think the file extensions I chose (<code>.graphql</code>, <code>.graphqls</code>) are slightly more correct, however:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.graphql</code> is the canonical GraphQL file extension (graphql/graphql-spec#203)</li>
<li><code>.graphqls</code> is the recommended GraphQL SDL file extension (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/essentials/file-types/)</li>
</ul>
<p>I excluded <code>.gql</code>, a commonly used abbreviated extension. It could conflict with other existing types (e.g. https://filext.com/file-extension/GQL), although I doubt many people are going to use <code>-tgraphql</code> in contexts where non-GraphQL <code>.gql</code> files appear.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll go with this PR for now, since it's more conservative.</p>
<p>We can add <code>.gql</code> later if there's demand. It's inevitable that some extensions will conflict. That's OK.</p>
