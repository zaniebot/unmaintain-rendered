            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi: The package manager Nix has its packages defined in a scripting/configuration language also called Nix. Each package is defined as a <em>derivation</em> object, which has a name field, and this object is stored in a field of a top-level <em>attribute set</em> (which is like a JavaScript &quot;object&quot;) or in an attribute set somewhere inside the top-level one.</p>
<p>When using Nix to install packages just for one's own user account, a package can be installed either by the name of its derivation or by its <em>attribute path</em> in the top-level attribute set, which is like <code>foo.ripgrep</code> or <code>foo.nodePackages.eslint</code>, where <code>foo</code> is (effectively) the name of the top-level attribute set. In NixOS, a Linux distribution built around Nix, one must use the attribute path to install a package system-wide.</p>
<p>Installing a package by derivation name can be quite slow (this could almost certainly be optimized), so installing by attribute path is generally preferable, but I can't know what the name of the top-level attribute set is for any given user, as one can have (as I understand it) any number of such top-level sets, named whatever one wishes.</p>
