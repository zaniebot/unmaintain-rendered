# Adding types for Kafka schema

---

_@singhai0_

[Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org/) uses `.avsc`, `.avpr` & sometimes `.avdl` (json-like) formats to store Kafka schema information. Adding them to rg because I hated adding `--type-add` to all my searches. Thanks :)

Travis is failing due to timeouts, I think rebuilding should fix it. @BurntSushi
