            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When <code>-S</code>/<code>--smart-case</code> is enabled, analyze and apply a case-insensitivity flag to each search pattern separately rather than globally.</p>
<p>For the PCRE2 engine, wrap case-insensitive expressions into <code>(?i:…)</code>. I.e. <code>rg --pcre2 --smart-case -e foo -e bAr</code> gives <code>(?i:foo)|bAr</code>.</p>
<p>For the default engine, produce each expression HIR separately, then combine them using <code>Hir::alternation</code>.  Although the PCRE2 approach is also possible, it turned out to be slower on large pattern files.</p>
<p>Fixes #1791</p>
<hr>
<p>As a side effect, each pattern is validated separately in the default engine; thus, this no longer works:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -e &quot;something(&quot; -e &quot;)something&quot;
regex parse error:
    something(
             ^
error: unclosed group
</code></pre>
<p>Also, this could be considered as a first step in fixing #478.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on this. Unfortunately, a refactor I did made this PR unmergeable as-is. Actually, the specific kind of change pursued here is probably simpler to do now. With that said, I&#x27;m unsure of whether I want to parse every pattern individually like this. It could be a big additional cost when searching a lot of patterns. However, it is something I&#x27;ve been mulling over for making error reporting better. Anyway, I&#x27;m going to close this PR out for now but I might re-visit the idea later.</p>
