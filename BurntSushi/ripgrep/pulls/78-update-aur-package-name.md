# Update AUR package name

_@SevereOverfl0w_

Seems that the package was renamed.

It was [moved to community](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/ripgrep/).

Indeed, `ripgrep` is now in community. I'll update the README in a bit (there are some other things I'd like to say, particularly around SIMD support and such).

Thanks though!
