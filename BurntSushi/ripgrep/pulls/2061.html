            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Closes #2060. The implementation is taken 1:1 from the glob crate. Function signatures may be subject to bike shedding.</p>
<p>I feel that there may be some optimization potential in the <code>escape</code> method that doesn't allocate if there are no special characters to be escaped (probably by returning a <code>Cow</code>), but I would have to benchmark it and <em>creating</em> globs is usually not on the critical path.</p>
<p>I've seen some <code>Strategy</code> foo while skimming over the code. Will the crate automatically pick a <code>Literal</code> strategy or do I need to do something to activate it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I had to trim this PR down quite a bit as you added a bunch of stuff beyond <code>pub fn escape(..) -&gt; String</code> that I do not want.</p>
<p>And yes, <code>Literal</code> should automatically be selected. And if it isn't, we should fix that. But nothing else should care about escaping.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And yeah, definitely no need to optimize a routine like this. Your signature and implementation are more than sufficient.</p>
