# docs: fix nixpkgs link

---

_@nadir-ishiguro_

Hi,

love ripgrep and just saw that the nixpkgs link is outdated. There has been some refactoring in nixpkgs a while ago that moved the packages around.

You don't need the link for installing ripgrep via Nix, but I thought a link leading nowhere gives off a bad impression for newcomers to Nix.
