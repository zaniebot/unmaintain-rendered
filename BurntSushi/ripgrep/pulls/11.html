            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am so looking forward to see this PR land, just because line counts are enabled by default and are something people do expect to see anyway. Looking at the benchmarks on @BurntSushi 's blog, being faster at this will be absolutely noticeable !</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It will likely only be noticeable when searching very large files.</p>
<p>But yes, I believe @llogiq is working on putting this in a crate since there have been other developments. I would also like to understand the algorithm and audit it for safety before merging, so it might be a bit. Hang tight.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sounds very reasonable ! I will happily use the fastest and best 'out-of-the' best experience then, to soon be able to tout it just became a little bit faster :).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I want to strip down the use of <code>unsafe</code>, put that in its own crate, document the bit twiddling and the rationale better and then I'll update.</p>
<p>Of course you can pull this now (as it'll already be faster), and I'll push a new PR when it's ready.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@llogiq Thanks! I have a nit about changes to <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</p>
<p>Other than that, I need to audit <code>bytecount</code> before I can merge this. I'm not sure when I'll get to that. Maybe this weekend? It would help if there was an explanation of how it works. cc @Veedrac</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I've got <a href="https://github.com/llogiq/bytecount/pull/2">a new version</a> that should be easier to audit.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the function <code>vector_not</code> turns any null bytes in a <code>usize</code> into <code>1</code>s and any others into <code>0</code>s. I go along four <code>usize</code>s at a time, adding these into a <code>counts</code> array. Every 255 quadruplets, I flush the bytewise counts into the total count to prevent any byte from overflowing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This did wind up with quite a nice speed up! Comparing old master (<code>rg-master</code>) with <code>rg</code> using <code>avx-accel</code>.</p>
<p>First, a base line with no line counting:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah subtitles] time rg-master 'Sherlock Holmes' OpenSubtitles2016.raw.en | wc -l
5107

real    0m1.578s
user    0m1.213s
sys     0m0.363s
[andrew@Cheetah subtitles] time rg 'Sherlock Holmes' OpenSubtitles2016.raw.en | wc -l
5107

real    0m1.533s
user    0m1.140s
sys     0m0.390s
</code></pre>
<p>And now with line counting:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah subtitles] time rg-master -n 'Sherlock Holmes' OpenSubtitles2016.raw.en | wc -l
5107

real    0m4.260s
user    0m3.867s
sys     0m0.397s
[andrew@Cheetah subtitles] time rg -n 'Sherlock Holmes' OpenSubtitles2016.raw.en | wc -l
5107

real    0m2.131s
user    0m1.810s
sys     0m0.323s
</code></pre>
<p>Twice as fast!</p>
