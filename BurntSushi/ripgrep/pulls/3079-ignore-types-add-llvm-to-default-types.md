# ignore/types: add LLVM to default types

---

_@amcn_

Hello ripgrep maintainers and community,

This PR adds `llvm` to the list of default types, matching files with extension `ll` which is used widely for the textual form of [LLVM's Intermediate Representation](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html).

Let me know what you think.

Finally, I would like to thank you for this great tool, it has been extremely useful to me over many years.
