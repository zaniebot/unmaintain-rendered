# Add Flox as an installation method

---

_@bryanhonof_

`ripgrep` is available to install through the [Flox CLI](https://flox.dev/docs/), and seems to be working today.
Since Nix, and Guix, are also listed as installation option, I thought Flox might make sense as well.

Can you change this to `**Flox**` in order to be consistent with other methods?
