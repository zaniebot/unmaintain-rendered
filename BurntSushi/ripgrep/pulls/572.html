            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was just having a quick look at the code and realised that you were depending on <code>libc</code> but not using it anywhere, so I removed the dependency. The effect on the benchmarks is still yet to be seen.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@Vurich Thanks! This is probably leftover from before the <code>wincolor</code>/<code>termcolor</code>/<code>same-file</code> stuff existed. I don&#x27;t see how this could impact benchmarks. :-)</p>
