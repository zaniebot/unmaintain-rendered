            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@KingMob In #1329, you expressed doubt over whether this was desired or not, and I asked you to get some other folks in the Clojure community to give their opinions. Could you please do that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, I totally guessed wrong on that one. I asked around, and by a vote of 6-1, more people prefer to keep them separate. I'll update the PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@KingMob Sounds good. Do you perhaps have a link to that vote? If not that's okay, but if so it would be good to include it here for provenance sake.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, I can add some Slack links, but two are private, and the other is on an unpaid plan, so the links will eventually decay, I assume. Want screenshots?</p>
<p>This was nothing so formal as a website and a poll; I asked at the public Clojurians Slack channels #edn and #off-topic, my coworking group's Slack (we have a few Clojurists), and the internal Cognitect Slack.</p>
<p>While not a super-high turnout, people like Alex Miller (a lead dev of Clojure), Billy Meier (author of the clj Liberator web framework), and Michiel Borkent (author of jet, a JSON/EDN/Transit conversion tool) all weighed in, FWIW.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the discussion in the public Clojurians #off-topic channel: https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C03RZGPG3/p1564419595224700</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! That's good enough for me. I'm not involved at all with the Clojure ecosystem, and I'd prefer not changing these mappings once added (but can if necessary), so I just try to do some CYA in less obvious cases. :-)</p>
