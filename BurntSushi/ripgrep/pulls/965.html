            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Simple as this probably? I didn't add a test since i don't see any for other options like this, but let me know if you'd like one.</p>
<p>I also didn't update the completion function. I guess we need to decide whether it's useful to show all of the <code>--no-*</code> options; i'm leaning towards not usually. But i should add them as hidden options at least so that the exclusions are accurate. I'll do that eventually...</p>
<p>(Fixes #964)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>LGTM, thanks! And yeah, I'm not too particular about adding tests for these since I'm not sure they are worth it.</p>
<p>I defer to you on how to handle the zsh completions. :-)</p>
