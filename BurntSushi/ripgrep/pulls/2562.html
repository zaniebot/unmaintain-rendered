<p>This removes the need to use <code>--path-separator</code> for MSYS and MSYS2 environments (such as Git Bash), as per #275, but not for Cygwin (see linked pr and comment).</p>
<p>Not sure if this is welcomed, since it is handling a special case for specific environment. But I think this is a good improvement as it aligns with the behavior of <code>fd</code> and removes error when running commands such as <code>rg foobar --files-with-matches | xargs </code> without <code>--path-separator</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In terms of implementation, I think this logic should probably live in ripgrep proper and not inside <code>grep-printer</code>.</p>
<p>In terms of idea, I&#x27;m less sure about this. It seems like it&#x27;s easy enough to work-around by defining an alias or a config file to set the default path separator yourself. It doesn&#x27;t feel right to be doing this automatically behind your back. And this is a very subtle (IMO) change in behavior and it&#x27;s not clear to me what the impact of it would be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m aware of the workaround. I proposed this change because it took me a while to figure out the error after piping the results of <code>rg --files-with-matches</code>, while most tools under MSYS, like fd and git, &quot;just works&quot;. I installed ripgrep through MSYS2 with <code>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ripgrep</code>, so I expected it to work well under that environment.</p>
<p>However, this method of installation is not documented, so I figured it might not have the best support. And I have to agree when I discover this solution it also felt a bit wrong to me too. Might be best to just leave it for the user to configure and improve documentation (#1667).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Apologies for my potential ignorance here, but could you say more about the relationship between cygwin and MSYS? In my brain, I seem to remember them being connected or the same in some way, but I find myself unable to articulate precisely their relationship.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not an expert either. I&#x27;ve only recently started using MSYS2 to work in windows and have not touched cygwin before.</p>
<p>But from my understanding, MSYS is built on top of cygwin and provides tools to build and run native windows software. It also has a package manager (<code>pacman</code>). It&#x27;s also worth noting that git bash (from git for windows) is based on MSYS2, so when people mention git bash it&#x27;s just repackaged MSYS2.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s more info on their home page: https://www.msys2.org/

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All righty, thanks. I think I&#x27;m going to close this then.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily 100% opposed to something like this, but I just don&#x27;t have a ton of visibility into its impact. And in general, I&#x27;ve found the whole cygwin/MSYS2 environment to be pretty difficult to fit into. The fundamental problem is that there is no cygwin Rust target, so Rust programs in cygwin don&#x27;t get linked with the cygwin POSIX emulation layer (or whatever it&#x27;s called). They stay native Windows programs. So it&#x27;s best to think about ripgrep as <em>always</em> a native Windows program and not something that is built for cygwin.</p>
