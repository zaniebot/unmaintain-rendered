            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, it felt long when I tested it.</p>
<p><code>ps</code> is a frequently used abbreviation <em>within</em> PowerShell (e.g. as a prefix for reserved variables or module names), but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s used enough with non-PowerShell tools that it should be considered the best abbreviation.</p>
<p>I also had a slight concern with potential confusion with postscript - one reason PowerShell doesn&#x27;t use the extension <code>ps</code>.</p>
<p><code>posh</code> might be a more widely accepted abbreviation, but I&#x27;m not a fan of that abbreviation, partly because that is an actual word.</p>
<p>This would be the second longest type, and there are many somewhat long types, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>markdown
asciidoc
taskpaper
vimscript
powershell
coffeescript
</code></pre>
<p>At any rate, I posted a survey on <a href="https://twitter.com/lzybkr/status/816421545421615105">Twitter</a>, so we&#x27;ll see what the feedback looks like.</p>

<p>Yeah, I thought about that too, but postscript could use <code>post</code> I think.</p>

<p>Yeah, I haven&#x27;t been terribly conscientious with vetting each name that&#x27;s added. We do at least have <code>md</code> for <code>markdown</code>.</p>

<p>Funny. I retweeted it. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So the vote is in and <code>ps</code> is preferred over the alternatives, with just 1 or 2 folks considering PostScript, so I updated the PR to use <code>ps</code>.</p>
<p>I also added a couple of less frequently used extensions that are related to PowerShell - not everyone cares to search those extensions but I will find it useful from time to time so I added them.</p>
