            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In my fix for #3184, I actually had two fixes. One was a tweak to how we
read data and the other was a tweak to how we determined how much of the
buffer we needed to keep around. It turns out that fixing #3184 only
required the latter fix, found in commit
d4b77a8d8967ce1bf701ec65ceb9a75e85e5f2e0. The former fix also helped the
specific case of #3184, but it ended up regressing <code>--line-buffered</code>.</p>
<p>Specifically, previous to 8c6595c215d1e24bed5b7b86e2b18f3c871439ef (the
first fix), we would do one <code>read</code> syscall. This call might not fill our
caller provided buffer. And in particular, <code>stdin</code> seemed to fill fewer
bytes than reading from a file. So the &quot;fix&quot; was to put <code>read</code> in a loop
and keep calling it until the caller provided buffer was full or until
the stream was exhausted. This helped alleviate #3184 by amortizing
<code>read</code> syscalls better.</p>
<p>But of course, in retrospect, this change is clearly contrary to how
<code>--line-buffered</code> works. We specifically do <em>not</em> want to wait around
until the buffer is full. We want to read what we can, search it and
move on.</p>
<p>So this reverts the first fix but leaves the second, which still
keeps #3184 fixed and also fixes #3194 (the regression).</p>
<p>This reverts commit 8c6595c215d1e24bed5b7b86e2b18f3c871439ef.</p>
<p>Fixes #3194</p>
