            <div class="timeline-body">Why The PR?
<p>Github has a really nice feature where you can copy markdown code blocks to your clipboard. The README.md for this repo also has all the common commands specified to install this package depending on your environment.</p>
<p>However, the commands include a prompt character. So when you copy and paste the commands they do not work without modification.</p>
<p>This PR aims to remedy this!</p>
