<p>These extensions are less common, but useful given that the *.r extension is also added as the R type.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the work you do on rg, if this isn&#x27;t wanted I&#x27;m happy to keep using my custom r type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sure, I use <a href="https://github.com/R-nvim/R.nvim">R.nvim</a> for my development and it recognises both *.rmd and *.rnw as R files. <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr">Knitr</a> also recognises both *.rmd and *.rnw as R files, although the actual files in the repo are .R and .Rnw/.Rmd due to tidyverse style guides. <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/d01420eea96019cbb544f12eefd8a80e0c458114/NEWS.md?plain=1#L160">Rmarkdown</a> will also recognise .rmd as valid.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I meant code repositories that <em>contain</em> <code>rmd</code> and <code>rnw</code> files. But I suppose other tools recognizing those extensions is a fine approximation too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t mind continuing to take a look, but most R based repositories follow the tidyverse style guide which calls for .R, .Rnw, and .Rmd. Even finding examples for .r is challenging.</p>
<p>I also did some checking for other file types that could possibly be confused for *.rmd and *.rnw, just so this change doesn&#x27;t cause unexpected behaviour for anyone and I couldn&#x27;t find any.</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the work you do.</p>
