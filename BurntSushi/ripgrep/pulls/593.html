            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you for your amazing work on much-needed and super-fast fully-featured regex search utility which is <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p>However I’ve been missing a bit a feature similar to <em>ack’s</em> helpful <code>--output</code> which allows printing only certain capture groups. That feature is discussed in <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/320">BurntSushi/ripgrep#320</a> and the discussion offers a solution. However it requires matching an entire line, which still might seem a bit less straightforward for some users.</p>
<p>Now, there is probably a reason why <code>-o</code> is made to conflict with <code>-r</code> so please excuse me if this PR is really out-of-place. However after implementing it, upon superficial gaze, things seem to be working fine:</p>


Examples outputs


ripgrep
<pre><code>$ ./target/debug/rg &#x27;of (\w+)&#x27; -Nor &#x27;$1&#x27; ./tests/hay.rs 
this
detective
luck
straw
cigar
</code></pre>
ack
<pre><code>$ ack &#x27;of (\w+)&#x27; --output &#x27;$1&#x27; ./tests/hay.rs 
this
detective
luck
straw
cigar
</code></pre>



<p>So I hope this has a chance of being considered. Thank you again!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can&#x27;t quite remember why we set the flags to conflict. There might be some subtle corner cases. I&#x27;d have to go back to that PR and read.</p>
<p>With that said, I&#x27;m not in principle against this, and I feel like this combination of flags makes sense.</p>

<p>I guess that the conflict was set because the <a href="https://github.com/beyondcompute/ripgrep/commit/90a11dec5e5765af560d343e879869a60363ef54">original implementation</a> didn&#x27;t add the <a href="https://github.com/beyondcompute/ripgrep/blob/90a11dec5e5765af560d343e879869a60363ef54/src/printer.rs#L310-L313"><code>if self.only_matching</code></a> condition in the <a href="https://github.com/beyondcompute/ripgrep/blob/90a11dec5e5765af560d343e879869a60363ef54/src/printer.rs#L291-L309"><code>if self.replace.is_some()</code></a> block.</p>
<p>The combination of <code>-r</code> and <code>-o</code> seems pretty natural for me. Actually, I tried to write <code>rg -o &#x27;Enqueued (\S+)&#x27; -r &#x27;$1&#x27;</code> a few minutes ago, and then I saw that it was impossible :-( .</p>
