<p>Closes #138.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a rather quick-and-dirty patch: I had zero familiarity with the codebase, and I basically searched for <code>files.with.matches</code> to guide me where changes should be made. I've tried to match the overall code style, but I may have missed something.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After playing with this, I realized that the equivalent option in grep is <code>--files-without-match</code> instead of <code>--files-without-matches</code>. That's my bad. I'll fix that!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oops, my bad! Every other tool uses <code>--files-without-matches</code>, and I never bothered to check grep. Wouldn't it be better to also rename functions and fields, though?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mernen No worries, it's totally my fault since I didn't check grep either until just now! It's unfortunate that other tools diverge, but I tend to give grep the highest precedence with this sort of thing because of its ubiquity.</p>
<p>I'm not too picky about the names in the code. There doesn't really need to be a precise correspondence between the CLI flags and the struct fields, so we can take liberties to make them more consistent. Moreover, much of that search code is going to get moved into a separate crate eventually, which will pretty firmly divorce it from whatever CLI interface ripgrep puts in front of it.</p>
