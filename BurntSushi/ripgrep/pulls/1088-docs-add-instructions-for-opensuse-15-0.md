I get a 404 error for this.

Does this need to be updated for every new major release of openSUSE?

It looks like we already have openSUSE Tumbleweed instructions. Is there any way to collapse them into one section? What's the difference? (I don't know what the difference between them is.

Leap and Tumbleweed are very different: the difference is verbosely explained in https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed and https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap

Maybe we can create a super section called "openSUSE" and then introduce the two flavors to get ripgrep
