# fix profile showing command for powershell

---

_@santagada_

change the profile showing command to one that matches the microsoft article linked, as its simpler and the old one didn't work at least on windows 10 creators edition.

Hmm... it is rather strange as this command works on my win10
But it might depend on powershell version...

Anyway i didn't know that you could print content of variable like that. It is definitely better!

@santagada Does this work on older versions of Windows?

@BurntSushi It works on my Windows 7, which is the oldest OS Powershell supports.
