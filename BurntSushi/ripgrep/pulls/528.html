            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Inline attributes don't seem to have any effect on performance on my own tests. However, I was unable to properly verify this, as the benchsuite program did not quite work on my box.</p>
<p>Feel free to kill this PR if you know I'm not right :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Undoubtedly, some of these probably should be removed. But if you aren't seeing any difference for any of them, then that makes me immediately skeptical. There needs to be a more thorough analysis, because I did put them there for a reason. Namely, at some point in time, I did notice a performance difference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would it be possible that rustc has improved in a way that makes the explicit inlines obsolete? But I agree that my own benchmarks were primitive and probably did not stress the relevant parts enough.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to run the benchsuite against this version and a regular release version, but I wasn't able to on Arch Linux at least.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Out of curiosity, what problem are you trying to solve here? Why do you want to remove these inline attributes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would it be possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything is possible. :-)</p>
<p>Note that some of these inline attributes will only impact certain invocations of ripgrep. For example, <code>src/decoder.rs</code> is only used when decoding UTF-16, which isn't tested by <code>benchsuite</code>.</p>

<p>I use Archlinux. There's an example here: http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/#benchmark-runner --- If you can't get it to work, then please file an issue and we can figure it out. Please include more details than &quot;it doesn't work.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I could test your PR on windows i suppose.
I'm not really fond on doing manual suggestions to compiler, but sometimes it might be necessary and there is nothing wrong with it.
After all you have inline attributes for a reason.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The only way I'd merge this PR is if there is a careful and thorough analysis of each <code>inline</code> annotation. That's what I would do. I think it would be better if we tackled it one at a time, so I'm going to close this for now.</p>
