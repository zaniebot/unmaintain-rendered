This shouldn't cause any user-facing changes.

The goal is to improve code readability and maintainability.

@BurntSushi are there any changes you'd like me to make here?

Please stop pinging me on PRs like this. They are super low priority for me. I'll get to it when I can. If you don't want to let it hang around open, then close it.
