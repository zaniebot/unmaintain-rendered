            <div class="timeline-body"><p>updates bstr to 1.0 and closes #2310
This allows downstream crates to use bstr 1.0 (or other crates that depend on it) without compiling it twice.</p>
<p>This raises the MSRV to 1.60.
When I first filed #2310 I assumed that raising the MSRV was not an option because it was set to 1.34.
However I discovered that ripgrep already has an MSRV of 1.52 since 9f924ee187d4c62aa6ebe4903d0cfc6507a5adb5.
To avoid future confusions like this I also updated the README with the new MSRV.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aye yeah, thanks. Sorry I missed this PR. Generally speaking, I do all dependency upgrades myself so that I can scrutinize changes to the dependency tree.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fair enough, I assumed this was just an uncontroversial chore since you are also the author of <code>bstr</code> :D Thanks for all your work :)</p>
