            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This extends the syntax of the --type-add flag to allow including the globs of
other already defined types.</p>
<p>Fixes #83.</p>
<p>Hi @BurntSushi, this is pretty much a straight implementation of your spec from #83, except that we are also allowing Unicode numbers in type names in addition to Unicode letters.  Letters were not enough for the default types (curse you, m4).</p>
<p>I am no rust expert so I&#x27;d appreciate specific feedback on my add_def changes (or anything, for that matter).  And let me know if I missed any places to put tests or documentation (or if I put the documentation in too many places; it did feel a bit repetitive).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but this is going to fail CI because ripgrep&#x27;s minimum version is currently Rust 1.12. You&#x27;ll need to use <code>try!</code> here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>These docs are great. Can you also add them to the man page in <code>doc/rg.1.md</code>? (You&#x27;ll need to <code>cd doc &amp;&amp; ./convert-to-man</code> to actually produce the <code>man</code> file, which can be viewed with <code>man -l rg.1</code>. If you can&#x27;t get <code>pandoc</code> installed easily, that&#x27;s OK, I can do the final conversion step.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! The doc formatting was a little off. I fixed that and also squashed the commits. Nice work!</p>
