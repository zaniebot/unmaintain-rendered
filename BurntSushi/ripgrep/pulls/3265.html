            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A minor change but incredibly useful for me.  Toit was a commercial project, but open sourced a few years ago.  Its a language and a framework/container runtime for embedded platforms like ESP32.  I can't speak to how popular it is, although I don't know that there are other platforms doing what these guys do - if you dive into the people behind it and their genius, my guess is that its only a matter of time before it gets more noticed and takes off a bit.</p>
<p>After seeing PR #3253, here are some links to save you the time:</p>
<ul>
<li>More from <a href="https://toitlang.org/">https://toitlang.org/</a>, with <a href="https://docs.toit.io/">docs</a> and <a href="https://pkg.toit.io/">package repo</a>.</li>
<li>It's got <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=toit.toit">VSCode</a> support and published with MS to get using <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/2ffd111109010e867223eb73b5e31dcd59d5ad43/manifests/t/Toit">winget</a>, similar on the respective tools for Linux etc.</li>
<li>I know its in some commercial products, see <a href="https://toit.io/">https://toit.io/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disclosure: I'm not a maintainer/owner or anything, but since its made my life so much better, its my go to.  (I may also have become a fanboi!).  I contribute PR's if there's anything noteworthy, and publish my own Toit material for others.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration!</p>
