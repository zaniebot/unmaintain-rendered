            <div class="timeline-body"><p>🤔</p>
<p>Well, it does certainly match <code>systemd</code>.</p>
<p>The only potential concern i can think of is that making the 'flags' in the list different from the actual feature names means that there's no longer a 1:1 mapping between the list and the crate/build stuff. Not sure if that would ever be an issue (and i think you said you eventually want to make this all unnecessary anyway?), but that was kind of my thinking with the way i wrote it i guess.</p>
<p>I'm cool with it if that doesn't bother you tho</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, it's a little iffy, but I think the mapping is still unambiguous, and yeah, hopefully we won't need these some day.</p>
