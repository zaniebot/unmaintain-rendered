            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I added this as an integration test because the existing unit tests in gitignore.rs don&#x27;t create any files but the logic to test is in <code>GitignoreBuilder.add</code> which only works on files.</p>
<p>I could also</p>
<ol>
<li>either add a unit test that creates a temporary gitignore file,</li>
<li>or extract a method from <code>add</code> that works on a <code>Read</code> and test that. However, since the errors need the path, the extracted method would also need to know the path.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the work on this. So to me, this is an overpowered solution. I do not think we need to bring in a absolutely enormous dependency on <code>encoding_rs</code> just to strip a few bytes from the prefix of a file that is usually small. I&#x27;d rather see this done manually. Hell, if it&#x27;s easier, I&#x27;d prefer we just read the entire ignore file into memory. (Although I&#x27;d prefer not doing that.)</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to close this PR because of its age (and because I&#x27;m working through the backlog), but if you want to try this again without <code>encoding_rs</code> that would be great. Otherwise I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get around to fixing it when I overhaul the <code>ignore</code> crate.</p>
