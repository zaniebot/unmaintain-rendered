# Add custom Zsh completion file

---

_@MaskRay_

clap-rs [1] does not generate good Zsh completion files, thus a custom completion script should be better.
I have refined https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/pull/510 and added more options to `complete/_rg`.

I'm OK with bringing this into the repo, so long as it's clear that I personally might not be able to keep it up to date.
