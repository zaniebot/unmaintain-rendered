            <div class="timeline-body"><p>fixes #1924
This change should add checksum files &quot;sha256&quot; for each built tar ball / zip ball file.
<code>actions/upload-release-asset</code> is now archived and recommends using <code>softprops/action-gh-release</code> instead. Therefore, this commit replaces the old upload-release-asset.</p>
<p>Example Release: https://github.com/xEgoist/ripgrep/releases/tag/13.0.6 , action-gh-release can also be utilized to include a changelog file to automate the release process.</p>
