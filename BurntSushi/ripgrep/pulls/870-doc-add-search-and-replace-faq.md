# doc: add search and replace faq

---

_@z2oh_

Adds a brief solution to basic search and replace using ripgrep and sed. I originally wrote a version of this in https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/74, where @BurntSushi expressed interest in this being added to the FAQ. Thanks for such a powerful tool!

@z2oh Thanks so much for this! I added a few touchups but otherwise merged this as-is. :-)
