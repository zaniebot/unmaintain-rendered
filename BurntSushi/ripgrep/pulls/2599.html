            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm personally not a huge fan of how this looks personally. It feels like it all just runs together. Although I do admit that this makes copying commands much more useful because of GitHub's &quot;copy&quot; button. On the other hand, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of encouraging folks to blindly run commands from a GitHub README, especially when they contain <code>sudo</code> (as many of these do). So... the extra speed bump might actually be desirable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I understand you already have a stance on this but if I could play devils advocate here. I think there are two camps of developer on your argument:</p>
<p><strong>Camp A</strong>: Thoroughly reads the command before even copying the command (who would benefit from it working without modification).</p>
<p><strong>Camp B</strong>: Will blindly copy and paste see the error because of the <code>$</code> and will proceed to remove the dollar sign, still without fully considering the command.</p>
<p>While I appreciate there is probably also developers that don't fit these two camps. I think in practice the speedbump probably would not save many developers 🤷‍♂️.</p>
<p>Either way thanks for taking the time to review these PRs!</p>
