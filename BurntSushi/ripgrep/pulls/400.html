            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I fear that this may not be quite right. Did you confirm this works in a local build? At least on Darwin and Linux, the generated completion files are nestled a bit further down: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/ci/before_deploy.sh#L23</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Unfortunately, CI isn't going to test this for us because this code doesn't trigger until a tagged release. If it's too much trouble, I can probably just take this on when I do the next release and iterate until it works.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I must admit to being completely ignorant about all things rust. I did install rust/cargo on my machine and ran the <code>cargo build --release</code> command that I saw in the AppVeyor script. However, I did not get an <code>rg.exe</code> file in <code>target\release\</code>. I can see than the shell completion file is in <code>target\release\build\ripgrep-[some-hash]\out\</code>. I probably wrongly assumed that they would be at the same level as the <code>rg.exe</code>.</p>
<p>I see that the AppVeyor script is <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BurntSushi/ripgrep/build/1.0.313/job/p6714xn58pnfylgh">currently running?</a>. Can we wait to see what error that might throw? Better yet, is there any way to explore the filesystem from that run?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dstcruz You can update existing PRs by either adding commits or just amending your commit and force pushing. (The latter is preferred since it will yield a more serviceable history.)</p>
