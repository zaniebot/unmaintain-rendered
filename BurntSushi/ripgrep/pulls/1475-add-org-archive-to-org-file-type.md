# Add *.org_archive to org file type

---

_@telotortium_

`.org_archive` is the default extension for Org archive files, created when
entries from an Org-mode file are archived (see
<https://orgmode.org/org.html#Moving-subtrees>). These files are still in Org
mode format, so it's worth searching them at the same time as non-archive Org
mode files.
