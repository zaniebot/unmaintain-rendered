            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since the homebrew-core formula was accepted, we should differentiate
the prebuilt formula available in this tap</p>
<p>Only after my previous PR was accepted (and I tried it again), did I notice that there may be an issue with conflicting formula names:</p>

<p>This is failing because the cache I have from installing the <code>homebrew-core</code> version of ripgrep doesn't match the sha of the prebuilt download.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good question.  There is really only <code>bottle</code> (but you aren't distributing <code>bottle</code>s) from what I can tell.  This actually seems like more of a problem with Homebrew since it doesn't namespace the cache by tap name.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm. I would like to make sure we get this name right. For example, I can imagine being convinced that the tap should compile from source instead of distributing prebuilt binaries. However, that's unlikely to happen unless something like <code>rustup</code> gets packaged because we'd need a nightly compiler to enable SIMD.</p>
<p>In Archlinux, we'd call this <code>ripgrep-git</code>, but that's not accurate because this tap doesn't track master. We also have things like <code>ripgrep-bin</code>, but that has the same problem as <code>ripgrep-prebuilt</code>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm overthinking this. (I do like <code>ripgrep-bin</code> better than <code>ripgrep-prebuilt</code> though.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It appears that <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/d4109a06e6b3957a7091ced6de1dd9d4de801952/Formula/multirust.rb">multirust</a> is available (which uses rustup?).  However, there are no formula which depend on it.. so I'm not sure if that's allowed.  <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/5563">I have a change that is using it to build with rust nightly</a>.  I guess this PR could just hang out depending on what happens there.  If the Homebrew PR is accepted and bottles created from the nightly build, I can revise this PR further.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>multirust</code> is on the way out unfortunately (to be replaced by <code>rustup</code>). The Homebrew folks probably made the right call by sticking with <code>rust</code>. In general, we really shouldn't be packaging nightly Rust at all. It just so happens that <code>ripgrep</code> benefits from it. I realize it sucks, but it's a good motivator for us (the Rust community) to get SIMD stabilized.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I'm just going to accept this and call it done. Thanks so much for straightening this out!</p>
