<blockquote>
<p>When building an instance of Walk using ignore::WalkBuilder, the patterns in files added by .add_ignore() are matched against the current working directory of the process, instead of the root of the tree being Walked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This PR changes the behaviour or <code>WalkBuilder.add_ignore()</code>. <strong>This is a breaking change.</strong> Absolute file paths are now resolved based on the directory the <code>WalkBuilder</code> was initialised with.</p>
<p>Example directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>// /home
//   /subdir
//     - ignorefile
//     - README.md
</code></pre>
<p>Contents of <code>/home/subdir/ignorefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/README.md
</code></pre>
<p>The below code will now always ignore <code>/home/subdir/README.md</code> rather than <code>./README.md</code> of wherever the executing process is.</p>
<pre><code>// psuedococde
let mut builder = WalkBuilder::new(&quot;/home/subdir&quot;);
builder.add_ignore(&quot;/home/subdir/ignorefile);
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tommilligan Thanks for investigating this! However, I don&#x27;t think I can merge this PR in its current form, and I&#x27;m not quite sure what the fix <em>should</em> be. As you point out, this is a breaking change. Unfortunately, this is not a <em>desirable</em> breaking change. Namely, the current behavior is actually intended as far as I can tell. If you look at ripgrep&#x27;s docs for the <code>--ignore-file</code> flag, then you&#x27;ll see that all ignore files provided in this way (which use <code>WalkBuilder::add_ignore</code>, and the <code>--ignore-file</code> flag is why this method was added) are <em>supposed</em> to be matched relative to the current working directory.</p>
<p>So you might say, &quot;OK, that&#x27;s fine, then we can add a new <code>add_ignore</code>-like method that matches relative to the root.&quot; While I would be okay with that, the problem here is that a <code>WalkBuilder</code> <em>doesn&#x27;t actually have a single root</em>. You can add multiple additional paths via the <code>add</code> method. The ignore files processed by <code>add_ignore</code> would then be incorrectly matched on subsequent paths.</p>
