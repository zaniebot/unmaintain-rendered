This may be unavoidable, but just so you know: this is sending out a fair few email notifications to people who watch releases on this repo, I've had at least 10 so far.

I don't know how to avoid it, sorry. I'm working on moving the release infrastructure over to GitHub, so once that's done, hopefully this will pass.

I put "TEST-0.0.0" in the release name, which should never appear in a real release, so if you really can't abide it, then create an email filter.

No worries, it's not a big deal!

Looks like I _finally_ got it working, so hopefully things will be quieter now. Thanks!
