<li><p>Hi, <a href="https://www.x-cmd.com/">x-cmd</a> is a <strong>toolbox for Posix Shell</strong>, offering a lightweight package manager built using shell and awk. It helps you download rg release packages from the internet and extract them into a unified directory for management, without requiring root permissions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I mean, can the installation method provided by x-cmd be added to the rg installation.md?</strong><a href="https://www.x-cmd.com/start/">The installation method for the x command</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">x env use rg
# or
x rg
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>We wrote a <a href="https://www.x-cmd.com/pkg/rg">rg introduction article</a> and a <a href="https://www.x-cmd.com/1min/rg">demo</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When adding new installation instructions, I either need to be familiar with the tool or it needs to be clearly trustworthy. The latter can be met by clear widespread adoption.</p>
<p>I looked into x-cmd and how it works is not clear to me. There are at least some yellow flags I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no commit messages whatsoever.</li>
<li>PRs from outside contributors seem to be rejected.</li>
<li>I couldn't find the mechanism, either in the code or in the documentation, where by the tool downloads packages to install. Is it downloading from github? Building from source?</li>
<li>Reading through the docs, most prose is non-specific and somewhat vague. This doesn't inspire confidence.</li>
<li>After searching, I could not find anyone else using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of those yellow flags, I'm not comfortable adding it ripgrep's installation instructions at this time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi ~ I am the author of x-cmd.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention. And I admire your due diligence.
I will add more documentations in the future.</p>
<hr />
<p>We repackage the rg binary build, and the x-cmd pkg download the rg bianry from here:
https://github.com/x-cmd-build/rg/releases</p>
<p>We have a metadata file for sha512sum checking about the integrity of package.</p>
<p>We also have the integreity check of x-cmd source code:
https://www.x-cmd.com/start/integrity-guarantee</p>
<p>In China, we use npm to deliver the package because github is blocked.</p>
<hr />
<p>X-CMD is not conmunity-driven. I have established a small full-time team to exclusively focus on its development.
However, all of the source code are open for maximum transparency.</p>
<hr />
<p>We not only provide rg package, we also provided an <strong>experimental</strong> shell wrapper for rg -- rg module.</p>
<p>This is the demo of x-cmd rg module:
https://www.x-cmd.com/mod/rg</p>
<p>This is the code of x-cmd rg module:
https://github.com/x-cmd/x-cmd/blob/main/mod/rg/lib/main</p>
<hr />
<p>In the future, I plan to add more rg shell wrappers in rg module. It is so much fun, like we do it on jq: https://www.x-cmd.com/mod/jq</p>
<hr />
<p>X-CMD is not well known to the public. But now we are progressing in China, mostly because Chinese is our first language, and we are not good at English communication.</p>
<p>We will fire an issue or pr later once we achieve clear widespread adoption.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thank you for creating such a great tool.</p>
