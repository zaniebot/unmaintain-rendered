            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Upload build artifacts for CI to allow people to easily grab nightly builds</p>
<p>Ran into the long file path issue, found the fix from last year: #2049 but as there were no nightly artifacts would need to clone and build just to test.<br>
This also adds release building to the CI for tests (to get us both sets of artifacts).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I appreciate what you&#x27;re trying to do here, but I do not want the headache of maintaining nightly release builds. IMO the build process for ripgrep is very easy and so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge ask to build it yourself if you want to test/use whatever is on master.</p>
