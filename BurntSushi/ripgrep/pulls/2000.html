<p>This commit bumps locked version of the memmap2 dependency to the current v0.5.0 and reverts fdfc418be55ff91e0c2efad6a3e27db054cb5534 to re-enable mmap on 32-bit architectures as a different approach to fixing #1911.</p>
<p>This was tested to report matches from the end of a 5GB file using MinGW and Wine:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would be grateful for a short feedback whether this is wanted at all.</p>
<p>I think the root cause for the issues is highly likely to have been the bug in memmap2. Since that dependency has been bumped in the meantime, I don&#x27;t think the workaround needs to be kept around.</p>
