            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Due to how walkdir works if symlinks are not followed, symlinks to
directories are seen as simple files by ripgrep. This caused a panic
in some cases due to receiving a WalkEvent::Exit event without a
corresponding WalkEvent::Dir event.</p>
<p>This is fixed by looking at the metadata of the file in the case of a
symlink to determine if it&#x27;s a directory.</p>
<p>Fixes #1389</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. It&#x27;s going to take me a bit to review this, as this adds an additional syscall for every symlink that is seen, as far as I can tell. We&#x27;ve had performance problems in the past (especially on Windows) when doing that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, that could indeed be too much overhead.
The only case that this PR fixes should be the case reported (when the given path is a symlink to a directory). Otherwise when the option to follow symlinks isn&#x27;t given the depth never changes so there are no <code>WalkEvent::Exit</code> events caused by symlinks:
https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/8892bf648cfec111e6e7ddd9f30e932b0371db68/ignore/src/walk.rs#L1026-L1030
Therefore checking only the given path, instead of any symlink encountered, should also fix this case. I can try fixing it that way if you agree.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Great, thanks! I think this looks good. I&#x27;ll be merging it with some tweaks as part of #1486. In particular, I made it so the additional stat check only occurred when the directory entry had depth <code>0</code>.</p>
