<ul>
<li>Clarifies the role of the two different closures.</li>
<li>Allows implementing of <code>Drop</code> for post-processing at thread
completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The closure API is maintained not just for compatibility but also
convinience for simple cases.</p>
<p>Fixes #469</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome! I ended up merging this with your other PR. It makes the trait definitions a bit more gnarly, but the idea still works. I also removed the trait object from the signature of <code>visit</code> and instead just used normal parametric polymorphism. Although, now that I say that, I wonder if a trait object is preferrable. There's unlikely any performance benefit, and a trait object would avoid copying all of the traversal code for each implementation of <code>ParallelVisitorBuilder</code>.</p>
<p>I saw your ideas with respect to reduce APIs, but I think I'd rather stick with the smallest addition that unblocks folks. As I've said a few other things, IMO, the API of <code>ignore</code> is an unmitigated disaster and needs to be completely rethought anyway. So until then, I'm somewhat okay with continuing to make the API worse as long as it serves a real need while also minimizing churn. So I really appreciated that this change is backwards compatible. :-)</p>
