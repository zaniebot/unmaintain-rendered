            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, I&#x27;ve done this myself. While I don&#x27;t document this anywhere, I <em>always</em> do dependency updates myself. That&#x27;s so I can carefully review the changes and inspect any new dependencies that may sneak in and understand why they are needed. Accepting a PR like this that not only updates every dependency but <em>also</em> bumps the minimal version required for each dependency would make it very very easy to miss if a new dependency ended up sneaking in.</p>
<p>I say all this in an effort to help others understand and appreciate that dependencies should be carefully scrutinized because they are a liability.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing the RUSTSEC advisory to my attention and submitting a patch though. I appreciate it!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Note though that I did not bump the minimal version of each dependency. I don&#x27;t see a strong reason to do this, and if I were consistent about it, it would lead to an annoyingly high rate of churn.</p>

<p>All I did was run <code>cargo-upgrade</code> (part of <code>cargo-edit</code>) which automatically did this. I completely understand and appreciate your quick response.</p>
