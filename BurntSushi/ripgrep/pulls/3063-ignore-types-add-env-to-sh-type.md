# ignore/types: add .env to sh type

---

_@lilianmoraru_

`.env` or "dotenv" is used quite often in cross-compilation/embedded development environments to load environment variables, define shell functions or even to execute shell commands.
Just like `.zshenv` in this list, I think `.env` should also be added here.
