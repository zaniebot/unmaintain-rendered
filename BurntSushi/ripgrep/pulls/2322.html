<p>It&#x27;s just a draft for now, there&#x27;s still work to do, but I&#x27;m opening this in case anyone would like to provide some early feedback. I&#x27;m still new to Rust, so this surely looks like garbage right now, but I&#x27;d like to make the code more idiomatic, bring it to the adequate speed and quality level, and learn in the process.</p>
<p>I ~still need to add~ added hostnames on Unix for better SSH support, but that <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665#issuecomment-840735760">requires approval</a> from @BurntSushi.</p>
<p>This depends on <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/termcolor/pull/65">BurntSushi/termcolor#65</a>, ~which will certainly need to be rewritten (because of the clunky API it currently introduces), or at the very least enhanced with stuff like <code>supports_hyperlinks()</code>.~</p>
<p>Fixes #665</p>
<hr>
<p>This is what I have in mind for this PR:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Unix: <code>file://hostname/path/file.txt</code></li>
<li>On Windows: <code>file:///C:/path/file.txt</code></li>
<li>On WSL: <code>file://wsl$/distribution/path/file.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Hostnames on Unix would be useful for using ripgrep through SSH (SSH is mostly used to connect to Unix destinations). They could also be added on Windows after <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/14116">microsoft/terminal#14116</a> is fixed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suggest you look at https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hyperlinked_grep/ In particular</p>
<p>By default, this kitten adds hyperlinks for several parts of ripgrep output: the per-file header, match context lines, and match lines. You can control which items are linked with a --kitten hyperlink flag. For example, --kitten hyperlink=matching_lines will only add hyperlinks to the match lines. --kitten hyperlink=file_headers,context_lines will link file headers and context lines but not match lines. --kitten hyperlink=none will cause the command line to be passed to directly to rg so no hyperlinking will be performed. --kitten hyperlink may be specified multiple times.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure users will want to customize what parts of the output are hyperlinked.</p>

<p>I have WSL on Windows, so I&#x27;m getting the best of both worlds. 😜</p>

<p>That&#x27;s not really how things work on Windows, and I don&#x27;t think Microsoft would change their terminal that way. This would need special-casing the <code>file://</code> protocol in the terminal, enhancing it with <code>#line</code> support, then adding configurable apps by file types with custom command line argument patterns. They won&#x27;t do such a thing.</p>
<p>Let me explain: URIs are handled by the shell (a system component), and applications can be associated with URI schemes. For instance, <code>https://</code> would be associated with the web browser. So, the shell decides how to handle a particular URI, not the terminal app. That way, you get an integrated UI experience which is consistent across applications. I&#x27;m not sure how exactly <code>file://</code> is set up, but it must be tied to something that decodes the URI to a file path, and chooses the application to open based on the file extension, which is configurable in the system settings. But this configuration doesn&#x27;t let you specify additional parameters to pass to the target application, such as the file line.</p>
<p>This could be worked around with a custom URI scheme such as <code>ripgrep://</code>, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that wouldn&#x27;t be accepted. 🙂</p>

<p>No, they can just strip the fragment from the URL before passing it to
the shell. If they want to remain backwards that&#x27;s their lookout, I don&#x27;t
see why the rest of the world should suffer for it.</p>

<p>Umm, I am pretty sure if you pass a http:// url with a fragment via
the shell, the browser will handle the fragment just fine. I dont see
why the shell cant pass file:// urls with fragments to applications, all
it requires is an extra check box in their configuration UI, to indicate
to the shell not to modify file urls when passed to the specified
application.</p>
<p>Or just use a non-Microsoft terminal if you must use windows.</p>
<p>Regardless, I am very strongly against crippling hyperlink support in rg
to satisfy the limitations of Microsoft&#x27;s software. If you really want
to do it, add an option to control whether to add line numbers to the
file URLs, or better yet create a template system with a default
template that is file://{hostname}{path}#{line}</p>
<p>Then users of rg can adapt the hyperlink to use whatever scheme and
level of usefulness they require.</p>

<p>ripgrep cannot know if its output is being interpreted on linux or
windows. It can be running over ssh on a linux machine but its output
can be interpreted on a windows machine. Or vice versa. You really
cannot include compile time tests to control output in a terminal application.</p>

<p>No clue. Probably not, if I had to guess.</p>

<p>You want it to work by default on <em>your terminal</em> in <em>your use case</em>,
breaking it by default for other people and other usecases. And you
picked the terminal and usecase that is the <em>most limited</em>. No remote
hosts and no line numbers. There is simply nothing stopping your
favorite terminal from stripping fragments and hostnames if it doesnt
like them. But no, according to you instead by default ripgrep must
produce crippled output, so that it works by default for <em>you</em>. I don&#x27;t
consider clicking on a search result and being taken to a random point
in the file (as will happen if the editor remembers last opened
position) or the top of the file <em>working by default</em>.</p>

<p>You are adding the feature <em>wrong</em>. I thought you were asking for
feedback, so I wasted my precious time giving you some, my mistake. But

<p>No, I am trying to make the output of ripgrep fit for purpose. The purpose here being, clicking on a search result and navigating to that result in an editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You want it to work by default on <em>your terminal</em> in <em>your use case</em>, breaking it by default for other people and other usecases.</p>

<p>It breaks only on terminals that pass file URLs without removing hostnames, fragments, queries etc from them onto systems which cant handle those. AKA terminals that dont sanitize untrusted input before passing it on. I feel for you that you are wedded to such a terminal.</p>

<p>Well, <em>of course</em> I want to make it work for myself. But I won&#x27;t be breaking anyone else. On the contrary, I want this to work for most people out of the box.</p>

<p>Yes, you will. You have conveniently ignored the fact that output from a search tool when clicked should go to the search result inside the file, not just the file. By leaving off line numbers you are <em>breaking that extremely reasonable expectation</em> for everybody, forcing them to use wrappers to work around your lack.</p>

<p>Non standard? Which standard are you referring to? Last I checked fragments are a part of every standard that determines what constitutes a valid URL.</p>
