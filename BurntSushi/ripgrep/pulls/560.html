            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey again! I've been collecting issues left over from my previous effort and i think i've found as many as i can for now.</p>
<p>The biggest problem, which was carried over from the original, was that option completion was basically broken on zsh 5.1 (the latest version available in Ubuntu Xenial). But i also found some typos in option names, missing actions for options that take arguments, missing exclusion rules, &amp;c.</p>
<p>In addition to fixing bugs i improved the <code>colorspec</code> handling slightly, and i added completion for sequences of types when given <code>--type-add &lt;type&gt;:include:</code>. And i re-ordered the options to match the <code>--help</code> output like i mentioned wanting to do before.</p>
<p>I tested this on zsh 5.1, zsh 5.2, and zsh 5.3 and it seems OK. Really hard to test properly though, so i'm sure i'll find something again....</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Awesome! As a Bash user, I might start to get jealous. :-)</p>
<p>And yeah, I appreciate that testing this stuff is hard. Fixing things as we go seems like the best course of action.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, i wasn't sure it was an option. Knowing that it is, i'll probably do that the next time i need to make changes to the function.</p>
