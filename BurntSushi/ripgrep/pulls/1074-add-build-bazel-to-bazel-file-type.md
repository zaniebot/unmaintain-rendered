# Add BUILD.bazel to bazel file type

---

_@kastiglione_

This adds `"BUILD.bazel"` to the filename patterns for the `bazel` file type.

Bazel allows `BUILD.bazel` as a filename alternative to `BUILD`, see bazelbuild/bazel#4517 and the [0.4.1 release changelog](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#release-041-2016-11-21).
