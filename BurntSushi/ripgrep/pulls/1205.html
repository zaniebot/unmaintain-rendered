            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I keep running into this issue where i want to use <code>-tc</code> to search a repository, and i don&#x27;t get everything i expect because some of the files are those <code>foo.h.in</code> ones. I know it&#x27;s not feasible to support <em>every</em> possible <code>*.in</code> extension, but these are really common in C and C++ projects — for example, zsh and PCRE have a lot of them — so hopefully that justifies it...?</p>
<p>In doing this, i combined a bunch of patterns with <code>[...]</code> because it seemed like it&#x27;d be easier to maintain the <code>*.in</code> variants that way. Let me know if it makes it more confusing though</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aye, I think I buy this! I&#x27;ve definitely seen a lot of <code>*.in</code> files too in my day, but I don&#x27;t tend to work in repos with them a lot. But I think this makes sense.</p>
