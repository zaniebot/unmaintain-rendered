            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This makes it easier to find the manpage when you first install ripgrep, since <code>man ripgrep</code> will work.</p>
<p>This is basically the first Rust code I&#x27;ve ever written; please don&#x27;t assume I know what I&#x27;m doing (but this is so trivial it seems difficult to screw up, hopefully?). I did, however, test both of the modified functions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to do this. The binary name is <code>rg</code> and that&#x27;s therefore what the man page lookup symbol should be too. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s common practice to create aliases like this. And I could easily imagine the existence of an alias like this leading folks to believe that the binary name of the tool is <code>ripgrep</code>. Finally, from an implementation perspective, this doesn&#x27;t create a symlink on Windows (creating symlinks on Windows is a huge PIA).</p>
<p>So I think I&#x27;m going to pass on this. Thanks for the thought though!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sure, makes sense. (FWIW symlinks being a PITA is why I just didn&#x27;t bother with implementing that.)</p>
<p>In that case though, can we find a way to make <code>apropos ripgrep</code> work? I think even if <code>apropos grep</code> brought up <code>rg(1)</code> that would be a huge improvement. I can file a follow-up ticket if you&#x27;re open to a change like that.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Getting <code>apropos ripgrep</code> to work seems reasonable. Filing a ticket for that sounds good. I don&#x27;t know what work goes into it and probably won&#x27;t have time to do it myself, so I can tag it as &quot;help wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>I would also expect some light research into what is culturally acceptable. I wouldn&#x27;t want <code>apropos grep</code> to show <code>rg(1)</code> as a hit unless it was common for such queries to produce alternatives to programs.</p>
