# Typographical Fixes

_@THE-Spellchecker_

Title: Fix typos in docs, comments, and help text

Summary:
- Fix spelling/wording issues across docs, shell completion script, and Rust crate doc comments (e.g., ripgrpe -> ripgrep, di erent -> different, mulitline -> multiline, bounaries -> boundaries).
- No behavior changes; comment/documentation-only cleanup.
