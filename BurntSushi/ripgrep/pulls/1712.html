            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't think globset requires Unicode support in regex for path matching (correct me if I'm wrong). I removed the dependency to make the crate lighter.</p>
<p>This won't affect the size of ripgrep, since it depends on Unicode in regex elsewhere. However, I've been meaning to use globset in <a href="https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide">zoxide</a>, and I'd like to keep the binary size as small as possible.</p>
<p>I tested a trivial program before and after the change, and the executable size went from 2544 KB to 2084 KB.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmm, yes, I <em>believe</em> this is indeed correct. Good catch. In particular, the glob-to-regex transform explicitly disables Unicode support in the regex, so I think that means it's impossible for the regex to make use of any of the Unicode features.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aye, yeah, passing the test suite is good enough for me. ~~I expect we'll find out if this was an unwise choice after the next release! Hah. But I think it should be fine.~~</p>
<p>Errmm... Well... That's not true. Derp. Because the Unicode feature will still be enabled for ripgrep.</p>
