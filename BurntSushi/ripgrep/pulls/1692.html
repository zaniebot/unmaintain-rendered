            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A cursory glance at TYPO3 documentation suggests they use <code>.typoscript</code> files.
however, there is <code>&quot;*.vue&quot;</code> in the <code>&quot;js&quot;</code> category, perhaps <code>.ts</code> should go there as well?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>TypoScript was added in https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1477, and as far as I can tell, it's correct.</p>
<p>Typescript already has a type in ripgrep, but it's called <code>ts</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I see it now. And having multiple types claim an extension should be fine too, there are three instances of <code>&quot;*.v&quot;</code> for example.
Sorry.</p>
