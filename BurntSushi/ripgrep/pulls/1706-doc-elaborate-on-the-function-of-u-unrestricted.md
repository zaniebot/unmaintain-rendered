# doc: elaborate on the function of -u/--unrestricted

The added wording reads a little redundant in the man page since the *AUTOMATIC FILTERING* section says basically the same thing. Not sure if that's a problem. But this should clarify the `--help` output at least?

Fixes #1703

This looks great, thanks! I think the redundancy is okay. The problem is that some folks might only look at one particular place and not the other.
