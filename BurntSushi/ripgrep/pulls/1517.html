            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This may be unavoidable, but just so you know: this is sending out a fair few email notifications to people who watch releases on this repo, I've had at least 10 so far.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know how to avoid it, sorry. I'm working on moving the release infrastructure over to GitHub, so once that's done, hopefully this will pass.</p>
<p>I put &quot;TEST-0.0.0&quot; in the release name, which should never appear in a real release, so if you really can't abide it, then create an email filter.</p>
