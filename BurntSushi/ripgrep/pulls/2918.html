            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for working on this. It looks neat. But I think this is too niche of a use case to have in ripgrep proper. And it seems likely to be a feature that begets more requests in terms of customizing how it works. It seems like you should be able to calculate this in an external tool by reading ripgrep&#x27;s JSON output.</p>
