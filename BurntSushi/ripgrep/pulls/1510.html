            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure this is a good fit. It's adding a lot of complexity and seems fairly niche. Moreover, this seems like the first of a long line of additional options: <code>max_modified</code>, <code>min_created</code>, <code>max_created</code>, <code>min_accessed</code>, <code>max_accessed</code>, and so on. I'd rather we have a more cohesive strategy to address those.</p>
<p>In the future, I strongly recommend opening issues before filing PRs, especially when the PRs are non-trivial.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't really have a normal documented contribution process. I'm just trying to save you time for next time. Trivial PRs are fine because if they don't end up being merged, then you didn't spend a lot of time on it. Meatier PRs are best to discuss first to make sure the feature is actually desirable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, alright. So, I really need this feature, which is why I wrote it. Do you think it could be merged with max_filesize, for instance by providing arbitrary filters?
Let's say:</p>
<pre><code>builder.filter(|path| std::fs::metadata(path).unwrap().filesize() &lt; 200_000)
</code></pre>
<p>A perhaps cleaner design would allow stacking up these filters (like std's iterators), but then the parallel walker might be harder to do, since you would need a trait to tell that two stacked filters are a valid walker.</p>
