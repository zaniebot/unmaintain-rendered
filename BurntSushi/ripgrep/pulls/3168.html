            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was trying to understand how <code>ripgrep</code> works under the hood so I created a diagram for it using <a href="http://code-canvas.com">code-canvas.com</a>. I think it will be pretty helpful for contributors to quickly onboard to the inner-works of <code>ripgrep</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the generated diagram for <code>ripgrep</code> grouped by the application's use-cases and their runtime data flows:

<p>I built code canvas to simulate a senior engineer who have been working on <code>ripgrep</code>'s codebase for pretty long and can explain to you any functionality of the repository visually through diagrams.</p>
<p>Here is what users are saying about codecanvas</p>
<p>&quot;I used to spend 4 hours asking GPT how a use case in a codebase works and I keep going back and forth until I am able to draw a diagram to summarize my understanding,
CodeCanvas gives me that diagram in 40 seconds&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>Some Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagram is already generated for <code>ripgrep</code>, completely free, no monthly subscription. Consider it as my contribution to help fellow contributors lower their context onboarding friction before they can start contributing.</li>
<li>The diagram file is stored in the repository itself, so the readme link will only work after merging. Until then, you can view the diagram from the link I shared above.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="https://docs.code-canvas.com/updating-diagram">1 pager guide</a> to learn how to refine simulations to capture specific codebase logics you might want to cover.</li>
