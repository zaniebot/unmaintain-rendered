# Added example for --colors to man page

This PR adds an example to the man page on how to replicate ag's default colour scheme, to facilitate switching to ripgrep from it.

Looks great, thanks! Would you mind moving this toward the bottom of the README instead? This seems like a nice FAQ entry. (I'd eventually like to setup a proper FAQ.)

Sure, no problem. I'll put it under Tips for now, since that seems like it could evolve into being the FAQ.
