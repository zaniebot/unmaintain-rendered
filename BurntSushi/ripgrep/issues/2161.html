            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0, -SIMD -AVX (compiled)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Built it myself by <code>cargo build  --all --release --features pcre2</code></p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Win-10, 21H1, ver. 19043.1586.</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>As part of a <code>pygrep.bat</code> file I use RipGrep like:</p>
<pre><code>setlocal
set RG_COLORS=--colors &quot;match:fg:white&quot; --colors &quot;match:bg:red&quot; ^
              --colors &quot;path:fg:green&quot;  --colors &quot;path:style:intense&quot; ^
              --colors &quot;line:bg:blue&quot;   --colors &quot;line:style:intense&quot;   --colors &quot;line:fg:white&quot; ^
              --colors &quot;column:bg:blue&quot; --colors &quot;column:style:intense&quot; --colors &quot;column:fg:green&quot;

::
:: handle option &#x27;-c&#x27; to set RG_OPTIONS=-i&#x27; etc. etc.
::
rg.exe --after-context=1 --mmap --fixed-strings f:\ProgramFiler\Python27\test %RG_OPTIONS% %RG_COLORS%  %*
</code></pre>
<p>With the Windows console width set to 120,  a command like <code>pygrep.bat IP2Location</code>, shows this:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/945271/158013562-c8e1a670-3278-4df1-ace1-7c85f47dbc0d.png" alt="pygrep-rg-colours"></p>
<p>the red colour bleeds over to the next line marking a non-match.</p>
What is the expected behaviour?
<p>With the WinConsole width set to e.g. 130, there is no problem. A <code>cls &amp; pygrep.bat IP2Location</code>, shows this:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/945271/158013673-1280bf8d-43bf-4264-b068-68c22444f944.png" alt="pygrep-rg-colours-130"></p>
<p>In lack of a better description, I named this &quot;<em>Colour wrapping</em>&quot;. I&#x27;ve no idea what&#x27;s the real issue here.
<strong>But</strong> this depends on which Y-position the .bat-file was invoked on. It&#x27;s as if a 1 line scroll when <code>&quot;match:bg:red&quot;</code> is in
effect causes this <em>bleeding</em>. Since if I increase the console <strong>height</strong> to avoid a scroll, then there&#x27;s no <em>bleeding</em>.</p>
<p><em>PS</em>. I wrote that <code>netstat.py</code> script using <a href="https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil">psutil</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m on windows, so I can look into this. That said, I&#x27;m also not an expert on Windows. My <em>guess</em> would be this has something to do with the way the Windows console writes wrapped lines; it looks to me like what happened was that after writing the <code>i</code> in <code>IP2Location</code>, the cursor moved down and then back to the beginning of the line, setting the background and foreground colors at each location along the way. I suspect that this is documented behavior somewhere? I think the fix will probably go in <code>termcolor</code> and not <code>rg</code>, if a fix is even possible.</p>

<p>Clearing the remainder of the line when writing a newline (per <a href="https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/issues/65">JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh#65</a>) will apparently produce the correct behavior.</p>
<p>@BurntSushi: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences">Apparently, Windows already has VT100 (ANSI) escape sequence support.</a> They still require accessing the Windows console API to enable, but if I&#x27;m reading the docs correctly, they should work the same way any other OS does. I think they probably exist because of the Linux subsystem in Windows 10.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@gvanem Sorry for late reply, but the bug seems to be present in any shell on Windows, so I think you&#x27;re correct.</p>
<p>@BurntSushi What would you say the best way to insert a line clear just before a newline is written in the output functions? I think I&#x27;ve found a place but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve hit another snag, too: Windows API doesn&#x27;t offer the equivalent to &quot;clear to remainder of line,&quot; only VT mode does, so I would need to manually change the remainder of the line on wrapping. I&#x27;m going to see about forking <code>termcolor</code> to add some of that functionality. Also, I should note that the bug only takes place on write and resizing the console immediately fixes it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To be honest, I just don&#x27;t really have the bandwidth right now to dig into this. The Windows console API is indeed quite limited. On the other hand, it&#x27;s been quite some time (years now) since Windows supported ANSI color escapes. So if you fix it for ANSI escapes, that might be enough.</p>
<p>The right place for this to go is indeed probably in <code>termcolor</code>, likely all the way down in the lowest levels of the <code>write</code> routine. It should only happen on Windows, and it might be a good idea to provide a way to disable it in the crate API.</p>
<p>Another option here, honestly, is to not fix it. This really seems like a bug in how Windows consoles handle this stuff to me. But if the fix is to do a search for <code>\n</code> on every <code>write</code> call, then I guess it&#x27;s just yet another penalty that Windows users pay. (They already pay a fair amount. ripgrep is generally much quicker on Linux/macOS in my experience.)</p>

<p>Fairly recently -- maybe the last 5?, 10? years -- Microsoft has turned around. Instead of competing, they started integrating open source projects.  Powershell being both open source and cross platform is pretty neat. ripgrep works great on windows.</p>

<p>It has been only a couple years since I&#x27;ve performed said benchmarks. And I do not claim to know why there is a difference, although I have a variety of guesses. Windows requires additional work in some cases with interacting with its system APIs (not console APIs).</p>
