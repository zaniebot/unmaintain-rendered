            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD -AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>choco install ripgrep</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>windows 7 SP1</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>How does ripgrep actually understand .gitignore files? Suppose I&#x27;m in directory foo:</p>
<pre><code>foo/
| - bar/
| --- .gitignore
| --- file.txt
| - baz/
| --- other file.txt
</code></pre>
<p>if I run ripgrep from foo, does that mean it will understand the .gitignore within bar, and if for example file.txt is listed in that .gitignore, it would ignore that file? I&#x27;m guessing it won&#x27;t apply the .gitignore inside baz.</p>
<p>Or, do I have to specify a .gitignore somehow?</p>
<p>Or, does it only look inside the directory where it was run, and if it doesn&#x27;t find one, doesn&#x27;t ever use one?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you&#x27;re in <code>foo</code>, it will respect the <code>.gitignore</code> in <code>bar</code>. Generally speaking, a <code>.gitignore</code> file can only apply to files in its directory or lower.</p>
<p>Basically, ripgrep treats <code>.gitignore</code> files just like git does. So if you know how <code>.gitignore</code> works with git, then you know how <code>.gitignore</code> works with ripgrep automatically. There are some bugs that lead to a few inconsistencies, but they are the exception, not the rule.</p>
