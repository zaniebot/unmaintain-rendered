            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could certainly just add a file type (in the meantime, <code>-g '!*.svg'</code> should do). A PR for that would be welcome.</p>
<p>Is there anything else we should be doing? svgs are plain text XML files, but it feels weird to try and search them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know, I hadn't seen the glob exclude but had seen the filetype exclude so I jumped straight to that as my solution. I don't really have any more specific suggestions because I don't work with SVGs enough.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@jdhorwitz The simplest thing to do is to add an <code>svg</code> file type to ripgrep: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/ignore/src/types.rs --- That way, one can ignore them by just using <code>-Tsvg</code>.</p>
<p>As to whether svgs should be ignored automatically or not kind of requires a UX exploration. I'm content to punt on that for now until more folks are actually having a problem with it.</p>
