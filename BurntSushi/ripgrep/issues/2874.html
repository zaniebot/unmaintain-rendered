<p>Svelte is popular enough with it's own file types .svelte and .svelte.ts (the latter would still be picked up by searching <code>-tts</code> but would probably make sense to add to the <code>.svelte</code> glob.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to simply run <code>rg &quot;my query&quot; -tsvelte</code> and not add the <code>--type-add</code> flag each time. I think this makes sense because it is now an established file type, and not my own made up filetype.</p>
<p>Maybe add to the existing list:</p>
<pre><code>svelte: *.svelte, *.svelte.ts
</code></pre>
<p>or similar? :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can't really make heads or tails of whether this is appropriate or not. Are <code>.svelte.ts</code> files actually svelte? It seems like they are primarily TypeScript files and thus could be surprising to appear in a search restricted to svelte.</p>

<p>This could easily be flipped around: if #2909 were merged, then what would folks do if they <em>didn't</em> want <code>.svelte.ts</code> files to appear in a <code>-tsvelte</code> search? I understand that's always possible, but I don't know how to judge whether it's common enough to be annoying.</p>
<p>(You can add <code>--type-add</code> in an alias or in a ripgrep config file.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can understand that, from a purely filetype perspective then it wouldn't make sense as this is just a typescript file, but you can use runes within them. So I assume the Svelte compiler does treat <code>.svelte.ts</code> files differently to <code>.ts</code> files to get that reactivity we would normally only be able to use in <code>.svelte</code> files.</p>
<p>Svelte developers move a lot of state management that as of Svelte 5, primarily relies on runes, to <code>x.svelte.ts</code> files. So I personally believe from a UX perspective it would make sense to combine them. Though I understand ripgrep is a tool that isn't in particular about any framework or technology, I know that if you add <code>-tts</code> you will also get <code>.tsx</code> results which are an extended typescript format.</p>
<p>So I defer it to your better judgement, though thank you for the last tip - I was unaware and think that doing that could be good enough. When I made this issue, I did it mostly because my intuition when using rg was to think that it would work for <code>.svelte.ts</code> simply by covering <code>.svelte</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah basically, I just don't have the domain expertise to adjudicate this. The fact that Svelte stuff can be &quot;inside&quot; <code>.svelte.ts</code> makes sense, but that's true of a ton of stuff. For example, you can find Markdown inside of <code>*.rs</code> files. There's all sorts of examples of file types that can &quot;contain&quot; other file types.</p>
<p>I absolutely could be wrong here.</p>
<p>In particular, one thing that strikes me as different here is that <code>svelte</code> does actually appear in the file extension. Maybe that should move the needle?</p>
<p>So how about we do this provisionally. If this change ends up annoying a bunch of people, then I'll very likely back it out.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That sounds sensible, thanks for picking this one up. I'll have zero feelings hurt if you decide to revert it. I do think the fact that it's in the filename and the Svelte compiler physically processes <code>.svelte.ts</code> files is a good rationale for it.</p>
