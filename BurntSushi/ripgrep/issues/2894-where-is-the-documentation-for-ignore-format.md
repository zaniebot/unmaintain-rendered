# Where is the documentation for .ignore format?

---

_@dbarnett_

Is there an official spec for what goes in a .ignore file? I like the spirit of it but I can't seem to find a user-oriented explanation of how it's supposed to work.

Starting from https://crates.io/crates/ignore and https://docs.rs/ignore/, I'm not seeing any explanation of what goes in .ignore files besides the description hinting that it relates to .gitignore files.
