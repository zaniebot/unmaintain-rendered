            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know what the copr is and I am sure there is nothing I can do to fix it. I think you need to get in touch with the maintainer of the package. I think that might be @carlwgeorge.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, that's my copr.  Copr is a build service provided by the Fedora project.  It is similar to Ubuntu PPA's.  It is just a temporary repo until I can get ripgrep into the main Fedora/EPEL repos.  The <a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2016-2ca07f1b54">cargo release</a> for F25 has not yet been pushed to stable.  Once it is I can enable F25 in the ripgrep copr.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I figured out how to temporarily enable the Fedora updates-testing repository in the copr, so it can now be used with Fedora 25.  This issue can be closed.</p>
