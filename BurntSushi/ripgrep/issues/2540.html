            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The reason why there hasn&#x27;t been a release is partly because I became a father and partly because I&#x27;ve spent most of my free time working on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/656">rust-lang/regex#656</a>. Where the latter is the regex engine used by ripgrep. That is coming to a close (for now) soon. Probably soonish thereafter I&#x27;ll put out a new release of ripgrep. But I can&#x27;t tell you when it will be. It could be next month. It could be next year.</p>
