            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 11.0.2 (rev 3de31f7527)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Binary off github.</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 10.</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to find where some program stores some setting. To do this, I set the setting to &quot;someuniquestring&quot; and then ran <code>rg someuniquestring likelydirectory</code>.</p>
<p>The search came back empty -- but it was because the string was stored UTF-16 encoded in some binary file. I didn&#x27;t think of that for a few minutes, even though this is common on Windows.</p>
<p>It&#x27;d be nice if ripgrep had a way to search for the UTF-16 encoding of an ascii string, either behind a flag, or maybe even by default (maybe only when running on Windows because UTF-16 is so common here).</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you&#x27;d accept, I could try to write a patch.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess you can&#x27;t use <code>-E</code> here because the file is not actually UTF-16, just the sub-string is?</p>
<p>If that&#x27;s so, i think the work-around on UNIX systems would be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>printf %s someuniquestring | iconv -t utf-16be | rg -af-
</code></pre>
<p>(You wouldn&#x27;t be able to do <code>rg -a &quot;$( iconv ... )&quot;</code> because you can&#x27;t pass <code>NUL</code> bytes in argument lists on UNIX)</p>
<p>Not sure if <code>iconv</code> is available for Windows, but maybe something to consider for now</p>

<p>ripgrep <em>should</em> already handle the common case already. If ripgrep sees a UTF-16 BOM at the beginning of a file, then it will automatically transcode the contents of the file to UTF-8, which should allow your search to succeed.</p>
<p>If your case is a &quot;mostly ASCII/UTF-8/binary file, with some parts in UTF-16&quot; then I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty uncommon. In that case, I imagine you could still try <code>rg foo -E utf-16</code>. Otherwise, I think @okdana&#x27;s example is probably the right path to go.</p>
<p>In general, I don&#x27;t think ripgrep can solve the issue of mixed encodings for you automatically.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The data is somewhere in a binary file, not in a text file with a BOM. This is pretty common on Windows (for example, Compound File Binary Format [1], PDB files, .res files, etc). These files won&#x27;t decode as UTF-16, so I don&#x27;t think <code>-E</code> helps.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#x27;s possible to do this. Windows has neither printf nor iconv preinstalled, and one has to think to do it, but just manually putting 0 bytes in the search string isn&#x27;t that hard to do manually either. But it&#x27;s also easy to implement.</p>
<p>If Windows isn&#x27;t a priority, that&#x27;s certainly understandable.</p>

<p>Have you tried it?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>There are several aspects of ripgrep that make it clear that Windows <em>is</em> a priority. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent the considerable effort required to get colors working correctly, supporting UTF-16 automatically and making sure everything single PR passes Windows CI builds before coming in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it&#x27;s also easy to implement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#x27;s only easy to implement when you&#x27;re searching for a simple fixed string literal. In the general case---for an arbitrary regex---it is not easy to implement, and this is one of the reasons why this feature doesn&#x27;t exist. Moreover, it wouldn&#x27;t be turned on by default automatically in <em>any</em> situation, since the only thing it would be good for is a mixed encoding use case. It would <em>also</em> mean that any corresponding ASCII results would not be found, so you&#x27;d wind up trading one problem for another.</p>
<p>No matter which way you slice it, if you need to search mixed encoding files, then you&#x27;ll need to take some kind of action to make the search behave as you want.</p>
