            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, all search results are written to an intermediate buffer <em>in memory</em> before being actually emitted to <code>stdout</code>. This is done to permit more efficient parallelism when searching. That is, only one thread can be writing to <code>stdout</code> at any point in time, but multiple threads can write to their own thread local memory buffer.</p>
<p>This does have undesirable end user consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>It can result in high memory usage when the number of search results is high.</li>
<li>When searching a single file, no output is seen until the search is complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should be able to do quite a bit to fix these issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a single file is given to search, then don't try any parallelism and make searching write to <code>stdout</code> directly.</li>
<li>If <code>--threads 1</code> is given, then do (1) regardless of the number of inputs.</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is done, but I opted to only do it for searching single files or stdin. Setting <code>--threads 1</code> will still use the intermediate buffer.</p>
