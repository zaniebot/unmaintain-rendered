            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>ripgrep 11.0.2
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Installed with cargo</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 8.1 Pro (x86_64)
If it&#x27;s relevant, I&#x27;m also using the latest version of msys2-x86_64</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I want to avoid having a type with multiple of the same glob, as I don&#x27;t know what problems that could potentially lead to. That also means not including a glob more than once with <code>--type-add &#x27;TYPE:include:TYPE&#x27;</code>
I add more than a handful of file type globs to ripgrep, so it becomes kind of a hassle to keep track of which type-glob pairs are already part of the default, and which have already been included into one type from another.</p>
Example of current behavior:
<pre><code>StaticPH ~ $&gt; rg --type-list | egrep &quot;vi(m|):&quot;
vim: *.vim 
StaticPH ~ $&gt; rg --type-add &#x27;vi: *.vim, *.vi, *.vim&#x27; --type-add &#x27;vim:include:vi&#x27; --type-list | egrep &quot;vi(m|):&quot;
vi:  *.vim, *.vi, *.vim
vim:  *.vim, *.vi, *.vim, *.vim
</code></pre>
What I&#x27;d like to see instead:
<pre><code>StaticPH ~ $&gt; rg --type-list | egrep &quot;vi(m|):&quot;
vim: *.vim
StaticPH ~ $&gt; rg --type-add &#x27;vim: *.vim, *.vi, *.vim&#x27; --type-add &#x27;vim:include:vi&#x27; --type-list | egrep &quot;vi(m|):&quot;
vi: *.vim, *.vi
vim: *.vim, *.vi
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think ripgrep should be deduplicating these. I&#x27;m also not sure what adverse effects can become of this, other than perhaps some small performance overhead. If you don&#x27;t want duplicates then just don&#x27;t add them.</p>
