Because:

* I do this in my spare time.
* I have a small child which makes my spare time incredibly limited.
* I spent most of my spare time over the last three years [rebuilding ripgrep's regex engine](https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/).
* There hasn't been a pressing need to put out a new release.
* I try hard to amortize my work. This means I can take long sabbaticals from individual projects with occasional bursts of activity.

I have been working on the next release for the last couple months. It will be ready when it's ready.
