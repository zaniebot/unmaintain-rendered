<p>It sounds like while the <code>--pre</code> flag is a fairly niche feature, it can be <em>really</em> useful in certain circumstances. Currently, the <code>--pre</code> flag isn&#x27;t really advertised prominently anywhere, and it may not be obvious how to use it effectively.</p>
<p>The poster from HN graciously provided an example script they&#x27;re using, which seems pretty neat. We might consider using it as an example:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If helpful, one additional use I would be willing to write up a bit is a highly ad-hoc full text search.<br>
More or less a loop of:<br>
<code>rg --pre rgpre &quot;&quot; &quot;$1&quot; &gt; &quot;$1&quot;.sanchopanda</code>.<br>
From there, lose all the other stuff and go back to the much more usable
<code>rg whateverthehell  -g &#x27;*.sanchopanda&#x27;</code><br>
until someone chooses to rerun the initial &quot;indexer&quot;.</p>
<p>This clearly falls outside the core functionality of code search, and has all it&#x27;s own tradeoffs.  However while obvious, likely niche, and so close to the core functionality for a programmer, it&#x27;s gibberish for everyone else, even the technically inclined, for whom it would be a boon.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ColonolBuendia If you wanted to give that a go, I&#x27;m sure we could find a place for it in the ripgrep docs. If it&#x27;s closer to a very specific use case, then it might be a good FAQ item. If it&#x27;s more like an explanation for how <code>--pre</code> works with some basic but useful examples, then it might be a good GUIDE section. I confess though, that I don&#x27;t quite understand what you mean yet. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me know how to edit the write up in the gist as it is now if its not very clear on the use of --pre.  As Pascal said, it would have been shorter if I had spent more time on it.</p>
<p>In terms of a guide, that sounds right to me.  The documentation curerntly is highly convincing that rg is faster.  I&#x27;m not even sure the unconvinced on speed are convincable from here.<br>
But it&#x27;s not very friendly to those who know very little about similair tools already.  Thats my reference point broadly, and for this flag in particular.   It&#x27;s not your obligation to enlighten anyone certainly, but given the reach of ripgrep, it&#x27;s an opportunity.</p>
<p>edit:  The full text idea i just mentioned is an example of how to use ripgrep -pre in an interesting way  more than anything.  It&#x27;s also a real thing I was able to do to kill an instance of microsoft search server 2010* that was running for a similair purpose.</p>
<p>*Apparantly, this is common.  It was made free, and that was that.  I imagine if you help kil enough of these, you get on the holiday card list for the ms security team forever.</p>
