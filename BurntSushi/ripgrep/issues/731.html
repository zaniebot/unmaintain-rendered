            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m grepping a log file as follows, which produces 313 matching lines:</p>
<pre><code>rg &#x27;WARN.*59082&#x27; log/server.log
</code></pre>
<p>When <code>--after-context</code> (or <code>-A</code>) is added no results are shown and <code>rg</code> exits with a status code of 1. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what number is supplied to <code>--after context</code>.</p>
<pre><code>rg --after-context=2 &#x27;WARN.*59082&#x27; log/server.log
</code></pre>
<p>A smaller log file I created to try to supply a test case works properly. The original log file is 742Mb. Performing the same operation (with <code>--after</code>) in <code>ag</code> yield results as expected.</p>
<p>Fresh debug and release builds from master (<code>14779ed</code>) yields the same result.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for reporting this! Unfortunately it is going to be hard to debug without a reproducible test case. Any chance you can try to wittle down your log file?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok I&#x27;ve found the source. There was a bunch of NUL bytes buried in the file. Not sure if this a case ripgrep should handle but reduced test case is attached.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It doesn&#x27;t print your test case because it thinks the file is a binary. If you add <code>-a</code> it should work.</p>
<p>It is a bit hard to troubleshoot what it&#x27;s doing when it just silently ignores it though. Maybe there should be a debug message?</p>
<p>Could be noisy if you have a lot of binaries in your repo or whatever, but that&#x27;s what <code>ag</code> does:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG: File nul-bytes.log is binary. Skipping...
</code></pre>
<p>(At least, it does that with files on the file system — i don&#x27;t think it can detect binary data on <code>stdin</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using <code>-a</code> does in fact fix it. I think some kind of message would have been super helpful. I figured there was a reason but there was nothing to go on to work out what it was. Extra confusion was caused by getting results without <code>-A</code> then adding it and getting none.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect that #306 might be a duplicate then.</p>
<p>However, the presence or absence of <code>-A</code> shouldn&#x27;t impact binary file detection... So that&#x27;s worth looking into.</p>
