<p>Please describe the behavior you want and the motivation. Please also provide
examples of how ripgrep would be used if your feature request were added.</p>
<p>If you're not sure what to write here, then try imagining what the ideal
documentation of your new feature would look like in ripgrep's man page. Then
try to write it.</p>
<p>If you're requesting the addition or change of default file types, please open
a PR. We can discuss it there if necessary.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my .ripgreprc:</p>
<pre><code>--type-add
bac:{bacalhau,bacalhau-examples}/*
</code></pre>
<p>but when i type:</p>
<pre><code>❯ rg -t bac lower
unrecognized file type: bac
</code></pre>
<p>Did i screw it up?</p>

For example, you don't say anywhere whether you've set the <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable, <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file">as documented</a>.</p>
