<p>Specifically, while this output is correct (since <code>^</code> is set to be in regex multi-line mode always):</p>
<pre><code>$ printf 'a\nbaz\nabc\n' | rg -U '^b'
baz
</code></pre>
<p>It should be the case that using <code>(?-m)^b</code> or <code>\Ab</code> would <em>not</em> print <code>baz</code> as a match. But that's not the case here:</p>
<pre><code>$ printf 'a\nbaz\nabc\n' | rg -U '(?-m)^b'
baz
$ printf 'a\nbaz\nabc\n' | rg -U '\Ab'
baz
</code></pre>
<p>The issue here is that in this case, ripgrep isn't memory mapping the input. In that case, ripgrep tries to be &quot;smart&quot; and not actually read the entire contents on to the heap if it knows the pattern can't match through a line terminator. But in this case, we can't quite make that assumption since anchors can match line terminators as look-around.</p>
