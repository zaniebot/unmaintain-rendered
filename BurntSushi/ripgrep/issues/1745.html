            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, to search through the history of a git repository, you need to do something like</p>
<pre><code>git log -S &#x27;search term&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>This technically searches through diffs. However, it would be very nice to be able to use rg with its speed and pretty output to accomplish the same.</p>
<p>Is this something you&#x27;d consider implementing?</p>
<p>Obviously this feature request could be extended to support other version control systems although I am only familier with git.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can already do that by piping Git commands into <code>rg</code>. A tighter integration seems out of scope.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Definitely way out of scope. Use shell pipelines.</p>
<p>This is also the kind of feature that begets more features. Which makes it very unlikely that I&#x27;ll change my mind.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there a recommended bash command with pipes and ripgrep to efficiently search all the contents of the git history? If so, I would be happy to submit a PR to the user guide.</p>
