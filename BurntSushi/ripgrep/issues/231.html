Is this possible?</p>

<p>I think fixing this will involve looking at how other search tools behave.</p>

<p>Hi, I&#x27;m a bit confused about the buffering, I have a command that generates a large output, I want to act as soon as a word is matched. I tee the output in a file so I can tail it.</p>
<p>command: rm xxx ; tail -F xxx | perl -pe &#x27;/NOT/ &amp;&amp; exit&#x27;
result: stops within a second
discussion: tail does some buffering, in this case around 200 lines of the command&#x27;s output</p>
<p>command: rm xxx ; tail -F xxx | rg . | perl -pe &#x27;/NOT/ &amp;&amp; exit&#x27;
result: stops within 10 seconds
discussion: I guess some buffering is done by rg but as all the lines are matching it soon flushes.</p>
<p>command: rm xxx ; tail -F xxx | rg NOT | perl -pe &#x27;/NOT/ &amp;&amp; exit&#x27;
result: never stops
discussion: tail -F never stops and I guess that rg&#x27;s buffer is not flushed.</p>
<p>Did I misunderstand this ticket?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please open new issues in the future. I don&#x27;t understand why people keep replying to ancient issues that may or may not be related.</p>
<p>In any case, try the <code>--line-buffered</code> flag. (I&#x27;m on mobile, I believe that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called. Look in the man page.)</p>
<p>If that doesn&#x27;t work please <em>create a new issue with a complete reproduction.</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it worked with --line-buffered</p>
<p>people reply to ancient issues because their issue is related (when they do spend the time)</p>
<p>now that --line-buffered is named people reading this ticket will have a clue. I found no --line-buffered in #240 nor in the patch.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m seriously considering locking all closed issues. Squirreling away discussion in old issues leads to a disorganized mess.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a reason why Discussions is enabled and it specifically encourages Q&amp;A. Please use that next time.</p>
