            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 0.8.0 (rev 361698b90a)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>build from source</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>ubuntu 16.04</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>I wanted to grep for <code>--no-suggest</code> so i gave the command <code>rg &quot;--no-suggest&quot;</code> i get this</p>
<pre><code>error: Found argument '--no-suggest' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context
	Did you mean --no-sort-files?

USAGE:
    
    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f FILE ...] [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list

For more information try --help
</code></pre>
<p>This should be interpreted as pattern because it's surrounded with quotes and not as flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>rg</code> doesn't know anything about the way you quote arguments on the command line; that's all interpreted by the shell. There are two ways to search for a pattern that begins with a hyphen:</p>
<p>1. Use <code>--</code> to tell <code>rg</code> that you're done giving it options: <code>rg -- --no-suggest</code></p>
<p>2. Give the pattern as an argument to <code>-e</code>: <code>rg -e --no-suggest</code></p>
<p>The latter is mentioned in the man page.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would be a good idea when an &quot;invalid&quot; flag is passed to add to the error message &quot;if you meant to use this as a pattern, do this .. or look here in the manual&quot; .. unfortunately i couldn't find the location where this message in generated in the source code of ripgrep.</p>
<p>Also what is interesting that it seems on windows it's possible to get the unescaped raw arguments with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683156(v=vs.85">GetCommandLine</a>.aspx)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is standard behavior for command line tools, and I'm not inclined to change it. The error message you see is generated by the argv parser.</p>
<p>I'm open to documentation improvements in this space, but I suspect it will suffer from discoverability issues.</p>
