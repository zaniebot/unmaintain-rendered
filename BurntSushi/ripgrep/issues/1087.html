<p>rg is much slower than ag when searching for the <code>'[ \t]$'</code> regex on a
sample repo. With this benchmark case:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the easy reproduction! Much appreciated.</p>
<p>This is unfortunately a case where ripgrep's literal optimizations end up making it slower rather than faster. The presence of literal optimizations virtually guarantees that cases like this exist, although we might consider some common sense heuristics to improve it. e.g., If all detected literals are just whitespace, then it's probably better not to use them. That would be a fairly easy change in <code>grep-regex/src/literal.rs</code>.</p>
<p>You can test this by trying ripgrep with PCRE2. For example,  <code>rg '[ \t]$' -P -U --no-pcre2-unicode --mmap</code> runs faster on my machine than <code>ag '[ \t]$'</code>. In particular, the flags given to ripgrep here enable the same performance profile as ag, albeit with PCRE2 instead of PCRE1. Similarly, <code>rg '\s$'</code> runs quite a bit faster than <code>ag '\s$'</code> (although, <code>rg -U '\s$'</code> is the more accurate comparison, but still runs quite a bit faster) precisely because <code>\s</code> prevents literal detection from happening since there are too many of them.</p>
