            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was wondering if any of the maintainers had a philosophical objection to making <code>ignore::dir::Ignore</code> and related machinery part of the public API. I've found myself needing to reimplement <code>Walk</code> with slightly modified file system abstractions, and it would be really helpful to be able to reuse the <code>Ignore</code> bits.</p>
<p>Happy to put up the PR if this seems reasonable.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This would be very useful especially with the ability to clone <code>WalkBuilder.ig_builder</code>, that would allow to check if a currently non-existing file/directory would be ignored before creating it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm unwilling to do this at this time. The <code>ignore</code> crate needs to be re-designed, and opening up more of its internals is really not something I am willing to support.</p>
