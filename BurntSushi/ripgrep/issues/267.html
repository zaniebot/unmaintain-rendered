            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I really don't know what to make of this.</p>
<p>I tried to search my project for &quot;magnézium&quot;, ignoring case, but I didn't get any matches, even though I know the project has several instances of it.
So I did some test cases:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'Néz' | rg -i néz
1:Néz
</code></pre>
<p>Good</p>
<pre><code>echo 'Agnéz' | rg -i agnéz
1:Agnéz
</code></pre>
<p>Still good</p>
<pre><code>echo 'Magnéz' | rg -i magnéz
</code></pre>
<p>What? This suddenly doesn't match, even though I only added a <code>M</code> letter?</p>
<pre><code>echo 'Magnez' | rg -i magnez
1:Magnez
</code></pre>
<p>But wait... If I replace the non-ascii <code>é</code> with <code>e</code>, it matches again.</p>
<p>Using <code>ripgrep 0.3.1</code>. The non-matching case works correctly using <code>grep</code> or <code>git grep</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect this is a dupe of #251, which is fixed on master. Namely, this works:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo 'Magnéz' | rg -i magnéz
1:Magnéz
</code></pre>
<p>I meant to get a release out this weekend but got tied up with other things. I think CI is giving me trouble too. I'll try harder to get one out soon.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm suspecting another dupe of #251 here. Tested under ripgrep 0.3.1:</p>
<p><code>echo &quot;touré kunda&quot; | rg 'touré.kunda'</code></p>
<p>returns nothing.
Note that ignore-case is not enabled in this case.</p>
<p>If it is already fixed in master, a new release would be highly appreciated.
Cheers, and many thanks for your great work!</p>

<p>I'm trying, but one of the tools I use to build releases is broken. People are working on fixing it. (I am specifically using the nightly version of said tool, so I get what I deserve, but nightlies are required to build executables with explicit support for SIMD.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Alright, tested 0.3.2, and it indeed returns the same number of matches for &quot;magnézium&quot; as git-grep, so I'm going to trust this issue is fixed.</p>
