Could you please not create issues and then completely delete everything? It's really destructive and unhelpful. Others might have had the same question as you, and searching could bring up this issue and a resolution.

To be clear, this issue was asking how to print only the matched portion of each line. The answer is the `-o/--only-matching` flag, which can also be found in grep.
