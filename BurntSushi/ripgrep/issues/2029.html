<p>Using <code>--files</code> to see what is searched is great.  The output can be compared with e.g. <code>find . -type f</code> but that&#x27;s quite slow.</p>
<p>Is there a <code>--ignored-files</code> or similar flag that shows which files / directories that RipGrep encountered but did NOT search?</p>
<p>If not, this would be nice to have.  One possible caveat is that RipGrep will not descend into ignored directories -- and sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have a full listing of FILES that were ignored, not simply &quot;we ignored everything under this directory&quot;.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>This caveat is why adding this feature is difficult. I didn&#x27;t build the filtering logic so that it could be inverted, because ripgrep only cares about what it <em>does</em> search, not what it <em>doesn&#x27;t</em> search.</p>
<p>Now the <code>--debug</code> flag will show everything that ripgrep skips, but of course ripgrep does not descend into directories that it skips, so it isn&#x27;t guaranteed to show every file that it ignored. It&#x27;s only guaranteed to show one of its ancestors up to the starting path.</p>

<p>I think this is an acceptable work-around for an uncommon task. &quot;Quite slow&quot; is probably only relevant in very large repos:</p>
<pre><code>$ comm -23 &lt;(find ./ -type f | sort) &lt;(rg --files ./ | sort)
</code></pre>
