            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I use <code>alias grep=rg</code> in my bashrc and I want it to just work. Lately I've started using AI for a lot of OS operations, and it always wants to use the -E flag like <code>find some_dir | grep -E &quot;\\.R$&quot;</code>. Seems this flag is -e in rg rather than -E.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there was compatibility, maybe alias -E to -e for instance?</p>

<p>Moreover, <code>-E</code> in grep is not equivalent to <code>-e</code> in ripgrep. Ironically, <code>-e</code> in ripgrep is equivalent to... <code>-e</code> in grep. <code>-E</code> means something different in grep and isn't applicable to ripgrep. Additionally, <code>-E</code> in ripgrep is already used in ripgrep for something else (specifying an encoding).</p>
<p>Doubly moreover, there are loads of differences between grep and ripgrep. While the intersection between them is certainly bigger than the symmetric difference, ripgrep cannot reasonably be expected to be used as a tool with a grep compatible interface. Or, indeed, an interface compatible with <em>any</em> other tool. So even if I did what you asked here, it wouldn't be enough to accomplish the stated goal.</p>
<p>You should probably use a smarter AI.</p>
