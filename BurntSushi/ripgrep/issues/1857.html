            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I know type aliases would maybe best be avoided, maybe they can smooth out the user interface.</p>
<p>Currently there is a bit of inconsistency:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-t rust</code> for *.rs files</li>
<li><code>-t py</code> for *.py files</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally I&#x27;d reach for <code>-t python</code> if I didn&#x27;t double check the type list - allowing both python and py to mean the same file type would smooth this out. I&#x27;m not sure how to avoid an explosion of aliases, but allowing the &quot;full name&quot; like python seems like a good idea on its own.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I&#x27;m a little torn on this. I previously didn&#x27;t want to do this because I didn&#x27;t want to create a precedent of aliases. But maybe adding aliases isn&#x27;t such a big deal.</p>
<p>FWIW, the reason why we have <code>rust</code> and <code>py</code> is purely because of length.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think in order for this to happen, I would want a &quot;proper&quot; way to define aliases without listing the glob rules for each alias. If someone wants to work on this, that would be lovely. A good start might be to propose a straw man implementation in this issue before submitting a PR. (But if you want to jump straight to a PR, that&#x27;s okay too.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@EduardoLaranjo Hi! Unfortunately I don&#x27;t quite have the bandwidth to mentor, even though I would generally love to do that.</p>
<p>I think the big idea here is that we want to be able to say that &quot;<code>py</code> is an alias of <code>python</code>&quot;, but <em>without</em> having to specify the globs twice.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at the ignore/file-type code in quite a while, so I don&#x27;t have an implementation path in mind off the top of my head unfortunately.</p>
