<p>ripgrep support to search several patterns together by <code>-e</code> or listing patterns in a file and using <code>-f</code> to specify the file.
Meanwhile, <code>--smart-case</code> option can judge search pattern if it needs a case sensitive searching. But, for now, all patterns are treated together to match the smart case rule. i.e. if I use <code>rg -S -e Abc -e bcd</code>, search pattern <code>bcd</code> also be treated as case sensitive.
So, I think it's better to support apply smart case rule to every search pattern separately, especially in the <code>-f</code> usage. But I am not sure if patterns in a single regex should support this.</p>
<p>I think ripgrep's man page for this change would be like:</p>
<pre><code> -S, --smart-case
            Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case
            sensitively otherwise. Every individual search pattern follow this rule 
            by itself, including PATTERN specified by -e and patterns in PATTERNFILE
            specified by -f.
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>-i</code> flag does not behave like this. The key here is that <code>-S</code> has to actually look at the pattern to determine whether to enable the mode or not. <code>-i</code> does not, as it is unconditional.</p>
