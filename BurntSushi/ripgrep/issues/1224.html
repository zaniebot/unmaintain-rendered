<p>ripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>By unzipping https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/0.10.0/ripgrep-0.10.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Windows 10.0.17763.379 (x64)</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>Please add a command-line flag which takes a file containing a list of files (one per line). (Bonus: allow any delimiter like xargs, but this shouldn't be necessary.)</p>
<p>The <code>xargs</code>-based solution described in the post below is &quot;fine&quot; but requires that users have <code>xargs</code> (not necessarily the case with Windows) and know how to use it. It's also a bit awkward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm very hesitant to add a flag like this because this really should be handled by whatever shell you're using. I grant that Windows doesn't have <code>xargs</code> natively, but I'm not experienced enough with Windows to know whether there is a typical alternative to this. IMO, if <code>xargs</code> is available, then it is a fine solution to this problem because it is completely standard.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems like powershell has built-in response-file-style &quot;splatting&quot;. @array -&gt; expands the array as arguments. There's probably a basic pattern to do that directly from a file.
