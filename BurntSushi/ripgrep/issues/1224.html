            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>By unzipping https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/0.10.0/ripgrep-0.10.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 10.0.17763.379 (x64)</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>Please add a command-line flag which takes a file containing a list of files (one per line). (Bonus: allow any delimiter like xargs, but this shouldn&#x27;t be necessary.)</p>
<p>The <code>xargs</code>-based solution described in the post below is &quot;fine&quot; but requires that users have <code>xargs</code> (not necessarily the case with Windows) and know how to use it. It&#x27;s also a bit awkward.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve been looking for an excuse to dig into some rust code (I&#x27;ve done some tutorials but am very beginner with rust). If this is an idea that folks think is worthwhile I&#x27;m willing to dig into implementing this sometime in the next few weeks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m very hesitant to add a flag like this because this really should be handled by whatever shell you&#x27;re using. I grant that Windows doesn&#x27;t have <code>xargs</code> natively, but I&#x27;m not experienced enough with Windows to know whether there is a typical alternative to this. IMO, if <code>xargs</code> is available, then it is a fine solution to this problem because it is completely standard.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seems like powershell has built-in response-file-style &quot;splatting&quot;. @array -&gt; expands the array as arguments. There&#x27;s probably a basic pattern to do that directly from a file.
