<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>riggrep seems to interpret negative patterns (starting with <code>!</code>) in .gitignore differently than git</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Given the following git repository:</p>
<pre><code>% tree
.
├── build
│   └── foo
├── build-64
│   └── foo
└── buildtools
    └── test.txt
</code></pre>
<p>with this <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>% cat .gitignore 
build*
!buildutils
</code></pre>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>rg can't match stuff in buildtools. git grep is perfectly fine with it:</p>
<pre><code>% git grep foo
buildtools/test.txt:Test to find: foobar
% rg foo
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect. Try running again with --debug.
</code></pre>
<p>Debug output: https://gist.github.com/rnestler/f58d58b8350009e228cb1a0210f1b4d8</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Return the same results as <code>git grep</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@rnestler Thanks for the bug report! Unfortunately this report is a little confused in that your posted <code>.gitignore</code> contains <code>!buildutils</code> instead of what I think was intended to be <code>!buildtools</code>. So in that sense, your whitelist pattern won't match. However, if I fix that and use <code>!buildtools</code>, then it still doesn't work, but the debug output becomes more useful:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG/ignore::walk/ignore/src/walk.rs:1395: whitelisting ./buildtools: Whitelist(IgnoreMatch(Gitignore(Glob { from: Some(&quot;./.gitignore&quot;), original: &quot;!buildtools&quot;, actual: &quot;**/buildtools&quot;, is_whitelist: true, is_only_dir: false })))
DEBUG/ignore::walk/ignore/src/walk.rs:1392: ignoring ./build-64: Ignore(IgnoreMatch(Gitignore(Glob { from: Some(&quot;./.gitignore&quot;), original: &quot;build*&quot;, actual: &quot;**/build*&quot;, is_whitelist: false, is_only_dir: false })))
DEBUG/ignore::walk/ignore/src/walk.rs:1392: ignoring ./buildtools/test.txt: Ignore(IgnoreMatch(Gitignore(Glob { from: Some(&quot;./.gitignore&quot;), original: &quot;build*&quot;, actual: &quot;**/build*&quot;, is_whitelist: false, is_only_dir: false })))
DEBUG/ignore::walk/ignore/src/walk.rs:1392: ignoring ./build: Ignore(IgnoreMatch(Gitignore(Glob { from: Some(&quot;./.gitignore&quot;), original: &quot;build*&quot;, actual: &quot;**/build*&quot;, is_whitelist: false, is_only_dir: false })))
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>./buildtools</code> does indeed get whitelisted and ripgrep descends into it, but <code>./buildtools/test.txt</code> gets ignored because it matches your <code>build*</code> pattern. One way to fix that is to change your <code>build*</code> rule to <code>**/build*</code>, which will ensure the <code>build*</code> pattern won't match through another slash. This does indeed fix your particular case.</p>
<p>The reason why this bug exists is because <code>git grep</code> searches based on <em>what is tracked by git</em>, where as ripgrep has to <em>guess</em> what is tracked by git by looking your <code>.gitignore</code>. Some things will always fall through the cracks using this strategy.</p>

<p>Oh I'm so sorry about that. I tried to create a minimal working example and screwed up 🤦‍</p>

<p>According to my understanding of the debug output ripgrep changes the pattern to <code>**/build*</code> anyways (<code>original: &quot;build*&quot;, actual: &quot;**/build*&quot;</code>) but since it doesn't behave the same I'm obviously misunderstanding something 😉 I guess it's related to the <code>literal_separator</code> option which results in a slightly different regex:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG:globset: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: &quot;**/build*&quot;, re: &quot;(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)build.*$&quot;, opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: false }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal('b'), Literal('u'), Literal('i'), Literal('l'), Literal('d'), ZeroOrMore]) }

</blockquote>
<p>But the ripgrep still interprets the .gitignore pattern differently than git doesn't it?</p>
<p>I mean given:</p>
<pre><code>% cat .gitignore 
build*
!buildtools

% tree
.
├── build
│   └── foo
├── build-64
│   └── foo
└── buildtools
    ├── bar (untracked)
    └── test.txt
</code></pre>
<p><code>git status</code> still picks up the new file <code>bar</code> in the buildtools folder:</p>
<pre><code>% git --version
git version 2.14.1
% git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

	buildtools/bar
</code></pre>
<p>When I remove the white-list pattern <code>git status</code> won't pick it up.</p>
<p>So is this still a wont-fix or could this actually be solved? If it provides any value I could open a new issue. But I totally understand that converting the .gitignore globs to regexes is a brittle thing where it's almost impossible to get all edge-cases right. So I'm perfectly fine with just adjusting my .gitignore patterns 😊</p>
<p>Also thanks a lot for creating and maintaining ripgrep!</p>

<p>Indeed! When <code>literal_separator</code> is enabled, it prevents <code>*</code> from matching a <code>/</code>. Per <code>man gitignore</code>, this behavior is enabled when a literal <code>/</code> appears in the pattern. That's why I suggested <code>**/build*</code>. The presence of <code>/</code> in this case causes <code>literal_separator</code> to be enabled which in turn prevents <code>*</code> from matching a <code>/</code>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Again, there is an impedance mismatch here. That's because <code>buildtools</code> is presumably tracked according to git because <code>buildtools/test.txt</code> is tracked.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify here, converting globs to regexes is an implementation detail, and <em>that</em> is certainly not the problem here. The conversion process is sound. The problem here are the semantics. Basically, if you come up with a consistent rule that ripgrep can use here to produce the same behavior as git, then I'm all ears. I can't immediately see one, but perhaps a different perspective is what's needed. Certainly, a simple rule like &quot;<code>*</code> never matches a <code>/</code>&quot; isn't possible because things like <code>*.rs</code> would stop working (matching happens relative to the corresponding <code>.gitignore</code>, so a <code>*</code> in that case really needs to match through a <code>/</code>).</p>
<p>Note, if you want to brainstorm here, I <strong>strongly</strong> urge you to internalize the contents of <code>man gitignore</code> first. :)</p>

<p>Ok so I untracked everything in buildtool and it will still show up because it is not ignored. But of course that means <code>git grep</code> won't find a thing in there 😉</p>
<pre><code>% git  status --ignored
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

	buildtools/

Ignored files:
  (use &quot;git add -f &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)

	build-64/
	build/
</code></pre>

<p>Will do that! And also run some more experimentation and dig a bit into the ripgrep source code. I already feel a bit bad for consuming your time 😉</p>

<p>The output of <code>git status</code> in this case is consistent with ripgrep. Remember, ripgrep knows to not ignore <code>buildtools</code> itself. The problem is that <code>build*</code> will cause everything underneath <code>buildtools</code> to get ignored because the <code>buildtools</code> whitelist rule only applied to that specific directory. For example, another way to solve your problem instead of <code>**/build*</code>  is to use <code>!buildtools*</code>. That will re-enable the whitelist on things starting with <code>buildtools</code>. But this would also cause directories like <code>buildtools-wat</code> to be whitelisted as well, and perhaps that isn't intentional. The way to fix that would be to keep the <code>!buildtools</code> whitelist and add a <code>!buildtools/**</code> whitelist in addition.</p>

<p>You shouldn't. So long as we're being productive and moving toward a resolution, then I'm very happy to participate. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just noticed that this seems now fixed:</p>
<pre><code>% rg --version

% rg foo
buildtools/test.txt
1:Test to find: foobar

<p>Noticed while trying to explain to somebody why it's important to not have recursive patterns by accident in <code>.gitignore</code> and using this bug report as an example :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
