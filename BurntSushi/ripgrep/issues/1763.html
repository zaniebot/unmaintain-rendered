            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>Several regular expression tools such as grep, vim, emacs, git grep, sed, etc. support using &#x27;&lt;&#x27; as start of word boundary, and &#x27;&gt;&#x27; as end of word boundary. In order to obtain the exact behavior of &#x27;&lt;&#x27; and &#x27;&gt;&#x27;, you would need to have some sort of lookahead or lookbehind syntax, such as in the perl regex engine to only match \b if it precedes or follows a word character.</p>
<p>It would be nice if ripgrep also supported use of &lt; and &gt; in order to inter-operate between other tools. I often think to use &lt; and &gt; when searching because I am used to the muscle memory of typing this in my editor and in other tools. But rg doesn&#x27;t recognize this, so it results in the expression not working as intended.</p>
<p>Note that rg errors out when using &quot;&lt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&quot; already:</p>
<pre><code>rg &quot;\&lt;word\&gt;&quot;
regex parse error:
    \&lt;word\&gt;
    ^^
error: unrecognized escape sequence
</code></pre>
<p>So I don&#x27;t think there would be a backwards compatibility issue. Previously any use of these escapes would cause a regex parse error, and once this is supported, they would become valid expressions.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Realized that use of \w was from someone explaining how to mimic the &lt; and &gt; with lookahead and lookbehind expressions, which aren&#x27;t supported in rg. Woops.</p>

<p>It sounds like you use these a lot. Could you give more specifics on cases you use them where <code>\b</code> isn&#x27;t good enough? I&#x27;m personally pretty skeptical of adding left and right word boundaries and generally don&#x27;t think they carry their weight.</p>
