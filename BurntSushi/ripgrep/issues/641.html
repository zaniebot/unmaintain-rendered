            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for a generic question but I&#x27;m seeing a strange behavior when trying to invoke <code>rg</code> from my Node.js app: child_process.spawn doesn&#x27;t emit any events <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues/888">nodejs/help#888</a></p>
<p>What&#x27;s strange is that the command I&#x27;m trying to spawn works fine in the console (both <code>cmd.exe</code> and Git Bash) and also spawning something like <code>rg -h</code> works fine; only performing real searches hangs the whole app. It might be a Node.js issue but I also wanted to ask here if <code>rg</code> doesn&#x27;t do anything special when providing output and exiting itself?</p>
<p>Thanks and BTW, the speed I&#x27;m seeing is just incredible, ripgrep rocks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is probably a duplicate of: #410. TL;DR: Your process is waiting to read something on stdin. To force the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the best results, I think you probably want to set your CWD to <code>&lt;path to search&gt;</code> and then use <code>./</code> as the path. (This will let you work around #278, which is probably unlikely to come up anyway.)</p>
