            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ripgrep always seems to output newlines, even if the input files don't contain any, for example aftee <code>printf 'hello' &gt;file</code>, <code>rg '.' file | diff file -</code> prints:</p>
<pre><code>1c1
&lt; hello
\ No newline at end of file
---
&gt; hello
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously this is usually not a problem, but it might be if your using ripgrep to do a search and replace, and don't want any unnecessary changes.
So I suggest adding an option to fix this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep already has about 100 options and I don't think it's worth adding another one for such a niche use case. Tools requiring the preservation of the absence of a trailing newline can fix that up themselves with a bit of annoying work.</p>
