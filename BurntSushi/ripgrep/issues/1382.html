            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ripgrep is pretty phenomenal and I love it. Also thanks to @roblourens + vscode folks that it's also used as the search engine for vscode with a great UX.</p>
<p>Now I fully realize that regexes are context insensitive grammars and to keep track of indents/brackets, you need some sort of a parse stack.</p>
<p>But here's what I want to do. I want to find all occurences of <code>choices=</code> inside of <code>models\..*?\( ... \)</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=10,
        choices=[(SINGLE, SINGLE), (MARRIED, MARRIED), (DIVORCED, DIVORCED)],
        default=SINGLE,
        null=False,
    )

...
    assert(len(status.choices), 3)
</code></pre>
<p>if I have <code>models\..*?\((.|\n)+(choices=)(.|\n)+\)</code> which would do a multiline match but also end up matching status.choices</p>
<p>This could be a mode. I guess if the whole indentation business is hard to tackle, even a bracket only mode would be awesome such that match only occurs if opening and closing brace are on same count. ripgrep would assign a level count to <code>(){}[]&lt;&gt;</code> characters.</p>
<p>so you could say <code>models\.CharField\(&lt;special selector may be?&gt;\)</code> and it would match the whole block rather than just stop at the first closing parenthesis</p>
<pre><code>models.CharField(
        max_length=10,
        choices=[(SINGLE, SINGLE), (MARRIED, MARRIED), (DIVORCED, DIVORCED)],
        default=SINGLE,
        null=False,
    )
</code></pre>
