            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 0.9.0
-SIMD -AVX</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>In Arch Linux Repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">pacman -S ripgrep
</code></pre>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Arch Linux @ Linux-4.18.5-arch1-1-ARCH</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>This software on the Arch Linux repository does not support the pcre2 engine.</p>
<p>I still need backreference, but this package on the official Arch Linux repository does not support the pcre2 feature, I hope to add.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep with PCRE2 support hasn't been released yet, so the Arch package can't support it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don't maintain the ripgrep package in the Archlinux repository, so this is not the place to file packaging bugs. Instead, you should file bugs with downstream: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/ripgrep/ (But again, to be clear, this isn't a bug because ripgrep hasn't been released with PCRE2 support yet.)</p>
<p>Until the next release, if you want PCRE2 support, you'll need to build ripgrep yourself. It should only take a couple minutes at most on Archlinux: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#building</p>
