# max-columns-preview surrounding context for first match

---

_@fallalex_

It would be helpful to see the surrounding context of a match buried in a long line rather than just seeing the beginning of the line. Not wanting to replace the max-columns-preview functionality but maybe add another flag to change the preview mode from start of line to the surrounding context (split between before and after the match).
