            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have some files with very long lines (minimized Javascript, so the entire 1MB file is only one line) and rg shows that there are matches in those lines. I&#x27;m using <code>rg --max-columns-preview --max-columns=100</code> to see previews of the matching lines, which helps a bit. But since the current behavior is to show the first N characters of the line, the actual text containing the match is rarely visible, since the match could be anywhere in the very long line, and isn&#x27;t likely to be near the beginning. I&#x27;d like to see this feature extended, perhaps with a new flag <code>--show-match-in-preview-with-context=M</code> that would skip over the characters (graphemes) preceding the match, such that at most M characters preceding the match are shown.
The behavior would be something similar to this sed script:</p>
<pre><code>sed -n &#x27;s/.*\(.\{100\}StructureComponent.\{1,100\}\).*/\1/p&#x27; dist/js/longlines.js
</code></pre>
