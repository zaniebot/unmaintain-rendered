            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(This time I have had read the README properly, at least I hope so)</p>
<p>The documentation in the readme doesn&#x27;t explicitly say that <code>--replace</code> actually writes the replacement to file, but neither does it say the opposite. I would have assumed &quot;Search and replace&quot; meant write changes to file.</p>
<p>The current functionally appears to replace correctly in the output, but provide no way (I can see) to write those changes to file:</p>
<pre><code>samuel:~ || echo hello world &gt; foo
samuel:~ || rg hello --replace &quot;good bye&quot; foo
1:good bye world
samuel:~ || cat foo
hello world
</code></pre>
<p>Same happens for recursive search and (don&#x27;t) replace.</p>
<p>Again version 0.2.1 on ubuntu 16.04.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, it does not. It was requested to do in #74, but I&#x27;m pretty firmly oppposed.</p>
<p>A &quot;search and replace&quot; isn&#x27;t really a standard option. Even a tool like <code>sed</code> won&#x27;t do it without explicitly asking for it.</p>
<p>I agree the docs could be clarified.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve continued the feature request on #74, personally I find <code>sed</code> a complete mind f**k and as you say it&#x27;s not a standard option of other commands which is why I&#x27;m so keen for it here.</p>
