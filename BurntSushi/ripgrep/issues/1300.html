            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<pre><code>% rg --version
ripgrep 11.0.1
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD -AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Arch Linux's latest official package.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<pre><code>% uname -a
Linux rain 5.1.8-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sun Jun 9 20:28:28 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</code></pre>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>This is potentially a feature request and not really a bug. <code>rg</code> can't be used with files that use <em>only</em> carriage returns (<code>\r</code>) as line endings. This isn't normally a problem because only files for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9">a certain 19 year old operating system</a> actually tend to use these, but unfortunately I use ripgrep and also reverse-engineer extremely old games made for said OS. My use case is perhaps less ridiculous than it seems, there are a myriad megabytes of source code I have to search through to find very particular identifiers in and <code>rg</code> is a great tool for that.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Easy:</p>
<pre><code>% echo -n abc\rdef &gt; file
% rg abc file
</code></pre>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>The program outputs the <code>\r</code> literally, so it ends up just giving a messy output that doesn't make any sense.</p>
<pre><code>% rg abc file
defbc
</code></pre>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Perhaps a flag similar to <code>--crlf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% rg --cr abc file
1:abc
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but this isn't going to happen. I'd suggest converting your files to use LF style line endings. Supporting this use case is, IMO, not worth the effort.</p>
