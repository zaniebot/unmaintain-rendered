Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I would like to have a flag that allows ignoring of .ignore files, but still ignore the files in .gitignore. The reason for me is that I have two main uses for <code>rg</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Searching files for content.</li>
<li>Very quickly creating a list of all files in the current directory that I might want to open. I pass the output of <code>rg --files --hidden --ignore-file ~/.vim/fzf_ignore</code> to to FZF in vim. This allows me to fuzzy search all the file names in the current repo that are not ignored by git. <code>~/.vim/fzf_ignore</code> contains a file with stuff like <code>.git/</code> and <code>.svn/</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem I keep running into is that I add some files to the .ignore file that I don&#x27;t want to search. But then I also cannot open them with the fuzzy search anymore. The reason I add them to .ignore is because they are big files that will often match my search, such as csv files, a dev database dump or a vendored minified js file.</p>
<p>The addition of a <code>--no-ignore-dot-ignore</code> flag would solve this problem for me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think that the various &quot;no ignore&quot; flags are already too complex. We might be doomed to  support every possible combination, but I&#x27;d like to resist doing that for the time being. Meanwhile, would you consider using <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a> instead for listing files? fd is, after all, designed for listing files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah using <code>fd</code> would make sense indeed, but it has even less flags to change the behaviour. One other way that would work for me is to do make the following work:</p>
<pre><code>rg --no-ignore --ignore-vcs
</code></pre>
<p>Right now it doesn&#x27;t use the vcs ignores</p>
