            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>ripgrep 0.8.1
-SIMD -AVX
</code></pre>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>macOS 10.13.3</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>It seems that <code>rg</code> ignores <code>.unity</code> files, which is the <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity Editor&#x27;s</a> file extension for scene files.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>I ran <code>rg</code> on a directory with <code>.unity</code> files and it yielded no results.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>I ran <code>rg --type all -i -e mystring .</code> in a directory which contains several <code>.unity</code> files:</p>
<pre><code>No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn&#x27;t expect. Try running again with --debug.
</code></pre>
<p>I did as it tells me with <code>rg --type all -i -e mystring . --debug</code>:</p>
<p>The full output is <a href="https://gist.github.com/ylluminarious/d5b86166a514fb439656b449fdd89909">here.</a></p>
<p>Some of these globs seem to belong to <code>rg</code> and others come from my project&#x27;s <code>.gitignore</code> plus my global <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot include the corpus of my search, i.e. the files that I searched with <code>rg</code> as they are confidential and very large.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>It should have searched my <code>.unity</code> files. I cannot tell for certain, but none of the ignore patterns in the debug output seemed to contain anything that would filter out my <code>.unity</code> files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ylluminarious The debug output somewhat cryptically tells you exactly the problem:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG/ignore::walk/ignore/src/walk.rs:1428: ignoring ./MyFile1.unity: Ignore(IgnoreMatch(Types(Glob(UnmatchedIgnore))))
</code></pre>
<p>That is, your unity file <strong>did not match anything</strong>. Normally, that wouldn&#x27;t cause it to be excluded, but you&#x27;re explicitly invoking ripgrep in its whitelist mode by using <code>--type all</code>. Literally the first line of documentation for the <code>--type</code> flag is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only search files matching TYPE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to your debug output, you haven&#x27;t defined any custom types, and since Unity is not a file format recognized by ripgrep by default, it follows that Unity files are not part of <code>--type all</code>, and therefore, are ignored <em>because that&#x27;s what you told ripgrep to do.</em></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi Thanks a lot for the answer. I&#x27;ll have to keep that in mind from now on and read the man page a little more closely. I figured it was something wrong on my end.</p>
