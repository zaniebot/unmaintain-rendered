# Static binary for Arm

---

_@babam86_

Please provide static binary for Arm.

I will use ripgrep on my Android (armv7). 

Thanks.

There are already binaries for Arm: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/0.9.0

I don't have any plans to add additional binaries because I don't have the bandwidth to maintain them. The existing arm binary is already sub-optimal in a couple respects.

But what you have provided is not a static binary.

I didn't say I did.

You kinda [did](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/0ce82403d48a7283321474fbf60c966ab45f0a6b#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8R93). Just saying as I got confused just like @babam86.
