# Shader file extensions for --type-list

---

_@Vethanis_

Hi,

It would be great to have some shader languages added to the --type-list:
hlsl: *.hlsl, *.fx, *.fxh
glsl: *.glsl, *.vert, *.frag, *.comp, *.geom

Thank you

Please submit a PR. I don't track file types in issues. They are too numerous. It's easier to just propose them via a patch.
