            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hey there
under filetypes <code>DEFAULT_TYPES</code> <code>yarn.lock</code> is listed as <code>yaml</code>. I don&#x27;t think that is correct.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>cc @okdana Looks like this got added in https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/353806b87ae1807af22145347b5b7b945da6315a#diff-911d10a397e534d636b0ed516c7d1bc8R271? From looking at <code>yarn.lock</code> files, it does indeed look like it is not yaml?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, you&#x27;re right. I&#x27;d heard tell that it was YAML (see the confusion in <a href="https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2250">this thread</a> for example), and it seemed to be when i glanced at it, but yeah, it&#x27;s not actually YAML. Sorry :/</p>
<p>I suppose we could add a separate <code>yarn</code> type for it but tbh i doubt many people want to search lock files. I&#x27;d only added it because it seemed consistent with <code>Cargo.lock</code> already being in there. I&#x27;ll just remove it</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Haha no worries! It actually looked like yaml too when I just glanced at it briefly. Removing it sounds good. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually ran it against two parsers to see if it didn&#x27;t comply by any obscure yaml rules I wasn&#x27;t aware of. That wouldn&#x27;t even have surprised me.</p>
