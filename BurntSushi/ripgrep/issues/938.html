            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m using <code>ripgrep 0.8.1</code> installed from the Arch Linux repos.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about word boundaries to know whether this is really a bug, or just a difference of interpretation. But either way, I was surprised by this difference, and I wanted to check whether it was intentional:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo foo: | grep -w foo:
foo:
$ echo foo: | rg -w foo:
# no output
</code></pre>
<p>If it&#x27;s intentional, it might be worth adding a mention of the difference to the man page.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s not a bug in the sense that it&#x27;s consistent with the way word boundaries are documented to work in Rust&#x27;s regex engine (and most others) — <code>grep</code> handles this case specially. But it would certainly be neat to replicate the behaviour somehow, and i think @BurntSushi said he plans to do so as part of libripgrep</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yeah, definitely the same issue.</p>
<p>Weirdly, it seems like both <code>rg</code> and <code>grep</code> are stricter than they really need to be. <code>rg</code> is strict in the example above, but here&#x27;s a case where I think <code>grep</code> is too strict:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo &quot;a b c&quot; | grep -w &quot; b &quot;
# no output
$ echo &quot;a b c&quot; | rg -w &quot; b &quot;
a b c
</code></pre>
<p>Without reading any code, it seems like <code>grep</code>&#x27;s rule is &quot;there must be non-word characters surrounding the match.&quot; While <code>rg</code>&#x27;s rule is &quot;there must be a word character on one side of a boundary, and a non-word character on the other.&quot;</p>
<p>I think the rule I actually want is looser than both of those: &quot;There must not be word characters on both sides of a boundary.&quot; Does anyone have a use case that relies on being stricter than that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah this is a dupe. Thanks @okdana. I&#x27;m still undecided on what to do exactly. This really requires actually playing with each implementation to see how well it works.</p>
