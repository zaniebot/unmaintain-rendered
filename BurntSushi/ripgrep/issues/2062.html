            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 11.0.2</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>apt-get install ripgrep</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Linux, Mac</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>Give a high level description of the bug.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>I have multiple per-machine gitconfig files with sections like this:</p>
<pre><code>[include]                                                                                                                                                                                                               
           path = ~/.local/lib/private-scripts/common.gitconfig 
</code></pre>
<p>and inside <code>common.gitconfig</code> I have this section:</p>
<pre><code>[core]                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
           excludesFile = ~/.gitignore
</code></pre>
<p>The excludesFile setting inside <code>common.gitconfig</code> is ignored, I have to place this snippet in each per-machine gitconfig file instead.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>The excludesFile setting inside <code>common.gitconfig</code> is ignored.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>Looking through the code it seems that ripgrep has a custom regex-based parser for gitconfig files which does not support includes.</p>
<p>I initially reported this for vscode <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/134322">microsoft/vscode#134322</a> but after a little digging this behavior can be reproduced with standalone <code>rg</code> and after grepping for &quot;excludesFile&quot; the causes seems obvious: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs#L591</p>
<p>An reasonably easy fix would be to call <code>git config core.excludesFile</code> instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While lacking include support is a legitimate bug there is no good reason for me to use a custom core.excludesFile settings instead of the default ~/.config/git/ignore. I have just been doing so since before ~/.config/git/ignore was supported by git.</p>
