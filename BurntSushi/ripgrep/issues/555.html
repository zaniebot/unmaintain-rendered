<p>Probably it is due the relative slowness of NTFS on Windows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=windows-10-lxcore&amp;num=4
Lists some benchmarks across Ubuntu and this subsystem. It is very competitive with Native Ubuntu Linux, except when it comes to filesystem access.</p>
<p>Filesystem access is important for compilation, as well as the thousands of &quot;watcher&quot; js and ruby programs that constantly touch the filesystem, which are the stated target market.
https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/266908-command-prompt-console-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windo/suggestions/13386252-filesystem-slow-compared-with-native-ubuntu-system</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might not be the most honest comparison as this tests filesystem speed in <strong>Bash on Ubuntu on Windows</strong> instead of plain Windows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enable the filesystem cache</p>
<p>Windows' filesystem layer is inherently different from Linux' (for which Git's filesystem access is optimized). As a workaround, Git for Windows offers a filesystem cache which accelerates operations in many cases, after an initial &quot;warm-up&quot;. You can activate the filesystem cache per-repository:</p>
<p>git config core.fscache true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/wiki/Diagnosing-why-Git-is-so-slow</p>
<p>Can you check if this git setting is enabled?</p>
<pre><code>git config --get core.fscache

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I still haven't had a chance to look into this, but I figured I'd respond with some things.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the search times here appear to be in the lowish milliseconds, which means that noise could be a serious contributing factor. If one tool takes 250ms to do something and another takes 200ms to do the same thing, then they're pretty darn close and I wouldn't really be too concerned about that.</p>
<p>Secondly, I've never done any benchmarks on Windows, and there are definitely things inside ripgrep that are specifically slower than on Unix systems, mostly having to do with the fact that paths in Windows are UTF-16 and all the glob matching logic requires UTF-8.</p>
<p>Thirdly, @ghuls idea of looking to the file system may be a good idea because <code>git grep</code> can specifically avoid walking the directory structure because of the git index. But that's totally fair; that's an advantage that <code>git grep</code> has.</p>
<p>I think the appropriate action item here is that someone needs to do a comprehensive benchmark analysis of ripgrep on Windows, probably compared to other tools, and figure out which things are slow. I suspect the answers will be different than on Unix.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to change the focus of this ticket from &quot;ripgrep is slower than git grep&quot; to &quot;do comprehensive benchmarks of ripgrep on Windows.&quot; I don't know if I'll ever do that myself, but I think it is a worthwhile task.</p>
<p>Also, the very first thing someone should do is find a meatier repository. <code>rg '\blet '</code> takes less than 50 milliseconds on my system against the <code>visualfsharp</code> repo.</p>
