            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would like to watch all the files of a source tree.
Currently I setup the file watches for each file individually and reset the whole thing if I notice a new folder.</p>
<p>Is it currently possible to match a Path against a stored object? My guess is, probably not the walker?</p>
<p>Best,
Stefan</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is nothing out of the box in the <code>ignore</code> crate that will do this for you, no. But the building blocks are there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So can I build a matcher outside of the ignore crate or would I have to extend it?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Let me try again: In your opinion, would you try to implement this feature inside the <code>ignore</code> crate? Or can I do it with the public interface?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dns2utf8 I think there is a place for it in the <code>ignore</code> crate, but it should be doable using the existing public API of <code>ignore</code>. That is, you shouldn&#x27;t need any internals to build it. Note that this is not an easy thing to get right!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am going to close this issue because I personally don&#x27;t have any plans to work on this, and I&#x27;m not sure I even have the bandwidth to mentor it. @dns2utf8 If you want to ask more questions though, then doing it in this issue is fine and I&#x27;d be open to re-opening it if someone really wanted to take this on.</p>
