            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey so I am using Atom and the package goto-defintion and it has a performance mode that depends on ripgrep. I downloaded ripgrep and have rg.exe. Ripgrep works in the command prompt but I cam't get it to work in atom. I have added the environment PATH to where rg.exe is located but I am still facing issues with using it within atom. I get &quot;Please instsall ripgrep first&quot; what should I do to remedy this situation? Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems like this is a question for the Atom or goto-definition people, isn't it? If rg works in the command prompt and you have your PATH set correctly, then that's pretty much the extent of installing rg.</p>
