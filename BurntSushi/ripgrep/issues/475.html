            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m running up against an issue with glob patterns, and am hoping you can let me know what I&#x27;m doing wrong.  I sometimes end up in a situation where I want to find something just in my app code, not my tests. So I do something like this, trying to search just my app files:</p>
<pre><code>rg -F &#x27;foobar&#x27; -g app/**/*.js
</code></pre>
<p>thinking that it will search for anything with a <code>.js</code> ending that&#x27;s found in the <code>app/</code> directory, regardless of how many subdirectories deep the file might be (this is how other glob patterns I&#x27;ve used before work, such as <a href="https://github.com/joliss/node-walk-sync"><code>walk-sync</code></a>.</p>
<p>However, it seems like this only matches against files that are <em>exactly</em> one subdirectory deep; anything directly in <code>app</code> isn&#x27;t found, and anything deeper than one directory below <code>app</code> isn&#x27;t found. How would I properly format the search to find everything?</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also tried changing it to something like this, to no avail:</p>
<pre><code>rg -F &#x27;foobar&#x27; -tjs -g app/*
rg -F &#x27;foobar&#x27; -tjs -g app/**/*
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aaaand never mind. Path to search can be added as the last parameter, that&#x27;s exactly what I needed. Whoops!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe it&#x27;s the running through Vim that&#x27;s the issue. I&#x27;m seeing different results from the command line now. It&#x27;s weird to me that these commands yield different numbers...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Huh, I&#x27;m having trouble reproducing this now. I&#x27;m not sure why it seemed like only one level of subdirectories was being searched, but I wouldn&#x27;t worry about this. I&#x27;ll come back and reopen if I come up with a case where I can reliably reproduce the problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All right, thanks! I did just try this in vim (with quotes around the glob) and couldn&#x27;t reproduce it.</p>
<p>If you do manage to come back around to this, it would be super helpful if you could reproduce it on a public repo that I could clone so that we know we&#x27;re searching the same stuff. Thanks!</p>
