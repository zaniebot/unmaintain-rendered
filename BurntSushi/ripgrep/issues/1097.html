            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep has many many options to control the output format. <code>rg --no-heading -N</code> will give you output that looks like <code>grep -R</code>. This is also the format used by default when the output is being directed into a file or pipe. You can put those options in an alias or your ripgrep config file if you want it to always work like that. All of this is mentioned in the usage help, the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md">guide</a>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Also, i think @BurntSushi might point out that ripgrep is explicitly not designed to be a 'drop in replacement' for <code>grep</code>, although it can work like that in some cases. This is discussed in a few places in the documentation, but especially <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#posix4ever">here</a></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately <code>--no-heading</code> does not include a <code> </code> following the <code>:</code>, making IDE ctrl+click navigation fail. I haven't dipped into rust yet or I'd submit a PR.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@jacobisaliveandwell probably your IDE could be smarter about this; grep does not add a space either.
You could add it using <code>rg foo --no-heading --column | sed -E 's/^[^:]*:([0-9]+:){2}/&amp; /g'</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed. My apologies. <code>grep</code> does this too. Something must have changed in vscode. disregard me.</p>
