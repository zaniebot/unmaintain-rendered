# "(Yes, ack has a bug.)" appears to be outdated

_@matkoniecz_

https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#quick-examples-comparing-tools has "(Yes, ack has a bug.)" linking to https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2/issues/445 and https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2/issues/14

Both are closed. So either ack fixed this bug or wontfixed it. It probably should be rerun and updated to either to not list ack as buggy or to mention that ack is buggy and it was kept as "feature"

I now found https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1474#issuecomment-582532579 so "has a bug" is true and will be true forever.

Though maybe it is worth clarifying.

I think my stance is still the same here. At some point, I will redo the benchmarks and upgrade to ack3.
