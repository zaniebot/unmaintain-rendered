<p>Weirdly, this works (running on the directory instead of all the files, omitting <code>*</code>):</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! This is definitely because of memory mapping. The reason why you&#x27;re seeing inconsistencies is because memory mapping is enabled by default using heuristics. e.g., If you search a directory, it&#x27;s always disabled. But if you search a small number of single files, then it&#x27;s generally enabled.</p>
<p>There is indeed a special case where memory mapping these sorts of files doesn&#x27;t work. Currently, <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/35f802166d1c5788e8c833f398d13b9c9e8cb360/src/worker.rs#L285-L292">ripgrep detects this by asking the file size</a>. If the size is 0, then it always uses standard <code>read</code> calls instead of memory maps. Interestingly, it looks like these files do not report a size of <code>0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ stat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown 
  File: /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown
  Size: 4096            Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular file

<p>I confess that my file size trick was not informed by what the OS purports to guarantee, but rather, it was informed by observed behavior. It looks like it doesn&#x27;t work in this case.</p>
<p>I suppose the fix to this is to look at the error returned by opening a memory map, and if it&#x27;s a &quot;no such device&quot; error, then perhaps we should fallback to normal <code>read</code> calls.</p>
