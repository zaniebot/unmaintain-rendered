            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This ticket doesn't have enough detail for me to reproduce your problem. Could you please provide a minimal reproducible example?</p>
<p>For example, this works:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah 191] echo foo &gt; tags
[andrew@Cheetah 191] rg foo
tags
1:foo
[andrew@Cheetah 191] echo tags &gt; .gitignore
[andrew@Cheetah 191] rg foo
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect. Try running again with --debug.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's really hard for me to understand your reproduction. It sounds like what you're telling me is that your <em>global</em> <code>.gitignore</code> file (as specified in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>, namely, <code>~/.gitignore</code> isn't intrinsically meaningful) isn't being respected, but without more information about which directories you're running <code>rg</code> in, it's impossible to tell what your actual problem is.</p>
<p>If you're saying that your global <code>.gitignore</code> isn't respected, then that's because ripgrep doesn't support it yet, which would make this a dupe of #9. (I'm in the process of working on ironing out a variety of ignore related problems/features, and this is one of them.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, I thought ~/.gitignore is supported? (.gitignore is in the home directory)
The tags file is on the root folder of a git clone.
So how do I ignore the 'tags' file?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Please see #9, which is about adding support for <strong>global gitignore configuration</strong>. Your <code>~/.gitignore</code> isn't automatically used by <code>git</code>. You had to tell it to use it in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code>. Please see <code>man gitignore</code> for the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how do I ignore the 'tags' file?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put it in an <code>.ignore</code> file that is in a parent directory of your clones (presumably, <code>~/.ignore</code> would work).</p>
<p>When #9 is done, then your current setup should work out of the box.</p>
