<p>Feature request: Add support in the printer for outputting the text in a way which preserves colors in non-terminal environments. For example, to be able to pipe the output of the tool into the clipboard and then paste it into a document. Thanks</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, but the problem isn't that the text output isn't colored, it's that (at least on Windows) the colored console output is copied without the color attributes, so that if I want to send the output of ripgrep to somebody over email I have to do a screen capture to get the colors preserved -- If I use tools such as clip (or select + CTRL-C) the colors will be lost.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That sounds like a feature request for whatever terminal you're using. There ain't nothing ripgrep can do AFAIK.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The feature request for the terminal is to be able to copy the color attributes (I have already created it). The one on ripgrep is to be able to output HTML.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK... I will say that it is frustrating as a maintainer when feature requests don't include relevant details initially. Instead, I seem to be getting details in a slow trickle. Are there any other relevant details you've omitted?</p>
<p>ripgrep is not going to grow an HTML output mode. If that's the only way to achieve colors when copying and pasting, then it sounds like the terminal itself should be improved to support things other than HTML. If that's not feasible, then write a tool that converts ANSI escape sequences (emitted by ripgrep) to HTML.</p>

<p>Cool, thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, my bad. I initially read this via email and the subject line was cutoff and just had &quot;Feature Request: Output in.&quot; Sorry about that!</p>
