            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ignore are you using?
<p>0.4.10</p>
What operating system are you using ignore on?
<p>Travis CI&#x27;s <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code> target</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I tried adding support for stopping at file system boundaries to <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">sharkpd/fd</a> by using <code>WalkBuilder</code>&#x27;s <code>.same_file_system()</code> method.
I tested it locally (Arch Linux with 5.3.11-1-ck-haswell), both with tests and by manually playing around with test inputs, and it achieved the intended result. However, after pushing it with the intention to open a PR against the fd repo, I got a notification from Travis that the build had failed.
As can be seen <a href="https://travis-ci.com/FallenWarrior2k/fd/jobs/256772331">here</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.com/FallenWarrior2k/fd/jobs/256772340">here</a>, the corresponding test times out on Darwin on both stable and 1.31.0.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>I personally do not have a Mac device so I cannot repro the bug locally, but if you have a Mac, checking out <a href="https://github.com/FallenWarrior2k/fd/tree/same-fs">FallenWarrior2k/fd</a> at branch <code>same-fs</code> and running the tests should (probably? hopefully?) be enough to trigger the bug.
More specifically, I was looking for <code>/dev/null/</code> starting at <code>/</code> with <code>.same_file_system(true)</code>, which resulted in empty output on all other platforms.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>The program hangs when using <code>walk_builder.same_file_system(true)</code>.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>ignore should either succeed or return an error in case the operation is not supported.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the bug report. While I do have a mac that I use for testing, I&#x27;m unlikely to look at this unless a small reproduction can be provided. I don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to debug an entire application like fd. Sorry.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay, after creating a pretty minimal repro, <a href="https://travis-ci.com/FallenWarrior2k/ignore-darwin-hang-repro">Travis results</a> show that it&#x27;s apparently not an actual hang, but just insanely slow in Travis CI&#x27;s <code>os: osx</code> environments.
I&#x27;ll be closing this as it&#x27;s not a bug, but rather a (presumably external) performance issue that&#x27;s probably not even related to <code>ignore</code> itself.</p>
