            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The installation instructions are here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation</p>
<p>I don't understand the error message you've given and I don't know anything about Atom or what it has to do with how your search tool is installed. I'd recommend filing an issue on the <code>atom-goto-definition</code> repo.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Folks, I can't help you if you don't help me understand your problems. Please tell me in as much detail as possible what you did, what you saw and what you expected to see. Did you run commands? If so, which ones and what were their output? Did you download executables and run them? If so, what happened? Did you see any errors? What version of Windows do you have?</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't work&quot; <strong>is not helpful</strong>. Please provide more details.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'll try to describe.
I've download binary ripgrep-0.5.0-i686-pc-windows-gnu.zip. Unzip it. Now i have thu rg.exe file.
If i run in commandline, it will work. So...
Do i need some more actions, or this is final state of &quot;install&quot; package? (download and unzip).
May be i need make something with PATH-variables, so system can see this file?</p>

<p>As far as ripgrep is concerned, that's it.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes. If another tool simply calls <code>rg.exe</code> and the directory containing <code>rg.exe</code> is not in your <code>PATH</code>, then the system does not know how to find <code>rg.exe</code>. Therefore, you must add the directory containing <code>rg.exe</code> to your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
