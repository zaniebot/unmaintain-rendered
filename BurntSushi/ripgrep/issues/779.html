Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>Feature request: add support for -L or --files-without-match.</p>
<p>This happens to be the same switch across grep, ack, and ag.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t find any such function in ripgrep, at least not in the documentation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I looked for &quot;not&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;invert&quot; words but I didn&#x27;t find this one. It&#x27;s ironic as I got the <code>--files-without-match</code> from grep manual.
So any reason why not to support -L as well?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hyperknot Because it&#x27;s already used to tell ripgrep to follow symbolic links, which is consistent with <code>find</code>&#x27;s flag for the same behavior. This is also documented:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -h | rg -e -L
    -L, --follow                            Follow symbolic links.
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ag</code> uses <code>-L</code> for <code>--files-without-match</code>, and also has a <code>-f/--follow</code> flag, but <code>-f</code> is used in ripgrep (and grep) for searching for many patterns from a file, which is a feature that <code>ag</code> does not have.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>grep uses <code>-R</code> for following symbolic links during recursive search, where <code>-r</code> is the normal variant. In hindsight, it is plausible that ripgrep should have used <code>-R</code> as well (although the lowercase <code>-r</code> variant doesn&#x27;t make sense since that&#x27;s ripgrep&#x27;s default behavior), which would have left <code>-L</code> open for <code>--files-without-match</code>. However, that is <em>certainly</em> not happening now.</p>
<p>My feeling is that <code>--files-without-match</code> isn&#x27;t used too often, and adding a short flag for it other than <code>-L</code> would confuse matters even more. But if someone has a better idea, I&#x27;m all ears.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe just add the words &quot;invert&quot; or &quot;not&quot; or something like this to the help, as the other options use these words for negation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hyperknot I can do that. It&#x27;s in my local changes which should get pushed out soon and will be in the next release.</p>
