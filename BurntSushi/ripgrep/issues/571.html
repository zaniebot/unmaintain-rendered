            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve read the part about regex in the README, is there no way you would consider adding more regex syntax to ripgrep? I really like it, and I&#x27;d love to use it, but I use a lot of regex. Things like:</p>
<pre><code>rg -tpy &#x27;def (?=[A-Z])[a-zA-Z\-_]+\(.+\):&#x27;`
</code></pre>
<p>don&#x27;t even work and forces me to write things like:</p>
<pre><code>rg -tpy &#x27;[a-zA-Z\-_]+\(.+\):&#x27; | ggrep -P &#x27;def (?=[A-Z])&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>I might as well just use (GNU) grep, which is quite a shame. I really enjoy ripgrep&#x27;s sane defaults and usability.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>regex</code> crate is based on / inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RE2_(software">RE2</a>), which is deliberately designed to avoid back-tracking for safety and edge-case-performance reasons; as a consequence it doesn&#x27;t support look-around features like this.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t figure out why you need look-ahead for the case you&#x27;ve provided, but anyway — <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"><code>ag</code></a> uses PCRE, which does support these features, if that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s critically important to you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks @okdana, that covered it. :)</p>
<p>Another tool that supports fancier features is Universal Code Grep, which uses PCRE2: https://github.com/gvansickle/ucg</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And yes, I also can&#x27;t figure out why you need look around for the given example. Your broader point is reasonably accurate though. Sometimes the lack of lookaround forces you to use a pipeline, but that should eliminate the lookaround, unlike in your example.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unless i&#x27;m misunderstanding, it seems like you should just be able to do <code>def [A-Z][A-Za-z_-]+</code> or w/e</p>
