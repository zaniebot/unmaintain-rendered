            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,
It would be great to have native Windows ARM64 binaries available. While Windows on ARM can emulate x86 and x64 binaries, this comes with a performance overhead.
Thanks so much for considering this!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess I&#x27;m open to this, but someone will likely need to do the leg work to add it to the release pipeline <em>and test that it works</em>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was hoping I might be able to give this a shot, but it seems Github only offers their Windows ARM64 hosted runners under their Teams and Enterprise plans.</p>
<p>I do, however, see that rust has an arm64 (emulated) target (<code>arm64ec-pc-windows-msvc</code>), so that&#x27;s at least half way there...</p>
<p>Given that there&#x27;s currently no free-tier Windows ARM64 hosted instance, I assume this probably isn&#x27;t on the horizon and would have to be something done locally or maintained separately by someone else until it can be baked into the official test/release pipeline?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That sounds about right assuming that background research is right. And for this to be something I&#x27;m willing to accept, I need to 1) be able to maintain it and 2) rely on it to work somewhat reliably. Debugging CI on release failures is a big time sink and probably why I don&#x27;t do releases more often. So for example, &quot;hey let&#x27;s depend on this GitHub Action that was just published and has 5 commits&quot; probably won&#x27;t fly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As a followup, I&#x27;d be willing to take a shot at this.</p>
<p>It will be potentially a few weeks before I can get my hands on an arm64 Windows machine for full testing though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Found a blocker: the rustup action used by ripgrep fails on Windows ARM <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/rust-toolchain/issues/143">dtolnay/rust-toolchain#143</a>. Seems that the ARM image doesn&#x27;t bundle rustup, unlike the x64 image.</p>
