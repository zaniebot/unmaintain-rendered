            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p><code>0.1.16</code></p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<pre><code>sudo apt install ripgrep
</code></pre>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<pre><code>$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
Release:	20.04
Codename:	focal
</code></pre>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>Ripgrep applies root level ignore patterns such as <code>/a/**</code> to subdirectories. A <code>.gitignore</code> like that in the root of a repository prevents ripgrep to look into any <code>a</code> subdirectory at any level. Git ignores <code>a</code> only at the root level of the repository.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<pre><code>$ mkdir bug-demo
$ cd bug-demo
$ mkdir a a/a b b/a
$ echo a &gt; a/a/a.txt
$ echo a &gt; b/a/a.txt
$ echo '/a/**' &gt; .gitignore
$ git init
$ git status
On branch master

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
	b/
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)
</code></pre>
<p>Git ignores <code>a</code> at the root level, this is correct.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add b
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
	new file:   b/a/a.txt

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore
</code></pre>
<p>So git doesn't ignore <code>b/a/a.txt</code> because of <code>/a/**</code></p>
<p>From within a subdirectory:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd b
$ echo b &gt; a/b.txt
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
	new file:   a/a.txt

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
	../.gitignore
	a/b.txt
</code></pre>
<p>So git doesn't ignore <code>b/a/b.txt</code> when called from within <code>b</code> even if it sees an <code>a</code> directory there.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>This is what happens with ripgrep, called from within the <code>b</code> directory</p>
<pre><code>$ rg a
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect. Try running again with --debug.

$ rg a --debug
DEBUG:grep::search: regex ast:
Literal {
    chars: [
        'a'
    ],
    casei: false
}
DEBUG:grep::literals: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(a)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }
DEBUG:rg::ignore: ./a ignored by Pattern { from: &quot;/home/me/bug-demo/.gitignore&quot;, original: &quot;/a/**&quot;, pat: &quot;a/**&quot;, whitelist: false, only_dir: false }
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect. Try running again with --debug.
</code></pre>
<p>This is inconsistent with git's behavior. It makes difficult or impossible to use ripgrep in some git repositories.</p>
<p>I wonder if the key is <code>original: &quot;/a/**&quot;, pat: &quot;a/**&quot;</code>: The original is <code>/a/**</code> but pat (pattern?) is <code>a/**</code> without the leading slash.</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<pre><code>$ rg a
a/a.txt
1:a

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm closing the issue. I did install ripgrep with <code>sudo apt install ripgrep</code> but I didn't realize that I downloaded a binary two years ago into a directory with higher precedence in my PATH, then forgot about it.
I removed the old binary and the newer version (ripgrep 11.0.2) works well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pmontrasio Nice! And no problem. Bugs that fix themselves before I even have a chance to read them are great. :-)</p>
<p>Do note though that ripgrep 11.0.2 is itself almost two years old: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1102-2019-08-01</p>
