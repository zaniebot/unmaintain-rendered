# grep's great --file option not implemented

---

_@seamusabshere_

```
 -f file, --file=file
    Read one or more newline separated patterns from file.  Empty pattern
    lines match every input line.  Newlines are not considered part of a
    pattern.  If file is empty, nothing is matched.
```

🌞 note that neither `ag` or `ack` have this, so it would be another differentiator!
