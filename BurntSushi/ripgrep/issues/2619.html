            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi.</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of upgrading the regex crates (regex, regex-syntax, regex-automata, aho-corasick etc). However the current release of grep-regex depends on an old version of regex-syntax.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve looked at the commit history to investigate the possibility of cherry-picking the changes, but the number of patches involved seems significant and it&#x27;s not clear to me if things are in a release-worthy state.</p>
<p>Is there any chance of a release of the grep crates that uses the latest version of the regex crates in the not too distant future?</p>

<p>I am actually working on the ripgrep 14 release. Things are still shifting quite a bit, so pulling patches probably isn&#x27;t the greatest idea but is doable if necessary.</p>
