<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 14.0.3</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Using ripgrep_14.0.3-1_amd64.deb</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Ubuntu 20.04</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>Using <code>(?x)</code> to add comments isn&#x27;t working due to automatic wrapping of the supplied pattern within <code>(?:)</code>.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Any pattern which uses <code>(?x)</code> and a comment.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<pre><code>$ echo &#x27;fig a#b 123&#x27; | rg -o &#x27;(?x)\d+ #extract digits&#x27;
regex parse error:
    (?:(?x)\d+ #extract digits)
    ^
error: unclosed group
</code></pre>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>I think automatic wrapping of patterns inside non-capturing group was introducted for this issue: <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2480">BurntSushi/ripgrep#2480</a>. If possible, don&#x27;t modify the pattern when there&#x27;s a comment. Or may be add a note in the documentation for this corner case.</p>
<p>FWIW, <code>GNU grep</code> doesn&#x27;t support multiple patterns via <code>-e</code> or <code>-f</code> for PCRE:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo &#x27;fig a#b 123&#x27; | grep -oP &#x27;(?x)\d+ #extract digits&#x27;
123

$ echo &#x27;MyText&#x27; | grep -P -e &#x27;(?i)notintext&#x27; -e &#x27;text&#x27;
grep: the -P option only supports a single pattern
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There&#x27;s really no way to get this completely right without individually validating each regex. I very specifically wanted to avoid doing that because of the extra cost it would add. With that said, now that I&#x27;m thinking about it more, it might be possible to do that with a fast path that skips the check in most cases. (For example, if a pattern doesn&#x27;t contain a meta character anywhere, then you know it&#x27;s valid. That would help when searching large dictionaries of literals.)</p>
<p>But yeah, when I added a fix for #2480, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t work in all cases. Another example of this is <code>rg &#x27;)(&#x27;</code>. That should be invalid, but it actually works.</p>
<p>With that said, one thing I realized here is that by adding the group around the regex, that group (which the user did not type) now appears in error messages. That&#x27;s bad juju and I&#x27;ll need to revert that for that reason alone. When I do that, I&#x27;ll look into validating each pattern manually.</p>
<p>For PCRE2, we&#x27;ll probably just need to accept a <code>wontfix</code> bug there. I don&#x27;t see a good reason to completely disable multi-pattern matching there just for this reason.</p>
