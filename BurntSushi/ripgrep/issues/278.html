            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep seems to ignore unintended files when the base directory is not the current directory.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<pre><code>% mkdir -p ../test/foo
% echo &#x27;.*&#x27; &gt;../test/.gitignore
% echo baz &gt;../test/foo/bar

% rg baz ../test
../test/foo/bar
1:baz

% rg baz ../test/foo
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn&#x27;t expect. Try running again with --debug.
</code></pre>
<p>I found the following lines in <code>ignore/src/dir.rs</code> don&#x27;t make sense because <code>path</code> on the right side is a relative path from the current directory, not from <code>abs_parent_path</code>.</p>
<pre><code>339         if let Some(abs_parent_path) = self.absolute_base() {
340             let path = abs_parent_path.join(path);
</code></pre>
<p>A possible fix to run the example above correctly is the following.  However, I&#x27;m not sure this fixes other cases.</p>
<pre><code>let path = path.canonicalize().unwrap()
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a tough one to fix.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the proposed solution can never work. Canonicalizing candidate paths does seem like the obvious solution---and I&#x27;ve been tempted to do it because it simplifies so much---but it has two significant problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Canonicalization erases symlinks and <code>ignore</code> files are symlink aware. If we erased symlinks, lots of <code>ignore</code> files would break.</li>
<li>Canonicalization is expensive.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are the key values in this particular case, assuming we&#x27;ve reproduced your test case inside <code>/tmp/ripgrep-278</code>, and searching from inside <code>/tmp/ripgrep-278/nested</code> for <code>../test/foo</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The absolute base path is <code>/tmp/ripgrep-278/test/foo</code>, which is derived by canonicalizing the search path <code>../test/foo</code>.</li>
<li>The root directory that sets the context for the <code>.gitignore</code> file is <code>/tmp/ripgrep-278/test</code>.</li>
<li>The candidate file path is <code>../test/foo/bar</code>.</li>
<li>The path that we actually search is <code>foo/../test/foo/bar</code>, which is generated by joining the absolute base path (<code>/tmp/ripgrep-278/test/foo</code>) with the candidate file path (<code>../test/foo/bar</code>) and then stripping the gitignore directory path prefix (<code>/tmp/ripgrep-278/test</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>That last step is where things go bad. In particular, the text that we <em>actually</em> match should be just <code>foo/bar</code>.</p>
<p>More generally, relative components like <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> should probably never be present when doing a match, which potentially suggests that we need a <code>realpath</code> that does what it does today, but leaves symlinks in tact. However, doing that for every single file path is a non-starter. It would be too expensive.</p>
<p>Part of the problem here is that we&#x27;re canonicalizing the parent directory paths, which is one way of traversing <em>up</em> the file hierarchy to find parent gitignore files. Doing this canonicalization inherently makes the parent directory paths get out of sync with the search paths, which is what causes the last step above to fail. If we found a way to go up the tree without canonicalization, then perhaps that would fix this. Let&#x27;s try:</p>
<ul>
<li>The absolute base path is <code>../test/foo</code>, which is taken directly from the search path <code>../test/foo</code> since <code>../test/foo</code> is a directory.</li>
<li>The root directory that sets the context for the <code>.gitignore</code> file is <code>../test</code>.</li>
<li>The candidate file path is <code>../test/foo/bar</code>.</li>
<li>The path that we actually search is <code>foo/bar</code>, which is generated by simply stripping the gitignore directory path prefix (<code>../test</code>) from the candidate file path (<code>../test/foo</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The interesting bits come from parent directories at <code>..</code> and above. You wind up with absolute base paths like <code>../../../</code>, which will infect the gitignore context directories. This means that a gitignore context directory at <code>../..</code> and above will never be a prefix of a candidate file path, which makes matching problematic. However, if we canonicalized file paths at <code>..</code> and above and synced this up with our candidate file paths, then I think that could be make to work.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;m likely to fix this, but I thought it&#x27;d be useful to try to write up the problem and a possible solution.</p>
<p>Sorry it took me so long to get to this, but I had a feeling this was going to be a fairly intricate bug, so I stayed away. :-(</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is one other solution. Notably, this command gives the correct output:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg baz $(realpath ../test/foo)
</code></pre>
<p>ripgrep <em>could</em> canonicalize (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4774116/realpath-without-resolving-symlinks">sans symlinks</a>) only the paths given by the user. This still might be costly, but we could limit it only to paths that contain <code>..</code>. Unfortunately, this becomes pervasive, because that canonicalization will influence the paths printed by ripgrep in the results, which could be annoying to users.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@tmccombs I wish I could be the oracle you want me to be, but I don&#x27;t have the context to answer your query. Unfortunately, the quickest way to fix this bug probably requires you to read and understand the code. You&#x27;ll need to experiment and debug.</p>
