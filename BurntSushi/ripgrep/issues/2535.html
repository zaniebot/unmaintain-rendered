            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>w:\sandbox\test&gt;rg --version
ripgrep 13.0.0 (rev af6b6c543b)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 10</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>I would like to search for text in a subset of files, not all of them. I tried using <code>-g/--glob</code>, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<pre><code>w:\sandbox\test&gt;type nul&gt;test.txt

w:\sandbox\test&gt;nvim test.txt # Add &#x27;lib&#x27; to the file

w:\sandbox\test&gt;rg lib
test.txt
lib

w:\sandbox\test&gt;rg lib -g &#x27;*&#x27;
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn&#x27;t expect.
Running with --debug will show why files are being skipped.
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>https://gist.github.com/ashrasmun/245ec0e48dd2b8377b0aa4616b7e9b2d</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>I would like to search for string &#x27;lib&#x27; in a narrow set of files, not all of them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report. Can you say why you didn&#x27;t run with <code>--debug</code> and show the output, as the error message suggests?</p>
<p>My best guess is that you have a Windows problem. IIRC, single quotes don&#x27;t work the way your command suggests you think they do: https://superuser.com/questions/324278/how-to-make-windows-command-prompt-treat-single-quote-as-though-it-is-a-double-q</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to read a tutorial on how to use the Windows command line. I&#x27;m not a Windows user myself so I&#x27;m not sure what the best one might be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>They actually provided the <code>--debug</code> output in the gist, and it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: &quot;**/&#x27;*&#x27;&quot;, re: &quot;(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)&#x27;[^/]*&#x27;$&quot;</code> [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, the single quotes are interpreted literally and they end up in the glob pattern.</p>
