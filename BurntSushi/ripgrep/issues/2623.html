            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It turns out that ripgrep's <code>-w/--word-regexp</code> flag doesn't quite do what it claims to. And as a result, it actually differs from GNU grep in some cases (and even with PCRE2 within ripgrep):</p>
<pre><code>$ echo '###' | grep -w -o .
#
#
#
$ echo '###' | rg-13.0.0 -w -o .
#
#
$ echo '###' | rg-13.0.0 -P -w -o .
#
#
#
</code></pre>
<p>ripgrep 14 will fix this:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo '###' | rg-14.0.0 -w -o .
#
#
#
</code></pre>
<p>The actual issue here is that ripgrep used a hacky work-around to implement <code>-w/--word-regexp</code> that just didn't work right in all cases. For PCRE2, it was implemented via look-around assertions that always got it right:</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/52731cdfb2e1f10ee068d8c40fac819484615c81/crates/pcre2/src/matcher.rs#L64-L69</p>
<p>The work-around I used basically tried to emulate look-around with capture groups. And while it works in a lot of cases, it doesn't work in all of them. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to fix the work-around once and for all, but couldn't see a way to make the code obviously correct. Instead, I just added support for <code>\b{start-half}</code> and <code>\b{end-half}</code> word boundary assertions that do exactly what the look-around does in PCRE2. See: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/469</p>
