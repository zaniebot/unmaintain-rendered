<p>ripgrep 13.0.0 (rev af6b6c543b)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Via chocolatey</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>Ripgrep doesn't find a match with literal string <code>&lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=&quot;0</code>.
I hope this is not a quote/escaping/whitespace issue on my side. See also the repro script below.
Removing the trailing <code>0</code> reports a single match as expected.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p><strong>app.config</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=&quot;0.0.0.0-12.0.0.0&quot; newVersion=&quot;12.0.0.0&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Input (Powershell)</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">rg -F &quot;&lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=`&quot;0&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> `&quot; escapes quotation marks.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>No output is provided.</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>A single match result.</p>
