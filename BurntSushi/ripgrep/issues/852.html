Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>It is possible for ripgrep to fail to open a memory map with the <code>ENOMEM</code> error. In particular, I believe this can happen if one tries to search a file that is bigger than available memory. I had thought this case would be OK since the OS could handle swapping the file into and out of memory, but I now wonder whether this is caused by overcommit settings?</p>
<p>No matter the cause, if the mmap fails with ENOMEM, then we should probably just fall back to standard read/write calls. (One wonders whether we should do this regardless of how mmap fails.)</p>
<p>This bug was found as part of the investigation in #850.</p>
