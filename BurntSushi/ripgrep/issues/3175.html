            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your feature request</h4>
<p>Currently when <code>-r</code> flag is passed to replace a matched string, when no match is found, ripgrep fails with code <code>1</code> and it breaks pipe excution. I am using ripgrep to clean the found output, wich sometimes might contain some text, which I want to get rid of:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ansifilter some.log | rg -oN &quot;some pattern&quot; | rg ' \(?[0-9]+ *(ms|s)\)?$' -r '' | sort | uniq -d
</code></pre>
<p>The second <code>rg</code> call is to remove duration marks, which sometimes exist, and sometimes not. When they don't above command would fail. As a workaround I am using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ansifilter some.log | rg -oN &quot;some pattern&quot; | { rg ' \(?[0-9]+ *(ms|s)\)?$' -r '' || true } | sort | uniq -d
</code></pre>
<p>This works, but I would prefer to have a switch (eg: <code>--ignore-missing</code> or <code>-R</code> as opposite to <code>-r</code>) and silently ignore when replace could not find a match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ansifilter some.log | rg -oN &quot;some pattern&quot; | rg ' \(?[0-9]+ *(ms|s)\)?$' -R '' | sort | uniq -d
ansifilter some.log | rg -oN &quot;some pattern&quot; | rg ' \(?[0-9]+ *(ms|s)\)?$' -r '' --ignore-missing | sort | uniq -d
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unless you have to use it zillion of times and remember about it. Maybe additional flag is not worth it but <code>-R</code> to ignore when pattern does not exists sound like a good compromise...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep has over 100 flags. I can't add a new flag for every niche use case, especially when there is an easy work-around. And I'm definitely not using one of the few remaining unused short flags for something like this.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble remembering to use it and you happen to use it a lot, then the solution is to write a wrapper script with the behavior you want.</p>
