            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently <code>globset::GlobMatcher</code> only have method to match against the path. However what I would also need is to have method that would return something like <code>Option&lt;Match&gt;</code> where I could extract the thing that was matched by <code>*</code> ONLY. That functionality is unavailabe in neither <code>glob</code> nor <code>globset</code>. I am currently on my mobile, so I will provide exact example later.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hauleth Can you please describe the problem you're trying to solve? This description should not mention the <code>glob</code> or <code>globset</code> crates at all. In other words, <em>what is your specification</em>?</p>
<p>Can you also please provide an example of a globbing library that does what you want?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do not know any glowing library that support such feature, but basically what I need is something to match path like <code>a/b/c/d.rs</code> to glob <code>a/*.rs</code> and be able to extract part <code>b/c/d</code> which is the part matched by <code>*</code> in glob pattern. I need this to provide functionality of Projectionist that allow me to provide &quot;alternate&quot; files for given file which simply are path substitution based on glob.</p>

<p>I also don't know of any globbing library that supports it. Probably because &quot;capturing groups&quot; aren't a thing in globs, so I don't see how you expect this to work at all.</p>
