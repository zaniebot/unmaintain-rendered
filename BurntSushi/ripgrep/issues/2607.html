            <div class="timeline-body">Option to disable searching when given an empty pattern
<p>When using ripgrep with an empty pattern (e.g. <code>rg &quot;&quot;</code>) it matches every line in every file. This was unexpected behavior for me but <code>grep</code> behaves the same (e.g. <code>grep --recursive &quot;&quot; .</code>). However there are use-cases where this behavior is problematic:</p>
<p>I am trying to use ripgrep with skim to search a code base with a preview. There is an <a href="https://github.com/lotabout/skim#preview-window">example</a> on their github page that uses <code>ag</code> aka. <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">the silver searcher</a>. I tried to use <code>rg</code> instead of <code>ag</code> like this: <code>sk --ansi -i -c &#x27;rg --color always --line-number &quot;{}&quot;&#x27; --preview &quot;preview.sh {}&quot;</code>. This works, however in contrast to <code>ag</code> <code>rg</code> starts listing every line of every file in the code base because before the user of <code>sk</code> inputs anything <code>&quot;&quot;</code> is provided to <code>rg</code> as pattern. This can generate a LOT of overhead depending on the code base. Therefore it would be cool if <code>rg &quot;&quot;</code> would no produce results or offer an option to disable it.</p>

<p>Yes, this is correct behavior. The empty regex matches the empty string and every string (including the empty string) contains the empty string. Just like every set is a superset of the empty set.</p>
<p>See also: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/discussions/896</p>

<p>IMO, the way <code>ag</code> behaves is a bug:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo bar | ag &#x27;&#x27;
ERR: Error: No query. What do you want to search for?
$ echo bar | rg &#x27;&#x27;
bar
$ echo bar | grep &#x27;&#x27;
bar
$ echo bar | ack &#x27;&#x27;
bar
</code></pre>
<p>It&#x27;s not like PCRE doesn&#x27;t support searching for empty patterns:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo bar | ag &#x27;(?:)&#x27;
bar
</code></pre>
<p>IMO, this request is basically an instance of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">this xkcd</a>.</p>
<p>I also think this is just generally a poor interaction pattern with tools like skim (and also fzf). I agree that starting a search with an exhaustive search for the empty pattern is bad UX, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should change the meaning of the empty pattern. It means we shouldn&#x27;t start searches with the empty pattern. Instead, either start without searching at all (probably a harder interaction pattern to implement) or start it with a regex that can never match. In the latter case, you can use <code>rg &#x27;a^b&#x27;</code> for the current release. In the next release, <code>rg &#x27;[a&amp;&amp;b]&#x27;</code> will work.</p>
<p>Once you have that, it&#x27;s not hard to write a wrapper to do a translation for you:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo bar | rg &#x27;&#x27;
bar
$ cat /tmp/rg-no-empty-pattern
#!/bin/bash

args=()
for arg; do
  if [ &quot;$arg&quot; = &quot;&quot; ]; then
    args=(&quot;${args[@]}&quot; &quot;a^b&quot;)
  else
    args=(&quot;${args[@]}&quot; &quot;$arg&quot;)
  fi
done
exec rg &quot;${args[@]}&quot;
$ echo bar | /tmp/rg-no-empty-pattern &#x27;&#x27;
$
</code></pre>

<p>Yes it is. That&#x27;s why I suggested to make it an option: Just a parameter called <code>--skip-empty-pattern</code> or something.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to accept a PR that would add such an option?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, sorry. ripgrep already has way too many flags, and if I accepted every request such as yours, it would grow to an unimaginable number. You&#x27;ll need to use a wrapper script like the one I gave you or change the interaction pattern.</p>
