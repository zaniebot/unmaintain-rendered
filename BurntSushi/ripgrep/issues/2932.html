<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>apt repository</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 10 with WSL 2.3.24.0
Android with Termux</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>I have a regex which searches whether a certain set of keywords exist within a single block (delimited by <code>END</code>)</p>
<p>When I put the regex and file contents into &lt;regex101.com&gt; (with PCRE2 engine), it would match from the very end of line 1 to the end of line 3. With <code>--only-matching</code>, there should be zero characters matched for line 1, thus it should output nothing. Line 2 only matches line boundaries, so it should also output nothing. The only line that should be outputted should be line 3 (unless I misunderstood ripgrep&#x27;s behavior).</p>
<p>When I use <code>--count --include-zero</code>, it would show no matches (<code>test.md:0</code>), which I believe means ripgrep is not matching anything at all, yet it is still outputting lines. But it&#x27;s not outputting <em>every line</em> in the file, it&#x27;s outputting the precise lines that are involved in the match (if ripgrep was in &quot;always printed whole lines&quot; mode).</p>
<p>I have using the following flags (none of these had any effect):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--mmap</code> and <code>--no-mmap</code></li>
<li><code>--line-buffered</code> and <code>block-buffered</code></li>
<li>Using <code>(?ims)</code> and not using it</li>
<li><code>--regex-size-limit 1G</code></li>
<li><code>-uuu</code></li>
</ul>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>I have a test markdown file (called <code>test.md</code>) with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>Testword4 END

Testword5 Testword6 
This is a test sentence.

</code></pre>
<p>This is the search command:</p>
<pre><code>rg --type md --ignore-case --pcre2 --no-heading --with-filename --line-number --multiline --multiline-dotall --only-matching &#x27;(?ims)(?:\A|(?&lt;=END))(?=(?:(?!END).)*?testword5)(?=(?:(?!END).)*?testword6)(?=(?:(?!END).)*?testword4)[\s]*?[\S][^\n]*?$&#x27;
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<pre><code>test.md:1:Testword4 END
test.md:2:
test.md:3:Testword5 Testword6
</code></pre>
What is the expected behavior?
<pre><code>test.md:3:Testword5 Testword6
</code></pre>
<p>The thing is, if I make one of the following adjustments as shown below, now it suddenly works as expected (I have no clue why).</p>
<p>Shortening contents in the block being matched</p>
<pre><code>Testword4 END

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have made changes which I discussed further down the comment, but the following paragraph is the central part of the issue:
The regex works as expected, what ripgrep outputs isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong per say, I&#x27;m just wondering why the results are <em>inconsistent</em> with the way ripgrep treats empty lines based on <em>changes in the input file</em>. Why does it seem like the <code>--only-matching</code> flag gets dropped when I change the input file? Is it a memory problem or the way ripgrep reads files?</p>
Changes
<p>I updated to ripgrep 14.1.1. I simplified the rg command to the following:</p>
<pre><code>rg --pcre2 --multiline --multiline-dotall --only-matching &#x27;(?=.*Testword4)(?=.*Testword5)[\s]*?[\S][^\n]*?$&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>It is seeing whether <code>Testword4</code> and <code>Testword5</code> both exists anywhere in the string, and then matching up to the first non-empty line.</p>
<p>I also simplified the test file:</p>
<pre><code>

Testword5  
This is a test sentence.
This is a test sentence.
This is a test sentence.
This is a test sentence.
This is a test sentence.

</code></pre>
<p>Actual results:</p>
<pre><code>test.md
1:
2:
3:Testword5
</code></pre>
<p>Expected:</p>
<pre><code>test.md
3:Testword5
</code></pre>
<p>If I change the test file like this:</p>
<pre><code>

Testword5
This is a test sentence.
This is a test sentence.
This is a test sentence.
Testword4

<p>Now it outputs the expected results:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for the explanation!</p>
<p>I am not familiar with Rust nor search engine implementations, so I have a few more questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the 128 bytes for <code>MAX_LOOK_AHEAD</code> mean ripgrep will give up look-ahead matching if the current character is 128 bytes away from the beginning of the match?</li>
<li>I saw the terms &quot;searching&quot; and &quot;printing&quot; in the other issue you linked. In my case, it still produces the correct match, just with an unexpected formatting, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a &quot;printing&quot; bug. Does this bug only impact the &quot;printing&quot; stage? Or will ripgrep sometimes produce outright incorrect matches?</li>
<li>If I modify the end of the regex to match more lines (rather than up till the first non-empty line), it&#x27;ll output/print no problem for whatever reason. The lookahead portions are left unchanged. Is that also because of the way ripgrep treats lookahead?</li>
