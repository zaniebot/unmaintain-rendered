            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>just been trying ripgrep for the first time, but I couldn't find an easy and straightforward way to just output the matching pattern.</p>
<p>For example, trying to search in a file like this:
<code>rg &quot;(\{.*\}\})&quot; example.txt</code></p>
<p>The regex matching works as intended, correct result is highlighted in bold red text.</p>
<p>But when I tried to redirect (&quot;pipe&quot;) the output to another program I realized that the actual output is still the unchanged input.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? I couldn't find an option just for this output, seemed pretty straightforward to me, but neither <code>rg --help</code> or the front page here seem to mention something..</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's a missing feature: #34. It's on my list of things to do soon, but it's part of a larger refactoring effort, so it might take a little longer.</p>
<p>There is a work around today though. You can use the <code>-r/--replace</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code>rg &quot;(\{.*\}\})&quot; example.txt -r '$1'</code></pre>
<p>I think that should do it. (On mobile so i haven't checked.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>rg &quot;(\{.*\}\})&quot; example.txt -r '$1'</code></p>
<p>Not really. Replacing works as intended apparently, in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>match and take capture group 1</li>
<li>replace with reference 1, i.e. capture group 1 again</li>
</ul>
<p>But the thing is, the actual output is still unchanged, because the program always returns the whole line where the match was found.</p>
<p>To help illustrate things better, I made an example file: https://fnpaste.com/YZvd</p>
<p>But I found a way around this: Changing the rx syntax to match the whole line, and then replace the whole line with capture group 1.</p>
<p>For example:
<code>rg &quot;.*40 (\{.*\}\}).*&quot; example.txt -r &quot;$1&quot;</code></p>
<p>This gives me the desired part. But there is a big caveat: I use the <code>40 </code> as an anchor to make the group match the correct part, but this is specific for this example only, I don't actually know the value.</p>
<p>I tried <code>&quot;.*(\{.*\}\}).*&quot;</code> in my text editor and it actually works there, whereas the same pattern only matches the last <code>{...}}</code> part of the target inside the line with rg.</p>
<p>I'm not really familiar with the intricacies of regular expressions in Rust, so this needs a bit of tweaking, I guess, although it should definitely be possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You're right. I forgot to add that you need to make your regex match the entire line in order for <code>-r/--replace</code> to work like <code>-o/--only-matching</code>.</p>
<p>I think this gives the desired output for you though:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg '^.*?(\{.*\}\}).*?$' example.txt -r '$1'
</code></pre>
<p>The trick is to make the <code>.*</code> lazy by using <code>.*?</code>. When it's lazy, it will try to match the least possible. Otherwise, it tries to match the most possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>That did the trick just fine, greedy vs. lazy, obviously..</p>
<p>I'll close this issue for now.
We have a good workaround, and you already said that this is on your list of things to do, so I guess all is fine..</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there some easy syntax to output only certain but several capture group indexes?</p>
<p>Let's say with pcregrep there is a way to do this:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'foo bar baz qux' | pcregrep -o1 -o2 '(bar )baz (qux)'
</code></pre>
<p>Which will produce:</p>
<pre><code>bar qux
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose that --replace method with capturing the whole line would help, but something easier would be useful.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sure:</p>
<pre><code>echo 'foo bar baz qux' | rg '(bar )baz (qux)' -or '$1$2'
</code></pre>
