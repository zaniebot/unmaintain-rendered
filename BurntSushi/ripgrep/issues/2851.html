<p>There is a lot of effort in heuristics of when mmapping will be a bit faster than normal reads.
I would like to use it for my programs so what I did is mostly copypasting the code which is not ideal. Do you think you could release that part as a crate for the ecosystem?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s in the grep-searcher crate.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re talking about splitting it out from there into an even smaller crate, then I don&#x27;t really support micro crates like that. I would suggest starting your own crate if you are of that philosophy.</p>
