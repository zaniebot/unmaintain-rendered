            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When <code>--threads 1</code> is given to <code>ripgrep</code>, it should not write results to an intermediate buffer. In particular, if every search is serialized (as it is when <code>--threads 1</code> is given), then no synchronization is needed to print to <code>stdout</code>, and therefore, no intermediate buffer is needed.</p>
<p>This should be somewhat straight-forward, since the searcher is generic over a <code>Printer&lt;W: Terminal&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In #4, I ended up doing this, but only when there was a single file (or <code>stdin</code>) to be searched.</p>
