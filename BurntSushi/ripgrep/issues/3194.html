<ul>
<li>[x] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<pre><code>ripgrep 15.0.0

features:+pcre2
simd(compile):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2
simd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2

PCRE2 10.45 is available (JIT is available)
</code></pre>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>Bug appears when built locally with Cargo as well as the binaries provided on the release page</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>Arch Linux -- kernel <code>6.17.3</code></p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>I've been using ripgrep to filter <code>journalctl</code> output in follow mode for years and thus need the <code>--line-buffered</code> option otherwise nothing is output since <code>stdin</code> doesn't close.  With the latest release that switch doesn't appear to be having any affect.</p>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<p>No output:</p>
<pre><code>journalctl -n5 -f | ./rg --no-config --line-buffered  'Oct'</code></pre>
<p>Does produce some output -- I assume this is because the &quot;block buffer&quot; is getting full?</p>
<pre><code>journalctl -n5000 -f | ./rg --no-config --line-buffered  'Oct'</code></pre>
<p>When run with &lt; <code>15.0.0</code> each line that is matched is output as soon as it's printed by <code>journalctl</code>.  Obviously you'll have to adjust the search to match whatever's in your logs.</p>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p>Same as &quot;steps to reproduce&quot;</p>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>Match lines (or inverse matches with <code>-v</code>) should be output as soon as they're output by the pipe</p>
