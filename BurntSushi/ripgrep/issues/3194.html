<ul>
<li>[x] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>ripgrep 15.0.0

features:+pcre2
simd(compile):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2
simd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2

PCRE2 10.45 is available (JIT is available)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Bug appears when built locally with Cargo as well as the binaries provided on the release page</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Arch Linux -- kernel <code>6.17.3</code></p>
Describe your bug.
<p>I&#x27;ve been using ripgrep to filter <code>journalctl</code> output in follow mode for years and thus need the <code>--line-buffered</code> option otherwise nothing is output since <code>stdin</code> doesn&#x27;t close.  With the latest release that switch doesn&#x27;t appear to be having any affect.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>No output:</p>
<pre><code>journalctl -n5 -f | ./rg --no-config --line-buffered  &#x27;Oct&#x27;</code></pre>
<p>Does produce some output -- I assume this is because the &quot;block buffer&quot; is getting full?</p>
<pre><code>journalctl -n5000 -f | ./rg --no-config --line-buffered  &#x27;Oct&#x27;</code></pre>
<p>When run with &lt; <code>15.0.0</code> each line that is matched is output as soon as it&#x27;s printed by <code>journalctl</code>.  Obviously you&#x27;ll have to adjust the search to match whatever&#x27;s in your logs.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>Same as &quot;steps to reproduce&quot;</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>Match lines (or inverse matches with <code>-v</code>) should be output as soon as they&#x27;re output by the pipe</p>
