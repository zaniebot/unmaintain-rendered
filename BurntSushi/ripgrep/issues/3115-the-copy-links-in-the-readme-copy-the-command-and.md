# The "copy" links in the README copy the command AND the leading $

_@lauralindzey_

First, thank you for including links to copy the commands! Not having to use the mouse to select text is a lot happier for my workflow.

However, when I paste the result, I get e.g. `$ brew install ripgrep`, which isn't a valid command :-)
