            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Grep doesn't have this feature either.</p>
<p>Something I do fairly frequently is try to extract patterns within a file which may occur one or more times per line, and output them one per line for further processing. For example, I have files with lines like this:</p>
<pre><code>- {SW Legends} foo bar {33k + 2k + 11k words}
- {SW} blah blah {160k words atow}
</code></pre>
<p>and I try to extract just the word counts, individually.</p>
<p>Currently I use multiple invocations and xargs:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -o '[\d\s+.k]+ words' file.md | xargs | ag -o '[\d.]+'
33
2
11
160
</code></pre>
<p>But I'd really like to be able to run something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -o '$n' '\{((?P&lt;n&gt;[\d.]+)k[\s+]*)+ words[^}]*\}' file.md
</code></pre>
<p>and obtain the same result.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The example above uses <code>ag</code> on the second invocation because of #468.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems like a complex feature. I don't think you need <code>xargs</code> in your pipeline. If I remove it, then your example still works. Having to use a simple pipeline seems fine?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm. In this case, yes. I've had other cases where the multiple invocation approach wouldn't work. I'll reopen if/when I find those?</p>
