<p>I am not experienced with ripgrep at all so it&#x27;s hard for me to evaluate how CPU bound it is and how much a faster I/O subsystem can further increase its overall performance but it might be worth looking into.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No. Or at least, not without some compelling evidence that it would be worthwhile. In the common case, ripgrep is CPU bound, because you&#x27;re usually using it to search things repeatedly (like a code repository). In the case where ripgrep isn&#x27;t CPU bound, it&#x27;s not clear why aync I/O would necessarily improve things. ripgrep already uses parallelism.</p>
<p>The benefits of io_uring in ripgrep&#x27;s specific case would need to be <em>extremely significant</em> to make it worthwhile to use. Not only would it be a boatload of platform specific code, but it would greatly complicate ripgrep&#x27;s handling of I/O.</p>
<p>I have no plans to do this experiment myself, but others are welcome to do it.</p>
