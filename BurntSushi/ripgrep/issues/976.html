            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I often use ripgrep is search by various file suffixes, e. g. <code>rg -g '*.inl'</code>, when there's no defined type name (e. g. for Idris) or I don't remember what's the type name (e. g. for Python).</p>
<p>A small issue here is too many characters to type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*</code> sign</li>
<li>quotes for the shell</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it would be convenient if <code>rg</code> had a quick way to search simply by file suffix.</p>
<p>Currently <code>-t</code> option supports a file type for a predefined set.</p>
<p>I think it could be convenient to have an option to execute <code>rg -t .foo</code> as an alias for <code>rg -g '*.foo'</code>.</p>
<p>This is easy to implement, and sound like bikeshedding, so feel free to close the request.</p>
<p>Using <code>ripgrep 0.8.1</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the detailed request! I think I'm going to have to pass on this. I don't think it's a good fit, but reasonable people can disagree. Here are my reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like that the <code>--type</code> flag accepts exactly one kind of argument: a file type name.</li>
<li>I think that writing globs is a pretty standard thing to do when running commands, and I do not believe it to be onerous enough to justify changing the semantics of <code>--type</code>.</li>
<li>If you are using a file extension frequently enough, then you might consider adding it to the list of available types, which ripgrep makes extensible. See <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types">the guide</a> for instructions on how to do that.</li>
