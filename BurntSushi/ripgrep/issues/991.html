            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 0.8.1 (rev c8e9f25b85)
-SIMD -AVX</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Came as a module with VSCode (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Linux x64 4.10.0-20-generic
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>When running a search on a directory of many many files using <code>rg</code>, the entire system, except for mouse movement freezes.  If I&#x27;m quick enough and attempt to kill <code>rg</code>, it results in a zombie process while all the child processes continue running forever.  I don&#x27;t use <code>rg</code> under normal circumstances, but it is apparently bundled with vscode.  I&#x27;m doing a search through the Qt source code base, as stated in the VSCode issue below.</p>
<p>@roblourens suggested I post a bug report here in the following issue <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/54730">Microsoft/vscode#54730</a>.</p>
<p>Show the command you ran and the actual output. Include the <code>--debug</code> flag in
your invocation of ripgrep.</p>
<p><code>/usr/share/code/resources/app/node_modules.asar.unpacked/vscode-ripgrep/bin/rg --no-ignore --debug &quot;QT_QPA_EGLFS_INTEGRATION&quot; Qt/5.9.6/Src</code></p>
<p>I apologize for the horrible camera picture, but once it &quot;hangs&quot;, I can&#x27;t start any new processes.  If I try to do an <code>ls</code> in a separate console window, nothing happens.  I can&#x27;t shut down except for hard resetting the machine.</p>
<p>If the output is large, put it in a gist:  https://gist.github.com/jovere/47fd22f6caad3c28a27915528e6a6c55

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Exciting! Can you tell me how exactly to get a checkout of the code you&#x27;re searching? I mean, I realize it&#x27;s Qt, but what are the exact commands I should be running? (There are many Qt repos in my Google search results.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>See also #975, which produces a similar symptom, but on macOS.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My guess is this is the repo: https://github.com/qt/qt5</p>
<p>I ran</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/qt/qt5 --recursive
</code></pre>
<p>will that get me into the same state you&#x27;re in?</p>
<p>Looking at <code>htop</code>, it is interesting that all of your cores appear to be pegged while executing kernel code (assuming the red means &quot;sys&quot; time). That suggests <code>strace</code> might show something interesting.</p>
<p>Another thing to try is to run ripgrep in single threaded mode, to see if that fairs any better. You can force that with <code>-j1</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sadly, nothing interesting happens when searching that repo on my system. It finishes in about <code>350ms</code> and uses a maximum heap size of ~100MB. Running single threaded finishes in about <code>2.3s</code> with a maximum heap size of ~24MB.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for noticing the CPU time being kernel time (would explain why the entire system is brought to its knees).  I updated to the latest kernel available for Ubuntu 16.04 (4.15.0-29-generic) and it finishes nearly instantaneously.  Hopefully this doesn&#x27;t result in any other issues.
Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wow. Does this mean ripgrep tripped over a kernel bug? That&#x27;s pretty cool. I&#x27;d love to know what it was.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s pretty cool... It&#x27;s been a thorn in my side for the last few days.  I think I&#x27;ve gone through at least a dozen resets.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re masochistic, the version was 4.10.0-20.</p>
