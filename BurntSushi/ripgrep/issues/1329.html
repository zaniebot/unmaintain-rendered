            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 11.0.1
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD -AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Homebrew</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>macOS 10.14.6</p>
Describe your feature request.
<p>I would like to add extension support for searching files in the <a href="https://github.com/edn-format/edn">Extensible Data Notation (EDN)</a> format. They end in <code>.edn</code>. It&#x27;s essentially Clojure&#x27;s version of JSON.</p>
<p>The only question I&#x27;m unclear on is whether it should get its own type-list entry (like JSON) or be grouped with the rest of the Clojure extensions. Given how strongly associated it is with Clojure, I&#x27;m leaning to adding it there.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Generally, you don&#x27;t need to open issues for this. Just open a PR with what you think it should be. If you aren&#x27;t sure, then ask some other folks in the Clojure ecosystem to weigh in.</p>
