            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I accidentally made my search a bit too loose and found tons of useless results scrolling by on my screen. As works with many other command-line utilities, I used Ctrl+C to abort the search -- but I got unlucky and happened to abort while in a colored sequence, so the color then bled into my whole prompt session.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>...and I just now found this closed issue:</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/430</p>
<p>Does ripgrep currently do any special handling of Ctrl+C on Windows?</p>
<p>Edit: A quick ripgrep of ripgrep shows no calls to SetConsoleCtrlHandler, which suggests that the answer is &quot;no&quot;. It's not hard to set up such a thing:</p>
<p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/registering-a-control-handler-function</p>
<p>Edit 2: Looks like I made the silly assumption that this was a C/C++ utility! Anyway, it seems that other people have found ways to register Ctrl+C handlers:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a known issue. It's described a bit in a tangent here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/281 TL;DR - &quot;Add <code>^C</code> handling&quot; is not a complete answer.</p>
<p>As of now, this is not something I plan on fixing.</p>
