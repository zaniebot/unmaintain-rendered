            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Other tools like grep, ack, ag, sift use <code>-L</code> as a short form alternative to the <code>--files-without-match</code> option.
Unfortunately <code>-L</code> is currently defined as an alternative to <code>--follow</code> but I think changing it would make ripgrep more consistent with other tools. So I suggest <code>-L</code> as a short form of <code>--files-without-match</code>, and <code>-R</code> as a short form of <code>--follow</code> because grep uses this short option for following symbolic links.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>But <code>-L</code> is also consistent with other tools like <code>find</code>. Personally, I am very uncomfortable removing flags that are likely widely used at this point, and even more uncomfortable redefining their meaning. I suggest we stop that line of thinking.</p>
<p>I am in principle OK with creating a short option for <code>--files-without-match</code>, but it has never seemed deserving of one IMO.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My inclination is to leave this as is, without a short option. If I hadn&#x27;t already used <code>-L</code> (from <code>find</code>) to mean &quot;search symlinks,&quot; then I&#x27;d be happy to add <code>-L</code> as a short option for <code>--files-without-match</code>. However, <code>-L</code> is definitely staying as-is, so we&#x27;d have to pick something different for <code>--files-without-match</code> and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it to add a non-standard short option for this flag.</p>
