            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As @BurntSushi described in #51, color customization with the style &quot;bold&quot; is interpreted as &quot;use a high-intensity color&quot;, therefore (when using a terminal) the actual ANSI escape sequence for bold text never appears in the output.</p>
<p>It would be great if this were an optional translation, such that &quot;bold&quot; really meant &quot;output bold ANSI sequence&quot; by default.</p>
<p>This is especially important when the output is parsed by a 3rd party that expects the color customization to work this way (as it does, e.g., for <code>git grep</code> or GNU <code>grep</code>).</p>

<p>This sounds like a <em>really bad</em> idea. It would be better to not rely on colors to parse the output. My guess is that the right fix for that is #244, but I don&#x27;t know for sure because I don&#x27;t know what problem you&#x27;re trying to solve.</p>

<p>I agree, but it might be a 31-year-old code base. ;-)  And the design will probably not change because it&#x27;s targeting GNU grep (which does not offer another output format to my knowledge).</p>
<p>I see these issues discussed in #244 as well.  I will also look into the other issues discussing editor integration.  Thanks.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ilohmar Unfortunately, it <em>can&#x27;t</em> be a goal of ripgrep to be completely interface compatible with GNU grep (or any other grep) since it takes a fundamentally different view on how searching works by default. So you already need to be able to tweak the CLI invocation itself, and at that point, it seems like it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect to parse the output specially too. With that said, I can understand how using the color codes as a common interface would be tempting. I expect that in practice, once we nail out these last color issues, that stuff won&#x27;t change going forward.</p>
