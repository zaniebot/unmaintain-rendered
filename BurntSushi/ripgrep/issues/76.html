            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I couldn't find an example like a preview of search and replace. That is what it <em>would</em> do if rg would really replace the string. This would be really helpful in order to prevent unexpected behaviour.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree. <code>ripgrep</code>'s docs could, in general, be improved a great deal. Adding examples that not only show the command but the output as well would be very beneficial.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep's documentation was overhauled in #785. There is now a user guide and a FAQ, both of which contains examples, including an entire section dedicated to replacements.</p>
