<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 14.1.0 (rev e50df40a19)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>chocolatey (i.e. choco)</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 11</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>The case-insensitive search (<code>-i</code>) is not working with file search.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Here, I created 2 files and tried to search them with and without the case-insensitive search (<code>-i</code> tag). The result was the same.</p>

What is the actual behavior?
<p>Please take a look at the image above.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>Ideally the first 2 rg queries (with the <code>-i</code> flag) should have returned both files.</p>
