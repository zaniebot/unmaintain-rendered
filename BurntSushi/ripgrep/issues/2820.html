<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<p>13.0.0</p>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>brew install ripgrep</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>macOS 12.5.1</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>The description for the &quot;--files&quot; flag says that it will list files that would be searched into, but if I execute something like this: <code>rg '.' node_modules --files | sort</code> I see top-level files listed also, like <code>./tsconfig.json</code>, which won't actually be searched into, as if I remove the <code>--files</code> flag I don't see any matches from those top-level files.</p>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<p>Run <code>rg . [PATH] --files</code>, inside a directory containing some top-level files.</p>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p>I see some files listed that exist outside of the root search path I specified.</p>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>I shouldn't see any files listed that exist outside of the root search path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the docs, the usage pattern for <code>--files</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH...]
</code></pre>
<p>You appear to be using it as if the usage pattern is this:</p>
<pre><code>rg [OPTIONS] &lt;pattern&gt; --files [PATH...]
</code></pre>
<p>The point of <code>rg --files</code> is that it doesn't accept a pattern. You're passing <code>.</code>, which is interpreted as a file path to the current working directory. Which, I believe, explains the behavior you're seeing...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aaaaaah ok, thanks for explaining 👍</p>
<p>Should it not accept a pattern though? 🤔 if it doesn't accept a pattern (even if it doesn't really do anything with it) then this workflow kinda breaks:</p>
<ol>
<li>running a normal <code>rg</code> command</li>
<li>appending &quot;--files&quot; to the previous command to check if the file you expected to be searched into was actually searched into.</li>
</ol>
<p>Requiring the user to delete the pattern when passing the &quot;--files&quot; flag seems kinda arbitrary/unexpected to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't understand why <code>--files</code> would take a pattern as an input and then not use it. You'll need to delete the pattern.</p>
<p>And even if I agreed with you that it should accept a pattern, it would be a giant breaking change. So it's a non-starter. It's not like it's just some optional thing it can ignore if it's there and be fine if it isn't. It's a positional argument. So ripgrep would have to always treat the first positional argument to <code>--files</code> as a pattern.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess the idea is that it would accept a pattern for consistency with other ways of running the program. I'm not sure if every other non-trivial way of running <code>rg</code> accepts a pattern though so maybe that argument is not that strong.</p>
<p>Probably not worth breaking the world anyway 👍</p>
