<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>13.0.0</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>brew install ripgrep</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>macOS 12.5.1</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>The description for the &quot;--files&quot; flag says that it will list files that would be searched into, but if I execute something like this: <code>rg &#x27;.&#x27; node_modules --files | sort</code> I see top-level files listed also, like <code>./tsconfig.json</code>, which won&#x27;t actually be searched into, as if I remove the <code>--files</code> flag I don&#x27;t see any matches from those top-level files.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Run <code>rg . [PATH] --files</code>, inside a directory containing some top-level files.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>I see some files listed that exist outside of the root search path I specified.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>I shouldn&#x27;t see any files listed that exist outside of the root search path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the docs, the usage pattern for <code>--files</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH...]
</code></pre>
<p>You appear to be using it as if the usage pattern is this:</p>
<pre><code>rg [OPTIONS] &lt;pattern&gt; --files [PATH...]
</code></pre>
<p>The point of <code>rg --files</code> is that it doesn&#x27;t accept a pattern. You&#x27;re passing <code>.</code>, which is interpreted as a file path to the current working directory. Which, I believe, explains the behavior you&#x27;re seeing...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aaaaaah ok, thanks for explaining 👍</p>
<p>Should it not accept a pattern though? 🤔 if it doesn&#x27;t accept a pattern (even if it doesn&#x27;t really do anything with it) then this workflow kinda breaks:</p>
<ol>
<li>running a normal <code>rg</code> command</li>
<li>appending &quot;--files&quot; to the previous command to check if the file you expected to be searched into was actually searched into.</li>
</ol>
<p>Requiring the user to delete the pattern when passing the &quot;--files&quot; flag seems kinda arbitrary/unexpected to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t understand why <code>--files</code> would take a pattern as an input and then not use it. You&#x27;ll need to delete the pattern.</p>
<p>And even if I agreed with you that it should accept a pattern, it would be a giant breaking change. So it&#x27;s a non-starter. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s just some optional thing it can ignore if it&#x27;s there and be fine if it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a positional argument. So ripgrep would have to always treat the first positional argument to <code>--files</code> as a pattern.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess the idea is that it would accept a pattern for consistency with other ways of running the program. I&#x27;m not sure if every other non-trivial way of running <code>rg</code> accepts a pattern though so maybe that argument is not that strong.</p>
<p>Probably not worth breaking the world anyway 👍</p>
