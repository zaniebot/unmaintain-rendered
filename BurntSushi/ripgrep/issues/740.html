            <div class="timeline-body"><p>After reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16097948">this comment</a> on HN, I thought it'd be neat to add support for the <code>--passthrough</code> / <code>--passthru</code> flag in ripgrep as well.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was thinking about that myself. I personally think it's easier to do it the way i mentioned in that thread, but it seems like some people are quite passionate about it, and it would be very trivial to add a flag that wraps the pattern in <code>^|(?:...)</code>, the way we do with <code>-w</code> and <code>-x</code>. (At least, that's the method that first comes to mind, because it's easy and i have experience with it.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm kind of meh on it, but I don't feel strongly enough to reject it outright.</p>
<p><code>ag</code> spells it <code>--passthrough</code> while <code>ack</code> spells it <code>--passthru</code>. How should ripgrep spell it? o_0 I suppose we could just accept both.</p>
<p>I like @okdana's suggested implementation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If it were me i think i'd make it <code>--passthru</code>, with <code>--passthrough</code> as like a hidden alias. Can't recall if Clap supports that tho</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.29.0/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.alias">It does</a> :wink: (You can also <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/2.29.0/clap/struct.Arg.html#method.visible_alias">make it visible</a> so it's findable in the help output)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@jzinn both are supported. Ripgrep has no specific goal to be &quot;formal.&quot;</p>
<p>Please drop this. It's a waste of time.</p>
