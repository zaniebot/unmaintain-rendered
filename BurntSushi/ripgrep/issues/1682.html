            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I wish to make ripgrep as fast as possible by default.</p>
<p>Here is what I appear to be getting today with default threads on a &quot;big box&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /proc/cpuinfo  | grep processor | tail -n1
processor	: 39

$ time rg something * &gt;/dev/null

real	0m2.636s
user	0m9.328s
sys	0m18.887s

$ time rg something --threads 40 * &gt;/dev/null

real	0m1.844s
user	0m21.137s
sys	0m32.325s
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps it would benefit by using the number of cores available as the default?  Cheers!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Picking the number of threads to launch is a pretty finicky exercise and there are lots of weird trade offs. On some machines, for example, I have noticed diminishing returns as ripgrep uses more threads up to the core count.</p>
<p>So I'm not inclined to change the default absent a more thorough investigation. A single data point isn't enough. Cases like this are exactly why ripgrep exposes a <code>--threads</code> flag. You can configure it to your optimal/desired setting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Bonus points if you can determine optimal # cores dynamically... (I think in this case it benefitted because it was on an NFS share so used more bandwidth with more requests or something...)</p>
