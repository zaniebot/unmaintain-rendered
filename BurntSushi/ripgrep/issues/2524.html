            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please update --debug switch to indicate if ripgrep is searching stdin or a file system directory (and print which one).</p>
<p>Rationale:</p>
<p>I used ripgrep from within a Makefile and in a terminal, it worked fine. However, when I used it from within Emacs via <code>M-x compile RET make RET</code> ripgrep returned no results. Reading the help, led me to add --debug, but it didn&#x27;t say why ripgrep wasn&#x27;t working as I expected.</p>
<p>After a bit of debugging I found that ripgrep reads stdin (emacs sets this up) which caused ripgrep to behave differently when running GNU make from within Emacs. I later saw in the doc that this is intended behavior, so no issue with that. Having --debug explain what is going on would have saved me a bit of debugging.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
