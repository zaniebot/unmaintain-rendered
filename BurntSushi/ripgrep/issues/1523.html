<p>I'd like ripgrep to process ignore patterns from .hgignore just is it does for .gitignore. It's the only feature I use that The Silver Searcher has but ripgrep doesn't. The formats are a bit different so simply copying/linking all .hgignore files to .gitignore in every repo won't work as a workaround.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but this makes me chuckle a bit. If The Silver Searcher's support for hgignore is good enough for you, then incidentally, symlinking <code>.hgignore</code> to <code>.gitignore</code> would <em>also</em> be good enough for you. Hell, you might be able to just use <code>alias rg=&quot;rg --ignore-file .hgignore&quot;</code> and have it work most of the time, depending on your <code>.hgignore</code> setup.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that The Silver Searcher advertises support for <code>.hgignore</code>, it treats it just like a <code>.gitignore</code> file with no specific support for hg's custom format. For example, it doesn't support hg's regex mode at all.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<p>https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/blob/a509a8172b4a67803e1b367bf4356450bc97130b/src/ignore.c#L36</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen anyone complain about this. Folks also seem to rarely complain about the litany of bugs in The Silver Searcher's gitignore support itself. The difference in the implementation of ripgrep's ignore support and The Silver Searcher is <em>dramatic</em>. Just to drive this point home, ripgrep's support for ignore patterns uses <em>more code than the entirety of The Silver Searcher</em>:</p>

<p>This is due to substantial differences in both correctness and performance. (And this doesn't even include the custom glob implementation that ripgrep uses.)</p>

<p>Well, that actually solves it... I was under the impression that <code>ag</code> does something better but yes, its support is good enough.</p>

<p>Tbh, this would probably solve 99%, if not 100%, of my uses. The main problem with this approach is that it only looks in the current directory and produces an error every single time you run <code>rg</code> in a directory without that file. Ideally there would be a way to specify the ignore file relative to the project's root and have a way to silence the error if it's missing, but I'm not sure those two things would warrant a separate issue?</p>
