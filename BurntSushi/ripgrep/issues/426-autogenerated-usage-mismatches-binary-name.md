# Autogenerated usage mismatches binary name

---

_@kpp_

```
$ rg -h | head -n14 | tail -n 1
USAGE:ripgrep [OPTIONS] <pattern> [--] [path]...
```

It should be `USAGE:rg [OPTIONS] <pattern> [--] [path]...`

This is a dupe of #418 I think. That is, I think it's the same underlying regression.

I think this was supposed to be fixed in the latest version of clap, but it's not.

Looking at it now ;-)

I found the issue.

@kbknapp Wow! I'm surprised Github closed this issue from your PR. (I'm reopening it because it doesn't actually get fixed until deps are bumped... Hah.)

Probably because I once tried to set up @homu on this repo, and so it has access. Cool.

Wow I had no idea that would happen, I apologize! I'd ~~almost~~ call that a bug, since I shouldn't be allowed to close your PRs and Issues 😜
