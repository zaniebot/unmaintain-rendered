# Show N words/characters around each match

#### Describe your feature request
I've been using `ripgrep` to search for certain words in all the files in my filesystem. However, some matches are in very long lines, which fill up my terminal, and it's very hard to search for them. This would probably be something like `--preview-chars=<N>`
