            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>Is there an option to tell <code>ripgrep</code> to print the matched lines as-is? I've gone over the man but  didn't find anything that worked. I tried all options with <code>--color</code> but I still lose the original text color.</p>
<p>An example use-case is with <a href="https://hub.github.com"><code>hub</code></a> where I want to keep the original text color/formatting being output by the program:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't a problem with ripgrep. ripgrep doesn't strip coloring from the output of hub. The more likely thing is that hub detects that it isn't printing to a tty, and therefore suppresses color output on its own. You thus need to figure out how to tell hub to keep its color enabled forcefully.</p>

<pre><code>hub issue -a me --color=always | rg -i term

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks to this question, I could achieve coloring control 'as-is' with <code>fd</code>.</p>
<p>results as FYI:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>$ fd rs --color=always | rg 'examples'</code>

<li><p><code>$ fd rs --color=always | rg 'examples' --color=never</code>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Looks like it same issue, but in my case is far as I understand git don`t care where to printed.</p>

<p>I expect removed/added lines to preserve color to the end of line</p>
<p>@BurntSushi , can you  please advise on this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You expected color to be preserved from the output of <code>git diff</code>, and you showed a screenshot of... color being preserved. There are things colored other than <code>test</code>. So I don't see the problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe you're referring to the things that appear after <code>test</code>? If so, there's nothing to be done about that. You can't just arbitrarily compose ANSI color streams and expect the output to be sensible. Sorry.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oops, looks like I might not have explained my question very well earlier – sorry about that! 😅 What I'm trying to do is highlight certain words in my terminal without messing up the other colors that are already there from a <code>git diff</code>. It's a bit surprising that we don't seem to have a straightforward way to do this yet. Do you happen to know if there's a tool or a trick that could help me out? I'm not too fussed about the technical details; I just want something that works smoothly. Thanks a bunch for your help!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nope. Sorry. I'm not the right person to ask. I'm not a terminal expert. I know how to get it to emit colors and that's pretty much it. You could write an ANSI interpreter to manage the stream of ANSI color codes where you could intercept resets and replace them with instructions to &quot;reset back to what the colors were before&quot; instead of just &quot;reset back to no colors.&quot; But I don't see how to do that in a generic way because you don't know which colors were emitted by each application. So like, even hypothetically, I don't see a way to do it. But like I said, I'm not the right person to ask, so I wouldn't an interpret a &quot;can't be done&quot; from me with 100% certainty.</p>
