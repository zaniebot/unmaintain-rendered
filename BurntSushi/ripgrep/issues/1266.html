            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Installed using the following method
$ curl -LO https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/0.10.0/ripgrep_0.10.0_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i ripgrep_0.10.0_amd64.deb</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Ubuntu 14.04 - 64-bit</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>Is it possible to ignore matches found in code comments if a flag is set?</p>
<p>Code example apple.rs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {

    // apple is a tasty fruit
   /*

    apple = 8;
    if apple &gt; 5 {
        println(&quot;Don't print that&quot;);
    }
    */
   let apple = 1;

    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);
}

</code></pre>
<p>If I run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Bash">rg --ignore-comments apple apple.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The output I would like to receive:
<code>let apple = 1;</code>
<code>println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);</code></p>
<p>And ignore the line <code>// apple is a tasty fruit</code> which also contains the search term &quot;apple&quot;</p>
<p>Congrats on version 11.0.0 :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Definitely not, sorry. ripgrep has no specific code awareness built into it, other than a mapping from the type of a file to its extension.</p>
<p>In your specific example, ignoring comment lines is pretty trivial:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg apple apple.rs | rv -v '^\s*//'
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this doesn't work in all cases since some comments, like <code>/* ... */</code>, can span multiple lines. Handling those correctly requires very specific syntax aware parsing that is just not part of ripgrep and probably never will be. ripgrep is, fundamentally, a <em>line oriented search tool</em>. A search tool that knows about the syntax of programming languages would look very different.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi Thank you for your snippet but I think it should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rg apple apple.rs | rg -v '.*:\s*//'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The second command is <code>rg</code>, isn't it?</li>
<li>And I have replaced <code>^</code> by <code>.*:</code> because the start of the line is the filename provided by the first <code>rg</code> command</li>
</ul>
<p>I answer to a closed issue because if is the first Google answer for</p>

<p>ripgrep ignore comment</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, my snippet is correct. By default, ripgrep does not include the file name
in the output if you're searching a single file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/apple.rs
fn main() {
    // apple is a tasty fruit
   let apple = 1;
    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);
}

$ rg apple /tmp/apple.rs
2:    // apple is a tasty fruit
3:   let apple = 1;
4:    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);

$ rg apple /tmp/apple.rs | rg -v '^\s*//'
   let apple = 1;
    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);
</code></pre>
<p>If you instead have <code>--with-filename</code> enabled (perhaps via a config file),
then my snippet won't work and you need something like what you wrote:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg apple /tmp/apple.rs --with-filename
/tmp/apple.rs
2:    // apple is a tasty fruit
3:   let apple = 1;
4:    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);

$ rg apple /tmp/apple.rs --with-filename | rg -v '^\s*//'
/tmp/apple.rs:    // apple is a tasty fruit
/tmp/apple.rs:   let apple = 1;
/tmp/apple.rs:    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);

$ rg apple /tmp/apple.rs --with-filename | rg -v '^.*?:\s*//'
/tmp/apple.rs:   let apple = 1;
/tmp/apple.rs:    println!(&quot;There are {} apples in stock&quot;, apple);
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh yes, sorry.
I was using it without the file argument so in a directory.
My apologies.</p>
