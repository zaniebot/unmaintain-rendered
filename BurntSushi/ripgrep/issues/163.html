            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for the terse reply earlier - it was just a gut reaction as a Windows user. The general rule on Windows is that all file operations are case insensitive, alas...</p>
<p>I've since tested git on Windows (with core.ignoreCase on), and .gitignore files are case insensitive there. I do think supporting this is important, even with a performance hit, as my fellow teammates add rules expecting that <code>**/Logs/*</code> will also match <code>**/logs/*</code> (from two different tools).</p>
<p>Otherwise, find.exe from the git for windows distribution behaves as on Linux, unless you change the flag:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&quot;c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\find.exe&quot; . -name *.CS

&gt;&quot;c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\find.exe&quot; . -iname *.CS
./foo.cs
./src/bar.cs
</code></pre>
<p>Well, almost:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&quot;c:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\find.exe&quot; SrC -name *.cs
SrC/bar.cs
</code></pre>
<p>In the short-term, it's not a huge deal for me - there are only a couple of rules that need duplicating in my current .gitignore files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Mac is effectively case insensitive. Most functions ignore case, and you can't have two filenames which differ only by case. Here's an example to give you the flavour. This means mac users usually don't care about case. Windows obeys the same kind of rules (you can't have <code>q</code> and <code>Q</code> directories, <code>mkdir q, cd Q</code> works).</p>
<pre><code>sh-3.2$ pwd
/Users/caj/temp
sh-3.2$ mkdir q
sh-3.2$ cd q
sh-3.2$ pwd
/Users/caj/temp/q
sh-3.2$ cd ../Q
sh-3.2$ pwd
/Users/caj/temp/Q
sh-3.2$ cd ..
sh-3.2$ mkdir Q
mkdir: Q: File exists
sh-3.2$ mkdir q
mkdir: q: File exists
sh-3.2$ rmdir Q
sh-3.2$ cd q
sh: cd: q: No such file or directory

<p>As for types, I'm not sure. On one hand I think symmetry is valuable and <code>--itype(-not)</code> would allow for a similar use case as above, where <code>--type(-not)</code> refers to canonical forms and <code>--itype(-not)</code> would match non-canonical forms too. That makes it a per-type issue, though, what the canonical forms should be (which we already have). Ruby's RAKE appears to look for any of <code>rakefile</code>, <code>Rakefile</code>, <code>rakefile.rb</code>, <code>Rakefile.rb</code>, but matches <code>RAKEFILE</code> too on case-insensitive filesystems, yet we only look for <code>Rakefile</code>. What about something more general like <code>*.RST</code>? I haven't seen any OS or other software yet that considers <code>*.abc</code> to be something totally different than <code>*.ABC</code> or <code>*.AbC</code> and anyone inventing a new extension would be stupid to distinguish it only by casing. However, in the end, what are types really? For now, it seems just named globs with nicer syntax (CMIIW). From that perspective, it would make more sense to have both <code>--iglob</code> and <code>--itype(-not)</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@thijsvandien You're wrong (about Mac, I don't know about Windows). Any path you pass as an argument to both <code>ls</code> and <code>find</code> is treated case-insensitively (on a case-insensitive FS), because those tools pass the path to the filesystem. <code>find</code>'s <code>-name</code> and <code>-regex</code> predicates are case-sensitive, because it's doing the string comparing itself rather than the filesystem being queried (and this is why <code>find</code> has the <code>-iname</code> and <code>-iregex</code> flags). Similarly, shell globbing is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>As for ripgrep, I think that filetype detection should be case-insensitive by default, regardless of filesystem, because file extensions are generally considered to be case-insensitive (e.g. <code>README.TXT</code> is just as much a text file as <code>readme.txt</code> is). So there's really no need for <code>--itype</code> (though <code>--iglob</code> would be useful, as globbing should be case-sensitive).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I did mean the <code>-name</code> flag to <code>find</code>, because if it'd be about the path to search in, even <code>rg</code> would pass that path to the OS, I suppose.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ack</code> is strange in this regards. On FreeBSD with a case-sensitive filesystem, with <code>--type=html</code> it matches all of <code>a.html</code>, <code>b.HTML</code> and <code>c.HtMl</code>, but with <code>--type=ruby</code> it matches <code>Rakefile</code> but doesn't match<code>RaKeFiLe</code>... On a Mac with a case-insensitive filesystem, it behaves the same. While <code>RaKeFiLe</code> and <code>Rakefile</code> should be considered equal there, it only matches if it is named as the latter.</p>

<p>Why? <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/163#issuecomment-253792743">Others in this thread</a> have shown that globbing itself is case insensitive on certain file systems.</p>
<p>There are clearly performance trade offs involved in this choice, which makes it even harder to choose the right path. Both &quot;check every file path&quot; and &quot;globing/types are case insensitive&quot; have the potential to regress performance, so I think some experiments need to be done before we can move forward.</p>
<p>Performance alone might not be enough to completely rule out whether we add case insensitivity to ripgrep, but it could certainly impact whether it's the default.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>On unices, globbing is case-sensitive by default. Yes, Bash (and presumably other shells) has an option to make globbing case-insensitive, but you have to opt in to that behavior. I don't really care how it behaves on Windows, so I wouldn't have any issue if you did case-insensitive globbing there, although I would expect that it's more valuable to have consistent behavior.</p>
<p>Regarding Rakefile, since that's not an extension, I think it's reasonable to do a case-sensitive match against Rakefile and RAKEFILE (so e.g. RaKeFiLe doesn't match), although you may want to find out how <code>rake</code> itself behaves on a case-sensitive filesytem (e.g. will <code>rake</code> pick up a file called RaKeFiLe?). I'm only advocating for case-insensitive type comparisons for extensions, not for special-cased filenames.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a new <code>case_insensitive</code> method to the <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.1.9/ignore/gitignore/struct.GitignoreBuilder.html"><code>GitignoreBuilder</code></a> type. The <code>add_line</code> method should then pass on this setting to the glob it creates via <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/0.1.4/globset/struct.GlobBuilder.html#method.case_insensitive"><code>GlobBuilder</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <code>--glob</code> flag uses <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.1.9/ignore/overrides/struct.Override.html"><code>Override</code></a> instead of <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.1.9/ignore/gitignore/struct.Gitignore.html"><code>Gitignore</code></a>, so we'll need a <code>case_insensitive</code> method on <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.1.9/ignore/overrides/struct.OverrideBuilder.html"><code>OverrideBuilder</code></a> too. That value should get pass to the corresponding method on <code>GitignoreBuilder</code> created in (1).</li>
<li>Do the plumbing to add a new <code>--iglob</code> flag. I suspect the existing <code>--glob</code> flag can be copied for the most part. When building the <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.1.9/ignore/overrides/struct.Override.html"><code>Override</code></a> matcher, enable case insensitive matching using the method added in (2).</li>
<li>Write a couple unit tests for the new functionality on <code>Gitignore</code> and <code>Override</code>, and then add an integration test to <code>tests/tests.rs</code>.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I started looking into implementing <code>core.ignorecase</code> and found that I think it would be unreasonable to check for <code>.git/config</code> in every directory. Would it perhaps be reasonable to only check for <code>core.ignorecase</code> in the global git config, the way ripgrep currently checks for <code>excludesfile</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@PeterSP It does certainly feel like we should respect <code>core.ignorecase</code>. I might be tempted to want to add support for that, even if it means checking every <code>.git/config</code>. I think we already do some stat calls looking for <code>.git</code>, so if we could piggy back off that by only looking for <code>.git/config</code> when <code>.git</code> exists, then I think it would be pretty cheap to do it. Note that it may be tricky to implement it that way, so I'd be fine starting without that optimization, so long as it doesn't have a noticeable impact on speed.</p>
