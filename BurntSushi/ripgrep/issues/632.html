<p>As the title says, I noticed that ripgrep will output the BOM character when printing a match in the first line. Not really blocking anything, but I think it would make sense for ripgrep to strip this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@roblourens That is interesting. I think my intuition was the opposite, but I could be completely wrong? For example, if you run <code>rg pattern file &gt; results</code> and <code>file</code> has a BOM, shouldn&#x27;t <code>results</code> also have a BOM?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@FSMaxB ripgrep doesn&#x27;t respect any locale settings and always uses UTF-8 for output. That seems orthogonal to the issue reported here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It seems to me like the BOM is metadata and not really part of the actual text of the file. But I&#x27;m not sure and haven&#x27;t checked what other tools do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>rg</code>&#x27;s behaviour seems consistent with BSD <code>grep</code>, GNU <code>grep</code>, and <code>ag</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% printf &#x27;\xef\xbb\xbftest\n&#x27; &gt; bom.txt
% file bom.txt
bom.txt: UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text
% /usr/bin/grep . bom.txt | xxd -a
00000000: efbb bf74 6573 740a    ...test.
% /usr/local/bin/grep . bom.txt | xxd -a
00000000: efbb bf74 6573 740a    ...test.
% /usr/local/bin/ag --no-numbers . bom.txt | xxd -a
00000000: efbb bf74 6573 740a    ...test.
% /usr/local/bin/rg --no-line-number . bom.txt | xxd -a
00000000: efbb bf74 6573 740a    ...test.
</code></pre>
<p>I can see why someone might expect it to be stripped out tho</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t quite know what the right answer is here. Given that both BSD and GNU grep leave the BOM in tact, I&#x27;m also inclined to take that path as well. In particular, in the absence of more concrete use cases where removing the BOM makes sense, I&#x27;d like to side with tradition on this one.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m going to close this for now, but if there is a more compelling argument to be made, please make it here and we can revisit this.</p>
