            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In <a href="https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all">rga</a>, I currently pass most arguments directly to ripgrep. But now I noticed I need to handle some of those flags myself, currently specifically --text, --binary, --null-data, --encoding, and their short versions to fix binary detection and <a href="https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all/issues/5">handle encodings</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, a command given with <code>--pre</code> might also want to know about certain configuration options given to ripgrep itself.</p>
<p>If there was a way to access the clap App or even better the higher level configuration of ripgrep given a Vec of args, that would be great!</p>
<p>Currently, it looks like all of the arg parsing is in the ripgrep crate itself, which can&#x27;t be loaded as a library, as far as I can tell.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but I don&#x27;t have any plans to do this. ripgrep core should stay a binary crate. I&#x27;d suggest either parsing what you need from the process arguments directly, or designing your own command line argument parameters and invoke libripgrep directly.</p>
<p>It is a non-goal of mine to make ripgrep arbitrarily flexible, and this is a step too far in that direction. Making things too flexible increases maintenance burden and the complexity of the code.</p>
