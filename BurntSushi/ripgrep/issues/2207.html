            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0 (rev af6b6c543b)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>choco</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>The user guides show example usage as:
rg someText -g &#x27;*.ext&#x27;</p>
<p>But this fails on Windows and --debug shows that .ext files were not being matched.</p>
<p>However the command:
rg someText -g *.ext</p>
<p>works correctly.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is a bug or documentation issue though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No quotes or double-quotes is the proper way to do it in a <code>cmd.exe</code> prompt. The user-guide is written from a *nix shell pov.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Quoting with single quotes will work in Powershell or bash, not in CMD.</p>
<p>CMD does not interpret single quotes and will include them in the subprocess command-line.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think there is anything actionable on my end here.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve always found cmd.exe quite difficult and very unwieldy to use, especially around quoting. It&#x27;s unclear why one would use on modern Windows. And in particular, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth cluttering up the user guide just to address <code>cmd.exe</code>.</p>
