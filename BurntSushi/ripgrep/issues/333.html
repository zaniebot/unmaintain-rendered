            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi.
I&#x27;m using ripgrep primarily inside vim/ctrlp.
I&#x27;m currently working on a very big repository (tens of thousands of files) with a, let&#x27;s say &quot;relaxed&quot; policy about what should be in version control and what should not, meaning I have to filter out a lot of binaries, build byproducts and whatnot.
I&#x27;m of course using a .ignore file at the root, which helps with speeding up the listings, but I need an additional layer of filtering to weed out so much &quot;noise&quot;, so I&#x27;m trying to find an adequate syntax to use for the &#x27;ctrlp_user_command&#x27; variable in vim which would <em>whitelist</em> just what I&#x27;m interested in (only certain types of source files).
So far, I&#x27;ve obtained the best results by using the &#x27;type-add&#x27; switch using the curly braces notation to include several file extensions, like this:
<code>rg . --files --type-add &quot;source:*.{h,cs,c}&quot; -tsource</code></p>
<p>This <em>almost</em> works, I can see most of the files listed have the extensions I specified, but there&#x27;s also many unwanted files, like these two for instance:
<code>tools\webscarab\src\org\owasp\webscarab\plugin\scripted\script.bsh</code>
<code>tools\win32\python27\Lib\site-packages\data\themes\tools\icons48.code.tga</code></p>
<p>For the first one I have no explanation. The second one would seem as if the &#x27;.code&#x27; part at the end was matching my &#x27;.c&#x27;.. Wild speculation, of course.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

I can see that it whitelists several things like images, jars and other things.

<p>imo the perfect resolution would be to add something like gnu find syntax for specifying file names. At least -path, -name, -ipath, and -iname as well as -not, -o, -a, -(, and -).</p>
<p>Or at least -ipath and -iname for starters.</p>

<li><code>rg</code>&#x27;s <code>--glob</code> and <code>--iglob</code> are effectively the same thing as <code>find</code>&#x27;s <code>-name</code>/<code>-path</code> and <code>-iname</code>/<code>-ipath</code> (though the semantics* are slightly different obviously)</li>
<li><code>!</code>-prefixed patterns are effectively the same thing as <code>-not</code></li>
<li>as in <code>find</code>, multiple glob patterns are combined with an implicit <code>-a</code> by default</li>

In that case, I already tried that as commented in my original post, and it still had some issues. It almost worked, but some files gave false positives..
My intention when opening this was more in the direction of bug catching &amp; fixing.. I since have not used vim again in large codebases, so cannot attest as to how rg behaves currently in that scenario.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s standard and idiomatic in UNIX command line since... forever. I don&#x27;t know precisely when the convention started, but it is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html">specified by POSIX</a>, which likely suggests the convention pre-dated POSIX. So it&#x27;s probably been around for at least 32 years.</p>
<p>And <code>-t go</code> works as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi Can we at least extend the &quot;USAGE&quot; displayed when <code>rg</code> is invoked with no arguments or with <code>--help</code> so that it shows the <code>--type</code> flag, like:</p>
<pre><code>USAGE:
    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
-    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f PATTERNFILE ...] [PATH ...]
+    rg [OPTIONS] [--type TYPE ...] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f PATTERNFILE ...] [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list
    command | rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN

<p>Yet, the usage/help fails to immediately show/explain to the user how to filter by filepaths/extensions.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that many many people had the same issue and were annoyed that the usage doesn&#x27;t show/explain <code>-g</code> or <code>-t</code>, but oh well.</p>
<p>It would be nice to address this somehow.</p>
<p>EDIT: I mean, sure, its in <code>--help</code>, but I still feel its hard to discover it. Random thought: ppl may not search for &#x27;glob&#x27; (or know what it does) and instead look for &#x27;filepath&#x27;, &#x27;file extension&#x27; etc.</p>

<p>There are a <em>ton</em> of things it doesn&#x27;t show.</p>
<p>The <code>--help</code> page is very long, and if you start prioritizing things to fix issues like, then you end up with the opposite problem: things that really do need to be prioritized end up getting de-prioritized. Therefore, your suggestion is not <em>just</em> &quot;please prioritize this important feature,&quot; but it&#x27;s <em>also</em> &quot;please also de-prioritize this other thing at the same time.&quot; In other words, a balance must be struct.</p>
<p>The user guide has several prominent sections on filtering. I think that&#x27;s probably good enough IMO.</p>

<p>The first result for me is the GUIDE
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md">https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md</a>. And the
GUIDE talks extensively about filtering. I don&#x27;t understand how that isn&#x27;t
relevant. It is literally exactly the thing you would want to see.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not splitting the guide into arbitrarily small pieces just so search engine results snippets are better.</p>
<p>The size of the document is large, which is why there is a table of contents. The table of contents is quick to scan and even includes the phrase &quot;file types.&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s not just that. Long documents are overwhelming to people, especially
ones with reading and focus disabilities, which means most people nowadays.
It&#x27;s really worthwhile to split this up into small pieces that just talk
about one thing. For most of the things talked about in this document there
isn&#x27;t a really good reason to have them all in a single document.</p>
