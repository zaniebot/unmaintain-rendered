            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep works very well except that often when I search for long words (like email) or sequences of numbers I encounter an error which only tells me that the command failed, however it happens that I put a sequence of different numbers of equal length and there I do not have such an error for long words, here is an screen shot of the error im getting <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a41d6ae-ec1e-480b-a129-ee0fc06b65d2">image</a></p>
