            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>13.0 installed todayt
Replace this text with the output of <code>rg --version</code>.
ripgrep 13.0.0 (rev 7ec2fd51ba)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>#!/bin/bash
curl -LO https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/13.0.0/ripgrep_13.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i ripgrep_13.0.0_amd64.deb</p>
<p>If you installed ripgrep with snap and are getting strange file permission or
file not found errors, then please do not file a bug. Instead, use one of the
Github binary releases.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
Release:        11
Codename:       bullseye</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>I wanted to return a list of bash function headers, but not those that were commented out. I thought I'd use a backreference for that:</p>
<p>rg --pcre2 '(?&gt;!# ).*()'</p>
<p>I have tried some derivations of the above, and none seem to work, as I get '# funcname()' in the output, all the time, now, I don't NEED to use back references to achieve my goals, so, I am all good.</p>
<p>Give a high level description of the bug.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>You have the meat above, I am on bash 5.14 when I'm doing this.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>It displays the lines that starts with '#'
Show the command you ran and the actual output. Include the <code>--debug</code> flag in
your invocation of ripgrep.</p>
<p>If the output is large, put it in a gist: https://gist.github.com/</p>
<p>If the output is small, put it in code fences:</p>

<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>What do you think ripgrep should have done?</p>
<p>I think it is the pcrelib, not ripgrep.</p>
