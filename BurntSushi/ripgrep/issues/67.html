            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Git allows the following in a <code>.gitignore</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/*
!/dir
</code></pre>
<p>which means: ignore every directory in the root of the repository except the <code>dir</code> directory. Git understands this, but <code>rg</code> will fail to find results in <code>/dir</code>. Note that <code>pt</code> handles this correctly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report! This wasn't actually a bug with overlapping patterns or anything. There was a bug in the gitignore parser that was triggered by the whitelist that was preventing <code>/dir</code> from being interpreted as an anchored path.</p>
