            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Info on how to build the man page would be a good improvement over the already very complete readme. Maybe also mention the install methods that include it (for example the .deb doesn't seem to install it).</p>
<p>I use this command in mac (installed through brew) and the man page is a godsend.</p>
<p>Once I figure that out maybe I'll make a pull request :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#manpage">FAQ item</a> might answer most of your question?</p>
<p>The deb really <em>should</em> include the man page. In fact, <em>every</em> distro package should include the man page. The deb is under my control, but truthfully, I generate it via the <code>cargo deb</code> tool, and I'm not sure anyone has taught it about man pages yet. I don't have the bandwidth to wade into Debian packaging territory, so it's basically up to someone else at this point.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>(Also, <code>rg --help</code> is very nearly the same as the contents of the man page. At least, all of the flags are documented using precisely the same text. The man page does contain some additional prose for other sections like config knobs, shell completions and the like. Also, <code>rg -h</code> shows a much more condensed view.)</p>
