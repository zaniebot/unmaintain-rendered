<p>ripgrep 12.0.1
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>brew install rg</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>OS: Darwin x64 19.6.0</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>I'm not sure if it's correct to post here. If not, please tell me where do this bug report.
When I try to print a lot of data using 'rg' in the vscode terminal (actually that much output is not intended), vscode hangs and I have to restart it.
I doubt it's a buffer problem, maybe. Because other tools like grep works well with printing that much data.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Just open vscode terminal on directory includes lots of data like home directory, then use rg 'a'</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>hang vscode</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Not to hang vscode</p>
<p>What do you think ripgrep should have done?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this world be more appropriate to file against the terminal itself. ripgrep is just printing bytes. One thing you might try is disabling colors.</p>

I upgraded rg using brew and the problem has been solved. vscode doesn't hang anymore even if there're lots of data on terminal.</p>
