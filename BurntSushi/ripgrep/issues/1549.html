<p>I would like to be able to complete default recognized type names in Bash.</p>
<p>I compile ripgrep from source; mostly as a historical curiosity. Because I already compile from source I patch ripgrep&#x27;s generated Bash completion to support type names: commonquail/ripgrep@1ce1701f9751bd743ca79b560254c04bb7063053:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -t j
java     jinja    jl       js       json     jsonl    julia    jupyter
</code></pre>
<p>That has been fairly useful to me, if <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">technically not quite worth it</a>.</p>
<p>Since the completion file is generated, it&#x27;s not really feasible to propose that version for upstreaming. Fortunately, clap has built-in support for enumerating valid values and it&#x27;s already being used a few places in ripgrep. Unfortunately, the type names seem very difficult to access at that point in time:
commonquail/ripgrep@36447f5f0b804e264ce13fbaa7aa4ab777fb55b0:</p>
<p>I appreciate that the generated completion scripts are <em>at best</em> a secondary concern, included purely &quot;because we can&quot;, so I understand not wanting to spend any time on this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t have any plans of working on this, but once #2626 is merged, ripgrep will own the generation process for bash shell completions. Previously, it asked a dependency (the Clap crate) to do it. This <em>should</em> make it much easier to augment the generation code to include all of the file types.</p>
<p>With that said, the ideal here would be for the completion script to use <code>rg --type-list</code> to determine the complete list of types. Since they can be added to (or removed) by the end user.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For Bash</p>
<pre><code>impl Flag for Type {
    fn doc_choices(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;&#x27;static [&amp;&#x27;static str] {
        &amp;[&quot;$(rg --type-list | cut -d: -f1)&quot;]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>is functionally equivalent to the modification I made. Nakedly shelling out this way would not work for Fish and PowerShell, of course, so some means of signalling dynamic generation would be necessary -- a richer return type or a new function definition, essentially.</p>
<p><code>--type-list</code> could be taught a flag to omit the prefix and obviate <code>cut</code>, or an alternative argument (hidden?) could do the same to leave <code>--type-list</code> alone. This could allow an alternative design more specialized than arbitrarily shelling out, which may or may not be preferable.</p>
