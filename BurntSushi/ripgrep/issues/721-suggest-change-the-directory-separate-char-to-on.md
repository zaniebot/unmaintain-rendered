# Suggest: change the directory separate char '\\' to '/' on windows

_@cn00_

The windows directory separate char '\\'  always case some problems, maybe use the Unix directory separate char '/' is more convenient.
I love ripgrep, thanks for your jobs.

I was on mobile before. This is a dupe of #711. Use the `--path-separator` flag to get what you want.
