            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There seems to be an encoding issue when piping the output of a ripgrep search. The characters <code>ø æ å ä</code> (and probably others, those are just the ones I&#x27;ve tested with) are converted to <code>??</code> when being piped to anything.</p>
<p>It seems to only be with piping; passing stdout to a file with <code>&gt;</code> works fine (at least in cmd.exe where files are created with utf8).</p>

<p>This is what I used to test this.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir rgtest
cd rgtest
echo &quot;testøæåä&quot; &gt; strtest.txt
mkdir testø
echo &quot;blahblah&quot; &gt; testø/testå.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then search for various things as seen in the picture. (The <code>--colors</code> option is unrelated; that&#x27;s just so you can see the filenames in Powershell).</p>
<p>This is on Windows 7 with ripgrep 0.5.1. I&#x27;ve recreated this in both powershell and cmd.exe, but I don&#x27;t have a Linux install to test it there.</p>

<p>If that&#x27;s not what you wanted you&#x27;ll have to give me more specific instructions.</p>
<p>The file is currently UTF-8 encoded but this issue occurs with other file encodings as well (and when not reading from a file, as seen in the <code>--files</code> examples.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmm, this actually doesn&#x27;t look like ripgrep. Piping these characters is succeeding with every native Powershell command, but failing with every call to an executable or any non-built-in program.</p>

<p>And while I seem to remember it failing in cmd.exe before, it actually seems to work fine there.</p>
<p>Sorry not looking into this more before reporting.</p>
