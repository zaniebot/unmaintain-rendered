<p>12.1..1
ripgrep 12.1.1
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Can't remember, but from apt, if that was possible</p>
<p>If you installed ripgrep with snap and are getting strange file permission or
file not found errors, then please do not file a bug. Instead, use one of the
Github binary releases.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Debian (11+)  Bullseye
Replace this text with your operating system and version.</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>IDK if it's a bug. I was really STRUGGLING to make ripgrep read the .ripgreprc file, and in the end, when all hope was ABANDONED, I changed the permissions to u+x, in pure DESPERATION.</p>
<p>That WORKED!  which is befuddling, flummoxing and flabbergasting.</p>
<p>Having read the above, about snap and permissions, I don't think I used snap, but still, sounds like it is kind of the same issue.
(I'm not sure if I used cargo either, so, it is open, how I got it.)</p>
<p>Great piece of software!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't personally understand how <code>u+x</code> would have transitioned you from &quot;a config file that wasn't being read&quot; to &quot;a config file that is being read.&quot; The config file is not executed. It is just read. To make the config file work, you do indeed need sufficient permissions to read it, but that <em>should</em> occur by default by virtue of creating it with the same user that you're running ripgrep with. At that point, it's just a simple matter of <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=path/to/.ripgreprc rg foobar</code> to test that it works. You can run ripgrep with the <code>--debug</code> flag to see whether it's reading the config file.</p>
<p>Other things to consider are whether you have an <code>rg</code> alias or wrapper script somewhere. If either of those has <code>--no-config</code>, that would prevent the config file from working.</p>
<p>But again, I don't know how <code>u+x</code> could have fixed things for you.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad it's working and thank you for sharing the solution that worked for you. :-)</p>
