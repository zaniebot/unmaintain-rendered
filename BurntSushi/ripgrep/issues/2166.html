            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>I use rg to search extremely large directories (&gt;1TB), and the output can get a bit long (several thousand lines, in some cases). I would like a way to see the colored, pretty output in the terminal, and also save the search results to a file in case an issue or really long line is run into that completely takes up the viewable terminal history.</p>
<p>Something like</p>
<pre><code>rg --output-file outputFile.txt searchText
</code></pre>
<p>Would output the usual, pretty output to stdout, but also save the results of the search in a readable format to out.txt.</p>
<p>I am well aware of things like <code>tee -a</code> that allow for output to stdout and to a file, but using it results in either A) bash color formatting in the file and the ruining of viewability in vim or B) difficult to read output in the terminal.</p>
<p>The features present in programs like youtube-dl and nmap are close to what i&#x27;m looking for.</p>
<p>Thanks, and thanks for creating such an awesome search tool!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In terms of implementation, in theory, it should not be too difficult to implement. I think the strategy I would take is to provide a tee-like implementation in ripgrep core of the <a href="https://docs.rs/termcolor/latest/termcolor/trait.WriteColor.html"><code>termcolor::WriteColor</code></a> trait. It would do the standard stuff for writing with color support, but would also provide a way to be built with a file that it would also write to (but without color support).</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m not quite convinced that this is worth adding. This seems like a very niche issue and could be solved relatively easily on your end with a tool that strips color formatting from the file you&#x27;ve written with <code>tee</code>.
