            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your feature request</h4>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/struct.GlobBuilder.html">GlobBuilder</a>, it supports <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/struct.GlobBuilder.html#method.case_insensitive">case_insensitive</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/struct.GlobBuilder.html#method.literal_separator">literal_separator</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/globset/latest/globset/struct.GlobBuilder.html#method.backslash_escape">backslash_escape</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder if it can support more options includes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">/// Whether or not paths that contain components that start with a `.`
/// will require that `.` appears literally in the pattern; `*`, `?`, `**`,
/// or `[...]` will not match. This is useful because such files are
/// conventionally considered hidden on Unix systems and it might be
/// desirable to skip them when listing files.
require_literal_leading_dot: bool

/// if given pattern contains `**`, this flag check if `**` matches hidden directory.
/// For example: if true, `**` will match `.abcdef/ghi`.
recursive_match_hidden_dir: bool
</code></pre>
<p>Which mainly works for hidden directory or hidden file</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm sure it can be supported. I didn't originally because I wasn't convinced of their utility. And more to the point, it somewhat encourages writing non-portable code. Namely, while a leading dot is a convention used on Unix to indicate a hidden file or directory, this convention is less used on Windows. On Windows, whether something is hidden or not is actually a first class property of the file's metadata.</p>
<p>On the other hand, globs <em>tend</em> to be written by end users, and in that context, portability isn't always needed.</p>
<p>In any case, it would be good to explain why you want these things. What would you use them for if they existed?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Background: I'm trying to help to make <code>ls</code> command better in <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/book/moving_around.html">nushell</a>, it uses <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/glob">glob</a> crate.</p>
<p>But it seems that <code>glob</code> doesn't support non-UTF8 path, and it would be tricky to make <code>glob</code> support it.  I'm searching for other replacement, one choice is the <code>globset</code> crate</p>
<p>If we use <code>ls -a **</code>, we would expect <code>recursive_match_hidden_dir</code> to be true and return hidden directories.  Simply use <code>ls **</code> will not return hidden directories (only for unix)</p>
