            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello!</p>
<p>The powershell completion instructions been added in
https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/d2c7a76a3c0f6c264ec0b1f04e1dcaeba3862a51</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For PowerShell, add . _rg.ps1 to your PowerShell profile (note the leading period). If the _rg.ps1 file is not on your PATH, do . /path/to/_rg.ps1 instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not find the <code>_rg.ps1</code> file in the final package or source code...
Is it in another repo?

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Cool, so where where it is in the package? I'm trying to find it on mac (powershell is cross-platform) ripgrep v0.7.1, installed thru <code>brew</code>. Is it included only in the windows build?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>AFAIK it's included in all of the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases">official release archives</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ripgrep.rb">Homebrew formula</a> just ignores it though</p>
<p>The formula code has standardised install locations for bash/fish/zsh completions; i don't think PowerShell is a core formula (?), but if there's a similar location for it that would play nicely with Homebrew you might consider <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues">submitting a request</a> to have them add it</p>
