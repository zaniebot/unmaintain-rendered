            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm on a Mac that has a case-insensitive file system (and so does Windows). When I have a folder containing <code>a.txt</code> and <code>b.TXT</code>, both <code>rg --ttxt --files</code> and <code>rg -g '*.txt' --files</code> list only <code>a.txt</code>.</p>
<p>A user on such system would expect both filenames to be matched, so that's what I would vouch for. Perhaps, in addition there could be a flag to either force case-sensitive or case-insensitive filename matching.</p>
<p>If detecting case-sensitivity of the filesystem is terribly inconvenient to do—a search may span multiple volumes with different case-sensitivity!—I suppose case-sensitive should remain the default always, and case-insensitivity could optionally be enabled with a flag (to become a very popular one on those platforms then).</p>
<p>For a point or reference, Python 3's <code>glob</code> module respects the filesystem. It's possible that this is an issue to address in the library used for globbing rather than this consuming project.</p>

<p>(In case it isn't clear, I'm fully supportive of taking action on this issue. The UX just isn't quite clear to me...)</p>
