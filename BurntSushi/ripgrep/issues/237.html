            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's what I'm currently doing. As I said in the original comment, it's about having a convenient shortcut to doing exactly that. I (and I guess many others) often search something, look at the result and then decide that I have to edit the file(s). Just going one up in the shell history and adding -E is really convenient and saves a lot of time. I've added this in <a href="https://github.com/jkramer/rst/blob/master/rst">rst</a> (slimmer faster version of ack I made long ago) and don't wanna miss it. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I still don't quite buy it. Put this in <code>~/bin/rge</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
exec vim $(rg -l &quot;$@&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can do:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg foo
# i want to see in vim
$ rge foo
</code></pre>
<p>... which seems about roughly equivalent to adding <code>rg -E</code>.</p>
<p>Note that I've resisted a similar feature that causes the results of ripgrep to open in a pager by suggesting this alternative in <code>~/bin</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
exec rg -p &quot;$@&quot; | less -RFX
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, I'm kind of a fan of this tool</p>
<p>https://github.com/aykamko/tag</p>
<p>which augments the <code>ripgrep</code> output with a numbering system, then allows you to type <code>e&lt;number&gt;</code> to jump straight to that result in VIM.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi
What about cases when we have multiple results and want to open one of those in editor, would you recommend using https://github.com/aykamko/tag or would be a better idea to have this as a ripgrep feature? I think it will be nicer to have this built in instead of using another tool.</p>
<p>My use case is searching in thousands of code files with results are most often deep directories spread around all over the place. I usually use mouse to copy path and open in editor (which isn't full path by default). Or copy and open it in nano/vim.</p>
<p>It would be equally great even if you could just recommend ripgrep flags to do this in a saner way, which is opening any one of the results in an editor quickly.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: tag does not work on windows</strong></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@SMUsamaShah I don't know what you would consider to be a &quot;saner&quot; way that ripgrep could offer you. In some terminals, you can click on file paths and have them open in your text editor. You might also configure your text editor to do the searching instead of doing it in a terminal. Or just be okay with typing or copying the path. That's what I do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry if the use of 'saner' felt offensive. I use <code>ripgrep</code> with same love as I use <code>Voidtools Everything</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks for telling this. On windows <code>cmder</code> can do that by pressing <code>left ctrl</code> to highlight the path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No &quot;sane&quot; is fine. I just wanted to know what sort of thing you wanted and what you meant by it. &quot;Sane&quot; is just ambiguous, so it is difficult to interpret what you mean when you say that. It's fine in some contexts where you don't need or want to be specific, but specificity is important here. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By sane I meant an easier alternative to copy pasting or writing the path to open one of the results. From your response I learned about this feature in cmder which just works for me. Thanks. :)</p>
