<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<p>My screenshot shows 14.0.2 (what is available in the Arch repo), but I also uninstalled from pacman, and did a <code>hash -r &amp;&amp; cargo install ripgrep</code> to replicate the same behavior with 14.0.3</p>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>Pacman &amp; cargo</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>Arch 6.6.2-arch1-1</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>

<p>It also does not seem to obey the presence of a <code>NO_COLOR</code> environment variable.</p>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<p>See the screenshot above</p>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p>☝️</p>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>Colors option flags should work, and passing <code>--colors path:none --colors line:none --colors column:none --colors match:none</code> should not have <code>^[[0m</code> &quot;leftovers&quot;</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You're passing <code>-p/--pretty</code>, which is an alias for <code>--color=always --heading --line-number</code>. You're also passing it last, so it overrides everything else.</p>
<p>This may have accidentally worked as desired in ripgrep 13, but ripgrep 14 is now much more consistent about flag overrides based on their relative position to one another.</p>
