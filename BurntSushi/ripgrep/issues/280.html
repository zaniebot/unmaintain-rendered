<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be surprising. People that aren&#x27;t me need to put in the work to do it and we should all be grateful to those folks that ripgrep is in as many repositories as it is now.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is a dupe of #10</p>
<p>FWIW, there is ongoing effort to get Rust and ripgrep into the Debian repositories.</p>

<p>Thanks for your efforts (and for ripgrep itself!).</p>
