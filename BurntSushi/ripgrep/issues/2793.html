<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>

<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<p>ripgrep 14.1.0</p>
<p>features:-simd-accel,-pcre2
simd(compile):+SSE2,-SSSE3,-AVX2
simd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2</p>
<p>PCRE2 is not available in this build of ripgrep.</p>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>Cargo</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>Debian 12</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>the terminal cursor in the prompt  is strangely disappearing after ripgrep produces a lot of output.</p>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<pre><code>cd ~
rg :q # this will produce a small output and will not give problems
rg --hidden :q # this will produce a lot of output
</code></pre>
<p>from now on the cursor in the terminal prompt is invisible (I've tried different terminal emulators: xfce-terminal &amp; alacritty)</p>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p>a lot of lines similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>rg: DEBUG|grep_printer::standard|/home/federico/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/grep-printer-0.2.1/src/standard.rs:892: ignoring .local/share/containers/storage/vfs/dir/d9f93c86bb90b5af46b15fcb63a1e3d06a06d044c86ed255b706f537940c464d/usr/share/locale/sv/LC_MESSAGES/apt.mo: found binary data at offset 4
</code></pre>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>the terminal cursor after the ripgrep invocation should behave normally (be visible and movable)</p>

You've also emitted a heap of relevant debug output. For example, whether a config file is being used and any additional options it is setting.</p>
<p>(It is likely that some of your files are emitting terminal control sequences. ripgrep doesn't and will not filter those out.)</p>
