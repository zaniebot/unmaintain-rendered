<p>As the issues you&#x27;ve linked state, they are not fixed in ack2 but are fixed in ack3. <a href="https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3">ack3 is currently under development.</a> Once ack3 becomes the official stable release, I&#x27;ll update the benchmark to use ack3.</p>

<p>Indeed! That&#x27;s why I periodically update them.</p>
<p>The benchmarks in the README are meant to give a rough glance. If you want more detailed benchmarks, then <a href="http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/">see my blog post</a>, which is also linked in the README. The blog post gets updated far less frequently because it is a lot of work. It will happen at my own discretion.</p>
