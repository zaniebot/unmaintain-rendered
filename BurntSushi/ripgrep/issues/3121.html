            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your feature request</h4>
<p>I use many files and folders that start with <code>.</code> (dot). I basically never want to consider these hidden, unless of course they are hidden by another rule (e.g. a <code>.gitignore</code>), and I keep being caught off-guard by ripgrep's default.</p>
<p>However, the <code>--hidden</code> re-includes too many things, such as <code>.git</code> directories. I can't figure out how to re-exclude these. For example, <code>--ignore-vcs</code> does not work.</p>
<p>I've spent a while now trying to piece together a command that excludes dot files from <code>--hidden</code> without other side effects, and I haven't figured it out yet. If this isn't supported, I'd be glad to see a feature for this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Use <code>.rgignore</code> to whitelist what you want, or with <code>--hidden</code> use <code>.rgignore</code> to blacklist what you don't want.</p>
<p>ripgrep doesn't treat <code>.git</code> specially when it comes to filtering. It's just another hidden file/directory, and it will remain that way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see. That is not clear to me from <code>ripgrep --help</code>. I spent a long time assuming I was doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Would you be open to PR to spell that out a bit more clearly?</p>
