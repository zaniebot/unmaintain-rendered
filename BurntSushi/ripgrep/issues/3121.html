            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>I use many files and folders that start with <code>.</code> (dot). I basically never want to consider these hidden, unless of course they are hidden by another rule (e.g. a <code>.gitignore</code>), and I keep being caught off-guard by ripgrep&#x27;s default.</p>
<p>However, the <code>--hidden</code> re-includes too many things, such as <code>.git</code> directories. I can&#x27;t figure out how to re-exclude these. For example, <code>--ignore-vcs</code> does not work.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve spent a while now trying to piece together a command that excludes dot files from <code>--hidden</code> without other side effects, and I haven&#x27;t figured it out yet. If this isn&#x27;t supported, I&#x27;d be glad to see a feature for this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Use <code>.rgignore</code> to whitelist what you want, or with <code>--hidden</code> use <code>.rgignore</code> to blacklist what you don&#x27;t want.</p>
<p>ripgrep doesn&#x27;t treat <code>.git</code> specially when it comes to filtering. It&#x27;s just another hidden file/directory, and it will remain that way.</p>

<p>Would you be open to PR to spell that out a bit more clearly?</p>
