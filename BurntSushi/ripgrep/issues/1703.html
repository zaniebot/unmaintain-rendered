            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--no-ignore</code> is, in my experience, one of the most common flags one would want to pass to ripgrep, but unfortunately it doesn't have a single character alias for its option. Obviously you can just add it by creating an alias under a different name, but it's annoying to do that on every system. It would be great if ripgrep supported such an option out of the box.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>-u</code> is basically the short option for <code>--no-ignore</code>. It's documented separately because it behaves differently when used more than once, but <code>-u</code> by itself is the same as <code>--no-ignore</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Aye, yeah, the short flag for <code>--no-ignore</code> is <code>-u</code>. And in particular, <code>-u</code> can be used repeatedly to progressively disabled smart filtering. <code>-u</code> disables ignore file filtering. <code>-uu</code> disables hidden file filtering. And <code>-uuu</code> disables binary file filtering.</p>
<p>The docs for <code>--no-ignore</code> should definitely mention the <code>-u</code> flag here.</p>
