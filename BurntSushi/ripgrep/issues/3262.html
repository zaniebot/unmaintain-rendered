<ul>
<li>[x] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 15.1.0</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Using the Arch (btw) package manager <code>pacman</code></p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>CachyOS Linux</p>
Describe your bug.
<p><code>$F</code> is treated as a capture group but I am using <code>--fixed-strings</code> so it should be treated as a literal.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; test.md
Recall that we defined the sum of two elements of 𝐅𝑛 to be the element of 𝐅𝑛 obtained by adding corresponding coordinates; see 1.13. As we will now see, addition has a simple geometric interpretation in the special case of 𝐑2.
EOF
rg --fixed-strings &quot;𝐅𝑛&quot; --replace=&#x27;$F^n$&#x27; test.md
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>Actual output is:</p>
<pre><code>rg: DEBUG|rg::flags::parse|crates/core/flags/parse.rs:97: no extra arguments found from configuration file

<p>Output expected is:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is intended and correct behavior. Even with <code>-F/--fixed-strings</code>, the capture group <code>$0</code> is still available. Moreover, there is no documentation suggesting or implying that the <em>interpretation</em> of the <code>-r/--replace</code> string is dependent on whether <code>-F/--fixed-strings</code> is enabled. I don&#x27;t think it would be a good idea to do so. It&#x27;s quite subtle. The rule, &quot;you always need to escape <code>$</code> to write a literal <code>$</code>&quot; is simpler and not conditional.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is there any way to treat the <code>--replace</code> string as literal? Sometimes I just want to do a straightforward search and replace without having to worry about escapes.</p>
