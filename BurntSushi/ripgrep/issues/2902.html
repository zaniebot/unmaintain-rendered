<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 14.1.0</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>DNF / Pacman</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Fedora Silverblue 40 / Arch Linux</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>Ripgrep fails to give ANYTHING inside the /tmp/(gibberish) files. <code>grep -R</code> works tho, but <code>grep -r</code>. Why? Is grep better than ripgrep? It seems so to me. One works, the other doesn&#x27;t, even with <code>rg -e</code> flags.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>I want to search a certain string inside a pkg build made by paru (arch linux build). The string is &quot;ld -z&quot;, thing is. RipGrep can&#x27;t search even basic text like &quot;Build&quot; (there&#x27;s a lot of build text inside the folder). <code>grep -r</code> doesn&#x27;t work either. But <code>grep -R</code> does. What&#x27;s the matter with the /tmp files? even with sudo it doesn&#x27;t find anything.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p><code>$ rg -e &quot;ld -z&quot; /tmp/aurmkulYq/</code> and I get no output.
<code>$ rg -e &quot;Build&quot; /tmp/aurmkulYq/</code> still no output.</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -R &quot;Build&quot; /tmp/aurmkulYq/

</code></pre>
<p>So... is gnu grep better than ripgrep? One works, the other doesn&#x27;t. Huh~</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>At least with <code>rg -e &quot;Build&quot; /tmp/aurmkulYq</code> it should output <em>something</em></p>
