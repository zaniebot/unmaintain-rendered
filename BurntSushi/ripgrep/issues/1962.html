            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The documentation for the <code>--quiet</code> flag is misleading with the <code>--files</code> flag.</p>
<p>The current documentation states:</p>
<pre><code>       -q, --quiet
           Do not print anything to stdout. If a match is found in a file,
           then ripgrep will stop searching. This is useful when ripgrep is
           used only for its exit code (which will be an error if no matches
           are found).

           When --files is used, then ripgrep will stop finding files after
           finding the first file that matches all ignore rules.
</code></pre>
<p>The very last part, &quot;the first file that matches all ignore rules&quot; seems like it&#x27;s worded backwards.  I get what it means, it&#x27;s just oddly worded.  It might be better to state instead &quot;the first file that does not match any ignore rules&quot;.</p>
<p>Just an opinion, feel free to close if you disagree.</p>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>rg --version
ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
