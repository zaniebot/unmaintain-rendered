            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What is the type name? Of the popular languages, I think only C/C++ have this kind of split, so I imagine it would be specific to them and not a general rule.</p>
<p>Note that you can also search header files by specifying a glob, e.g., <code>-g &#x27;*.h&#x27;</code>, which I kind of think might be good enough.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>ack</code>, <code>ag</code>, and <code>ucg</code> (and maybe others) have a <code>--hh</code> file type for this for C/C++, which only includes &#x27;<em>.h&#x27; files.  Which now that I type that, probably should be expanded to include &#x27;</em>.hpp&#x27; etc. forms.</p>
