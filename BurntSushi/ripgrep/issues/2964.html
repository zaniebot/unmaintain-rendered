<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<p>ignore v0.4.23</p>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>Cargo</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>Fedora 41</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>If I use ignore to copy a folder with the associate git repository files, the filters of <code>.gitignore</code> are applied to files of the .git folder (ex with .idx).
Files from a .git folder work as a whole, it's seems logical to not apply to them the filter of <code>.gitignore</code> (when hidden is set to false in Walk)</p>
<p>Related issue in release-plz : https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz/issues/1961</p>
<p>I have tried to use overrides with &quot;.git/&quot; and &quot;.git/*&quot;, but from what i tested, whitelisting did not work with files in subfolder of <code>.git</code> (files in .git/objects/pack/ wasn't whitlisted).</p>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<p>iteratewith a ignoreWalk on a folder with a git repository, a gitignore with a line *.idx, and hidden set to false (to process .git folder) and see than idx files in <code>.git/objects/pack/</code> are filtered.</p>
<p>I have encounter the problem with the usage of release-plz. cf issue : https://github.com/release-plz/release-plz/issues/1961</p>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p>release-plz update in a repository than have *.idx in .gitignore</p>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>I expect than the files of .git folder wasn't affected by filter of .gitignore
Or than, If I add <code>.git/*</code> in overrides, all files in .git and subfolders be whitelisted.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You might need `.git/**.</p>
<p>I'm unsure of whether gitignore should apply to <code>.git</code>. It doesn't make sense in the context of git itself, but ripgrep isn't git and its implementation is separate from git. I kind of feel like it's more unexpected for gitignore to apply to everything except for <code>.git</code>.</p>
<p>Also, please provide an MRE. That would be a Rust program using <code>ignore</code> on a defined set of inputs that others can reproduce.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's to work with <code>.git/**</code>, thank you.
I had seen than <code>/**</code> exist in the code, but not understanding than it can help in this case.</p>
<p>I'm unsure too for a specific management of <code>.git</code> in ignore, but I think both can have arguments.
Perhaps with a specific option on WalkBuilder ? (like require_git)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>WalkBuilder</code> has too many options already. I'm not really a &quot;add a knob for ever conceivable use case&quot; kinda person, and would rather folks paper over behaviors they don't like with whitelist globs.</p>

Perhaps add some example in doc of <code>OverrideBuilder</code>, could help to better see the usage and functionalities.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, I looked too quickly, the option with '.git/**' as override doesn't work, all content of <code>.git</code> folder are copied, but regular files are not copied anymore (README.md).</p>
<p>I don't understand why <code>matched</code> in Override return <code>Match::Ignore</code> if <code>mat.is_none() &amp;&amp; self.num_whitelists() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; !is_dir</code>.
I was expected than, if there is no match in Override, so others matches (like from .gitignore) would be tested.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, you should fine a simple test with this repository : https://github.com/gwen-lg/ignore_override_test
The file1 is not copied contrary to what I expect (and assert is triggered).</p>
