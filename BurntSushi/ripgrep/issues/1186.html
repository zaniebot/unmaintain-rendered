            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be cool for ripgrep to respect the NO_COLOR &quot;standard&quot;, i.e. when $NO_COLOR is set, ripgrep should not colorize the output. See https://no-color.org</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'm OK with this in principle. It should be implemented in <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/termcolor"><code>termcolor</code></a> as parts of its <a href="https://docs.rs/termcolor/1.0.4/termcolor/enum.ColorChoice.html#variant.Auto">&quot;auto&quot;</a> mode.</p>
<p>I think I've historically not done this because it's not clear to me how widespread <code>NO_COLOR</code> usage actually is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, and sorry for not doing my research. I suspected ripgrep to use some library for colored terminal output and that would obviously be the better place to implement this. I've opened https://github.com/BurntSushi/termcolor/issues/13.
As for how widespread <code>NO_COLOR</code> usage is, I can't really say, but I don't see a big downside to not implementing it. The variable name is fairly specific and even if it is set, one can override it, i.e. turn on colors, on a per program basis.
You can probably close this issue, since it needs to be implemented in termcolor and the change will eventually show up in ripgrep, when dependencies are updated.</p>
