            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One feature that I think would be very useful for searching source code files is the ability to search within &quot;scopes&quot;. For example, there might be a &quot;comments&quot; scope which would restrict the search to single- and multi-line comments. Another possible scope could be &quot;literals&quot; to search within string and numeric literals.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds cool, but requires language aware parsing support. Even if I accepted this as something I would want in ripgrep, it will be years before it ever happens. So I&#x27;m just going to close this.</p>
<p>There are other issues tracking similar features that have a more restricted scope, and even then, the scope still feels large. I&#x27;m on mobile, otherwise I&#x27;d dig them up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In what I was doing today, this occurred to me as a <em>really</em> useful feature and so I came to request it if no one had before. The mention of similar features made me look through <code>--help</code> more closely, and I found <code>--pre</code> which can be used in conjunction with another program to approximate this effect. You can search outside of comments if you write a program that filters out the comments, for example (I would recommend replacing them with equivalent whitespace so file positions remain the same). I do not know of any existing programs to achieve <em>that</em>, but I haven’t looked, either.</p>
