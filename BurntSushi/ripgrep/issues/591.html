            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry if this already exists and I just can't find it.  I have an issue where I'm piping a large amount of data into rg and it's not always valid unicode (could be a mix of encodings in the same stream).  I tried using the encoding ascii but the regex will still complain that the input isn't valid utf8.  Is there (or could there be) a way to use the bytes::Regex instead of the normal Regex to get around this issue?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but the way you've described this issue doesn't make any sense to me. Please provide a way for me to reproduce your problem.</p>
<p>bytes::Regex is a red herring. That's what ripgrep already uses.</p>
