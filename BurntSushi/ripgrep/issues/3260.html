            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I apologize if this has been litigated already but I couldn't find anything in search.</p>
<p>The ignore crate is used by a number of non-ripgrep tools. I have found that I run into situations where I want to ignore things for one tool but not another.  The feature request then is to be able to add additional ignored files to the ignore crate on an individual tool basis.  For instance, a hypothetical tool <code>foo</code> could add <code>.fooignore</code> as a specific ignore file only honored by that tool. I imagine this could be configured on the <code>WalkBuilder</code> but I didn't see anything there presently.</p>
<p>I do not currently maintain a tool that uses or would use the <code>ignore</code> crate in this way but if it were added I would open feature requests or PRs for some tools currently using <code>ignore</code>.</p>

<p><code>ignore</code> doesn't encode any ripgrep specific logic.</p>
<p>It's how <code>fd</code> supports <code>.fdignore</code>:</p>

<p>It's how ripgrep support <code>.rgignore</code>:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks and apologies for the spam, I misinterpreted this part of the docs and didn't scroll down far enough to see the function in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore files currently only come from git ignore files (.gitignore, .git/info/exclude and the configured global gitignore file), plain .ignore files, which have the same format as gitignore files, or explicitly added ignore files.</p>
