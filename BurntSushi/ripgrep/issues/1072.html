            <div class="timeline-body"><p>MS word .docx are made to store text on windows. It would be great to be able to search inside these files.</p>
<p>Thanks for your great work! (But I'm still looking for an app that could do that)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep is primarily a tool for searching plain text or otherwise UTF-8 encoded data. It is <em>not</em> a tool that knows how to decode and read arbitrary files. It will <strong>never</strong> be such a tool.</p>
<p>While ripgrep does have some support for understanding different types of files, such as compressed files, the support is limited and only intended as a low-effort-but-big-gain-in-many-cases kind of feature.</p>
<p>If you have a tool that can convert docx files to plain text, then you should be able to search them pretty easily by using the <code>--pre</code> flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Is the some way to tell rg that a docx file is just a zip?  I attempted to use the -z option, but rg doesn't reconize docx as a zip.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>-z</code> flat only recognizes a fixed set of file extensions. You can either unzip the file yourself and search it, it use the <code>--pre</code> flag.</p>
