            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I constantly use the <code>sack</code> tool ( https://github.com/sampson-chen/sack ) to provide a nice wrapper around my silversearcher results.  It allows me to quickly open a file with vim at the exact location of the search result.  As you can imagine, this saves tons of time when exploring a large code base.  I would love to see this capability in ripgrep.  I recently discovered a similar project implemented in go  https://github.com/zph/go-sack.  I&#x27;m not sure how difficult it would be to add this capability to ripgrep, but it would greatly improve its usefulness.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep is certainly not going to grow <code>sack</code> functionality on its own. It seems like it should be added as a wrapper tool like it is for the silver searcher. Adding editor specific functionality to ripgrep doesn&#x27;t seem like something I&#x27;d be willing to maintain.</p>
