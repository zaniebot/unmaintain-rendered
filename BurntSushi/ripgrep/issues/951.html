<p><code>rg</code> does not seem to work properly with regard to pipes.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> works:</p>
<pre><code>(let ((default-directory &quot;~/src/emacs/emacs&quot;))
  (setq argh (make-process :name &quot;grep&quot;
                           :command (list &quot;rgrep&quot; &quot;TODO&quot;)
                           :connection-type &#x27;pipe
                           :buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*grep*&quot;))))
(with-current-buffer (process-buffer argh)
  (length (buffer-string))) ;; =&gt; 114100
(process-status argh) ;; =&gt; exit
</code></pre>
<p><code>rg</code> does not:</p>
<pre><code>(let ((default-directory &quot;~/src/emacs/emacs&quot;))
  (setq argh (make-process :name &quot;rg&quot;
                           :command (list &quot;rg&quot; &quot;TODO&quot;)
                           :connection-type &#x27;pipe
                           :buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*rg*&quot;))))
(with-current-buffer (process-buffer argh)
  (length (buffer-string))) ;; =&gt; 0
(process-status argh) ;; =&gt; run
</code></pre>
<p>The process is still running:</p>
<pre><code>$ pgrep -a rg
31513 /usr/bin/rg TODO
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I use the <code>pty</code> type, it works:</p>
<pre><code>(let ((default-directory &quot;~/src/emacs/emacs&quot;))
  (setq argh (make-process :name &quot;rg&quot;
                           :command (list &quot;rg&quot;
                                          &quot;TODO&quot;)
                           :connection-type &#x27;pty
                           :buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*rg*&quot;))))
(with-current-buffer (process-buffer argh)
  (length (buffer-string))) ;; =&gt; 96824
(process-status argh) ;; =&gt; exit
</code></pre>
<p><code>ag</code> also seems to work correctly, like <code>grep</code>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thanks, you&#x27;re right that the problem was that the directory to search was unspecified.  This works:</p>
<pre><code>(let ((default-directory &quot;~/src/emacs/emacs&quot;))
  (setq argh (make-process :name &quot;rg&quot;
                           :command (list &quot;rg&quot; &quot;TODO&quot; &quot;.&quot;)  ; &lt;- &quot;.&quot; specified the current directory
                           :connection-type &#x27;pipe  ; &lt;- using a pipe instead of a pty
                           :buffer (get-buffer-create &quot;*rg*&quot;))))
(with-current-buffer (process-buffer argh)
  (length (buffer-string)))  ;; =&gt; 210825
(process-status argh)  ;; =&gt; exit
</code></pre>
<blockquote>

<p>This is difficult (for me, at least) because the problem seems to be at a deeper level than, e.g. calling <code>rg</code> from a shell, and I&#x27;m not an expert in how Unix processes work.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes, it seems that, basically, when <code>rg</code> thinks it&#x27;s outputting to a pipe, and there is no specified directory to search, it doesn&#x27;t do any searching (calling with <code>--debug</code> does give debug output, but no searching happens, and the program blocks).</p>
<p>However, <code>grep</code> doesn&#x27;t work this way: when it&#x27;s called with output to a pipe but no data on STDIN, it searches for files, just as it does when called with output to a tty.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the intended behavior, that when <code>rg</code> is called with STDOUT going to a pipe, it expects to search STDIN rather than files.  However, I&#x27;m not sure if this is documented, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>rg --help
...
    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f FILE ...] [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list
</code></pre>
<p>The only mention of STDIN is:</p>
<pre><code>        --no-filename                       
            Never print the file path with the matched lines. This is the default when
            ripgrep is explicitly instructed to search one file or stdin.
</code></pre>
<p>So I guess that either this needs to be documented clearly, or the behavior needs to be improved to search for files unless data is received on STDIN.  For parity with <code>grep</code>, I suppose the latter is better.</p>

<p>Indeed, I looked at <code>ag</code>&#x27;s code and repo, and it definitely has some issues regarding option handling.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><code>rgrep</code> is a standard alias for <code>grep -r</code>.  On Debian, it&#x27;s part of the <code>grep</code> package:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /usr/bin/rgrep
#!/bin/sh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
exec grep -r &quot;$@&quot;

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The fact that <code>rgrep</code> is aliased to <code>grep -r</code> explains the mystery. ripgrep has no <code>-r</code> flag because recursive search is the default, but ripgrep should also support searching stdin when available without the user needing to specify <code>-</code>. Thus, ripgrep must guess at what you want. <code>grep -r</code> does not do any such thing, because <code>-r</code> always makes it do recursive search. It ignores what&#x27;s on stdin. Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ grep -Hr a /tmp/elsewhere
/tmp/elsewhere:a
$ grep -Hr a ./in-current-dir
./in-current-dir:a
$ grep -Hr a
in-current-dir:a
$ cat /tmp/elsewhere | grep -Hr a
in-current-dir:a
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, there is no such thing as &quot;parity&quot; in this case. <strong>This is one of the fundamental differences between ripgrep and grep.</strong></p>
<p>Note that I still don&#x27;t know what it is you&#x27;re trying to achieve. Why are you connecting a pipe to your process when you don&#x27;t want to send anything on stdin?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>When no file paths are given to ripgrep, it uses a heuristic to decide what to do. Namely, ripgrep will block to search on stdin when no paths are given <strong>and</strong> stdin is not a tty <strong>and</strong> stdin is either a file or a fifo. In all other cases, it searches the current working directory. When you connect a pipe to it, my guess is that ripgrep probably sees that as a fifo and blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, I looked at ag&#x27;s code and repo, and it definitely has some issues regarding option handling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only difference that I can see between ag and ripgrep on this particular issue is that ripgrep checks if stdin is a tty or not. If it&#x27;s a tty, then it always does recursive search. The corollary to that is that the only way for ripgrep to search stdin is if its stdin is <em>not</em> a tty. ag has no such check. All it does is check if stdin is a file or a fifo (which ripgrep also does):</p>
<pre><code>    rv = fstat(fileno(stdin), &amp;statbuf);
    if (rv == 0) {
        if (S_ISFIFO(statbuf.st_mode) || S_ISREG(statbuf.st_mode)) {
            opts.search_stream = 1;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>That ag doesn&#x27;t block is actually interesting, because in order for ripgrep to search stdin, it must detect stdin as either a file or a fifo. That should cause ag to also attempt to search stdin. So probably something else is going on, but diving into emacs is beyond the scope of what I&#x27;m willing to debug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I guess that either this needs to be documented clearly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be worth a mention in the docs, but ripgrep&#x27;s default behavior is pretty much what you&#x27;d expect it to do. If you don&#x27;t give it a path, then it searches CWD, unless you&#x27;re piping something into it, in which case, it searches that data instead.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, I understand better now.  I think it was actually an accident that I originally ran <code>rgrep</code> in that example rather than <code>grep</code>--I think I was trying to turn <code>rg</code> into <code>grep</code> and I overlooked the <code>r</code> at the beginning of the word.  Silly mistakes...  :/</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Because Emacs&#x27; process code works much better when it uses a pipe rather than emulating a tty.  Chris Wellons explains the details in his blog: http://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/01/17/  It&#x27;s very interesting how he used DTrace to figure out what was going on between <code>curl</code> and Emacs.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the problem was indeed that I misunderstood <code>rg</code>&#x27;s behavior and expectation of receiving data on STDIN.  It would be very helpful if this were explained in the docs.  As a first step, may I suggest changing the command examples to:</p>
<pre><code>    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f FILE ...] [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]
    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list
    command | rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN
</code></pre>
<p>That at least shows that connecting a pipe to <code>rg</code> implies searching STDIN and is not intended for searching paths.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So, after the jump to ripgrep 13, also neovim&#x27;s <code>jobstart()</code> started to hang when calling ripgrep. I found a solution and I leave this comment for other people to &quot;connect the dots&quot;. As the doc suggests, supply a path as last argument to ripgrep:</p>
<pre><code>rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]
# or if you want to start in the current dir:
rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN ./
</code></pre>
<p>This is also very well documented in the manpage/documentation of ripgrep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ripgrep will automatically detect if stdin exists and search stdin for a regex pattern, e.g. ls | rg foo. In some environments, stdin may exist when it shouldn&#x27;t. To turn off stdin detection explicitly specify the directory to search, e.g. rg foo ./.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In most cases it should be therefore sufficient to add a <code>./</code> as last paramenter</p>
<p>This has also been suggested at <a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/25025/neovim-jobstart-not-receiving-stdout-sometimes-if-async-i-think">vi.stackexchange.com</a></p>
