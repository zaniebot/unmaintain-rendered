Quoting manpage:</p>
<pre><code> --files
        Print each file that would be searched (but don't search).
</code></pre>
<p>But that is incorrect, <code>--files</code> lists all &quot;unignored&quot; files, including binary ones, which will not be searched unless <code>--text</code> added.  <a href="https://github.com/genestack/user-tutorials/tree/master/source/_static">Example</a>:</p>
<pre><code> % ls .
favicon.ico  genestack.css  logo.svg

 % rg --files                                           
favicon.ico                                              
genestack.css
logo.svg

 % rg -l 0  
logo.svg

 % rg -al 0
favicon.ico
logo.svg
</code></pre>
<p>I expect <code>rg --files</code> to omit binary files unless <code>--text</code> is added.</p>
<p>If there is any way of doing that (listing files without ignored and binary ones), I would gladly accept that too.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not quite follow you.  Does any similar tool does that?  <code>ag</code> does not, there's similar issue opened there as well (before me).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Again, you lost me there.  How does <code>ripgrep</code> already do that?  In proposed example <em>.ico</em> file isn't searched by <code>ripgrep</code> unless I add <code>--text</code>.  I presume there is some check for that already, which isn't triggered in <code>--files</code> mode.  Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Binary file detection happens during search.</p>

<p>It's not about complexity. The whole point of the <code>--files</code> flag is to list files that <em>would</em> be searched. Filtering out binary files from that list requires them to be searched, which is exactly what <code>--files</code> says <em>won't</em> happen. More practically, the reason why <code>--files</code> exists is because it's much faster than searching.</p>
<p>If you really want this, then all you need to do is run a search. i.e., Instead of <code>rg --files</code>, use <code>rg -l '.?'</code>, which will print every file that matched the given regex (which always matches), but also omits binary files.</p>
