            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>Many languages use <code>/</code> to indicate the start and end of a regular expression, and thus require any forward slashes within the pattern to be escaped as <code>\/</code>.</p>
<p>ripgrep does not need to explicitly delimit regexes, and does not treat <code>/</code> as special.  But sometimes habit leads me to mistakenly type <code>\/</code> anyway.  This produces an error:</p>
<pre><code>regex parse error:
    \/foo
    ^^
error: unrecognized escape sequence
</code></pre>
<p>Fair enough.  But given ripgrep&#x27;s status as an interactive tool, it would be nice if it would just Do What I Mean, perhaps warning about the unnecessary escape but then proceeding, rather than making me go back and edit the command.</p>
<p>I tested various other regular expression APIs and tools that don&#x27;t use <code>/</code> as a delimiter: Python <code>re</code>, PCRE, GNU grep, and BSD grep on macOS.  All of these accepted <code>\/</code> (with no warning) and treated it as <code>/</code>.  (Most of those seemed to allow unnecessary backslash escapes of arbitrary characters; Python allowed it for characters other than letters and numbers.  Personally I&#x27;d prefer a more conservative approach that only allows it for <code>/</code>.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is better tracked here: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/501">rust-lang/regex#501</a></p>
<p>While I suppose ripgrep could allow this independently of what the regex engine does, it would probably be more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</p>
