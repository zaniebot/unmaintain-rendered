            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the creations I&#x27;m porting from Python or writing anew, the most common use I have for recursive directory traversal is to turn a mixture of file and directory paths given at the command line into a list of file paths to be processed.</p>
<p>While <code>ignore</code> and <code>walkdir</code> one-up Python&#x27;s <code>os.walk</code> in one respect (I don&#x27;t need to call <code>os.path.isdir</code> and bypass <code>os.walk</code> for non-directories), <code>WalkBuilder</code> makes taking a <code>Vec</code> of roots surprisingly un-ergonomic because the first one must be special-cased.</p>
<p>If I&#x27;m willing to mutate StructOpt&#x27;s output (which I&#x27;d prefer to avoid), the simplest solution I&#x27;ve found is:</p>
<pre><code>    if let Some(path1) = opts.inpath.pop() {
        let mut builder = WalkBuilder::new(path1);
        for path in opts.inpath {
            builder.add(path);
        }
        for result in builder.build() {
            // TODO: Process each file
        }

    }
</code></pre>
<p>If I&#x27;m not willing to mutate it, then it&#x27;s worse.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the awkwardness of using <code>Iterator::fold</code> when what&#x27;s really needed is <code>Iterator::fold_first</code>.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to propose one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>WalkBuilder::empty()</code> constructor so I can call <code>add</code> for the first argument too.</li>
<li>Add a <code>WalkBuilder::from_iter()</code> constructor so I can just feed my <code>Vec</code> of roots directly to it.</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This sounds fine to me, as long as the semantics for an empty walker are clear and the implementation matches those semantics. (The existing code I imagine has never needed to handle that case, since a walker always has at least one root by construction.) I don&#x27;t expect this to be a challenge or anything, but it&#x27;s easy to overlook.</p>
<p>PRs are welcome. I&#x27;m unlikely to do this myself any time soon, but could do it next time I&#x27;m in the code.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fair enough. I certainly won&#x27;t have time to work on someone else&#x27;s codebase until at least the new year, but I&#x27;ll leave myself a note in case I can find time.</p>
<p>Do you have a preference between <code>WalkBuilder::empty()</code> and <code>WalkBuilder::from_iter()</code> or should I use my own judgment on which one to implement if I get to it first?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, I&#x27;d like to give this a try, I just have a couple of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What should happen if you use <code>WalkBuilder::from_iter()</code> with an empty iterator?
I assume nothing, it would be the same as using <code>WalkBuilder::empty()</code></li>
<li>What should happen if you try to run <code>WalkBuilder::build()</code> but you haven&#x27;t added any paths? Should it panic?</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, what&#x27;s the status of this? I would be interested in this feature as well 😄.</p>
<p>My opinion @SpyrosRoum for building an empty <code>WalkBuilder</code> is that it should work fine, but the built <code>Walk</code> should just have no items during iteration, that saves us from having to panic.</p>
