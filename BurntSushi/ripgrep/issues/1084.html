            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<pre><code>% rg --version
ripgrep 0.10.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Arch Linux, using the Arch-official <code>ripgrep</code> package.</p>
<h4>Bug description/reproduction steps</h4>
<p>This prints out &quot;abcd&quot;.</p>
<p><code>echo 'abcd' | rg 'a(.*(d|ce))'</code></p>
<p>Adding a &quot;c&quot; makes it not match (i.e. it doesn't print out anything).</p>
<p><code>echo 'abcd' | rg 'a(.*(cd|ce))'</code></p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>I believe that both regexes should match the input, and print out a match in both cases. Testing using <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101</a> seems to imply this is true.</p>
<h4>Real-world discovery background (non-minimal case that made me discover the minimal repro above):</h4>
<p>I was trying to run <code>git diff --name-only master... | rg 'js/src/(.*(cpp|\.h))' --replace '$1'</code>.</p>
<p><code>git diff --name-only master...</code> printed lines such as:</p>
<pre><code>js/src/frontend/BinSource.yaml
js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp
js/src/frontend/ParseNode.h
</code></pre>
<p>and I wanted to extract:</p>
<pre><code>frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp
frontend/ParseNode.h
</code></pre>
<p>(i.e. trim <code>js/src/</code> off the front, and only match <code>cpp</code> and <code>h</code> files)</p>
<p>However, adding a <code>\.</code> in front of the <code>cpp</code> made <em>nothing</em> match.</p>
<p><code>git diff --name-only master... | rg 'js/src/(.*(\.cpp|\.h))' --replace '$1'</code> -- prints nothing???</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a duplicate of #1064 and #1081. It's fixed on master.</p>
<p>From my digging, I thought that this bug wasn't a regression, but had always been there in previous versions of ripgrep. However, we've had this bug filed three times since the release of ripgrep 0.10, but never before. So something seems fishy.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, I don't think it's a regression. I found the same thing on 0.8.1, confirmed it on 0.10.0, and was going to report it until I found all the duplicates.</p>
