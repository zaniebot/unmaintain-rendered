            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your feature request</h4>
<p>It is common in some code-bases to have a file-name being the identifier of a feature, which could be of interest of someone looking for code of that feature. Sometimes, these identifiers are not repeated inside the file content, causing a regular &quot;grep&quot; action on the code-base to fail.</p>
<p>An example of this would be a library using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/requireindex">requireindex npm package</a> to have submodules loaded without having to repeat the module names. Then, having the identifier of each of those modules (the file name), it's not possible to find these modules using a regular grep (unless the name is repeated somewhere, which is not always the case).</p>
<p>We could argue that it's a better job for <code>git</code> to implement such a feature, and I would agree that git also could use a combination of its <code>grep</code> and <code>lf</code> subcommands. However, <code>rg</code>, with the existing great support for <code>git</code> repositories, could also use a feature.</p>
<p>Afaik, ripgrep is not currently expected to be used for matching file names as a primary objective. Meaning, if we're going to add a content+path search feature, it probably makes sense to <em>also</em> have a path-only search feature added. This could be considered out-of-the-scope for the project, of course. However, this would make ripgrep also a good replacement for <code>find</code>/<code>git lf</code>, in addition to the current content searching feature—without too much extra cost, as the existing code is already walking over dirs/files and does have some path-matching rules in place.</p>
<p>What do y'all think?</p>

<p>I really think the simpler answer here is, if you need it, to write a wrapper script that does both searches for you.</p>
