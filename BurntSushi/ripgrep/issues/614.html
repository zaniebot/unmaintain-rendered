            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Okay.  I had at face value assumed that xargs would only invoke more than one rg process (in non-parallel mode) if the number of arguments exceeded the argument limit on my system (which I&#x27;m pretty sure is much higher than this).  But it appears that I&#x27;m wrong, because just running <code>rg -l --sort-files bar /tmp/test/{000..100}.txt</code> results in correctly sorted output.</p>
<p>So like you say, it seems like this is a non-issue.  Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right, piping to sort is a fine thing to do, but I wasn&#x27;t aware that xargs would behave that way and so thought there was an actual problem with rg.</p>
<p>Clearly it&#x27;s more than fine.  It&#x27;s correct :).</p>
