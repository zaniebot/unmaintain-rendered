            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s not really clear how the automatic encoding detection is supposed to work - which encodings should it be able to detect? Do you have any test cases that I can look at, or can you point to where the code is? It doesn&#x27;t appear that encoding_rs is responsible for this, as best I can tell?</p>
<p>If I have a better idea of how it should work, I can file a better issue (or not file one)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, the man page is pretty light on details here, but I think the guide explains it a bit better: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#file-encoding Although, the guide never mentions the <code>auto</code> value, instead, it just talks about what ripgrep does by &quot;default.&quot;</p>
<p>In summary, by default, ripgrep looks for a BOM. If it sees a UTF-16 BOM, then it does UTF-16 to UTF-8 transcoding automatically and searches the UTF-8. I don&#x27;t think anything else is done.</p>
<p>Folks have filed issues in the past about being more aggressive in encoding detection, but I&#x27;d rather not dive into those waters if possible. It is possible for one to use <code>--pre</code> and probably <code>--pre-glob</code> to implement one&#x27;s own detection &amp; transcoding though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Got it, yeah I think the man page implies that it might do more than it currently does.</p>
