            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>13.0.0</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Locally built binary.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Ubuntu 20.04</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>Global ignore file located either at ~/.config/rg and ~/.config/ripgrep is not working.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Create a ignore text file and soft link it to ~/.config/rg/ignore, ~/.config/rg/.ignore, ~/.config/ripgrep/ignore and ~/.config/ripgrep/.ignore.
Now run rg command anywhere, should respect the ignore file.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>rg doesn't respect the ignore file.</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>rg should respect the ignore file similar to using --ignore-file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>None of the things you've done are supported by ripgrep. So I don't know why you expect them to do anything. If you want a config file, follow the steps in the docs about setting RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, okay, I just saw this https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/cc90511ab29d3c37e873acac0fd80f90473f54bb#diff-0ec86f4f4d491d0c2cd77e264ed6337b7cb0d064b0280281029e180f009b4799R8 and hence expected that it worked so I could have a single ignore for all use case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That's from 2016. And it's library level docs just giving an example, e.g., finding an ignore file in a parent directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>True however I didn't knew there would such a large refactor in the code base and the way it was supposed to be used globally. I read the related issues and the controversial &quot;~&quot; not supported in the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH file (even though a workaround was suggested using alias, but didn't work with my vim settings).</p>
<p>Sorting through all the things, I have managed to produce what I initially wanted to do using the CONFIG_PATH. I just didn't thought of using --ignore-file through CONFIG_PATH file before and hence created this ticket. Stupid of me, lol.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for your time and for replying so quickly! @BurntSushi</p>
