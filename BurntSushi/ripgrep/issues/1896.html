            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@arzoriac Out of curiosity, is there a reason why you&#x27;re still using the tap instead of upstream homebrew? (I have idly considered removing the tap.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@arzoriac Ah. That was true a few years ago. You can switch to the Homebrew now then if that&#x27;s the only reason. ripgrep&#x27;s SIMD is now baked into the binary portably. Previously, you had to enable a compile time switch to get it to work on nightly Rust, but that stuff stabilized a while back and now everything &quot;just works.&quot; :-)</p>
