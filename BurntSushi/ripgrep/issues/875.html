<p>Andrew, I know you are loathe to add more <code>!</code> support but given the pre-existing <code>-E</code>, perhaps a <code>-e !PATTERN</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The name of the flag is really not the interesting part of this feature request. The interesting part is the request to support more sophisticated boolean tests.</p>
<p>I think if we were to decide to do this, then it needs to be part of a larger story that encompasses more sophisticated expressions. We also need to address the fact that, today, we can actually express quite a bit, but it requires piping. Namely, piping permits expressing &quot;and&quot;. Piping plus the <code>-v</code> flag permits any arbitrary boolean expression you might want. For example, <code>rg foo | rg -v bar</code> says &quot;show lines matching <code>foo</code> but do not contain <code>bar</code>,&quot; which is <em>exactly</em> your feature request.</p>
<p><code>git grep</code> has support for this via <code>-not</code>, <code>-and</code> and <code>-or</code>. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m willing to add this to ripgrep. There <em>must</em> be a point at which we say, &quot;piping is good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>An alternative way to implement this feature is in the regex engine itself (since intersection and complement are available as operations on regular languages), but this is extremely non-trivial to do.</p>
<p>I try not to speak in absolutes, but, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to add anything else that uses <code>!</code> in a shell&quot; is as close to an absolute that I can get. Let&#x27;s drop that idea.</p>

<p>Well, the &quot;best&quot; way is to, as I hinted at, build complement and intersection into the regex engine. But as I said, this is extremely non-trivial to do efficiently. If we were to implement this, then we&#x27;d need an algorithm that selects the (attempted) optimal matching path given all of the boolean conditions. e.g., if you said &quot;x and not y and not z,&quot; then ripgrep would search for <code>x</code> and only apply the <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> blacklist on matches to filter them out. If you had <code>x or y or z</code>, then ripgrep would, as it does today, combine them into one regex joined by <code>|</code>. If you had <code>not x and not y and not z</code>, then ripgrep behave as it would today if you ran <code>rg -v x</code> and then use the <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> blacklists to filter our matches. If you had <code>not x or not y or not z</code>, then ripgrep could behave as it does today if you ran <code>rg -v &#x27;x|y|z&#x27;</code>. And so on...</p>
<p>It is plausible that this would result in a performance improvement. But you can&#x27;t just throw that out there as a benefit and expect it to stick. :-) Performance does not exist in a vacuum. Pipelines tend to be constructed in a way that iteratively reduces the search space, which in turn makes performance less and less of an issue. The interesting bits are probably pipelines that start with an inverted match on a rarely occurring pattern, which would not reduce the search space much. Regardless, I personally find this to be a somewhat flimsy motivation for a feature like this unless someone can convince me otherwise. IMO, if we add a feature like this, it should be primarily for the UX.</p>

I think it&#x27;s an example where the built-in op can provide better UX than piping.</p>
<p>Another example is piping with -A or -B.</p>
<pre><code>// want to print a line including &quot;abc&quot; and &quot;xyz&quot; with +- 3 lines
rg abc -A 3 -B -3 | rg xyz -A 3 -B 3  // not what we want

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s certainly part of an argument in favor of this, but I will not allow that argument to be used as a hammer. Taken to its logical conclusion, ripgrep should bundle every conceivable transform on its data. At some point, people need to become OK with piping ripgrep&#x27;s output and dealing with the different format. Different people will have different opinions on where that line is drawn.</p>

<p>That would be nice but won&#x27;t work in all cases. E.g., consider</p>
<pre><code>rg -C5 foo | rg -v bar
</code></pre>
<p>Now the context lines around the matched lines in the first rg call are being matched by the second rg call and your output may end up being a bit of a mess and not what you might expect.</p>

<p>Looking at a few now-closed duplicate issues, what most people want is just &quot;a and not b&quot; with all of headers/context preserved which might make sense to special-case if that&#x27;s much simpler that the general case.</p>

<p>Personally I&#x27;m not that interested in using complex boolean or regex patterns with ripgrep. I just want to be able to specify multiple patterns. Perhaps this could just be specified with a new flag like</p>
<pre><code>rg --patterns &quot;level=error&quot; --patterns &quot;requestID&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe that&#x27;s too simplistic, but I&#x27;ve been using rg nearly since it was started and I&#x27;ve never had any desire for anything besides a simple &#x27;and&#x27; match on multiple patterns.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@sparrc Conceptually, you might be right. But in terms of implementation, I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference, so I&#x27;m treating them the same. Also, ripgrep <em>does</em> have the ability to search multiple patterns (using the same exact flags as <code>grep</code>). It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a &quot;or&quot; match.</p>
<p>On top of that, the reason why just wanting &quot;and&quot; match is a little weird is because you can do it with pipelines: <code>rg level=error | rg requestID</code>. It&#x27;s just that the UX isn&#x27;t quite as good...</p>

<p>One of the main reasons for me to use <code>ripgrep</code>, and one of its advantages is speed, so I&#x27;m picking it when I&#x27;m searching large files. Using multiple pipes slows things down in some cases, as it copies the data, adds syscalls, etc.</p>

I would imagine it like this:</p>

Regular <code>grep</code> can do that for the matter. It is just that <code>ripgrep</code> is nicer to use which drives this request – to increase the nice UX rather than include an otherwise impossible feature!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My current work-around for this is effectively use <code>rg -l</code> to find all OR&#x27;ed matches, and then pass off to git grep.</p>
<p>A statement that looks roughly like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ my-grep -e foo --and -e bar --and --not &#x27;(&#x27; -e fizz -e buzz &#x27;)&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>Gets translated roughly to:</p>
<pre><code>rg -e foo -e bar -l -0 | xargs -0 git grep --threads 12 --no-index -e foo --and -e bar --and --not &#x27;(&#x27; -e fizz -e buzz &#x27;)&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>There&#x27;s a LOT of extra plumbing in my shell script to achieve better performance (e.g. don&#x27;t have ripgrep search for expressions in an <code>--and --not ( -e fizz -e buzz )</code> block, but ultimately <code>rg -l -0 | xargs -0 git grep --no-index</code> works pretty effectively, and is much faster than <code>git grep</code> by itself if you make use of e.g. <code>rg</code> type filters (e.g. <code>rg -t c -t py</code>).</p>
<p>This also allows you to specify some <code>git grep</code> specific formatting, like <code>--show-function</code>, in addition to those that <code>rg</code> also supports like <code>--break --heading --line-number</code>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>for UX on multiple patterns with boolean logic,</p>
<p>what if users wrote a double quoted string with &#x27;AND&#x27; , &#x27;OR&#x27;, &#x27;NOT&#x27; in it , but only within quotes and in all caps after a certain flag. if necessary could specifically surround query patterns with single quotes or curly brackets to make it easier to pluck them out.</p>
<p>if each query result is a set of matches, the logic can be a tree of set operations like intersection (&quot;AND&quot;), set union (&quot;OR&quot;), complement (&quot;NOT&quot;) to get the results which meet the criteria</p>
<pre><code># rg --logic &quot;practitioner AND surgery&quot;
r1, r2 = find([&quot;practitioner&quot;, &quot;surgery&quot;], data)
result = intersection(r1, r2)

# rg --logic &quot;patient AND (diabetes OR cancer) AND statin NOT lung cancer&quot;
r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 = find([&quot;patient&quot;, &quot;diabetes&quot;, &quot;cancer&quot;, &quot;statin&quot;, &quot;lung cancer&quot;], data)
result = intersection(r1, union(r2, r3), r4).difference(r5)
</code></pre>
<p>could follow a specific order of operations such as listed here: <a href="http://www.cwladis.com/math100/Lecture4Sets.htm#:~:text=Order%20of%20operations%20on%20sets%3A&amp;text=Just%20like%20with%20numbers%2C%20we%20always%20do%20anything%20in%20parentheses,all%20equal%20in%20the%20order.">order of operations on sets</a></p>
<p>as for performance, that could still be single pass over the data (presumably) but would require a check for multiple queries at each point O(N), plus each set operation is (i believe) linear in the number of matches, and thus fairly fast, but this can add a whole new dimension to the capabilities of ripgrep, AND / OR / NOT / Parenthesis is easily interpretable</p>

Your examples are simple because none of your queries are regexes. A DSL that embeds regexes means you&#x27;ll need to handle escaping, and that could become quite annoying. A DSL also implies, to me, that it needs facilities for bulk-including regexes, like via the <code>-f</code> flag.</p>
<p>If I had time to implement this, my first step would be to look at <code>git grep</code> and write a specification based on its man pages and behavior. Then evaluate whether that specification could be improved.</p>

<p>i just believe ripgrep could be a super fast offline-first alternative to algolia ...but perhaps regex could be surrounded by curlies?</p>
<p><code>rg --logic &quot;{^[A-Z]+_SUSPEND$} OR rustacean&quot;</code></p>
<p>if somebody needs to regex for curly brackets, or regex for regex patterns, they could use double curly brackets, or suck it up and use something else. and even if the logic matching didnt support regex at all, i&#x27;d use it, and it would be extremely useful in the vast majority of use cases where one doesn&#x27;t need regex</p>
<p>the plan i described is unclear about the order of operations tho, I&#x27;d suggest</p>
<p>parenthesis &gt; OR &gt; AND &gt; NOT
because &quot;or&quot; is more inclusive</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>git grep&#x27;s advanced Boolean expression should be the model for this. It allows nesting and grouped expressions.</p>
<p>git grep -e foo —and —not ( -e fizz -e buzz ) —and -e bar</p>
<p>Will match anything with “foo” and “bar” but exclude anything that contains “fizz” or “buzz”.  You can recursively nest things and make very complex queries this way.</p>

[[Bar]]
Foo

\w+

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think this was mentioned earlier:
<code>rg foo | rg bar</code> isn&#x27;t the same as <code>rg foo --and bar</code>, because <code>rg bar</code> will match also filenames with <code>bar</code>, so will have false positives</p>
<p>and the workaround <code>rg &#x27;foo.*bar|bar.*foo&#x27;</code> doesn&#x27;t scale well</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For context the primary reason I was looking for this functionality is because I use rg mostly in Emacs through projectile. From what I understand it parses the highlighted output from rg (highlighting matches) and displays them similarly highlighted in the emacs projectile ripgrep search results window. Doing any kind of piping defeats this, and I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a clean way around it without first-class support from the tool.</p>
<p>Does this sound like a familiar problem to anyone? Did you find a work around?</p>
<p>Basically I have grown to love fzf&#x27;s &quot;regex-like&quot; style of matching, where individual words are regexes, but everything that is separated by a <code>space</code> character is actually considered a separate match which are all allowed to match <em>anywhere</em> on the line, not just in that order (so it&#x27;s not like replacing <code>space</code> with <code>.*</code>). It&#x27;s great UX. Not necessarily <code>ripgrep</code>s responsibility to fill this niche of course, just thought I&#x27;d give some context.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can recommend using ugrep (https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep), which supports boolean matching, for what you @hraban describe.</p>
<p>Together with this simple script:</p>
<pre><code>args=()
query=()
while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
    case &quot;$1&quot; in
        --)
            # for files
            break
            ;;
        -*)
            args+=(&quot;$1&quot;)
            shift
            ;;
        *)
            query+=(--and &quot;$1&quot;)
            shift
    esac
done
ug --column-number &quot;${args[@]}&quot; &quot;${query[@]}&quot; &quot;$@&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can then find lines that match <code>one</code> and <code>two</code> in any order by calling <code>the-script one two -- /path/to/fle /other/file</code> or for recursive search <code>the-script one two</code>. This, together with ugrep&#x27;s support for terminal hyperlinks results in a really nice experience I make use of daily.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Here&#x27;s a NAND regex. I can confirm correct boolean regex is possible in the simple case of non-nested expressions foreach of AND/OR/NOT/XOR/NAND via TDD</p>
<p>one issue is, as @hraban mentioned, a natural way to input these is to pass multiple patterns, and the ripgrep cli expects a single pattern and paths as far as i understand right now. these boolean expression regexes get pretty long and arcane, decent user experience needs a builder pattern / DSL sort of thing. No doubt there are many ways to achieve this aim and cramming everything into one regex might not be the move, but since you have some of the best regex code around, compiling boolean expressions to regex is likely faster than doing logic queries outside of the regex machinery</p>

<p>currently hella swamped on unpaid work ugh, maybe it&#x27;s a fun thing to tinker with next month or this fall, wrote this in january, dont want to keep it bottled up, just want to post here in support of this valuable opportunity to further upgrade the already excellent ripgrep cli !</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@bionicles Thanks! The problem there is that it relies on look-around, and thus will only work with the <code>-P/--pcre2</code> switch.</p>
