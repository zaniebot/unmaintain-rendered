            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>▶ rg --version                                                                                                                                                                    
ripgrep 11.0.1
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Compiled from source</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>MacOS (Catalina)</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I think that passing a plain directory as argument to <code>-g</code> should match files in that directory. Moreover, prefixing a match string with <code>!</code> should negate the results. This seems to the behaviour most of the time.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<pre><code>## from temp, empty directory
mkdir a b
echo hello &gt; a/test.txt
cp a/test.txt b
rg -g a hello ## return nothing
rg -g &#x27;!b&#x27; hello ## returns match from file in &#x27;a&#x27;
</code></pre>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>Above script yields following (showing output of negated search only)</p>
<pre><code>▶ sh /tmp/run.sh                                                                                                                                                                  
a/test.txt
1:hello
</code></pre>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>Should have yielded results for either both or neither (preferably both) the invocations in the reproduction steps.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is correct behavior. The <code>-g/--glob</code> flag applies to <em>every</em> file path searched. So the <code>-g a</code> behavior will cause ripgrep to descend into your <code>a</code> directory but <em>not</em> your <code>b</code> directory. However, <code>a</code> doesn&#x27;t match any file inside your <code>a</code> directory. You can confirm this behavior by adding a <code>a/a</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo hello &gt; a/a
$ rg -g a hello
a/a
1:hello
</code></pre>
<p>If you do want to search everything in <code>a</code>, then you need to use a glob pattern that <em>both</em> matches the directory and the the files inside of it:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -g &#x27;a/**&#x27; hello
a/a
1:hello

a/test.txt
1:hello
</code></pre>
<p>Your negation pattern works as you expect because it avoids descending into the <code>b</code> directory completely.</p>
<p>With all of this said, while the behavior is correct, the docs for the <code>--glob</code> flag could really be improved, so we can use this ticket to track that.</p>
