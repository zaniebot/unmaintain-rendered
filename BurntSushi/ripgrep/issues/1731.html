            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>A feature I personally find incredibly useful in <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a>, is the ability for it to pass the results of the run individually, or in batch, to an external program using parallel command execution, using these switches:</p>
<pre><code>    -x, --exec &lt;cmd&gt;                   Execute a command for each search result
    -X, --exec-batch &lt;cmd&gt;             Execute a command with all search results at once
</code></pre>
<p>More details can be found here about fd's <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#parallel-command-execution">parallel command execution</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst a similar thing can be achieved by doing this already in rg (for example):</p>
<pre><code>vim `rg -l text`
</code></pre>
<p>It's a bit cumbersome and is only working in batch. It would be great if rg had a similar mechanism as in fd, i.e.,</p>
<p><code>rg text -X vim {}</code> (for batch)</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd rather folks relied on their shell to do this. And if you don't want batch mode, you can use <code>xargs -n1</code> to execute a command for each argument.</p>
