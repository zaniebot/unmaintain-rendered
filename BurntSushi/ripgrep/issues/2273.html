            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am using <code>ripgrep</code> through <code>neovim</code> and <code>telescope</code>, both for finding files and for searching in files.</p>
<p>When I search in files I want a non-regex match, hence I use the <code>--fixed-strings</code> flag. Sometimes, I want to perform a regex search and it would be useful to have a shorthand name for the <code>--no-fixed-strings</code> flag. I thinking <code>-NF</code> as in &quot;No -F&quot;?</p>
<p>I think this would be a small win from a UX perspective. Also, a release hasn't been done in a long time, so you can include it in the next one. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are very few short flag names left and this one doesn't cut it IMO. The intended flow is to have fixed strings disabled and enable it when you need it.</p>
<p>Also, your suggestion isn't a short flag. It's two short flags combined that already mean something today.</p>
<p>As for the release schedule, please see: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#release :)</p>
