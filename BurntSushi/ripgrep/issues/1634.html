            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Originally asked as a discussion question here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/1633</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm using the <code>grep</code> crate (AKA: libripgrep) to try and match exact byte portions of a slice. I've found that when my <code>Matcher</code> returns a match with a given range, this information is lost when it's sent over to the <code>Sink</code> as a <code>SinkMatch</code> struct.</p>
<p>I've created a small repository to reproduce the issue. Here's the entire code: https://github.com/acheronfail/grep-sink-example/blob/master/src/main.rs. See the <a href="https://github.com/acheronfail/grep-sink-example"><code>README.md</code></a> for the output of the program.</p>
<h2>What did I expect?</h2>
<p>That the <code>Match</code> object which returned a range of <code>2..8</code> in the haystack would translate to a <code>SinkMatch</code> with a bytes portion that maps roughly to <code>HAYSTACK[2..8]</code>.</p>
<h2>What happens?</h2>
<p>The <code>SinkMatch</code> struct's <code>bytes</code> field includes the entire line matched, and not the matched portion.</p>
<p>Am I using this incorrectly? Should the <code>SinkMatch</code> be giving me the matched bytes, or should I be doing this via the captures trait methods instead?</p>

<hr />
<p>You aren't using it incorrectly and this is indeed expected behavior, although it is perhaps a design flaw. In particular, the <code>grep-searcher</code> and <code>grep-matcher</code> architecture generally assume two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detecting whether a match exists in a particular line is cheaper (possibly substantially so) than finding the exact boundary of that match.</li>
<li>A match is generally infrequent compared to the size of the haystack.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why hamfisted APIs like <a href="https://docs.rs/grep-matcher/0.1.4/grep_matcher/trait.Matcher.html#method.find_candidate_line"><code>Matcher::find_candidate_line</code></a> exist. Indeed, in the most basic grep output format (no color), you never even need the match boundaries in the first place. All you need is the line that matched.</p>
<p>If, however, you're working on a problem in which you always find the precise match offsets up front, then the current architecture drops them on the floor, which would require you to re-run your search for each matching line. If matching lines are rare in your particular situation, then this shouldn't be a problem. If matching lines are frequent, then this could be a significant performance problem.</p>
<p>I do think the API is flexible enough where we could potentially fix this by enriching the <code>SinkMatch</code> structure, but it would require some thinking and some design work.</p>
