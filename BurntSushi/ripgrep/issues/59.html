Before I can evaluate whether ripgrep would be useful to me, I would need to see some <em>significant</em> improvements over <code>grep -r</code> in terms of speed.</p>
<p><code>.gitignore</code> support is not particularly useful to me and grep can search only specific files with the help of globs (<code>grep pattern {,**/}*.py</code>), so speed would be the only real benefit over GNU grep and, personally, I doubt that ripgrep is fast enough to make a difference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah yes, I found the GNU grep benchmarks. Thanks!</p>
<p>Personally, I'd consider adding GNU grep to the list of benchmarks on the README, as it's mentioned frequently throughout other parts of said README.</p>
