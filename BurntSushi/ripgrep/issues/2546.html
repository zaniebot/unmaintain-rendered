<pre><code>ripgrep 13.0.0

+SIMD +AVX (runtime)

<p>running the following inside systemd sandbox, in an empy directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">echo something &gt; test
rg --no-ignore --debug something
</code></pre>
<p>produces the following output, followed by exit with code 1:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG|grep_regex::literal|crates/regex/src/literal.rs:58: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(shared)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }
DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:421: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 12 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes
</code></pre>
<p>When ran on the same machine, but outside the sandbox produces the following, so I'm assuming in the previous case it exited prematurely:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't see a complete set of commands required to reproduce this issue, so I'm not sure what to say there.</p>
<p>Otherwise, at a guess, I'd expect that perhaps the systemd sandbox is messing with ripgrep's tty detection. Since you've called ripgrep with a pattern but didn't tell it what to search, you're asking ripgrep to guess. The two choices are &quot;search the current directory&quot; or &quot;search stdin.&quot; It's possible systemd has configured the environment in a way that ripgrep incorrectly chooses to search stdin, and if stdin is closed/empty, then ripgrep will search it and report no results. And thus exit with <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>I'd suggest you tell ripgrep what to search instead of asking it to guess.</p>

<p>That was it :facepalm:</p>
<p>Thank you for your help (ant the great software) and apologies for taking your time.</p>
