# Clarify --ignore-file option short description

---

_@runapp_

I've trapped into the same confusion with #684 . Glad to see that the document was enriched, but to me "Specify additional ignore files." and even "Process ignore files case insensitively." for `--ignore-file-case-insensitive` are both not so clear.
I wonder if it'd be better to refer to the file as "ignore rule files"?

I'd prefer if these sort of tickets were just submitted as PRs with the desired wording, then we can hash it out from there. Thanks!
