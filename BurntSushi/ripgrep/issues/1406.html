<p>A <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/tips.html">Vagrantfile</a> is just a Ruby script used as a configuration file for Vagrant. It could be simply appended to <code>ruby:</code> after <code>Gemfile, Rakefile</code> (which I believe to be the best way), or the same way as Dockerfile: <code>vagrant: Vagrantfile</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I do not keep open issues tracking file type additions. They are trivial additions, so please just submit a PR.</p>
<p>I'd probably stay conservative and just add a new <code>vagrant</code> type and leave <code>ruby</code> untouched. If you want to add to the Ruby type, then I'd appreciate if you could get some kind of consensus on it from the Ruby community. (It's not clear to me that <code>Vagrantfile</code> should really belong in the Ruby type.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not very sure what to do. If I type <code>-truby</code>, I would personally expect all Ruby types to be searched.</p>
<p>I actually discovered today that uses file extensions rg instead of detecting file types, because some of my files weren't being searched - I understand it helps a lot with performance, so I am adding file extensions wherever I can now.</p>
