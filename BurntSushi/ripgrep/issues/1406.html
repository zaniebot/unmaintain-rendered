<p>A <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/tips.html">Vagrantfile</a> is just a Ruby script used as a configuration file for Vagrant. It could be simply appended to <code>ruby:</code> after <code>Gemfile, Rakefile</code> (which I believe to be the best way), or the same way as Dockerfile: <code>vagrant: Vagrantfile</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I do not keep open issues tracking file type additions. They are trivial additions, so please just submit a PR.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d probably stay conservative and just add a new <code>vagrant</code> type and leave <code>ruby</code> untouched. If you want to add to the Ruby type, then I&#x27;d appreciate if you could get some kind of consensus on it from the Ruby community. (It&#x27;s not clear to me that <code>Vagrantfile</code> should really belong in the Ruby type.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not very sure what to do. If I type <code>-truby</code>, I would personally expect all Ruby types to be searched.</p>
<p>I actually discovered today that uses file extensions rg instead of detecting file types, because some of my files weren&#x27;t being searched - I understand it helps a lot with performance, so I am adding file extensions wherever I can now.</p>
