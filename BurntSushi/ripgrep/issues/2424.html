<p>As developers, we often need to search the git repo we currently use, even if the current dir is somewhere inside that repo. Ripgrep already has a notion of the git repo (using <code>.gitignore</code> files), but it doesn't seem to have an option to search the whole git.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure I follow. Why not <code>cd</code> into the repo root? Or just pass a path to the repo root to ripgrep? I'm not sure I see a reason to bake this into ripgrep itself.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I am currently working with a giant monorepo (we sadly have a few of those).  Most often, I am deep within the monorepo's structure.  The <code>cd ../../../../..</code> is a massive pain to type, esp when uncertain how many of those i would need.  This is so bad that I had to create this alias:</p>
<pre><code>alias gitroot='git rev-parse --show-toplevel'
</code></pre>
<p>which I use with fd:</p>
<pre><code>fd 'something.*\.o$' `gitroot`
</code></pre>
<p>I think it would be useful to have a flag like <code>--root</code> to avoid requiring such workaround.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Understood. But I'm going to disagree that this belongs in ripgrep. I think your solution of <code>rg foo $(gitroot)</code> is quite fine and only barely less convenient than <code>--root</code>. You could make it even more convenient by putting it in an alias, like, <code>rg-root</code> or something.</p>
