            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/c777e2cd5766128e11f7fd5dffd79e1ba8a753fb/.github/workflows/release.yml#L92">macOS binary was built with the latest nightly release</a> at the time of the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/12.1.1">most recent release</a>, which was on May 29, 2020.</p>
<p>The PR you issue was closed in 2018. So yes, ripgrep was compiled with a Rust release that fixed that bug. Whether that bug is still fixed or there is some other issue is something I don&#x27;t know and it&#x27;s not a ripgrep issue.</p>
