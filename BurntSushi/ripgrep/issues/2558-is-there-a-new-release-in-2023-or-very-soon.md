# Is there a new release in 2023 or very soon?

_@Coresi7_

Dear contributors and owners:
I know ripgrep is not a kind of some application which is keen on release new versions, but it's been a while that ripgrep has no new version for almost two years.
Hope it has a new version released which make your recent efforts meaningfull!
Thanks!
