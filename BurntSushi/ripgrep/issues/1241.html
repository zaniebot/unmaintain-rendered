            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>0.10.0</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Via official Debian Buster repository.</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Debian Linux (Buster)</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>The <code>xml</code> type of ripgrep currently only supports files ending in <code>*.xml</code> and <code>*.xml.dist</code> (and I have actually not idea, what a <code>*.xml.dist</code> file should be…
However there are a lot more files that are XML files and should be included in that type.
See for example the supported filetype of <a href="https://beyondgrep.com/">ack-grep</a>:</p>
<pre><code>--[no]xml          .xml .dtd .xsl .xslt .ent; first line matches /&lt;[?]xml/</code></pre>
<p>There are some filetypes missing from ack-grep as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>*.xsd</code> (XML Schema)</li>
<li><code>*.xjb</code> (JAXB Binding)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those should be included as well.</p>
<p>One interesting bit in ack-grep is</p>
<pre><code>first line matches /&lt;[?]xml/</code></pre>
<p>This is actually a good candidate to detect XML files that don&#x27;t match any of the above mentioned filename suffixes and should be supported by ripgrep as well.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please see my comment in your previous issue: <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1240">BurntSushi/ripgrep#1240</a>#issuecomment-481288418</p>
<p>Just open a PR with the requisite changes and we can discuss them there.</p>
<p>ripgrep does not support file type detection by looking at the contents of the file. It&#x27;s a performance trap, so it&#x27;s unlikely that ripgrep will ever support it. But if you feel strongly about it, please open a separate issue with compelling arguments in favor of it.</p>
