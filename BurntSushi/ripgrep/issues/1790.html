            <div class="timeline-body"><h3>Feature request summary</h3>
<p>Stop search on first non-matching line, but only after having seen matching lines.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>On sorted or semi-sorted files, it is often useful to extract consecutive lines that match a given pattern. In some cases involving large files, time and IO can be saved by stopping the search after having matched such a run of consecutive lines.</p>
<p>I'm fairly convinced this feature can save countless CPU cycles and IO in big-ish data situations, particularly where timestamp matching is involved.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>2021-01-29T07:08:09+0100 foo
2021-01-29T08:08:09+0100 bar
2021-01-29T09:08:09+0100 baz
2021-01-29T10:08:09+0100 boz
</code></pre>
<p>Behaviour when searching for pattern <code>^2021-01-29T08</code> with this option enabled:</p>
<ol>
<li>First line does not match; continue to next.</li>
<li>Second line matches; print it and continue to next.</li>
<li>Third line does not match; break and exit; line 4 is never scanned.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pseudo code</h3>
<pre><code>have_seen_matches = null
for each line:
  if line matches:
    print line
    have_seen_matches = true
  else:
    if have_seen_matches == true:
      break
</code></pre>
<h3>Suggested documentation</h3>
<pre><code>--stop-on-nonmatch
    Stop reading a file on the first non-matching line that follows a matching
    line. At least one line must have matched for this to take effect.
</code></pre>

<p>Because the number of matching lines is not known when starting the search. I might be misunderstanding what you actually mean, or my description or use case was unclear.</p>
