            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, thanks again for ripgrep! In delta we're using <a href="https://docs.rs/grep-cli/latest/grep_cli/fn.resolve_binary.html"><code>resolve_binary</code></a>, and I have a question / feature request regarding its API (which I'm opening as a feature request issue). The second sentence of the docstring says <code>&quot;If the program could not be resolved, then an error is returned.&quot;</code>, whereas in fact this is only true on Windows, as the last sentence says. This has caused me and others to make mistakes. My question is</p>
<ul>
<li>Would a name like <code>resolve_windows_binary</code> have been a clearer name, or was there a reason not to do that?</li>
</ul>
<p>And my feature request</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming a breaking renaming change is not reasonable, how about moving the final sentence of the docstring (<code>&quot;On non-Windows, this is a no-op.&quot;</code>) up so that it becomes part of the first sentence of the docstring?</li>
</ul>
