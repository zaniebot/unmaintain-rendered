            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your feature request</h4>
<p>Enact GREP_COLOR variable configuration</p>
<p>Please describe the behavior you want and the motivation. Please also provide
examples of how ripgrep would be used if your feature request were added.</p>
<p>I currently have both these variables set:</p>
<pre><code>GREP_COLOR=mt=42;5;185
GREP_COLORS=mt=42;5;185
</code></pre>
<p>It causes my matched grep text to be blinking white on green.... A deliberately annoying choice made to grab my attention. Not sure which one of the 2 is the one &quot;doing&quot; it; it depends on which year of grep release you use. Both is safest for me. And sometimes it requires --color=always to make it happen.   My grep is basically aliased to --color=always -i</p>
<p>Been enjoying this for years if not decades, but today hit a wall with file encoding that just won't grep a simple word out of a simple log file unless i type it and pipe it to grep, which I don't like.</p>
<p>So I discovered ripgrep.</p>
<p>It cuts through the file encoding and gives me my results just fine, but obviously not in the ridiculous color I want. I love its speed and simplicity, but I also love the colors I have been using for years/decades.</p>
<p>Here's a visual example of what I'm getting at:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae0b184e-c547-42cd-859a-e5c0f2b8803f" alt="image" /></p>
<p>If you're not sure what to write here, then try imagining what the ideal
documentation of your new feature would look like in ripgrep's man page. Then
try to write it.</p>
<p>Probably just a copy of the gnu doc for the --color feature</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No, definitely not. <code>GREP_COLOR</code> and <code>GREP_COLORS</code> is for grep, not for ripgrep. It's IMO not a good idea to be respecting other tool's environment variables.</p>
<p>Moreover, ripgrep very intentionally doesn't expose a way to set arbitrary ANSI escape codes. Instead, you specify the styling you want and ripgrep translates that to ANSI escapes.</p>
<p>I guess I'd be open to adding a &quot;blink&quot; style... Then you could still get the styling you want at least.</p>

<p>That would indeed be nice. All the visual ANSI codes are implemented really well in Windows Terminal.  Italics, underline, double-underline would be great.</p>
<p>but blink would be greatest! :) Thanks!!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Italics and underline are already supported by ripgrep.</p>
<p>I probably won't work on this myself, but PRs are welcome.</p>
