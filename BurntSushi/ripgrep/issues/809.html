<p>When using <code>rg -Tfiletype -tfiletype foo</code>, the exclude takes precedence over the include. Is this intentional behavior?</p>
<p>My use case is a <code>.ripgreprc</code> which excludes minified files by default, which I do occasionally need to search. I can do <code>rg --type-add=minified:*.min.{css,js} -tminified --no-config foo</code> in this case, but this is pretty clunky. I would much rather do <code>rg -tminified foo</code> and have my include clobber my config file&#x27;s default exclude.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Could you expand on that, as it might be in my sphere of influence to change?</p>
<p>The way I understand it, it&#x27;s currently set up so that excludes <em>always</em> override includes, no? The way I imagine in the simple case is just using normal overrides in whichever flag is last &quot;wins&quot; (or overrides the prior). However, I&#x27;m assuming in ripgrep&#x27;s case this is complicated by having multiple includes/excludes?</p>
<p>i.e. what do I mean:</p>
<pre><code>$cat ripgreprc
--type-add &#x27;foo: *.foo&#x27; 
--type-add &#x27;bar: *.bar&#x27;
-Tfoo
-Tbar

$ rg -tfoo
    # should ripgrep search &#x27;bar&#x27; files?
</code></pre>
<p>In ripgrep&#x27;s help message for <code>--type</code> states, <code>&quot;**Only** search files matching TYPE&quot;</code> (emphasis mine).  In which case, traditional overrides work perfectly here. However, the &quot;do what I expect not what I say&quot; in me says, &quot;I want to search everything, including &#x27;foo&#x27; files, but I still want &#x27;bar&#x27; files to be skipped.&quot; (more traditional <code>--include</code>/<code>--exclude</code>).</p>
<p>Edit: So keeping the current functionality as is (perhaps just adding overrides?) seems fine, with the ability to also add more traditional include/excludes. As there may be times I <em>do</em> want to be able to say, &quot;ripgrep, ONLY search this one file type&quot; which wouldn&#x27;t be possible with traditional includes/excludes. So I see them (current type system with traditional include/exclude) as not mutually exclusive ideas.</p>
<p>From a implementation standpoint traditional include/excludes are much harder to implement than just, &quot;<code>--type</code> and <code>--type-not</code> override each other&quot; as it would have to resolve <em>only matching types</em> in an overriding fashion.</p>
<p>If what I&#x27;ve said is true so far, there are a few ways I could actually tackle this on my end. The easiest would be to provide something like <code>Arg::overrides_eq_vals_with</code> which only overrides specific values with another arg provided both values match. Because clap already has all this information about what comes in what orders, it&#x27;d be quite simple to add.</p>
<p>i.e. assume we had an argv (after config parse) that was roughly <code>$ rg --exclude=*.foo --exclude=*.bar --include=*.foo &#x27;test&#x27;</code> After <code>overrides_eq_vals_with</code> it would become <code>$ rg --exclude=*.bar --include=*.foo &#x27;test&#x27;</code>.</p>
<p>The other way would involve something I&#x27;ve been thinking about, which is to provide companions to the validators, namely the ability to provide functions to <code>Filter/Skip</code>, <code>Map</code>, and <code>Action</code> arguments mid parse. These would do things such as do something potentially impure (<code>Action</code>), allow one to filter/skip values (<code>Filter/Skip</code> haven&#x27;t decide on naming yet), or transform actual values themselves (<code>Map</code>) to be saved in the matches struct. These would all have access to the matches struct as it exists at that time, in order to perform decisions or possibly even mutate. I should say though that this method is further off and would not be available until v3 at the earliest (if ever, pending design and implementation, etc.).</p>

<p>Apologies for the length! As I began typing it was mainly me talking myself through the problem at hand 😜</p>
<p>Edit: Added some words about current <code>--type</code> vs <code>--include</code>/<code>--exclude</code></p>

<p>Exactly. Basically, you want <code>--exclude A --include B --exclude C</code> to retain its ordering in the same way that <code>-g &#x27;!A&#x27; -g B -g &#x27;!C&#x27;</code> does. This is in fact partially why the <code>-g/--glob</code> flag provides the facilities to both whitelist and blacklist (via a <code>!</code> prefix on the glob) in the same flag, because then I can easily retain the order of the flag values given.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think whatever the docs say today was my attempt at documenting ripgrep&#x27;s behavior, and not necessarily the ideal behavior. I&#x27;m pretty sure I was aware of this issue when I added the <code>-t/--type</code> and <code>-T/--type-not</code> flags, and it in particular manifests itself here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/361698b90a6b31feac78ac2f16082342f750a1e1/src/args.rs#L873-L878</p>
<p>You can see for example that we add all positive selections followed by all negative selections. This means negative selections will always override positive selections, regardless of where they come. This is likely the source of this specific bug reported. We could swap the positive/negative and that would fix this particular bug, but it would just create another one (negative overrides that came after positive overrides would not override the positives).</p>
<p>The docs on the <code>-t/--type</code> and <code>-T/--type-not</code> flags are quite ambiguous and don&#x27;t mention any precedence rules between them. I wonder if I did that on purpose. ~_~</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That is interesting. I might argue that this would be better solve by dropping your default ignore rules into a <code>.ignore</code> file, and reserving the CLI for overrides.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure I quite grok this, but from ripgrep&#x27;s perspective, basically what I&#x27;d need is the ability to couple two or more flags together, and then have a way to ask clap for the list of values given to any of those flags in the order they were received. Each value I get would then need to be tagged with its corresponding flag (whether that&#x27;s an associative list or corresponding lists or whatever doesn&#x27;t really matter). That would be enough information on my end to load them into globsets, which will handle the actual precedence rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i.e. assume we had an argv (after config parse) that was roughly $ rg --exclude=<em>.foo --exclude=</em>.bar --include=<em>.foo &#x27;test&#x27; After overrides_eq_vals_with it would become $ rg --exclude=</em>.bar --include=*.foo &#x27;test&#x27;.</p>

<p>What do you think of my idea above in lieu of this? Is it simpler to implement? It definitely implies new API items to <code>ArgMatches</code> though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@pikeas As a note, you can work around this by not putting <code>--type</code> or <code>--type-not</code> flags in your config file. Instead, put them in a <code>.ignore</code> file and load it with the <code>--ignore-file</code> flag (or drop it in your <code>$HOME</code> directory).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also, @kbknapp, I admire your zeal. :) ripgrep has had this bug since day 1 (even in the docopt days), so there is no real urgency to get this fixed, and there are usually pretty easy workarounds on the user&#x27;s end although it is somewhat exacerbated by the config file feature.</p>
<p>With enough effort, I could probably fix this on ripgrep&#x27;s end with some light parsing of the argv itself. I would only need to look at flags I think. For example, given:</p>
<pre><code>--include A --exclude B --exclude C --include D
</code></pre>
<p>I could pretty easily get a list of <code>[--include, --exclude, --exclude, --include]</code> from argv itself. If I combine that with the lists that clap will give me, <code>[A, D]</code> and <code>[B, C]</code>, then it seems like it should be straight-forward to produce the desired list which is <code>[A, B, C, D]</code>. Does that make sense?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually wrote up two versions of my comment above, and deleted the original because I thought the suggestion was too much work on your end (which I&#x27;m still slightly inclined to believe), but it entailed being able to query new information from clap about the position an argument came in.</p>
<p>At first glance it appeared to me like it&#x27;d be a quick win and easy to implement this feature (include/exclude) with this new information. And since clap already knows all this info, its super simple for me to add on that side of things. It&#x27;s also quite general purpose because it doesn&#x27;t assume a particular use case (like <code>Arg::overrides_eq_vals_with</code> would), so I like that aspect of it. But the more I dug into it, the problem is it still requires a lot of &quot;jumping through hoops&quot; to solve the problem (on the end application side).</p>
<p>An example would look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume after config files we have an argv something like: <code>rg --include A --exclude B --exclude C --include B</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Which clap reports as <code>include=[&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;], exclude=[&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;]</code>. However, from only clap&#x27;s reporting it could still actually be any of these permutations (I&#x27;m using <code>i</code> for include and <code>e</code> for exclude for brevity) that was really used:</p>
<p>| argv | Actually Searched |
| --- | --- |
| <code>iA iB eB eC</code> | A |
| <code>eB eC iA iB</code> | A, B |
| <code>iA eB eC iB</code> | A, B |
| <code>iA eB iB eC</code> | A, B |
| <code>eB iA iB eC</code> | A, B |
| <code>eB iA eC iB</code> | A, B |</p>
<p>With just two overlapping values this is simple, but even so based off just what clap reports we can&#x27;t actually know what the user wanted because there&#x27;s two truths.</p>
<p>So back to including position information which would look something like this (using that original argv as an example).</p>
<pre><code>matches.positions_of(&quot;include&quot;); // [1, 4]
matches.positions_of(&quot;exclude&quot;); // [2, 3]

matches.position_of(&quot;include&quot;); // [1]
matches.position_of(&quot;exclude&quot;); // [2]

matches.values_of(&quot;include&quot;).unwrap().with_positions(); // An iterator that provides [(1, A), (4, B)]
matches.values_of(&quot;exclude&quot;).unwrap().with_positions(); // An iterator that provides [(2, B), (3, C)]
</code></pre>
<p>That could be used to get a final list for your globset via</p>
<pre><code>// Collect up chained values
let mut combined = matches.values_of(&quot;include&quot;).unwrap()
    .with_positions()
    .chain(matches.values_of(&quot;exclude&quot;).unwrap()
        .with_positions()
   .collect();

// Sorting by position
combined.sort_by_key(|tup| tup.0);

// Remove &quot;overrides&quot;
let mut overrides = vec![];
for (i, a) in combined.iter().enumerate() {
    if combined[i+1..].iter().any(|tup| tup.1 == a.1) {
        overrides.push(i);
    }
}
for &amp;i in overrides.iter().rev() {
    combined.swap_remove(i);
}

// swap back out into separate fields
let mut includes = Vec::new();
let mut excludes = Vec::new();

let inc_p: Vec&lt;_&gt; = matches.positions_of(&quot;include&quot;).unwrap().collect();
for (p, val) in combined.into_iter() {
    if inc_p.contains(p) {
        includes.push(val);
    } else {
        excludes.push(val);
    }
}

// From our original argv, we now have
// include = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;]
// exclude = [&quot;C&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s far more clean ways to do this (and more efficient), but this was just off the top of my head.</p>
