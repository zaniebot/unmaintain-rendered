            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep 12.0.0 (rev b9cd95faf1)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<p>Binary release
Windows 10</p>
<p>Even when simply searching a string which is only in the same line as an umlaut,
rg does not match the result. For example: Text line is &quot;Lünen&quot; - I&#x27;m searching for &quot;nen&quot;. Result comes back empty though.</p>
<p>Actually ripgrep would have to be at least able to cope with lines that contains special characters like umlauts, if not being able to search for them.</p>
