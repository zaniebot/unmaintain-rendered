<pre><code>ripgrep 12.1.1
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Homebrew.</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<pre><code>Darwin nicolaw-aframe 19.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.6.0: Mon Aug 31 22:12:52 PDT 2020; root:xnu-6153.141.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
</code></pre>
Describe your bug.
<p>Blank lines are still printed between matching when using <code>-NI</code> flags to surppress the printing of the filename and line numbers. If filenames and numbers are being suppressed, then the blank line to separate each file has no meaning or context so I would not expect them to be printed.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Assuming that there are multiple files in your <code>/etc/</code> filesystem that contain the word <code>host</code>, then I would not expect any blank lines to be emitted from the following command; I would only expect to see lines that contain the word <code>host</code> emitted:</p>
<pre><code>rg -NI host /etc
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>Blank lines are printed to delineate the results from one matching file to the next.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>No blank lines should be emitted.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So I actually wrote out a bug fix for this, but now I&#x27;m second guessing whether this is really a bug or not. It just seems weird to me to disable headings in this particular case, but leave them present when <code>--no-filename</code> is given but line numbers are displayed. I guess in my view, having that gap between different files matching might actually be desirable? Or at least, if this bug were fixed, having that gap would be impossible. But today, you can remove the heading with the <code>--no-heading</code> flag (or by redirecting ripgrep&#x27;s output away from a tty).</p>
<p>I&#x27;m inclined to leave ripgrep&#x27;s behavior as is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s a very fair point. Perhaps this is a command line help/documentation fix then.</p>
<p>As it turns out my use-case does involve pumping this into a pipe, but I immediately pushed it into another <code>grep</code> and <code>sort -u</code> to &quot;fixup&quot; the output that I first saw come out of <code>rg</code>. I didn&#x27;t realise change in formatting in such a situation.</p>
<p>I suspect that many people will have <code>rg</code> recommended to them by a friend or colleague like myself when performing ad-hoc command line data-mining for various purposes, and thus will start out crafting an initial <code>rg</code> command line like I did for its speed, and then iterate to pump it into some loop and might make the same presumptions that I did.</p>
<p>Apologies if this wasted your time.</p>
<p>Thank you for the solution!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see, yes. People are sometimes caught off guard by the change in formatting depending on whether ripgrep is printing to a tty or not. But even core commands do this occasionally. Compare the output of <code>ls</code> and <code>ls | cat</code> for example. It&#x27;s subtle!</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll switch this over to a documentation bug, although it&#x27;s a little tricky. Maybe the tty style behavior can be mentioned more prominently in the docs. But I think we&#x27;re getting close to a point where there are a few things being mentioned prominently, which of course weakens the notion of &quot;prominent.&quot; :-/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wow, finding that issue wasn&#x27;t easy, but that&#x27;s exactly the problem I encountered.</p>
<p>My situation: I extract 1 field from multiple json-like files. I only need the value, so I use replace like this:</p>
<pre><code>rg --no-filename --no-line-number --color=never --max-count=1 &#x27;&quot;name&quot;\s+&quot;(.*)&quot;&#x27; &quot;*.acf&quot; --replace &#x27;$1&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>And then I get values separated with empty lines that I don&#x27;t need.</p>
<p>It wasn&#x27;t trivial to find what caused it. I tried <code>--no-context-separator</code>, <code>--null</code>, <code>--null-data</code> flags, searched through discussions and issues here until I found this one.</p>
<p>So the solution is to use <code>--no-heading</code> flag and it appears that empty line was an empty heading. Not complaining, but that wasn&#x27;t so obvious to figure it all out :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@murlakatamenka Can you suggest a way to make it easier to figure out? Other than changing ripgrep&#x27;s behavior (which as explained above is perhaps not such a good idea), what would have reduced the amount of time you spent tracking down the problem?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, yes, I should&#x27;ve been more constructive, sorry for that.</p>
<p>The problem is that I failed to find out how to change it, so it&#x27;s discoverability thing. You see above I tried not-so-relevant flags. I did check tab-completion to <code>rg --no-&lt;TAB&gt;</code>. I also checked man page / issues for following keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>separator</li>
<li>delimiter</li>
<li>blank / empty line</li>
<li>multiline</li>
<li>multiple (meaning multiple files)</li>
</ul>
<p>all until I found this issue and that <code>a-ha!</code> moment: blank line belongs to the heading, <code>--no-heading</code> flag is what was looked for.</p>
<p>I think possible solution would be add more info to help / man page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--heading
This flag prints the file path above clusters of matches from each file instead of printing the file path
as a prefix for each matched line. This is the default mode when printing to a terminal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like here we don&#x27;t have any mention that the heading includes that blank line - separator of clusters of matches.</p>
<hr>
<p>I would say steps to reproduce the issue are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#x27;d like to extract some data from files</li>
<li><code>rg &lt;pattern&gt;</code>, check results in the output</li>
<li>no need for line numbers -&gt; <code>--no-line-numbers</code>, cool</li>
<li>don&#x27;t need filenames -&gt; <code>--no-filename</code>, obviously</li>
<li>no blank lines, please -&gt; <code>???</code>, user is stuck</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>I mostly agree with what @sheisnicola wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If filenames and numbers are being suppressed, then the blank line to separate each file has no meaning or context so I would not expect them to be printed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our use cases <code>-NI</code> meant &quot;hey, <code>rg</code>, I don&#x27;t care about <em>source / location</em> of the data, fetch me just it&quot; and those blank lines weren&#x27;t desirable. Guess there can be situations where you don&#x27;t need this metadata but still want the clustering of matches.</p>
<hr>
<p>So for now <code>--heading</code> help / man page can be improved. Maybe some notice of how you control output when searching through multiple files? Otherwise Interactive TAB-completion is usually enough for me to discover ripgerp&#x27;s options and flags.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since this issue is still open, I thought I&#x27;d add my 2 cents. 🙂</p>
<p>I was also surprised by the default behavior when I asked ripgrep to &quot;just show me the raw matches&quot; by adding <code>-oNI</code>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Actually, I was also surprised that line numbers were displayed by default when file names weren&#x27;t. Line numbers don&#x27;t seem to be very useful out of context (without a file name).</p>
<p>I guess what I really expected is for <code>-I</code> to be the equivalent of <code>--no-filename --no-line-number --no-heading</code>, but I suppose this would be too big of a change now. Anyway, having one convenient option for this would have been nice.</p>

<p>This isn&#x27;t true. If file names aren&#x27;t shown, then it&#x27;s because the file name is unambiguous. That is, only one file was searched. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg WARRANTY UNLICENSE LICENSE-MIT

</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, too big of a change and not one that makes sense to me personally. I&#x27;m not even sure what such an option would be called. I&#x27;d suggest creating an alias or a wrapper script for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or at least, if this bug were fixed, having that gap would be impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#x27;t the <code>--heading</code> option enable this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No? The issue here is precisely that the gap exists when <code>--heading</code> is set. And <code>--heading</code> is set by default when printing to a tty.</p>
<p>In fact, when doing a recursive search, both <code>--heading</code> and <code>--line-number</code> are <em>only</em> set when printing to a tty. That&#x27;s because ripgrep is assuming that when printing to a tty, you want to see &quot;human friendly&quot; output. But you can squash that pretty easily by piping the output of ripgrep into <code>cat</code>. For example, the following two commands are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -IN --no-filename --color never host /etc
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -I host /etc | cat
</code></pre>
<p>Because when you aren&#x27;t printing to a tty, ripgrep simply doesn&#x27;t enable <code>--heading</code>, <code>--line-number</code> or <code>--color auto</code>. This matches grep&#x27;s behavior when not printing to a tty. The only difference between ripgrep and grep here is that grep doesn&#x27;t take as many liberties with the output when printing to a tty.</p>
<p>Given that I still feel the same way that I did back when I first looked at this issue, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to take any action here. So I&#x27;m going to close this.</p>
