            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>There are some applications that I managed which use gzip to roll up log files but
when the zip file was created, it&#x27;s not named with an extension.</p>
<p>Instead, the name could be something like <code>./@1234567890</code> and therefore, cannot be searched with ripgrep <code>-z, --search-zip</code>.
Using zgrep works fine on these files.</p>
<p>Rename files like this is particularly tricky because (a) it&#x27;s being managed by a running application and (b) the application could be 3rd party vendor software that we have little control over.</p>
<p>I suggest we enable the search zip feature by allowing <code>--search-zip COMPRESSION_ALG</code> where COMPRESSION_ALG could be any among the current algorithm that ripgrep supports: <code>gzip</code>, <code>gzip2</code> etc...</p>
<p>This will help us avoid having to rename an application managed file while still being able to search through the zip file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn&#x27;t know about --pre flag but it does seem like a very elaborate solution. The nature of SRE ops works often involve adhoc troubleshooting so I would appreciate if you would consider my suggestion to make it a friendlier/easier UX?</p>
<p>i.e. if I have to use <code>rg --pre</code>, i would just use <code>zgrep</code> instead for ergonomic at the price of a slower search speed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--pre</code> doesn&#x27;t seem particularly elaborate to me, but this is why it exists: to customize how ripgrep reads files. The <code>-z</code> flag is a shortcut for a common such use case. I think yours is niche and would be better solved by pre.</p>
