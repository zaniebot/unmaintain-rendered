            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/d6b59feff890f038acde7d5e151995d8aec1e107/README.md?plain=1#L34-L36"><code>README.md</code></a> features a screenshot:</p>

<p>However, the URL in question (https://burntsushi.net/stuff/ripgrep1.png) returns 404 not found, leading to a broken image.</p>
<p>If you still have this image, it would be helpful to include it in the repo itself as documentation and reference it using a local URL, or perhaps restore or recreate it so that it can be included in the docs.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I think I flubbed this when I moved my web site to a new server. But I took backups and I've restored this image.</p>
<p>I agree that it would be nicer to include the image in the repository, but I think the immediate problem is fixed.</p>
