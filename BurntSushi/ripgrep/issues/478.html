<pre><code>$ rg -e foo -f src/search_stream.rs 
Error parsing regex near 'fer.|*/|z{' at character offset 213: Invalid application of repetition operator to: '(?u:f)(?u:o)(?u:o)|(?u:/)*(?u:!)|(?u:T)(?u:h)(?u:e)

<p>Aside from the badly formatted regex error message (see #395), the error message should show the file path and probably also the line number at which the error occurred.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/590">PR</a> to address this issue. It also tries to avoid the problem with the AST dump (issue https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/395).</p>
<p>I have one question. Were you thinking about reporting the file path and line number where the error occurred in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex">regex</a>?</p>

<p>Probably not. I could maybe see a case for pushing the line number reporting into the regex crate, but certainly not the file path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@petr-tik Thanks for the kind words, but this is definitely not fixed yet. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /tmp/patterns
foo
bar(wat
quux

$ rg -f /tmp/patterns
regex parse error:
    foo|bar(wat|quux
           ^
error: unclosed group
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few problems here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The file path of the pattern file isn't shown in the error message. This is important if you use <code>-f</code> multiple times.</li>
<li>There is no line number corresponding to the pattern that failed to parse.</li>
<li>The error shows <em>all</em> of the patterns in the file given joined with a <code>|</code> instead of just the pattern that is invalid.</li>
</ol>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @BurntSushi , just checking whether this issue is still open.
If it hasn’t been addressed yet, I’d be happy to take a look and work on it.</p>
