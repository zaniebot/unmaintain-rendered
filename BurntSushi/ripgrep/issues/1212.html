            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<pre><code>ripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</code></pre>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>From the deb file from GitHub.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Debian 9.8, kernel 4.9</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>First of all I'm not sure it's a bug directly with ripgrep.</p>
<p>I have a file of size <code>34359738196</code> (32GB ~).</p>
<p>I'm seeing a difference when calling ripgrep via a pipe, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /data/vincent/x32 | rg -N --no-filename --stats foobar
DEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:58: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(foobar)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes

0 matches
0 matched lines
0 files contained matches
1 files searched
0 bytes printed
4403625046 bytes searched
3.140673 seconds spent searching
3.143315 seconds</code></pre>
<p>and calling ripgrep directly with the file, like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -N --no-filename --stats foobar /data/vincent/x32
DEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:58: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(foobar)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes

0 matches
0 matched lines
0 files contained matches
1 files searched
0 bytes printed
34359738196 bytes searched
12.918476 seconds spent searching
13.652422 seconds</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately I can't upload the file, it's full of sensitive information. I could generate an equivalent file of the same size and test that.</p>
<p>I also tested on another server with Debian 9.6, kernel 4.9 and I get the exact same bytes searched result.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>I would expect piping to ripgrep to produce equivalent results.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's almost certainly because the file contains a <code>NUL</code> byte, and therefore, binary detection kicks in. Unfortunately, binary detection depends on the method of searching. In your first example, ripgrep is forced to use a roll buffer. In the latter example, ripgrep is probably memory mapping it. To confirm, use the <code>-a/--text</code> flag to force searching (just like you would with <code>grep</code>).</p>
<p>There are a couple other tickets open for improving this state of affairs with respect to binary data.</p>
<p>If this doesn't fix your problem, then please show the output with the <code>--trace</code> flag for each. It would also help if there was a way to minimize the input. But try the <code>-a</code> flag first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks, that was it.</p>
<p>I actually thought about that and used <code>hexdump -s 4403625046 -n 100</code> to take a look at the data but didn't see a NUL byte anywhere so I assumed that wasn't it, but the byte is probably somewhere before or after then.</p>
