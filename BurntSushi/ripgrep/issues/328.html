[18:08] &lt;WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows&gt; Ralith: Well there are functions to hint to the OS you&#x27;ll be using memory soon so it&#x27;ll prefetch it
[18:09] &lt;burntsushi&gt; WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows: i don&#x27;t do anything special with mmaps. i just open them and search.
[18:09] &lt;WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows&gt; burntsushi: You search sequentially though?
[18:09] &lt;burntsushi&gt; yes
[18:10] &lt;WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows&gt; burntsushi: Then you *really* want to pass FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN when opening the file
[18:10] &lt;WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows&gt; Both with and without mmaps
[18:10] &lt;burntsushi&gt; WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows: is that supported by the memmap crate?
[18:10] &lt;WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows&gt; burntsushi: Does memmap support opening from an fs::File?
[18:10] &lt;burntsushi&gt; i believe so
[18:11] &lt;WindowsBunnyDancingOnRainbows&gt; burntsushi: Then you can use the OpenOptionsExt on Windows to open an fs::File with that flag, then use it or pass it to memmap

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CannedYerins I think the only thing in <code>benchsuite</code> that is Linux only is building the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>If <code>benchsuite</code> is too inconvenient to run on Windows, then I think we&#x27;ll need to come up with our own benchmark for this. It should include short and long files, as well as a small number of files and a large number of files.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you run the benchmark over and over that flag won&#x27;t have much difference because the file is already cached in memory. It is when you&#x27;re reading a large file from disk and it hasn&#x27;t been cached in memory yet, that is when there is a noticeable improvement. Instead of getting a big beefy machine with 30GB of ram, try using something with much less RAM and benchmark it on files that are <em>bigger</em> than your RAM (that way it can&#x27;t cache the whole file in memory).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CannedYerins Thanks for doing this! It looks like there is virtually no difference to me. You ran the benchmarks with only a single iteration, so it&#x27;s impossible to see the variance to make a final determination. The other problem is that 4GB of RAM is enough to fit all of the benchmark corpora in memory. :-(</p>
<p>The other issue here is that you&#x27;re only passing the seq scan flag when opening a file for buffered reading, but ripgrep is probably using memory maps in all of the subtitle benchmarks, which I think means you aren&#x27;t actually measuring what you want to measure. :-( See the mmap logic here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/src/args.rs#L564</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m going to close this because I don&#x27;t see much value in tracking it. Given my ignorance of Windows, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if someone could make ripgrep go faster via some Windows-specific tweaks. But I don&#x27;t have the bandwidth to do it.</p>
