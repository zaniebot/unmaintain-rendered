<p>It looks like <code>rg</code> is slower when given a (long) list of files on the command line, than it is when it has to find those files itself. <code>grep</code> doesn&#x27;t have this problem, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s some confounder like my shell taking a long time to expand the glob.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, this is probably a dupe of #44. Your example is actually more embarrassing, because the positional arguments are <em>files</em>, not directories, which makes the reprocessing of parent ignore files even more strange.</p>
<p>I have some grander plans in mind on refactoring the ignore code, so fixing this will probably get lumped in with that. For now, I think we can just track #44.</p>
<p>Thanks for the report!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sadly (and embarrassingly), the blame for this can be placed squarely on my implementation of <code>docopt</code>. Virtually all of the time is spent in matching the argv string against the docopt matcher. My guess is that I could re-implement this to go faster, but I don&#x27;t have the energy for a rewrite of docopt.</p>
<p>I think this means I should admit defeat switch to clap. :-) cc @kbknapp</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi if &quot;admitting defeat&quot; means having spent all your time writing some of the best parsers and libraries known to Rust (perhaps any language), and helping ensure the Rust ecosystem/users maintains or even exceeds current levels of quality and professionalism....well then I <em>aspire</em> to one day &quot;admit defeat&quot; as well :wink:</p>
<p>As for this issue, I&#x27;d like to do a build using clap just to compare the results. I&#x27;ll post the results in the next day or so once I have time to make the build and do the tests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@kbknapp Haha aww shucks. FWIW, clap is unbelievably well maintained. I hadn&#x27;t looked at it for a while, but when I checked it the other day I was completely blown away.</p>
<p>To give you more context: you probably won&#x27;t notice much of a difference in standard usage. The problem appears specifically when there&#x27;s a long list of positional file arguments. Docopt struggles with this because it uses a weird backtracking algorithm to match <code>argv</code> against its matcher. When <code>argv</code> is large, there&#x27;s a <em>significant</em> slow down. I doubt clap will even notice it at all.</p>
<p>Converting <code>ripgrep</code> over to clap seems like a largeish undertaking, so please don&#x27;t kill yourself over it! (In the sense that there&#x27;s a lot of options, not in the sense that Docopt weirdness is spread throughout ripgrep.) I do kind of want to do it myself as a forcing function to get more familiar with clap, but I won&#x27;t stop you. :-) I will note that this is kind of high on my priority list because it&#x27;s really easy to provoke this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Woah. Maybe there&#x27;s some hack we could stick on the front of the whole thing (either docopt, or ripgrep) to handle the specific case of a ton of positional args, that wouldn&#x27;t need a complete rewrite? I&#x27;ve never looked at docopt internals though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s probably something. I&#x27;m just not feeling up to digging around in Docopt internals. Everything about it is too complex. (Which is my failing.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you&#x27;d like to do the converting that&#x27;s cool with me, I&#x27;ll just standby for any questions/suggestions!</p>
<p>Instead of doing a full re-write I just a simple test (called <code>lof</code> for lots-o-files) to see if it would in fact make a difference:</p>
<pre><code>$ find ~/.config -print | wc -l
4291

$ time lof-docopt ~/.config/**/*
0.52s user 0.11s system 99% cpu 0.629 total

$ time lof-clap ~/.config/**/*
0.05s user 0.02s system 97% cpu 0.075 total
</code></pre>
<p>I know it&#x27;s not super scientific or perfect, but gives a rough estimate. Here&#x27;s what I used:</p>
<p>Docopt:</p>
<pre><code>const USAGE: &amp;&#x27;static str = &quot;
Lots of Files

Usage:
  lof &lt;files&gt;...

&quot;;

#[derive(RustcDecodable)]
struct Args {
    arg_files: Vec&lt;String&gt;,
}

fn main() {
    let args: Args = Docopt::new(USAGE)
        .and_then(|d| d.decode())
        .unwrap_or_else(|e| e.exit());
}
</code></pre>
<p>And clap:</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
    let m = App::new(&quot;lof&quot;)
        .arg(Arg::with_name(&quot;files&quot;)
            .multiple(true))
        .get_matches();
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also did version where I looped through and printed out the values both as <code>Strings</code> and <code>OsStrings</code>, but the results were basically no different.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, so I finally have ripgrep wired up to clap and I can confirm this issue in particular gets fixed. My test case with GNU grep:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah linux] time sh ../cmd.grep
./include/linux/ide.h:  REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME, /* resume request */
./include/linux/ide.h:   (rq)-&gt;cmd_type == REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME)
./include/linux/ide.h: * State information carried for REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_SUSPEND and REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME

real    0m0.182s
user    0m0.120s
sys     0m0.043s
</code></pre>
<p>With current ripgrep master:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah linux] time sh ../cmd.rg 
include/linux/ide.h
        REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME, /* resume request */
         (rq)-&gt;cmd_type == REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME)
 * State information carried for REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_SUSPEND and REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME

real    0m1.025s
user    0m0.783s
sys     0m0.240s
</code></pre>
<p>and finally with ripgrep wired up to clap:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah linux] time sh ../cmd.rg 
include/linux/ide.h
        REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME, /* resume request */
         (rq)-&gt;cmd_type == REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME)
 * State information carried for REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_SUSPEND and REQ_TYPE_ATA_PM_RESUME

real    0m0.106s
user    0m0.067s
sys     0m0.037s
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is run single-threaded on 3,458 files explicitly given on the command line. This test case was derived from the following <code>xargs</code> command in the <code>linux</code> repo (notice how gosh dang slow ripgrep <em>was</em>):</p>
<pre><code>$ time find ./ -type f | xargs grep PM_RESUME | wc -l
16

real    0m1.170s
user    0m0.833s
sys     0m0.483s
$ time find ./ -type f | xargs rg-master -j1 PM_RESUME | wc -l
16

real    0m17.562s
user    0m13.960s
sys     0m3.753s
$ time find ./ -type f | xargs rg -j1 PM_RESUME | wc -l
16

real    0m1.136s
user    0m0.630s
sys     0m0.670s
</code></pre>
<p>Yay clap!</p>
