            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I noticed that <code>rg</code> ignores symlinks by default, even when I invoke it solely to search a single symlinked file. For me, that's very surprising behavior. The <code>-debug</code> flag also said nothing about why it was skipping my file.</p>
<p>So I'm suggestion to either change that behavior (unless maybe it's made this way for a good reason?), or inform the user that his symlinks are being ignored.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed, <code>rg</code> should search a symlinked file if it's explicitly specified. This is good enough reason for me:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah tmp] echo test &gt; foo
[andrew@Cheetah tmp] rg test foo
1:test
[andrew@Cheetah tmp] ln -s foo bar
[andrew@Cheetah tmp] rg test bar
No files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect. Try running again with --debug.
[andrew@Cheetah tmp] grep test bar
test
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, you can use the <code>-L</code> flag with <code>rg</code> to follow symlinks.</p>
