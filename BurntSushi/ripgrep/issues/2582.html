            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>Describe your feature request</h4>
<p>I would like an option to tell ripgrep, that despite being connected to a pipe, it should not search standard input, so that it will do a normal recursive search.</p>
<p>Don't know about the name.  <code>--no-pipe</code>, perhaps?</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>ripgrep does not work from within Emacs when used as the grep-command on Windows.  It exits immediately with error code 1, or hangs.
I suspect this is related to issue #951, something to do with stdin being a &quot;fifo&quot;?  I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, from what I can see Emacs is just running a bog standard inferior process - and indeed trying to run ripgrep as a Python subprocess exhibits the same problem, this hangs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import subprocess
subprocess.check_output(['rg','SomeSearchTerm'])
</code></pre>
<p>But never mind the reason, I would just like an option to fix it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good point.  <code>rg foo .</code> does work.  I just never used the second argument, so I didn't think of it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The key insight is that by omitting the path argument you are basically saying, &quot;ripgrep, please guess whether to search the current working directory or stdin.&quot; Due to idiosyncracies in how processes are created in various contexts, it is impossible for ripgrep to guess correctly 100% of the time.</p>
