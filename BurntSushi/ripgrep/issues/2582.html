            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>I would like an option to tell ripgrep, that despite being connected to a pipe, it should not search standard input, so that it will do a normal recursive search.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t know about the name.  <code>--no-pipe</code>, perhaps?</p>
Motivation
<p>ripgrep does not work from within Emacs when used as the grep-command on Windows.  It exits immediately with error code 1, or hangs.
I suspect this is related to issue #951, something to do with stdin being a &quot;fifo&quot;?  I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s supposed to mean, from what I can see Emacs is just running a bog standard inferior process - and indeed trying to run ripgrep as a Python subprocess exhibits the same problem, this hangs:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.check_output([&#x27;rg&#x27;,&#x27;SomeSearchTerm&#x27;])
</code></pre>
<p>But never mind the reason, I would just like an option to fix it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Good point.  <code>rg foo .</code> does work.  I just never used the second argument, so I didn&#x27;t think of it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The key insight is that by omitting the path argument you are basically saying, &quot;ripgrep, please guess whether to search the current working directory or stdin.&quot; Due to idiosyncracies in how processes are created in various contexts, it is impossible for ripgrep to guess correctly 100% of the time.</p>
