            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<pre><code>ripgrep 12.1.1 (rev 7cb211378a)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Issue repros with both <code>scoop install ripgrep</code> and <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> versions</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Windows 10 Version 20H2 (OS Build 19042.867)</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>On Windows, ripgrep (via <code>ignore</code>) considers files which have the &quot;hidden&quot; attribute OR whose basename starts with a <code>.</code> to be &quot;hidden&quot; for the purposes of the <code>--hidden</code> flag</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/64ac2ebe0f2fe1c8967e7ec550bc32466bf40a07/crates/ignore/src/pathutil.rs#L22-L46</p>
<p>I can understand why ripgrep might want to ignore <code>.dotfiles</code> on Windows for consistency (and that changing it now would be breaking), but as a Windows user, I was surprised by this behavior because it uses a meaning of the term &quot;hidden&quot; which is different from the OS's without documenting that it's going to do so. It would be nice if <code>rg --help</code>'s <code>--hidden</code> section could clarify what ripgrep considers to be a &quot;hidden&quot; file, similar to the comment in <code>pathutil.rs</code>.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<pre><code>&gt; rg --help | rg -A 7 -e --hidden
</code></pre>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<pre><code>        --hidden
            Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories
            are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an
            ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn't provided.

            This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.

        --iglob &lt;GLOB&gt;...
</code></pre>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Something along the lines of</p>
<pre><code>        --hidden
            Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories
            are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an
            ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn't provided.

            A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot
            character ('.'). On operating systems which support a `hidden` file attribute,
            like Windows, files with this attribute are also considered hidden.

            This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.
</code></pre>
<p>My initial attempts at searching through the ripgrep documentation to understand why it was skipping <code>.directories</code> by default involved <code>rg --help | rg -e dot</code>, which pointed me to the <code>--no-ignore-dot</code> flag (which sounds promising but isn't actually relevant to ignoring dotfiles generally). If that feels like a mistake that other users might reasonably be expected to make, it might be worth additionally updating the <code>--no-ignore-dot</code> help section with a pointer along the lines of <code>This does **not** affect whether ripgrep will ignore files and directories whose name begins with a dot. For that, see --hidden and --no-hidden.</code></p>
<p>I also noticed that the <code>--no-hidden</code> flag the <code>--hidden</code> section mentions doesn't have a top-level help entry; not sure if that's intentional.</p>

<p>I agree it should be better documented. The reason why ripgrep does this wasn't an accident though. The prefix-dot convention is also used on Windows. It just isn't recognized (AFAIK) by Windows itself.</p>
<p>Your doc update LGTM.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks! I can definitely imagine going either way on an initial decision about how to treat dotfiles on Windows; now that it's a backcompat concern to change it, I think it would be hard to argue for changing the behavior and agree that sticking to just a doc update makes the most sense.</p>
<p>I'll send a PR with the doc update. Do you have a preference on whether to include the pointer in the <code>--no-ignore-dot</code> section?</p>

<p>Ah yup, that SGTM too! We can hash out the wording if necessary in the PR.</p>
