            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As that miniconda is a somewhat popular tool for installing stuff on machines where users don&#x27;t have sudo, and as that it looks like the <code>conda-forge</code> repo maintains a ripgrep recipe (and it is up-to-date at the time of my writing), you might consider mentioning a conda recipe in the Installation section of the README.md ?</p>
<p>Something like this gets the job done</p>
<pre><code>conda install -c conda-forge ripgrep
</code></pre>
<p>Not exactly a feature request, but not a bug either, so I filed it here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not familiar with Conda, but as long as it doesn&#x27;t have any telemetry embedded into installed programs, then I&#x27;m happy to include it in the README. Folks should feel free to just file a PR for small stuff like this. I don&#x27;t usually track things like this in separate issues. Thanks!</p>
