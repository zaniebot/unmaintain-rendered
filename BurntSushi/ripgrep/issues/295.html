I assume this was probably an artifact of the grep crate once being part of ripgrep, which requires memmaps.</p>

<p>You&#x27;re indeed correct. In the long ago, ripgrep (formerly called <code>rep</code>) was my playground for testing the regex library. I initially tried to move all search code into a separate <code>grep</code> crate, but couldn&#x27;t quite figure out how to do it. So I ended up splitting a good chunk of it back out into ripgrep proper, and probably just forgot to get rid of the <code>memmap</code> dependency.</p>
<p>I am planning on moving the search code back into the <code>grep</code> crate, at which point, the <code>memmap</code> dependency may return. (What I know now that I was missing before is that the search code needs to be abstract over a sink/printer interface.)</p>
