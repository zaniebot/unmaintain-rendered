            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It looks like RipGrep is already supporting the <code>[^...]</code> syntax for glob patterns which will match on a character-range with negation. Can the <code>[!...]</code> syntax also be supported for the same purpose?</p>
<p>From http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An expression &quot;[!...]&quot; matches a single character, namely any
character that is not matched by the expression obtained by removing
the first '!' from it.  (Thus, &quot;[!]a-]&quot; matches any single character
except ']', 'a' and '-'.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, I got confused. RipGrep is supporting <code>[!...]</code> but actually not <code>[^...]</code> which for example node-glob seems to <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer">support</a>.</p>
<p>I am however not finding a standard that describes the <code>[^...]</code> syntax, so feel free to close.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FYI, even though POSIX (2.13.1) leaves the behaviour undefined, most glob-pattern implementations actually <em>do</em> support <code>[^...]</code> in addition to <code>[!...]</code>. bash does; zsh does; <code>fnmatch(3)</code> does in most C libraries, including GNU, FreeBSD/macOS, OpenBSD, and even musl; and, perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/7668cbc60578f99a4c048f8f8f38787930b8147b/wildmatch.c#L17">git does too</a>.</p>
<p>Something worth considering?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@okdana Cool, I didn't know that! I'm hopeful that it is a relatively simple addition to the <code>globset</code> crate. It is technically a breaking change, but I think we're fine. (<code>globset</code> should get a semver bump at least though.)</p>
