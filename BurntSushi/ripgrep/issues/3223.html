<ul>
<li>[x] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>15.1.0 (rev af60c2de9d)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p><code>ripgrep</code> installed with <code>ripgrep-15.1.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz</code></p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Linux Mageia 9</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>In stdout, numerous “No such file or directory (os error 2)” messages appear mixed in with the relevant <code>rg</code> results.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Run in the terminal such an innocuous command as:</p>
<p><code>rg -F &quot;lst@definelanguage[maths]&quot; -g &quot;lstlang0.sty&quot; ~/</code></p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>I get in stdout the relevant <code>rg</code> results but they are mixed with a lot of garbage of the form:</p>
<p><code>rg: /home/⟨path to an (indeed) non-existent file⟩: No such file or directory (os error 2)</code></p>
<p>On the other hand, if I collect the result in a file:</p>
<p><code>rg -F &quot;lst@definelanguage[maths]&quot; -g &quot;lstlang0.sty&quot; ~/ &gt; ~/rg.txt</code></p>
<p>this file contains only the relevant <code>rg</code> results.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>I would expect only the the relevant <code>rg</code> results in stdout.</p>

<p>Sure, but I don&#x27;t know how to built such a MRE.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You&#x27;ll probably need to debug this on your own then. My guess is that this isn&#x27;t a problem with ripgrep specifically.</p>
<p>In any case, there are a number of things you could try. For example, the command you&#x27;ve presented searches your entire home directory. Why not try searching something smaller to see if you can isolate the problem?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, probably not a <code>ripgrep</code> issue per se (sorry for the noise in this case).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If I restrict the search to a subdirectory of my home directory, the problem remains but only the (indeed) non-existent files of this subdirectory are mentioned.</p>

<p>Well, I guess you&#x27;re right: the error messages go to stderr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you have no idea whatsoever where the nonexistent filenames are coming from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. If I&#x27;m right, these files were removed not at the same time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I then don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bug at all.</p>
<p>When you read a directory and then act on its files, and some other process is racing you creating and deleting files at the same time, TOCTOU problems are pretty much unavoidable. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you read the whole directory at once and then act on its files, or you act on each file as you are reading the directory; as long as there are two steps to it, races are possible and <em>will</em> happen.</p>
