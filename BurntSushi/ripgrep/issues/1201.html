            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Huh? That version output looks correct. Please provide more details. I don't understand what's wrong here. Please be very specific about what the expected output is versus the actual output. Please also provide more specific details on what exactly you downloaded. Show the URL if you have to.</p>
<p>I can't make sense of this issue in its current form.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hm, probably the report was based on a misunderstanding on my part...</p>
<p>I downloaded &quot;grep-searcher-0.1.2&quot; (as it was the first in the queue), unpacked it (it contains just &quot;rg.exe&quot;), and was wondering why the downloaded version &quot;0.1.2&quot; was not reflected in the output of --version.</p>
<p>Obviously (and to my surprise) the ripgrep and grep-searcher releases bear the same executable name but differ in some respect (could you shed some light on this?).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because grep-searcher isn't actually a release. The CI configuration for Windows a new release for every tag and I don't always remember to clean it up.</p>
<p>It should be clear which release is the primary one because it actually has release notes.</p>
