            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 11.0.1 (rev 973de50c9e)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>I downloaded the binary from the github release page.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Ubuntu 18.04</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>I use rg to search a huge file (&gt;20GB). And from &quot;top&quot; command, the cpu usage of rg is always &lt;=100%, which means that rg is using only 1 core, instead of multiple cores.
&quot;-j 1&quot; and &quot;-j 6&quot; don't make any difference in terms of cpu usage and running time.
My workstation has 6c/12t cpu, 64GB of ram and nvme ssd. So I don't think the hardware is the restriction here.</p>
<p>Does ripgrep support multithreading in single large file at all? If not, is it on the roadmap?</p>
<p>Thanks!
Leo</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Nope. It significantly complicates the implementation.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since this is a semi-FAQ item, and searches for this question lead to this issue...</p>
<p>A viable &quot;multithreaded ripgrep search of a single very large file&quot; workaround, <em>external</em> to ripgrep, is to use GNU Parallel with its <code>--pipepart -a [inputfile]</code> option.</p>
<p>This will spawn multiple <code>rg</code> processes, and pass one raw <em>subsection</em> of <code>inputfile</code> to each process. You can adjust the number of blocks/processes to optimize for your hardware, including a <code>--block -1</code> option that spawns [core-count] processes to automaticallly divide the work into [core-count] chunks (which may be overkill, and bottlenecked on I/O).</p>
<p><code>parallel --pipepart --block -1 -a haystackfile &quot;rg needlestring&quot;</code></p>
<p>Note also that this workaround is specific to searching <em>single</em> files. ripgrep handles the multiple-file case quite efficiently on its own!</p>
<p>(And for the record, I 100% support the idea that adding single-file multithreaded search to ripgrep would add complexity that @BurntSushi is perfectly justified in avoiding! I'm hoping this workaround will help others, but if it's not a net win to drop this here, let me know and I will delete it)</p>
