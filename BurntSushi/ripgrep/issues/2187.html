OS - macOS 12.3
Installed - Brew installed</p>
<p>Hello Expert, I am facing some issues with ripgrep options available. I want to enable --smart-case to enable my search case insensitive but this option not working and the search result does not produce any output. same I  tried for the color option to highlight the searched keyword but that also failed.</p>
<p>Here is my search query and it failed</p>
<p>rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' -S &quot;Show Blocks&quot; 20220407_142710_shtec.txt</p>
<p>but if I add -i instead of -S option then below is the output but here color option is ignored by ripgrep.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Why did you delete the issue template? Please fill out the template. You're missing the <code>--debug</code> output and you haven't given me a command I can run on my own machine because I don't have <code>20220407_142710_shtec.txt</code>. If you can't share <code>20220407_142710_shtec.txt</code>, then please find another file you can provide me and a command that reproduces the problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Pass the <code>--debug</code> flag and copy the output to here......... There isn't anything else to do.</p>
<p>And your first command failing is expected. Please consider reading the docs for the <code>--smart-case</code> flag. The first sentence is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Searches case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Search case sensitively otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your pattern isn't all lowercase. So ripgrep treats it as a case sensitive search.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I think the issue here isn't ripgrep. I think you would benefit from some synchronous one-on-one help. Maybe you have a friend or something that you can do some pair programming with.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi  sorry but the smart case in the doc mentioned that it's like a flag &quot; -i  &quot; second what the point of the smart case if it does not automatically treat the upper and lower word search like the &quot;-i&quot; flag. --smart-case is not smart in this case then. this --debug also not showing anything</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>if I type everything as it is in the file then there is no point in having ignored case sensitive and smart-case. vim also has similar stuff which works fine and smartly. What about the color option I used in the search that also not produce the output as per the color I defined</p>
<p>here I mentioned magenta and yellow and result is red</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>--smart-case</code> is &quot;smart&quot; because it detects whether everything in your pattern is lowercase. <em>Only then</em> will it enable case insensitive search. Otherwise, it becomes a normal case sensitive search. Smart case helps when you want your search to be by default case insensitive <em>unless</em> there is something that isn't lowercase in your pattern. So, e.g., <code>rg -S 'foo'</code> behaves like <code>rg -i 'foo'</code> and <code>rg -S 'Foo'</code> behaves like <code>rg 'Foo'</code>. That's the &quot;smartness.&quot;</p>
<p>If <code>--debug</code> doesn't show anything at all, then there is something very fundamentally wrong with your setup and I don't know how to help you with it.</p>
<p>Colors work fine for me.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I don't have the capacity to help you further. I don't mean to be mean, but I think you need more basic help than what I feasibly offer through GitHub Issues. I recommend you get synchronous one-on-one help from a friend. Either that, or there is a language barrier here that I don't know how to overcome.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I found the problem, --debug and colors options were not working because I pipe the output of rg with the bat. but similar think I have tested with silver_search and pipe the output with the bat not break the functionality. anyway, I found the issue. thought to document here so someone like me come get some help</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>In the future, when reporting issues, it is imperative you include the full command you're <em>actually</em> running and its entire output. Otherwise it wastes a lot of time.</p>
