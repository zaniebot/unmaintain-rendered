<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Nixpkgs</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>NixOS 23.05</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>If I run <code>rg . foo.dng</code>, it will print the binary <code>.dng</code> file. The same occurs with <code>rg --no-binary . foo.dng</code>. This does <em>not</em> occur if I run <code>rg .</code>.</p>
<p>P.S. this is relevant to me because I have a utility that passes a list of files to Ripgrep. I expected Ripgrep to handle filtering out binary files from that list, as the Ripgrep documentation states.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Run <code>rg . FOO</code> where <code>FOO</code> is a binary file.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<pre><code>→ rg --debug -l . foo.dng

DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:421: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 12 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes
foo.dng
</code></pre>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>Ripgrep should return no matches.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is correct behavior. I&#x27;m on mobile, but the docs should say that ripgrep always searches the contents of files that are given explicitly on the command line. If you need to filter that list, you need to do it before handing the list to ripgrep.</p>
