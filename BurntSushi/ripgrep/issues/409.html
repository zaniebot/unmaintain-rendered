            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was doing something like:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh host cat verylargearchive.zst | zstd -d | rg pattern | head
</code></pre>
<p>to check that my pattern made sense before running on the full thing. And that hang for a while, and I assume it would have waited for the whole thing to have been read.</p>
<p>Replace <code>rg</code> with <code>grep</code> and the program stops as soon as <code>head</code> closes its input pipe.</p>
