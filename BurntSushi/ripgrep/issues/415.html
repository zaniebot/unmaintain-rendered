            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi, maybe I misunderstand the option , that if the file type is in the list of <code>rg --type-list</code>, for example, *.vim, can I use <code>rg 'xxx' -tvim</code> to search text in all *.vim?  But now it output <strong>unrecognized file type: vim</strong>.
I'm using the latest version in 2017-03-21</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@FinallyFinancialFreedom Could you please provide a minimal reproducible example? Please show the exact commands you're running, the actual output of each command and the expected output.</p>
<p>ripgrep does not provide a <code>vim</code> file type by default. If you're adding the <code>vim</code> file type manually, then please consider reading the docs carefully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>--type-add <TYPE>...
Add a new glob for a particular file type. Only one glob can be added at a time.
Multiple --type-add flags can be provided. Unless --type-clear is used, globs are added
to any existing globs defined inside of ripgrep.</p>
<p><strong>Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT
persisted.</strong></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Maybe I did not make it clearly.
I assumed that all filetypes in the output of <code>rg --type-list</code> command can be used after -t parameter, is it right?
<code>vimscript: *.vim</code> is in the list, and when i <code>rg something -tvim</code> in vim plugins folder,  i got <strong>unrecognized file type: vim.</strong>. There are fzf.vim and vim.vim file under this folder.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I see. The type name is on the left hand side. The right hand side are the glob rules. So you would need to use <code>-tvimscript</code>. I would be OK with a PR that add a <code>vim</code> type as well, since <code>vimscript</code> seems annoying to type.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ok, -tvimscript works fine, <code>vimscript</code> is not so intuitive. Whatever, rg is blazing fast. It helps me a lot, thank you for the wonderful job.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@FinallyFinancialFreedom Thanks! I added the <code>vim</code> file type, so the next release you should be able to do <code>-tvim</code>. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi Why does it have to be added everytime ? Is there something more to it than just searching like <code>*extension</code>? Perhaps some noise reduction for each extension or something ?</p>
<p>I have quite exotic file types in my project and I would want to use them :)</p>

<p>I don't understand what is preventing you from doing so. Could you please be more specific?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry maybe I am misunderstanding how to use this.</p>
<p>Is <code>rg --tpy foo</code> suppose to be same as <code>grep -r foo --include=\*.py</code> ?</p>
<p>If so then, given <code>.snake</code> extension, why <code>rg --tsnake foo</code> fails with <code>unrecognized file type: snake</code> but <code>grep -r foo --include=\*.snake</code> doesn't ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nevermind I just noticed there is <code>--type-add</code> flag :facepalm: Sorry for confusion.</p>
<p>I just thought this would be handled automatically like with <code>--include</code> flag in <code>grep</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, the type system is meant to group related globs together. For example, if you want to search README files, you might want <code>{README,readme,README.txt,README.md}</code>.</p>
<p>ripgrep's approximate equivalent of grep's <code>--include</code> flag is the <code>-g/--glob</code> flag.</p>
