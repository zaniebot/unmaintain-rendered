            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry it was just an impulse feeling of missing a favorite tool in the table. I've read what <code>ripgrep</code> is about, I can see the difference, and perf-wise I don't care, so to answer your question: I'm not sure. I'm closing this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All righty. I personally haven't used <code>pcre2grep</code> much myself, however, I did use it as a baseline when adding the <code>-P/--pcre2</code> flag to ripgrep in terms of performance.</p>
<p>Quickly scanning <code>pcre2grep</code>'s man page, nothing jumps out at me as a feature that isn't in ripgrep, other than perhaps POSIX locale support. (ripgrep does support transcoding from a number of different encodings however, including UTF-16, which I don't think <code>pcre2grep</code> supports.)</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like <code>pcre2grep</code> didn't have Unicode support, but you can enable it via the special <code>(*UCP)</code> directive in the pattern when combined with the <code>-u</code> flag (short for &quot;UTF-8 mode&quot;). e.g., <code>pcre2grep -u '(*UCP)Napol\won'</code> will match <code>Napoléon</code>, but if you remove <em>either</em> of <code>-u</code> or <code>(*UCP)</code>, then <code>Napoléon</code> is not matched. So one place where ripgrep does well here is that it can use PCRE2 and its Unicode features even on input that is not valid UTF-8. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ echo $'\xFFNapoléon' | pcre2grep -u '(*UCP)Napol\won'
pcre2grep: pcre2_match() gave error -23 while matching this text:

Napoléon

$ echo $'\xFFNapoléon' | rg 'Napol\won'
Napoléon
