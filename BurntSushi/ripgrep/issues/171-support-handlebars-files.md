# Support Handlebars files

---

_@alexlafroscia_

[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) (also used in Ember.js for templating) files end in `hbs`, which is something not currently supported.  I'll try to make a PR for this myself, but figured I would make an issue first!

Sounds good to me! Since "handlebars" is quite long, I'd probably make the
type name "hbs" (unless there is some other better suited initialism).
