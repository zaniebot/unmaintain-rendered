<p>I&#x27;ve managed to build the artifacts <code>_rg, rg.1, rg.bash, rg.fish</code>. Where am I supposed to upload them in github? Is this something only maintainers can modify in the release artifacts?</p>

<p>Are you asking how to upload artifacts to someone else&#x27;s project? No of course you can&#x27;t do that and of course only maintainers can. Otherwise anyone could insert whatever they want into a release...</p>
<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding your question?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I&#x27;ll separate this in 2 questions to be clearer</p>
<p>a) In https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/341a19e0d05bc6f0cabeb2dc756b37cfc047f8f0/ci/build-deb#L6-L8 it mentions that &quot;the resulting dpkg is uploaded to GitHub via the web UI&quot;. What Github web UI is this referring to?</p>
<p>b) Not really a question: If the previous answer is &quot;github web UI == github release page&quot;, then I guess that this issue can only be done by maintainers due to permissions</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For (A), the UI is this page (which you probably don&#x27;t have access to): https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/edit/13.0.0</p>
<p>Here are a couple screenshots. You can see there is a place for me to upload release artifacts:</p>

<p>As for (B), yes. It doesn&#x27;t get fixed until the next release, just like any other change.</p>
