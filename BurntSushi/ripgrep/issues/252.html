            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd like to have a type called e.g. <code>styling</code> which searches css, sass, less and stylus, as well as a type for combined <code>styling</code>, <code>js</code> and <code>json</code> called e.g. <code>frontend</code>.</p>
<p>I could define those as their own types, but if I could compose other types together it would mean that if I add a new css dialect to <code>styling</code>, my <code>frontend</code> type would automatically be updated to use it.</p>
