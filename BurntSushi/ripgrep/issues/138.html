            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One flag that occasionally comes useful is to identify files that <em>don&#x27;t</em> match a certain expression. Both <code>ag</code> and <code>ack</code> have <code>-L</code>/<code>--files-without-matches</code> (effectively the opposite of <code>-l</code>/<code>--files-with-matches</code>).</p>
<p>One minor problem here is that <code>rg -L</code> is already taken for following symlinks.</p>
<p>Curiously, <code>ag -lv</code> appears to be a synonym of <code>-L</code>. I&#x27;m not sure whether this is intentional or not, but it seems like a perfectly reasonable approach to me — in fact, years ago, before I knew of <code>-L</code>, this is actually what I first tried with <code>ack</code>, and got bogus results (it interprets this combo as &quot;list all files that have at least one line that does not match the given expression&quot;, like ripgrep does today). Personally, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a use case for this.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not opposed to adding <code>--files-without-matches</code>, but I don&#x27;t think we need to add a short alias for it. I&#x27;d at least like to keep <code>-L</code> for following symlinks.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m also not opposed to making <code>-v</code> a bit smarter with respect to whether <code>-l</code> is given or not, but I worry that it will make &quot;find files with a line that doesn&#x27;t match&quot; impossible to do.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, so I did some more thinking about this and I think the <em>current</em> behavior of <code>-lv</code> is probably the right one. I totally get that it can be confusing, but <code>-v</code> pretty solidly refers to matching at the line level and isn&#x27;t a generic &quot;do the opposite&quot; flag. In particular, <code>grep -lv</code> behaves the same as <code>rg -lv</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a proposed specification.</p>
<p>Add a new flag <code>--files-without-matches</code>. Only show the path of each file that contains zero matches.</p>
