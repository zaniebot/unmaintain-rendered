            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ripgrep supports <code>\x{1234}</code>, but not <code>\u1234</code>, while many people expect the latter. Have you considered also supporting <code>\u</code>?</p>
<p>If not, we'll rewrite one to the other for compatibility with the JS regex engine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is an interesting ticket. It probably belongs as an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex">regex engine</a> itself. Historically, I chose not to support the <code>\u</code> syntax because Rust itself has support for such syntax in its string literals. But obviously that isn't available when you aren't writing Rust code. That seems like a good enough argument to support the syntax to me.</p>
<p>Note that technically, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Hex_notation">according to UAX#18</a>, the <code>\x</code> syntax satisfies the requirement, but they also list a specific grammar for the <code>\u</code> (and <code>\u{...}</code>) style of syntax.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/424">filed a ticket with the regex crate</a>, but I'll leave this open so it's easy to track with respect to ripgrep.</p>
<p>(I don't have a specific timeline on this. I should be able to get it done as part of the <code>regex-syntax</code> rewrite that I'm working on, but I don't have an ETA. It could be a few weeks (ideal) if things go well, or it could be months.)</p>
