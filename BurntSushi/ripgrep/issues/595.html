<p>Despite the discussion in #413 and the resultant commit 30ca3ecca65d06ebc1d0794f3968397709aff9a8, I'm still seeing rather large binaries after a fresh <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> on my CentOS 7 box (~27 MiB)</p>
<p>Running <code>strip ~/.cargo/bin/rg</code> gives me a binary that's a magnitude of size smaller, like expressed in #413.</p>
<p>Did I misunderstand the effect of that commit, or is this a bug?</p>

<p>Only the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases">release tarballs are stripped</a>. The only way to make <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> produce a smaller binary is to modify the <code>Cargo.toml</code> to disable debug symbols, and I'm not particularly interested in doing that.</p>
<p>I hate to say things like this, but <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> is pretty much the install option of last resort. I provide it because people want it, but it's really not &quot;supposed&quot; to be the way you install ripgrep.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to add a note to the README near the <code>cargo install</code> option with respect to its downsides.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ahh, that makes more sense!
I think a doc update around the implications of <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> would be excellent!
Thanks so much for the quick reply @BurntSushi.</p>
<p>I didn't realize I could install it from <code>copr</code> so I'll go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>Curious, what's the estimated turnaround time for updating the package on <code>copr</code>?
It's currently <code>0.5.2</code> fyi.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't know. I don't maintain that. The only things i personally maintain are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Github releases (which you can use)</li>
<li>Crates.io</li>
<li>Homebrew</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, you can continue using cargo install if you want and don't mind waiting a couple MB.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi @BurntSushi ,</p>
<p>Thank you for ripgrep, it's truly awesome.</p>
<p>Installing via <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> could be &quot;fixed&quot; if debug symbols were removed from the toml, as they are implied at compile time. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># From a fresh git clone of ripgrep, with debug=true removed from toml
$ cargo build
[...]
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 70.58 secs
$ ls -l target/debug/rg 
-rwxr-xr-x 2 dv dv 29M oct  3 12:43 target/debug/rg
</code></pre>
<p>outputs a binary with debug symbols in <code>target/debug</code> folder (as expected).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># From a fresh git clone of ripgrep, with debug= true removed from toml
$ cargo build --release
[...]
Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 227.42 secs
$ ls -l target/release/rg 
-rwxr-xr-x 2 dv dv 6,0M oct  3 12:49 target/release/rg
</code></pre>
<p>outputs an optimized binary (only 6Mb).</p>
<p>All users installing ripgrep from <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> would benefit from it :smiley:*.  What are you thoughts?</p>
<p>*I think about <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/10">Ubuntu/Debian</a> users like me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What other explanation would you like? I want debug symbols in the binary. I don't want to have to keep fiddling with the Cargo.toml. <code>cargo install</code> is provided on a best effort basis, and I'm not going to go through contortions to make it perfect.</p>
<p>I mean really, why do you care this much? Even if you're one of the few people that cares about a few MB of disk space, then you are of course free to run strip on the binary.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I didn't mean to upset you. Reducing the size of the executable by 80% might interest others:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

$ sed -i -e '/\[profile.release\]\|debug = true/d' Cargo.toml
$ cargo build --release

<p>Instead of going through <code>Cargo.toml</code> contortions, just <code>strip</code> the binary:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo install ripgrep
$ strip $(which rg)
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can a new profile be created instead? So release defaults to the proper settings and then you can use a profile called &quot;debuggable_release&quot; or something (maybe just &quot;dr&quot;).</p>
