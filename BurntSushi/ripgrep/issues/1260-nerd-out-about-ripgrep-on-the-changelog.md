# Nerd out about ripgrep on The Changelog?!

---

_@jerodsanto_

Howdy from [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)!

_(Never heard of The Changelog? We've been interviewing the hackers, leaders, and innovators of software development since '09.)_

We'd love to have you on the show sometime soon, @BurntSushi. What do you think? 

💚
