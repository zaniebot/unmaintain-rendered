            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We should definitely try to support customizing colors in the output similar to how <code>ag</code> does it. Currently they support 3 color customizations, as per <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/issues/90">this issue</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--colors-match</code></li>
<li><code>--colors-path</code></li>
<li><code>--colors-line-number</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing the part where we set colors based on an argument is not particularly hard (just a matter of translating user input to <code>term::Attr</code> enums). Parsing input in the bash terminal format like <code>ag</code> does was not difficult to implement. However, this limits Windows usage because we don&#x27;t have an easy translation between those colors.</p>
<p>How should we go about supporting these color customizations for both Linux, Mac and Windows?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should take the common subset that is supported by all platforms and expose them as English names. I think that means these: https://stebalien.github.io/doc/term/term/color/index.html --- I don&#x27;t know precisely which ones are or aren&#x27;t supported on Windows though. Things like &quot;bold&quot; or background colors don&#x27;t work either (I think), or rather, bold &quot;RED&quot; is &quot;BRIGHT_RED&quot;. So maybe we do something like: <code>--color-path COLOR</code> where <code>COLOR</code> is <code>FgName[:Bold][/BgName[:Bold]]</code>, and <code>FgName</code>/<code>BgName</code> is any one of (case insensitively) <code>black</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>cyan</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>magenta</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>white</code>, <code>yellow</code>. We could note that background colors aren&#x27;t supported on Windows.</p>
<p>We should probably look at other tools that permit color customization and support both Linux and Windows and see what they do.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to avoid specifying colors as ANSI escape codes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>We could also do something a bit more generic that might be better for future expansion, like, <code>--color-path COLOR</code> where <code>COLOR</code> is <code>ATTR[,VAL][...]</code>. <code>ATTR</code> can be one of <code>Bold</code>, <code>Dim</code>, <code>Italic</code>, <code>Underline</code>, <code>Blink</code>, <code>Standout</code>, <code>Reverse</code>, <code>Secure</code>, <code>Fg</code> or <code>Bg</code>. If <code>Fg</code> or <code>Bg</code>, then <code>VAL</code> can be one of <code>black</code>, <code>blue</code>, ... and so on.</p>
<p>If any option chosen is known not to be supported on Windows, then <code>rg</code> should return an error.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually feel pretty strongly about this. If an end user asks ripgrep to do something, and ripgrep knows it can&#x27;t, then it should just fail and tell the user how they can fix their problem. We should try to follow this philosophy everywhere in ripgrep.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not to say that soft errors don&#x27;t exist. One example of a soft error is if <code>ripgrep</code> can&#x27;t descend into a directory. It emits the reason why it can&#x27;t but otherwise continues on its merry way.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s convincing enough for me. Makes sense!</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if the user&#x27;s environment allows them to change colors on their terminal. If not, <code>rg</code> fails with a relevant error message.</li>
<li>If the user can change colors, we go through the argument, which looks something like <code>--colors=((path|line|match):(fg|bg|style):(color or bold/italic/etc.))*</code> and parse into <code>Attr</code> values.</li>
<li>The <code>Printer</code> is then passed these values if they exist, overriding any default values.</li>
<li>Where <code>write_matched_line</code> and other methods manually set colors, use the user-provided ones or defaults.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&#x27;s a relatively sufficient overview of the changes needed.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since this kind of colorization is usually more of a somewhat permanent configuration thing rather than on a per-search basis, I think this should be settable via configuration file as well (although an alias will probably do just fine on Linux and Mac OS X for now, but not sure if that&#x27;s a practical option on Windows).</p>
<p>Whether or not ripgrep currently reads settings from any non-ignore files (I don&#x27;t know actually), it seems at least to be a good idea to design a syntax that doesn&#x27;t interfere with what parsers for, say, TOML or INI-style syntax can handle. Or maybe there&#x27;s nothing to worry about?</p>

<p>Funnily enough, if you pass <code>--color</code> today and it doesn&#x27;t work, ripgrep silently ignores it (but puts it in the debug log). Foot, meet mouth. :-)</p>

<p>I kind of suspect that I&#x27;d like to punt on support ANSI escape codes for now. Not only because it seems like a pretty niche use case, but the term coloring library we&#x27;re using presents a (mostly) platform independent abstraction, which isn&#x27;t going to allow using ANSI escape codes directly. It&#x27;s a much bigger change to support them.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s nearly impossible to read the file name; the theme has switched the terminal&#x27;s bold green for a color close to the background. Which is not your fault, I get, just a vote that I&#x27;d love to be able to customize the color.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I&#x27;m finally ready to tackle this issue (and the litany of other color related issues). In particular, my plan is to jettison use of the <code>term</code> crate and roll my own platform independent abstraction.</p>
<p>I am going to move forward with this specification:</p>
<pre><code>--colors=((path|line|match):(fg|bg|style):(value)) ...
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--colors</code> flag specifies color settings for use in ripgrep&#x27;s output. The <code>--colors</code> flag may be given multiple times. Each use of <code>--colors</code> sets the foreground/background color or the text style of a particular part of ripgrep&#x27;s output. Currently, colors are limited to one of eight choices (red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black) and text style is limited to either <code>nobold</code> or <code>bold</code>. There are otherwise three configurable aspects of ripgrep&#x27;s output:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>path</strong> - Whenever a file path is printed.</li>
<li><strong>line</strong> - Whenever a line number is printed.</li>
<li><strong>match</strong> - Whenever text that explicitly matches the pattern is printed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, this sets the match color to red and its style to bold, and set the line number background to green and not bold:</p>
<pre><code>--colors &#x27;match:fg:red&#x27; --colors &#x27;match:style:bold&#x27; --colors &#x27;line:bg:green&#x27; --colors &#x27;line:style:nobold&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#x27;d like to disable colors, then you can use the special <code>none</code> directive. For example, this disables any colors or styles when printing file paths:</p>
<pre><code>--colors &#x27;path:none&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>Color settings are applied iteratively. For example, to clear any existing color settings for <code>match</code> and set its foreground to blue, one can do:</p>
<pre><code>--colors &#x27;match:none&#x27; --colors &#x27;match:fg:blue&#x27;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>While the above specification doesn&#x27;t resolve <em>all</em> use cases (e.g., &quot;I want to set the exact ANSI escape code&quot;), it does solve the most important ones (e.g., &quot;I can&#x27;t read the output of ripgrep&quot;) and dodges the question of platform differences by only supporting the intersection of ANSI color support and Windows console support. Most importantly, this specification leaves the door open for future expansion, such as additional text styles or supporting ANSI escape sequences directly.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My apologies, I was too brief before, as the difference in bolding between top and bottom is subtle. In the above screenshot with <code>ag</code> on top and <code>rg</code> below, the green path is bolded with font, but not with color. Likewise with the line numbers. This may be more clear when with a screenshot of my ansi color pallet settings:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YiPnAhT.png" alt="screenshot">
Many terminals support bolding font independently from the bright ansi colors, as shown in the screenshot. With match:style:bold, the green path would appear almost black.
I would like to be able to bold the <em>font</em> of the path and line numbers in <code>rg</code> to match the format of <code>ag</code> if possible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@CallumHoward Ah I see now, thanks for the clarification! I think you&#x27;re experiencing the same problem as in #266.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The no-bold-escape-sequence output is not only a nuisance in terminal use, it is also a real problem for software trying to use <code>ripgrep</code> and parsing its output, e.g., when replacing <code>grep</code> by <code>ripgrep</code> in Emacs...  Are you planning to make this configurable, such that one could get actual &#x27;bold&#x27; escape sequences?  Otherwise I will have to hack around the parsing code in Emacs, because I really like what I&#x27;ve seen of <code>ripgrep</code> so far!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ilohmar Please file a new issue and describe the specific problem you&#x27;re trying to solve. It would help if you left Emacs out of it completely (for example) because I don&#x27;t use Emacs, and therefore I don&#x27;t have the same context as you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Done, see #293.  Emacs was just an example, sorry for not making this clear enough.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For anyone coming here trying to make <code>rg</code> look exactly like <code>ag</code>, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>rg --colors &#x27;match:bg:yellow&#x27; --colors &#x27;match:fg:black&#x27; --colors &#x27;match:style:nobold&#x27; --colors &#x27;path:fg:green&#x27; --colors &#x27;path:style:bold&#x27; --colors &#x27;line:fg:yellow&#x27; --colors &#x27;line:style:bold&#x27;
