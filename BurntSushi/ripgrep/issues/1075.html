            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While talking with @ashleygwilliams about the implementation of ignore files in cargo-generate, we noticed that we currently don&#x27;t have a way to validate ignore files. In our context, &quot;validate&quot; means &quot;ensure that all globs make sense for cargo-generate, and to warn users on ones that can&#x27;t have any effect on a project&quot;.</p>
<p>Concretely, a glob such as <code>../foo</code> in a <code>.genignore</code> file in the project root will not make any sense and is probably a typo we want to notify the user about. (I don&#x27;t even know how ignore deals with these relative paths.)</p>
<p>Would it be possible to add a method to <code>WalkBuilder</code> to analyse the current internal state and emit errors when encountering a glob that is not local to one of the root paths?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how to go about this. At a surface level, a <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/acf226c39d79264256c0295b8381f8c7f0d74d59/ignore/src/gitignore.rs#L83"><code>Gitignore</code> contains a <code>Vec&lt;Glob&gt;</code></a>, where <code>Glob</code> is already an exported type. We could add a method that returns a <code>&amp;[Glob]</code>. A <code>Glob</code> in this context is <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/acf226c39d79264256c0295b8381f8c7f0d74d59/ignore/src/gitignore.rs#L25-L75">strictly informational</a>, but you could use it to look for problematic patterns and warn about them. However, I&#x27;m not sure how to expose this API in a convenient way during directory traversal. It would probably mean attaching <code>Gitignore</code> values to <code>DirEntry</code>, which I don&#x27;t feel too great about.</p>
<p>Popping up a level, a glob such as <code>../foo</code> is not actually invalid, AFAIK. The <code>ignore</code> crate does its best to adhere to the specification defined in <code>man gitignore</code> when reading <code>.gitignore</code> files (and, as a convenient consequence, <code>.ignore</code> and any other ignore-esque files). As far as I can tell, <code>../foo</code> is not specifically outlawed by <code>man gitignore</code>. With that said, I&#x27;m struggling to figure out under which conditions such a pattern would match something. On Unix at least, I&#x27;m pretty sure that <code>..</code> is not a valid directory name, such that it should never match. But I don&#x27;t know what the story is on Windows. If we could make an argument that it never meaningfully matches, then I might be OK treating it as an error (in much the same way that, say, <code>**.c</code> is treated as an error today). With that said, I&#x27;d like to emphasize that I do not feel great about this; this part of ripgrep has historically been a very subtle source of bugs, and I&#x27;m hesitant to deviate from the spec. Therefore, making this into a disabled-by-default configuration knob is probably the way to go.</p>
<p>The <code>ignore</code> crate does already provide an API for querying errors that occur as part of parsing <code>gitignore</code> files. Specifically, a <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.4.4/ignore/struct.DirEntry.html#method.error"><code>DirEntry</code> has an <code>error</code> method</a> that reports errors found while parsing ignore files. So I imagine these more &quot;paranoid&quot; errors would surface via this method, which you could then emit as warnings.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m going to close this because it&#x27;s not quite clear what the next actionable step is here to me. It might make sense to implement this on a case by case basis, so that application specific logic can be used to determine whether a glob is sensible or not.</p>
