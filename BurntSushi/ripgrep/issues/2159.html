            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>Replace this text with the output of <code>rg --version</code>.</p>
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0 (rev 0b36942f68)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>installed from source on github</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Lubuntu 20.04 with i3wm</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>When trying to use a .ripgreprc config-file, it does not set the flags. In my .bashrc I have set, as instructed in the repo readme:</p>
<p>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=&#x27;/home/emil/Dropbox/share/.ripgreprc&#x27;</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>for example, in the .ripgreprc I have:</p>
<p>--smart-case</p>
<p>but it is does not change rg behaviour - this goes for all the flags I try to include.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>rg monkey</p>
<p>only finds text with lowercase monkey.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>the expected output would be rg to find any case of monkey, like:</p>
<p>Monkey
monKey</p>
<p>and so on.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is very likely a problem on your end. e.g., Maybe you aren&#x27;t setting the env var correctly. Maybe you aren&#x27;t <code>export</code>ing it. etc etc.</p>
<p>You can test this by running <code>echo MONKEY | RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=/home/emil/Dropbox/share/.ripgreprc rg monkey</code>. If that works, then there&#x27;s nothing wrong with ripgrep here, and the problem is definitively with how you&#x27;re setting the environment variable. Consider running <code>env</code> to debug whether the env var is set or not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh okay, when running <code>echo MONKEY | RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=/home/emil/Dropbox/share/.ripgreprc rg monkey</code> the output is captured correctly. Hmm, how strange, I would&#x27;ve thought adding it to .bashrc could not go wrong. Sorry for wasting your time!</p>
