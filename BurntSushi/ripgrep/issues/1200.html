Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I thought it would be really handy if ripgrep supported shannon entropy search. By that I mean adding an option, so as it&#x27;s searching through text; if any given word has entropy above a threshold then display it as a match. I currently use other tools for this type of search, though I use ripgrep for regex and most other types of grep functionality. It would be handy and I suspect faster to have all of that in this tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This doesn&#x27;t sound like a good fit for ripgrep, sorry. If speed is important, you might consider reusing some of ripgrep&#x27;s libraries for this. It shouldn&#x27;t be too much code for such a specialized use case. High level documentation for ripgrep&#x27;s libraries is still missing, but <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/grep/examples/simplegrep.rs">this example</a> should be a good starting point for now.</p>
