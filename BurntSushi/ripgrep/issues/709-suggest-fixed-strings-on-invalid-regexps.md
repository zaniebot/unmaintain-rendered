# Suggest --fixed-strings on invalid regexps

---

_@Wilfred_

```
$ rg "foo("
Error parsing regex near 'foo(' at character offset 3: Unclosed parenthesis.
```

I think ripgrep should suggest the `--fixed-strings` argument if there's a regex syntax error.

Hmmmm... I think I'd be OK with that.

I can pick this one up next.

One question though: Do we still want the error generated by the `regex` lib to be propagated all the way to the command line? Or are OK with replacing that with a generic error such as: "*Syntax error encountered while parsing provided regex. Please recheck. Note: Perhaps you meant to use --fixed-strings instead.*"

I can think of a relatively straightforward, easy-to-implement fix if we're OK with the latter.

I would suggest regex error details to be shown to the user. grep, ack, and ag also give details about regex errors.

@balajisivaraman We _definitely_ want to surface the syntax error.

Can this be closed with the merging of #727?

---

_Comment by @BurntSushi on 2018-01-14 16:19_

@balajisivaraman Yup! Thanks.

@BurntSushi does `--fixed-strings` means auto fixe regex?  I mean if the regex has no errors, just use it as regex.

@wsdjeg I don't understand your question or your suggestion. Could you please elaborate? Please include examples.

---

_Comment by @BurntSushi on 2018-02-01 14:00_

@wsdjeg Also, have you read the documentation?

```
    -F, --fixed-strings                     
            Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. When this flag is
            used, special regular expression meta characters such as (){}*+. do not need to be
            escaped.
```

@BurntSushi I have read it, I just create a grep plugin , and using rg as backgroud tool. search the user's input.

I hope I auto detect if the user is input a right expression. that means, it will be better there is an option --auto-fixed-string.  if there is error in such expression, treat it as fixed string. otherwise use it as regex.

here is an gif:

@wsdjeg That seems like a distinct feature request that is completely orthogonal to this issue. Please open a new issue.

---

_Comment by @wsdjeg on 2018-02-01 14:22_

Ok, and thanks for this project.

_Comment by @prosoitos on 2025-06-02 21:16_

It looks like this got addressed years ago, yet, with version 14.1.1 (latest), when running:

```sh
rg "foo("
```

I am getting:

```sh
rg: regex parse error:
    (?:foo()
    ^
error: unclosed group
```

No mention of `--fixed-strings`.

I am confused.

Thanks!
