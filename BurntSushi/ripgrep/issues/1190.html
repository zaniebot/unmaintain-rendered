<pre><code>rg --version

How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Cargo update</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>MacOS 10.14.2 (18C54)</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>it seems like ZSH tab auto completion broke, no longer getting auto-completion after typing <code>rg &quot;abc&quot; --file</code> (expect for it to suggest options)</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p><code>rg &quot;abc&quot; --file&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;</code></p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>autocompleting with ALL files name</p>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>autocompleting with the search options</p>

<p>It shouldn&#x27;t complete further options for the reason you mentioned, but also <code>--file</code> isn&#x27;t offered at all (on versions of zsh that support arg-spec grouping) after <code>rg abc</code> because <code>abc</code> is taken as a pattern, which is mutually exclusive with <code>--file</code>.</p>
<p>On balance, it wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable for us to remove that restriction, since the function can&#x27;t actually assume that <code>abc</code> was meant to be a pattern rather than a file.</p>

<p>I&#x27;ve just tested on zsh 5.3 and zsh 5.7 and it seems to work as expected for me. Are those options offered if you try to complete <em>before</em> typing the first operand? Can you run <code>echo $ZSH_VERSION</code> and <code>whence -v _rg</code> and report the results?</p>

<p>It sounds like the function isn&#x27;t loaded at all then.</p>
<p>Does Cargo even provide the completion function? I&#x27;ve never used it to install ripgrep before, but i tried just now and i don&#x27;t see it anywhere. If you had it before, maybe you got it from somewhere else? Homebrew maybe?</p>

<p>well I definitely have it since <code>rg</code> still run, just the autocompletion does not.
I think <code>whence</code> and <code>which</code> does the same thing.</p>
<pre><code>whence -v rg
rg is /Users/son.luongngoc/.cargo/bin/rg

<p>this works without underscore i think we were just using different system :D</p>

<p><code>_rg</code> is the name of the completion function for <code>rg</code>. It&#x27;s included with ripgrep as a separate file, also named <code>_rg</code>. (But, again, i&#x27;m not sure if Cargo gives it to you)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>If you install it through Homebrew you should get the <code>_rg</code> file under <code>/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions</code>. We&#x27;re getting outside the scope of ripgrep now, but, assuming that directory is in your <code>fpath</code> (and i think it&#x27;s there by default in the zsh that macOS ships with), it should be loaded by <code>compinit</code>. You should have something about that in your <code>.zshrc</code>. You&#x27;ll probably need to restart the shell after installing it, too.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html">zsh documentation</a> goes into more detail about how to set up completion</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>hmm i took a dive into it and manually removed my <code>_rg</code> <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/4127">robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#4127</a> then uninstall using brew and reinstalled using brew and it worked.</p>
<p>Possibly that not installing via brew, e.g. using Cargo, would break the autocompletion?</p>
<p>I suggest we include <code>rg --auto-complete</code> flag to generate autocompletion for ZSH and BASH shells by default?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>To clarify, <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> only installs the binary. It installs nothing else. No man page. No completions. No license. No docs. Nothing. This is why it&#x27;s the last installation option in the README, and is specifically prefixed with &quot;If you&#x27;re a Rust programmer ...&quot; If I were more ideologically driven, I probably wouldn&#x27;t allow ripgrep to be installed with <code>cargo install</code> at all, precisely because of confusing issues like this. Nevertheless, people seem to love having this option available to them.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Deleting the <code>zcompdump</code> file can fix issues with completion after installing/upgrading something, but doing it in <code>zshrc</code> like that will disable <code>compinit</code>&#x27;s caching mechanism, forcing it to scan through all of your completion files every single time the shell starts. It&#x27;s similar to calling <code>compinit</code> with the <code>-D</code> option. There are some situations where that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d want, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the right fix if you&#x27;re just missing a completion function.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to reply to my latest post. I don&#x27;t mind sharing my <code>.zshrc</code> setup - if you find anything that is causing the autocomplete to not work (and allow me to drop the <code>compinit</code> part) then I&#x27;m all ears 👂</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t see any problems with it, at least nothing that would break ripgrep completion.</p>
<p>One thing i should have said before is that when you delete the cache by hand you should use <code>rm -f ~/.zcompdump*</code> (with the asterisk), since sometimes there are extra bits at the end of the file name. I glanced at OMZ and it looks like it creates the files that way by default, so that probably applies here. You can see if doing that lets you remove the extra stuff you added.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#x27;t, the only other thing i can suggest off the top of my head is removing the <code>compinit</code> line and putting the <code>fpath</code> addition above where you source OMZ. Again, i&#x27;d be surprised if that&#x27;s actually doing anything for you, but that&#x27;s how i&#x27;d expect OMZ to want <code>fpath</code> additions to be done.</p>
