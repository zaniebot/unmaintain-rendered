            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 11.0.2 (rev 3de31f7527)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>from the latest Github binary release</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 10 Pro 1903
(something changed from the previous Windows 10 Pro version I was using; this issue did not start occurring until immediately after the 1903 install a few days ago)</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>Using ripgrep and letting it run to completion (as opposed to Ctrl+c interruption as described in <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/187">PR#187</a>) appears to restore terminal colors, but it does not do so completely.</p>
<p>If I run <code>less</code> after ripgrep, it displays as white-on-white.</p>
<p>If I run <code>color</code> to restore colors to window defaults, then <code>less</code> works correctly.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<ol>
<li>Run <code>less</code> to verify colors are correct</li>
<li>Run ripgrep (on anything) to completion</li>
<li>Run <code>less</code> again, observe white-on-white behavior</li>
<li>Run <code>color</code> to restore command prompt colors</li>
<li>Run <code>less</code> again, observe correct color behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>I am using <code>less</code>  from <a href="https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow/releases">GoW 0.8.0</a></p>
<p>I tried this with various console colors (white on black, black on white, yellow on black, red on blue-green) and got the same result.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>(see steps above)</p>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>(see steps above)</p>

<p>Interestingly enough there is another symptom that doesn&#x27;t involve <code>less</code> at all.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve now created a directory <code>c:\tmp\ripgrep-1490</code> with one file in it, test.txt, containing the text &quot;hi&quot;.</p>
<p>Precise commands:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; color 73
&gt; rg hi

<p>and the colors are... strange after rg runs:</p>

<p>Hmm, I&#x27;ll check; do you have any suggestions? (the only one I can think of is a peculiar utility called <code>waf</code>)</p>
<p>I just tried <code>waf</code> (which uses terminal escapes for changing colors) and it seems to do the right thing, restoring all color state. It doesn&#x27;t affect the output of <code>less</code> and works fine with <code>color 73</code>.</p>

<p>ripgrep should too. ripgrep only uses the old console APIs when ANSI colors aren&#x27;t available.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK it looks like there are at least <em>four</em> color values relating to the Windows Command prompt.</p>
<ol>
<li>the &quot;default&quot; color value from the Registry (<code>reg query &quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor&quot; /v DefaultColor</code> -- I have mine set right now to <code>02</code> = green on white for debugging this issue... think I&#x27;ll keep it this way)</li>
<li>the &quot;natural&quot; (??? my terminology) color of the Command Prompt which was set at the time that <code>cmd.exe</code> started running, and which you can set with the <code>/T:xy</code> option where <code>xy</code> is the color code</li>
<li>the current color of the command prompt.</li>
<li>the last color set manually via the UI (upper left corner of command prompt -&gt; Properties -&gt; Colors) -- I have no idea where this color is stored but it&#x27;s stored somewhere</li>
</ol>

<p>With my Registry entry at <code>02</code> (green on white), and colors of a Command Prompt window set to that horrid blue-on-red, I can type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>start cmd</code> -- opens command window W1 with green-on-white</li>
<li><code>cd \tmp\ripgrep-1490</code> in W1</li>
<li><code>start cmd /T:7e</code> from W1 -- opens command window W2 with yellow-on-black</li>
<li><code>rg hi</code> in W1 -- this sets the colors to blue-on-red</li>
</ul>
<p>W1:</p>

<p>It doesn&#x27;t. It just emits a &quot;reset&quot; ANSI escape code. The terminal emulator is then responsible for interpreting that and resetting the colors appropriately. This is why I suspect this might not be a ripgrep problem. (If there were something wrong with the ANSI reset escape, then it would have an immediate and wide impact on almost all users.)</p>
<p>In any case, it could be a while before I open up my Windows machine to test this. If I can&#x27;t reproduce it, then someone else will have to investigate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No problem. It&#x27;s not a huge issue since typing <code>color</code> at a command prompt fixes things, so I have a workaround, but it&#x27;s rather annoying.</p>

<p>To reset colors to their defaults, use ESC[39;49m (not supported on some terminals), or reset all attributes with ESC[0m.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm. Apparently, Windows terminal windows don&#x27;t handle ANSI escape codes natively; if I try in Python on my Windows machine, I get:</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;python
Python 2.7.14 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:34:40) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(u&#x27;\u001b[31mHello&#x27;)
[31mHello
&gt;&gt;&gt; print u&quot;\u001b[31mHelloWorld\u001b[0m&quot;
[31mHelloWorld[0m
</code></pre>
<p>From https://pypi.org/project/colorama/:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal text and cursor positioning) work under MS Windows.</p>
<p>ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal text and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on Windows, too, by wrapping stdout, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which would appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the appropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms, Colorama does nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So which library does ripgrep use on Windows to intercept ANSI escape sequences and get them to work properly?</p>

<p>Ah -- ok. How does this get enabled? If I search google for &quot;Windows 10&quot; &quot;VT emulation&quot; nothing seems to come up.</p>
