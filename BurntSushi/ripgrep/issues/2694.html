<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<pre><code>ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>dnf install ripgrep</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>Fedora Rawhide (40)</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>When running any ripgrep command on a clone of https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting, stderr will emit output</p>
<pre><code>./autotests/input/.gitignore: line 7: error parsing glob '/**/a?[a-z12!][]][!][:upper:]][^[=a=]]\?[\\incomplete?*': unclosed character class; missing ']'
./autotests/input/.gitignore: line 8: error parsing glob '!/**/a?[a-z][]][!][:upper:]][^[=a=]]\?[\\incomplete?*': unclosed character class; missing ']'
</code></pre>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>git clone https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/syntax-highlighting.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd syntax-highlighting</code></li>
<li><code>rg anything 2&gt;stderr.txt</code></li>
<li><code>cat stderr.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<pre><code>./autotests/input/.gitignore: line 7: error parsing glob '/**/a?[a-z12!][]][!][:upper:]][^[=a=]]\?[\\incomplete?*': unclosed character class; missing ']'
./autotests/input/.gitignore: line 8: error parsing glob '!/**/a?[a-z][]][!][:upper:]][^[=a=]]\?[\\incomplete?*': unclosed character class; missing ']'
</code></pre>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>&quot;Something else&quot; would be better, but to me it is not clear what the most appropriate behaviour is:</p>
<p>From what I can tell, ripgrep prints to stderr internal diagnostics about what it found in the specific <code>.gitignore</code> file. I can see these options to improve the user experience in this corner case:</p>
<p>a) don't print those diagnostics by default; it's not within the responsibilities of ripgrep to diagnose the content of .gitignore files. Possibly add an option to turn diagnostics on, to allow for trouble-shooting</p>
<p>b) expand the text of the emitted diagnostic which clarifies that the origin is ripgrep itself - when running without redirection, that is not immediately obvious. Example: &quot;rg: configuring search with ./autotests/input/.gitignore: line 7: ...&quot;</p>
<p>FWIW, I believe the above .gitignore patterns are exactly as intended, as they seem to act as input into a test, not as &quot;meaningful&quot; .gitignore files. To that extent, here, that is a very fringe corner case. There may be other instances where ripgrep may print.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You can use <code>--no-ignore-messages</code> to suppress that specific output without suppressing anything else. I don't think they should be suppressed by default because it could otherwise result in a silent failure to filter a search as one might expect.</p>
<p>I am fond of the idea of adding an <code>rg:</code> prefix to the error message, though, I suspect it should probably be added to all error messages.</p>
