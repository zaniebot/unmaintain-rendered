            <div class="timeline-body"><h2>Current behavior</h2>
<p>When <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> refers to a nonexistent file, this is the warning that is currently printed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/ripgreprc rg 'search regex'
/Users/roryokane/.config/ripgreprc: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<h2>Proposed improvement</h2>
<p>The error message I’d prefer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/ripgreprc rg 'search regex'
Problem reading the config file specified in RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH:
/Users/roryokane/.config/ripgreprc: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>I wish I could fit the phrase “the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH environment variable” in that first line, but I couldn’t think of a wording that wouldn’t make the error distractingly long when the user doesn’t want to fix that warning soon, which might happen occasionally.</p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>This would be especially useful for those who have set <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> in their shell’s config, and have recently copied their shell config to a new computer. They may not remember that <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> is set.</p>
<p>To illustrate, here’s how the current error message looks in that case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell"># somewhere in my shell config
export RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/ripgreprc
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rg 'search regex'
/Users/roryokane/.config/ripgreprc: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>When I first saw that error, I assumed that ripgrep looked for that file by default, and I was surprised that it was so verbose about a config file not existing. It took me some searching to realize that <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> was involved. After that, I solved the problem by copying my config file to the new computer.</p>
