            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am running Ubuntu on WSL2 and installing packages with HOMEBREW.</p>
<p>When I am installing the latest ripgrep with 'brew install ripgrep', the installation is completed fine.</p>
<p>However when I am trying to run ripgrep I am getting the following error.
'home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/ripgrep: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error'</p>
<p>I am not facing issues when I am installing other packages like 'midnight commander'</p>
<p>I am not sure what am I missing here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't a problem with ripgrep. It's a problem with your environment/configuration or installation method. Sadly, I am not familiar with Homebrew, Ubuntu or WSL, so I can't help you. But this is definitely the wrong place to get help for this particular issue.</p>
