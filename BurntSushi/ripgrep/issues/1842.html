            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As of version 12.1.1, if the <code>--no-heading</code> option is used then a <code>:</code> will be used to separate paths, lines, columns (if the <code>--column</code> option is used) and matches. Is it possible to customize those characters individually?</p>
<p>For example I&#x27;d like to use a <code>@</code> between paths and lines, the default <code>:</code> between lines and columns and a space between columns and matches.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m new to ripgrep, I&#x27;ve read the manual but I haven&#x27;t found anything about it so I assume this behaviour is not currently supported?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is no way to customize it. But the underlying library does support customizing it: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/7923d252285d78b023a237d669d741dfa210ff86/crates/core/args.rs#L789-L790</p>
<p>I think I would be OK with a PR that adds two flags, one each for customizing the match and context separators for fields emitted in each case.</p>
<p>As a hint, you&#x27;ll want to use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/7923d252285d78b023a237d669d741dfa210ff86/crates/core/args.rs#L1025"><code>cli::unescape_os</code></a> to extract out the separator from the CLI argument.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m also keen to have this feature, and my use-case is to make sure that the file path and line number are presented in the terminal in a way that can be ctrl+left clicked such that they will open to that line in VSCode.</p>
<p>I use the following settings:</p>
<pre><code>--max-columns=150
--max-columns-preview
--smart-case
--search-zip
--color=auto
--no-heading
--no-messages
--trim
</code></pre>
<p>And the output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg use
src/entries.rs:186:use super::*;
src/entries.rs:187:use std::io::Cursor;
src/entries.rs:188:use test_case::test_case;
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, the fact that there is no space after the 2nd colon on each line makes it such that VSCode won&#x27;t open the file at that line, instead it will initiate a search that yields nothing. Having a space there makes this work 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Removing <code>--trim</code> isn&#x27;t a solution.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ve forked the repo and started taking a preliminary look. If I manually change line 789 of <code>ripgrep/crates/core/args.rs</code> to be a space instead of a colon, it doesn&#x27;t quite do what I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d like to be able to keep the colon between the path and the line number, but have a space between the line number and the match.</p>
<p>Would you be open to accepting a PR that changes the <code>printer</code> crate to allow this?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@samwho Possibly. It depends on if there are any performance problems created by accepting multiple bytes vs one byte. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve touched that code, but my instinct is that there shouldn&#x27;t be.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@samwho did you come up with a solution? I have the same problem with VSCode link detection, and <code>--field-match-separator &quot; &quot;</code> doesn&#x27;t quite do what I want, as I lose the line number when clicking a link.</p>
