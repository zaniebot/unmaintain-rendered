            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 0.8.1
-SIMD -AVX</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Archlinux</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Execute rg as super user on root directory.
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cd /
rg azefdz
</code></pre>
<p>This produces the following output</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">thread '&lt;unnamed&gt;' panicked at 'slice index starts at 234 but ends at 3', src/libcore/slice/mod.rs:756:5
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
[1]    3419 segmentation fault (core dumped)  rg azefdz
</code></pre>
<p>It segfaults with any string though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Could you please follow the instructions in the error message you got to get a backtrace?</p>
<p>If the backtrace doesn't contain names, then please checkout the ripgrep repo and build it from source by running <code>cargo build --release</code>. Then retry via the binary at <code>target/release/rg</code>. This binary should have debug symbols enabled, which will give a better backtrace.</p>
<p>I can't reproduce the problem, so you'll have to debug this. Playing with flags like <code>--no-mmap</code> and <code>--threads 1</code> might help, and running ripgrep under <code>strace</code> might help too.</p>
<p>Note that in general, running a privileged process that reads every file on disk, including those found in <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code>, is probably a bad idea. On my system, ripgrep makes its way through part of the system, but ends up hanging. <code>grep</code> behaves the same. If I ignore the <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> directories, then both ripgrep and grep behave as expected.</p>
