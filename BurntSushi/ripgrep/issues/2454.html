            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ignore are you using?
<p>0.4.20</p>
What operating system are you using ignore on?
<p>Windows</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>This one is a bit of an edge case, but this pattern is used by Unreal and I suspect is valid. When excluding <em>all</em> files, but <em>not</em> directories, and subsequently whitelisting specific file types, ignored folders seem to be traversed and files which should be otherwise ignored, are not.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m building a tool to automate robocopying Unreal&#x27;s source between git and perforce; and while <code>ignore</code> seems to have largely correct output (better than any other library I&#x27;ve tried in any language), this particular bug is blocking me at the moment.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>If I have a directory containing a <code>.gitignore</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code># Ignore all files by default, but scan all directories
*
!*/

# Text files
!*.txt

# Ignore logs
/Logs/
</code></pre>
<p>And the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>A.txt
B.txt
C.txt
Logs\A.txt
Logs\B.txt
Logs\C.txt
Logs\Subfolder\A.txt
Logs\Subfolder\B.txt
Logs\Subfolder\C.txt
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<p><code>ignore</code> will include all <code>*.txt</code> files within <code>/Logs/</code> when it should not.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p><code>ignore</code> should not include all <code>*.txt</code> files within <code>/Logs/</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you&#x27;re using the library directly, then you <em>must</em> provide a program that reproduces the problem. Otherwise, how can I fix it? For example, using ripgrep, your example works just as I would expect:</p>
<pre><code>$ tree
.
├── A.txt
├── B.txt
├── C.txt
└── Logs
    ├── A.txt
    ├── B.txt
    ├── C.txt
    └── Subfolder
        ├── A.txt
        ├── B.txt
        └── C.txt
$ cat .gitignore
# Ignore all files by default, but scan all directories
*
!*/

# Text files
!*.txt

# Ignore logs
/Logs/
$ rg --files
A.txt
B.txt
C.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Which is what looks correct to me. Your ignore file whitelists all <code>*.txt</code> files, so that explains the <code>{A,B,C}.txt</code> in the results. But ignores <code>/Logs/</code>, which is correctly ignored here.</p>

<p>My apologies, the issue template didn&#x27;t mention that, and I didn&#x27;t want to cut down my program if I didn&#x27;t have to (I thought this may be reproducible with ripgrep - and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t think to test it - since it isn&#x27;t I suspect it&#x27;s PEBKAC but let&#x27;s see). 🙂</p>

<p>You can simply do cargo run and check the directory for added.txt/removed.txt</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah okay, I see now that that <code>add_ignore</code> doesn&#x27;t set the root path of <code>GitignoreBuilder</code> using the existing <code>WalkBuilder</code> root. Which makes sense since as it&#x27;s intended for global ignores which totally flew over my head for whatever reason. This may be out of scope for the library then, I naively assumed this worked something like filters, and would let me use a given <code>.gitignore</code> as if it was already in a given directory.</p>
<p>My apologies! I&#x27;ll close this for now, and use a <code>.gitignore</code> in both source and output instead. I think this would be a rather interesting feature though, as I&#x27;ve seen a few people using <code>filters</code> to this effect - but since those act like a &quot;.gitallow&quot; I can&#x27;t use them here without modifying the source ignore files.</p>
