<p>0.10.0</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>As debian package from the official debian buster repository.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Debian Linux (Buster)</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>ripgrep supports the type <code>java</code>, but it only includes <code>*.java</code> and <code>*.jsp</code>. However, properties for java files are usually stored in <code>*.properties</code> files. (https://beyondgrep.com/)[ack-grep] also supports a <code>--java</code> option, which includes this. ripgrep currently has no support for <code>*.properties</code> files at all. This should be changed and I think included in the <code>java</code> type.
See the bottom of https://beyondgrep.com/documentation/ for the type supported by ack-grep.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the issue. Generally, I don't keep issues for file types open because they are typically trivial additions. Please feel free to submit a PR with the necessary changes to <code>ignore/src/types.rs</code>: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/308819fb1fd47ad8a27ab82401eca69f24971ca0/ignore/src/types.rs#L159</p>
<p>As a work-around to the next release, you can add to ripgrep's built-in file types. See the guide: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-file-types</p>
