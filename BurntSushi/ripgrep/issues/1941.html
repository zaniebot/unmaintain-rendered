            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>% rg --version
ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Arch Linux</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Arch Linux</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>Searching in a folder that contains files/folders that I don&#x27;t have permissions to causes the errors to mix up with the results.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>You need to search in a folder with some files that you can&#x27;t access (like /etc), that also contains some files that match your search.</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<pre><code>% rg pcp /etc 
/etc/shadow: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/gshadow: Permission denied (os error /etc/passwd
39:pcp:x:959:959:Performance Co-Pilot:/var/lib/pcp:/usr/bin/nologin
13)

/etc/shadow-/etc/group
72:pcp:x:959:
: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/gshadow-: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/named.conf: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/libaudit.conf: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/sudoers.pacnew: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/shadow.pacnew: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/crypttab: Permission denied (os error 13)
</code></pre>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>errors should likely be sent to the main thread for printing so they are in-order:</p>
<pre><code>% rg pcp /etc 
/etc/shadow: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/gshadow: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/passwd
39:pcp:x:959:959:Performance Co-Pilot:/var/lib/pcp:/usr/bin/nologin

/etc/group
72:pcp:x:959:
/etc/shadow-: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/gshadow-: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/named.conf: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/libaudit.conf: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/sudoers.pacnew: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/shadow.pacnew: Permission denied (os error 13)
/etc/crypttab: Permission denied (os error 13)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmm yes, I can indeed reproduce this. A quick work-around is to disable parallelism with <code>-j1</code>.</p>
<p>In terms of fixing this, it isn&#x27;t quite as simple as &quot;send errors to the main thread.&quot; Errors are (or should be) already bubbled up to the top-level routines in <code>crates/core/main.rs</code> and printed with <code>err_message!</code>. The main problem here is that we prevent interleaving on stdout by acquiring the std&#x27;s stdout lock at a fairly low layer of abstraction (down inside of <code>termcolor</code>). That is, printing is itself done on different threads. Printing isn&#x27;t done by the main thread. We might be able to &quot;fake&quot; it by just acquiring that same lock in <code>main.rs</code> when printing an error message. It&#x27;s a bit weird because it&#x27;s a glorious violation of abstraction, but I just tried it and it does appear to resolve the issue. I&#x27;ll noodle on this a little bit.</p>
