<p>With specific types of input files, I&#x27;m seeing rg -Ff return no matches in cases where it should return a match.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?

</code></pre>
<p>corpus is a single line containing the prefix from the patterns file:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat corpus 
1.208.0.0/12
</code></pre>
<p>this is expected to produce a match, but does not:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -Ff patterns corpus 
(no matches)
</code></pre>
<p>treating patterns as non fixed string finds a match:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg -f patterns corpus 
1:1.208.0.0/12
</code></pre>
<p>and strangely, removing a single line from patterns will also find a match:</p>
<pre><code>$ head -n 39 patterns &gt; fewerpatterns
$ rg -Ff fewerpatterns corpus 
1:1.208.0.0/12
</code></pre>
<p>I haven&#x27;t dug in enough to see if this purely a result of 39 vs 40 lines, or if it&#x27;s 39 vs 40 lines and the size of the &#x27;1.208.0.0/12&#x27; string, but I do seem to be crossing some boundary into buggy behavior with this specific test.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah thanks for this bug report! Literal optimizations are going to be the death me. I introduced this regression when I added an optimization for the <code>-F</code> flag to bypass the regex engine entirely and use Aho-Corasick. There are a number of cases where Aho-Corasick can&#x27;t be used directly, which I thought I had handled, but one slipped by: ripgrep escapes patterns when the <code>-F</code> flag is set before passing them down to the matcher, and those same escaped patterns were being handed to the Aho-Corasick builder directly. So you were <em>actually</em> searching for the literal <code>1\.208\.0\.0/12</code>, which is obviously wrong.</p>
<p>The offending line of code is here, which also explains why <code>40</code> was a magic number: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/bc37c32717301abf26e5aecc942688d2ddd63692/grep-regex/src/matcher.rs#L75</p>
<p>(Specifically, the regex engine, currently, can often search for a small number of literals more quickly than Aho-Corasick, so we were diverting to the regex engine for a smaller number of literals, in which case, using escaped literals is correct.)</p>
<p>This is basically one giant mess because all of this should be pushed down into the regex engine, but there&#x27;s a lot of refactoring work that needs to be done before that can happen. So I tried to paper over it at a higher level and got bit here.</p>
<p>Anyway, this should be fixed on master. I&#x27;m going to see about getting a patch release out soon.</p>
