            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I recently ran into an issue where rg doesn&#x27;t look in all directories.</p>
<pre><code>$ rg &#x27;libthrift-0.5.0&#x27; &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common&#x27;
... (didn&#x27;t find it)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ rg &#x27;libthrift-0.5.0&#x27; &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common/images&#x27;
... (found it)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought maybe the name &quot;images&quot; was special, but I didn&#x27;t find anything promising in the rg repository.</p>
<p>Sorry for the sort of crummy bug report.  I looked at the permissions for the &quot;images&quot; directory that it doesn&#x27;t want to search recursively, and it doesn&#x27;t look weird.  Happy to include any other information, but I didn&#x27;t really know what to say.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mosesn The first sentence of the README says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern while <strong>respecting your gitignore rules.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your bug report doesn&#x27;t mention anything about your gitignore rules, so I can&#x27;t tell whether you&#x27;ve account for that or not.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>good question–it&#x27;s not ignored according to git</p>
<pre><code>$ git check-ignore &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common/images&#x27;; echo $?
1
</code></pre>
<p>but when I output the debug information, it seems to think it&#x27;s ignored</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG:ignore::walk: ignoring src/java/com/twitter/search/common/images: Ignore(IgnoreMatch(Gitignore(Glob { from: Some(&quot;/Users/mnakamura/workspace/sources/2/.gitignore&quot;), original: &quot;images&quot;, actual: &quot;**/images&quot;, is_whitelist: false, is_only_dir: false })))
</code></pre>
<p>I looked in the .gitignore file, and it does include &quot;images&quot;.  And indeed, when I turn on --no-index, it seems to be ignored.</p>
<pre><code>$ git check-ignore --verbose --no-index &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common/images&#x27;; echo $?
.gitignore:128:images	src/java/com/twitter/search/common/images
0
</code></pre>
<p>With that said, now that it&#x27;s in the index, it&#x27;s no longer subject to .gitignore, according to git.  So I would expect it to be inspected by rg.  Should I close this ticket and file a feature request to also search files that are in .gitignore, but also in the git index?</p>

<p>It has been requested but it&#x27;s not happening. The recommended work-around is to explicitly whitelist files that are in your <code>.gitignore</code> but you still want to search. You can do that in either a <code>.gitignore</code> or a <code>.ignore</code> file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If anyone else is curious, I did some follow-up research in how other tools handle this.</p>
<p>git grep looks in the index directly, so it gets this for free.</p>
<pre><code>$ git grep &#x27;libthrift-0.5.0&#x27; &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common&#x27;
(FINDS IT)
</code></pre>
<p>if you tell it to not use the index but to use gitignore, it doesn&#x27;t find it.</p>
<pre><code>$ git grep --exclude-standard --no-index &#x27;libthrift-0.5.0&#x27; &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common&#x27;
(DOESN&#x27;T FIND IT)
</code></pre>
<p>If you search using ag, it does find it (???)</p>
<pre><code>$ ag &#x27;libthrift-0.5.0&#x27; src/java/com/twitter/search/common
(FINDS IT)
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you search using ag from the root of the repository, and then grep for the directory, it&#x27;s not there.</p>
<pre><code>$ ag &#x27;libthrift-0.5.0&#x27; | grep &#x27;src/java/com/twitter/search/common&#x27;; echo $?
1
</code></pre>
<p>So it seems like ag only looks for .gitignore files in the directories you specify for them to search.</p>
<p>I think rg handles this the right way–it&#x27;s quite confusing that ag sees different results depending upon which directory you search from.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@mosesn Yeah, <code>git grep</code> has one-up on us here. With respect to <code>ag</code>, its <code>gitignore</code> support is incredibly buggy. I say that because when I was first building ripgrep, I&#x27;d often use <code>ag</code> as my standard of correctness. But I soon realized that this was folly, because it gets a lot of the <code>gitignore</code> rules wrong. (The irony is that I say that in an issue that highlights what&#x27;s most reasonably considered a <code>wontfix</code> bug in ripgrep on the very same functionality! :rofl:)</p>
<p>There are a couple other tools that claim to respect gitignores such as <code>pt</code> and <code>sift</code>, which each have their own independent implementation.</p>
