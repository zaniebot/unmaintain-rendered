            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@hgoscenski Yeah, that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s probably too big to email, but if you upload it somewhere (that you can then delete after I download) and email me the link, then I can do that. I will make sure to delete whatever you give me before closing this issue. My email is on this page: https://blog.burntsushi.net/about/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice find! I was able to reproduce this in a more emphatic way on the open subtitle data set:</p>
<pre><code>$ time rg -v &#x27;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en | wc -l
32721743
real    0m19.855s
user    0m9.368s
sys     0m30.039s
$ time egrep -v &#x27;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en | wc -l
32721743
real    0m2.679s
user    0m2.817s
sys     0m1.060s
</code></pre>
<p>If we suppress output and just count the matches, then all is well in the world:</p>
<pre><code>$ time rg -cv &#x27;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en
32721743
real    0m0.562s
user    0m0.517s
sys     0m0.044s
$ time egrep -cv &#x27;Sherlock Holmes&#x27; OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en
32721743
real    0m0.872s
user    0m0.751s
sys     0m0.120s
</code></pre>
<p>So this is seemingly a performance bug in the printer? Well, if that were true, then <code>rg .</code> should be just as slow:</p>
<pre><code>$ time egrep . OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en | wc -l
32722360
real    0m3.158s
user    0m3.332s
sys     0m1.098s
$ time rg . OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en | wc -l
32722360
real    0m25.141s
user    0m12.447s
sys     0m35.610s
</code></pre>
<p>... yikes. That&#x27;s no good. This is specifically a case that I tested when initially building ripgrep. My guess is that there is a regression lurking somewhere. So, I did some time travel. It turns out that ripgrep 0.2.9 doesn&#x27;t have this regression (so my recollection is still in tact, it seems), but ripgrep 0.3.0 does:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --version
ripgrep 0.2.9
$ time rg . OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en | wc -l
32722360
real    0m3.054s
user    0m3.393s
sys     0m0.769s

$ rg --version
ripgrep 0.3.0
$ time rg . OpenSubtitles2016.raw.sample.en | wc -l
32722360
real    0m25.367s
user    0m11.428s
sys     0m37.080s
</code></pre>
<p>OK, so bisecting between these two tags, it appears that commit e8a30cb8934106e63f9d0938c547e535acb7b888 introduced the regression. This makes sense to an extent, since this is the commit that re-worked colored output and tty handling. My suspicion at this point is that I somehow disabled buffered writing in the single threaded case.</p>
<p>Now that I have an idea of what the bug is, I&#x27;m looking more closely on master. Indeed, this is how we get the stdout handle:</p>
<pre><code>    pub fn stdout(&amp;self) -&gt; termcolor::StandardStream {
        termcolor::StandardStream::stdout(self.color_choice)
    }
</code></pre>
<p>All this does is use <code>io::Stdout</code> internally on Unix, which isn&#x27;t buffered at all.</p>
<p>Sigh. This is a bad bug. I am really surprised that this hasn&#x27;t been caught. I suppose this somewhat validates the assumption that ripgrep&#x27;s output is often much much smaller than what it searches.</p>
<p>Technically, this bug is also present in the multithreaded searcher, but is less pronounced because the multithreaded searcher buffers the entire output of each file in memory before printing it.</p>
<p>This will be interesting to fix because of colors... Brainstorming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling the ANSI color escapes with a normal buffer writer is simple. Windows is the problem. So we could just fix this for ANSI escapes.</li>
<li>Add a new buffered writer API to wincolor that probably uses the <code>BufferWriter</code> internally. This is probably the best route to go.</li>
</ul>
