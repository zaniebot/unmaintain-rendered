Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>When .git/ does not exist, .gitignore is not used. I am unsure whether is this intentional behavior as this line specifically checks for the existence of the folder:
https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/09139721047b1cda6ad88dbf89dc5fa74c66a3a2/ignore/src/dir.rs#L200</p>
<p>I ran across this because I have my home directory in version control and access it by setting GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE.</p>
<p>I would expect that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of .gitignore does not depend on existence of .git/
-or-</li>
<li>The directory used to verify the existence of git is read from GIT_DIR if it is defined.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can work around this easily but wanted to check if it would be considered a bug.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<pre><code>mkdir rgtest
cd rgtest
mkdir a
echo &quot;pattern&quot; &gt; a/test.txt
echo &quot;/a/&quot; &gt; .gitignore
rg pattern # pattern found

mkdir .git
rg pattern # pattern not found

rmdir .git
export GIT_WORK_TREE=&quot;$HOME/rgtest&quot;
export GIT_DIR=&quot;$HOME/rgtest/.nonstandardname&quot;
git init
rg pattern # pattern found (i would expect this to be ignored)
</code></pre>

<p>It is definitely intentional that <code>.gitignore</code> is not respected when ripgrep does not detect a git repository.</p>
<p>It seems possible for ripgrep to respect <code>GIT_DIR</code>, and it might not be particularly hard, but ultimately, ripgrep isn&#x27;t actually <code>git</code>. The <code>git</code> command has the luxury of operating on exactly one repository for any given invocation, but ripgrep does not. Moreover, ripgrep uses the <code>.git</code> directory to tell when it is has reached the &quot;root&quot; of a git repository, which is how ripgrep knows not to apply <code>.gitignore</code> files from a parent git repository to any repositories that might appear in sub-directories. <code>GIT_DIR</code> effectively breaks that assumption. So it&#x27;s not quite clear to me how exactly ripgrep should respect <code>GIT_DIR</code>. (And <code>GIT_WORK_TREE</code> does not seem relevant, as I understand it.)</p>
<p>Other than creating a dummy <code>.git</code> directory (or file), another alternative is to simply symlink <code>.gitignore</code> to <code>.rgignore</code> (or <code>.ignore</code>), and ripgrep should pick that up.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on this choice?</p>
<p>I noticed a few months ago that ripgrep completely broke for me with respect to .gitignore use and never understood why until today.</p>
<p>(I discovered that the correct solution was to switch to .ignore so my workflow is working again now, I&#x27;m just curious in the reasoning behind splitting the functionality into two files.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep has always supported both <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.ignore</code>. They both exist because they aren&#x27;t always the same. i.e., Just because a file is in your gitignore doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t want to search it, and just because a file is not in gitignore doesn&#x27;t mean you do want to search it. Plus, not everything you might want to search is in a git repo.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Because <code>.gitignore</code> only applies to git repositories.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW it feels like at least some time ago rg was always respecting <code>.gitignore</code>, and that worked excellent for my use case (see below). But now in 11.0 it&#x27;s ignored and kinda &quot;breaks&quot; rg since each invocation goes and searches multiple gigabytes of stuff.</p>
<p>My use case: we have a repository that can either be cloned from Mercurial or from Git. And normal workflow is to use Mercurial. So the repo has <em>both</em> <code>.hgignore</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> files at the root, however typical usage ends up <em>without</em> a <code>.git</code> folder. However I&#x27;d still very much like rg to use the file! Alternatively, if rg would support <code>.hgignore</code> that would work too of course, but my impression is that this ain&#x27;t going to happen.</p>

<p>Indeed it was. Commit https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/e65ca21a6cebceb9ba79fcd164da24478cc01fb0 changed that by fixing #934.</p>

<p>Sometimes folks rely on bugs accidentally and then get bitten when the bug gets fixed. <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">This is just part of software evolution</a> and there are plenty of trivial work-arounds available to you.</p>

<p>There are several things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an empty <code>.git</code> directory (or even just a file) at the root of the repo.</li>
<li>Symlink your <code>.gitignore</code> to a <code>.ignore</code> or <code>.rgignore</code>.</li>
<li>Explicitly copy the rules from the <code>.gitignore</code> to a <code>.ignore</code> or <code>.rgignore</code>.</li>
<li>Use ripgrep&#x27;s <code>--ignore-file</code> flag to explicitly specify the <code>.gitignore</code> file as an ignore file that it should use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Indeed, it&#x27;s unlikely. See #6.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>yeah I understand that I came to rely on a peculiarity that could have been considered a bug. Some of the workarounds are not without downsides though -- e.g. an empty <code>.git</code> folder makes various other tools (e.g. Visual Studio) do &quot;I detected a broken git folder for you!&quot; prompts. Symlinks don&#x27;t work that well on Windows, etc.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go with manual <code>.rgignore</code> file I guess</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I think <code>rg</code> respecting the environment variables, at least insofar whether to look for <code>.gitignore</code> file, would be quite useful. I&#x27;m using a tool called <code>yadm</code> for dotfile management, and it provides a <code>yadm env</code> command that simply drops you into a shell with the appropriate environment variables to fool most tools into thinking your home folder is actually a git repo.</p>
<p>This works well enough with my editor, <code>tig</code>, <code>git</code>, etc. but <code>rg</code> starts searching everything in the home folder instead, which makes it hard to find things.</p>
<p>As to how this should be implemented, I&#x27;m not really familiar with how ripgrep is implemented; is it possible to use something like the appropriate <code>libgit2</code> <a href="https://libgit2.org/libgit2/#HEAD/group/ignore/git_ignore_path_is_ignored">API</a> to determine whether a file is ignored?</p>

<p>This is the crux of this issue, in addition to the UX. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think your comment really addresses any of the points I raised above. I&#x27;d suggest picking one of my suggested work arounds above.</p>

<p>No. That&#x27;s not how ripgrep works.</p>
