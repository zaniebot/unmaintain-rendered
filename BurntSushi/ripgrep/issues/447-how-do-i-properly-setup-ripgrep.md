# How do I properly setup ripgrep?

---

_@v-vincere_

Hey so I am using Atom and the package goto-defintion and it has a performance mode that depends on ripgrep. I downloaded ripgrep and have rg.exe. Ripgrep works in the command prompt but I cam't get it to work in atom. I have added the environment PATH to where rg.exe is located but I am still facing issues with using it within atom. I get "Please instsall ripgrep first" what should I do to remedy this situation? Thanks

It seems like this is a question for the Atom or goto-definition people, isn't it? If rg works in the command prompt and you have your PATH set correctly, then that's pretty much the extent of installing rg.

Okay thanks for the prompt response, I will talk with them.
