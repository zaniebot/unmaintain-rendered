            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed it does. It uses the same flag as grep does:</p>
<pre><code>    -F, --fixed-strings        Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of
                               a regular expression.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>-F</code> should <em>never</em> be used for performance reasons. Its only use (at the moment) is as a convenience to avoid the need to escape regex meta characters. Eventually, I'd like to support what grep does, which is match any one of a number of literals separated by new lines (which should emerge fairly naturally out of #7).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh geeze. When I saw -Q didn't work, I looked at the list of flags, but apparently I only looked at the &quot;Less common options&quot; section and ignored the top, thinking that the top was a summary and the longer descriptions beneath had all the flags. But now that I've actually read the section header it's obvious that it's not describing the most common options.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, if you have any suggestions on how to make the docs clearer, I would be happy to hear them. I don't think --help is that great today, and I mostly intended the top section to be options that i thought were either more common or somehow more important, but the categorization is something i came up with willy nilly. Maybe it should have more sections? Or one big one?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Honestly, I think the best solution would be to have a manpage. The problem with <code>rg --help</code> is that it's not paged, so you have to scroll up to find what you want, which leads to the problem I had of not even reading the top. But manpages are paged by default, so you start with the top, which should make the most common options much more visible.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There is a man page. :-)</p>
<p>In #189, it was suggested to show less on <code>--help</code>, but that has downsides too.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes it does. It uses the standard <code>-F</code> flag that grep uses.</p>

is for convenience since you don't need to worry about escaping regex meta

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You should probably stop advertising any compatibility with ag/ack if you don't make an effort to match their arguments.... Why copy from grep when you advertise copying from ag/ack? It makes no sense, and ripgrep is harder to use because of it.</p>
<p>It's also very difficult to find in the man because you don't use 'literal', 'quote', 'exact', or any other terminology people are likely to use. &quot;Fixed strings&quot; is a terrible phrase that can mean anything. What is a non fixed string?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@duane Can you please point me to the place where ripgrep advertises &quot;compatibility with ag/ack&quot; so that I can fix it? No such promise is intended. No such promise for grep is intended either. ripgrep does take inspiration from those tools though.</p>
<p>Documentation can always be improved. I'm not perfect.</p>

<p>&quot;literal&quot; is there: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/doc/rg.1#L61 --- It's also in the <code>--help</code> output.</p>
<p>FWIW, the <code>-F/--fixed-strings</code> flag is from grep. I'd say people are likely to just try <code>-F</code> and hope it works.</p>

<p>Re: ack and ag, it's not clear why this is undesirable—they have a much more approachable interface, and I would be happy to explain why if you indicate interest.</p>

<p>What is inaccurate about it...?</p>
<pre><code>% rg --help | rg -C2 literal

            Treat the pattern as a literal string instead of a regular expression. When
            this flag is used, special regular expression meta characters such as .(){}*+
            do not need to be escaped.
