Thoughts on adding a sort option when sending output to a non-terminal? (It looks like the results do get sorted when it detects output is going to a terminal.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>ripgrep has never done any sorting of any kind.</p>
<p>If you run ripgrep with <code>-j1</code>, then it will disable parallelism and should
result in deterministic output.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This appears to be a dupe of #263.</p>
<p>Notably, there&#x27;s no regression here because ripgrep has <em>never</em> done sorting.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what ttys have to do with sorting. :-/ @nerdrew Perhaps you could clarify in #263.</p>
