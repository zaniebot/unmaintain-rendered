            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No. ripgrep doesn't even expose a way to search file paths with a regex at all. The only way to match on file paths is with globs. If you want regexes, you need to use pipelines, e.g., <code>rg --files | rg 'foo\w+'</code>.</p>
<p>I don't think I can suggest a work around because the desired semantics aren't clear. What problem are you trying to solve? What is your input? What's your desired output?</p>

<p>I'm using ripgrep to implement file search in my app. I want the search results to include files if name OR content matches the pattern.</p>
<p>I can use your suggestion to solve the problem, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a more direct built in solution.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zachliu <code>rg content-pattern | rg file-pattern</code> will get you pretty close. Or just do <code>rg -g 'file-glob-pattern' content-pattern</code>.</p>
