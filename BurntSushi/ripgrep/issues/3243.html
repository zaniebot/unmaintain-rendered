<p>This is a kinda random/niche request, though ideally should be rather trivial to add: it would be nice if there were linkable headings for each of the different options (in programs which support this), as there may be times when it's desireable to send a link to a specific option in a man page to someone, when using a website like the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/rg.1">arch linux man pages</a> which support links to headings.</p>
<p>An example of another man page which does this is <code>fd</code>. although I'm not <em>too</em> familiar with the man page syntax, however I <em>believe</em> the correct way to do this is to use <code>.TP</code>, although <code>.IP</code> might be better as it allows you to set the tag/label?</p>
<p>example link to a specific option in fd (albeit the names is not the best and could break if a new option starting with the same word is added, but it's better than nothing): https://man.archlinux.org/man/fd.1#no~2</p>
