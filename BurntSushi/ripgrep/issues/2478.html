<p>13.0.0</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Binary download from releases.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Debian Bullseye</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>Ripgrep does not sanitize file match content before showing it in annotated output (colorized lines and match, which is the default mode of operation). While I agree matched lines should be passed unmodified as-is when output is piped to a program, it is very unconvenient up to the point of being dangerous when passed to the terminal. The problem is that the output cannot be easily handled in a safe manner because it contains a mixture of control characters from the grepped file and ripgrep. I propose ripgrep should strip all control characters (and unprintable, while at it) from the match column before applying colors, whenever a terminal is attached to the output.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Attached is a file
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/files/11071721/controlchars.txt">controlchars.txt</a>
which will hide a line when grepped with</p>
<p><code>rg &quot;&quot; controlchars.txt</code></p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>Sabotaged output:</p>
<pre><code>1:one
2:three
</code></pre>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Sanitized output:</p>
<pre><code>1:one
2:two
3:three

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure how practical this is, and I doubt I'll work on it any time soon. I'm also skeptical of your characterization of it being dangerous. Is <code>cat file</code> dangerous? How many tools dump the contents of an arbitrary file without sanitizing it?</p>
<p>I'd be open to considering a PR fixing this, but I don't think it will be a simple change.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes! <code>cat file</code> is indeed dangerous if the passed file is of untrusted origin. Not beyond a mild annoyance on its own, but combined with flaws in terminal emulators it <a href="https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/May/33">can lead to RCE</a>. I can think of many use-cases where rg is fed untrusted files, like logfiles or whole filesystems. The beauty of ripgrep is that it is insanely fast reading files. Absolutely feasible to just go to / and <code>rg --one-file-system</code>.</p>
<p>Currently, input files can be sanitized using a <code>--pre</code> processor, but that greatly impacts speed and distorts reported match locations. Also, it is unnecessary to sanitize the entire input. Output can be sanitized, too, with some <code>awk</code> magic, but not (easily) without losing colored matches (and at that point, there is no way to tell if colors came from ripgrep or the grepped file).</p>
<p>The perfect place to sanitize would be right between &quot;found a matching line&quot; and &quot;output the match&quot;, and that's inside ripgrep ;-) I can totally understand this isn't a priority, though. Since you're open for a PR, I might give it a try, but not very soon either. I guess a new option <code>--safe-output</code> would be best, removing all non-printable characters from output?</p>

<p>IMO, a flag <code>--safe-output</code> may cause some confusion. One could expect to get output with literal control chars/escape sequences, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cat controlchars.txt | sed $'s/\e/\\\\E/g'
one
two
\E[1A\E[999D\E[2C\E[Kthree
</code></pre>
<p>Something like <code>--strip-xxxxx</code> may be clearer, but I'm not sure what would be the best expression (<code>xxxxx</code>) because we shouldn't strip all control characters.</p>

<p>It may be too much. See this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ # By default:
$ echo -e &quot;lorem\tipsum&quot; | rg 'lorem'
lorem	ipsum
$ # Stripping all control characters:
$ echo -e &quot;lorem\tipsum&quot; | rg 'lorem' | tr -d '[:cntrl:]'
loremipsum

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You're right, the full list of unprintables is too much of a filter. Also, terminal detection downpipe was a bad idea, strike that. If it's an option, it should always behave the same.</p>

<p>From those I can think of a whitelist of characters with known good effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>LINE FEED <em>if matched, it is probably intended to be output as well</em></li>
<li>CARRIAGE RETURN <em>keep windows linefeeds alive</em></li>
<li>HORIZONTAL TAB</li>
</ul>
<p>And a blacklist of characters with likely unintended effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>BACKSPACE</li>
<li>ESCAPE</li>
<li>RUBOUT (DELETE) <em>I actually don't know if this one is interpreted by any terminal</em></li>
<li>BELL (Beep)</li>
<li>NULL
<em>and from this <a href="https://serverfault.com/a/189551/38826">helpful comment</a>:</em></li>
<li>SHIFT OUT</li>
<li>SHIFT IN</li>
<li>DEVICE CONTROL 3 (XOFF)</li>
</ul>
<p>The blacklist may be extended with all characters of no known good effects (not displayed = not useful, can only do harm).</p>
<p>It's quite difficult to make either a complete whitelist or blacklist fit for all purposes and use-cases.</p>
<p>After all, maybe a minimalist approach is best:</p>
<p><code>--strip-escape</code></p>
<p>Everything else can be filtered downpipe externally with other tools. But rg <em>adds</em> escape sequences for colors and those use only ESCAPE afaik. So the one character which has to be stripped at minimum would be ESC?</p>
<p>In addition, a second option for convenience could be</p>
<p><code>--strip-uncommon</code></p>
<p>which would apply the above whitelist (easiest and safest route).</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that filtering any of these is not conflicting with UTF-8 because UTF-8 is 128+ for all its bytes. Other encodings, most notable UTF-16, have to be researched. How are they printed to the terminal? Are control characters passed through in other encodings at all? How to deal with them?</p>

<p>How do you see a new flag <code>--strip-xxxxx</code> interact with <code>--passthru</code>? Only stripping chars in matched lines or in the entire document (since <code>--passthru</code> returns all lines, matched or not)?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think we should not <em>strip</em> escape sequences but <em>replace</em> them with a safe form, like <code>less</code> does by default:</p>
<pre><code># by default — some words will be colorized
$ echo -e 'lorem\tipsum \e[31mdolor \e[32msit amet\e[0m' | rg 'lorem'
lorem   ipsum dolor sit amet
# with escape characters guarding enable
$ echo -e 'lorem\tipsum \e[31mdolor \e[32msit amet\e[0m' | rg --guard-escapes 'lorem'
lorem   ipsum \x1B31mdolor \x1B32msit amet\x1B0m
</code></pre>
<p>We may also want to colorize those escape sequences (like <code>\x1B</code>), maybe just with &quot;bold&quot; effect.</p>
