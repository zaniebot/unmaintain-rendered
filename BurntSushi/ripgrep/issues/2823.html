<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<p>13.0.0</p>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>brew install ripgrep</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>macOS 12.5.1</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>I'm trying to understand how <code>.gitignore</code> files are handled.</p>
<p>Let's say I have the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;cwd&gt;
├── .gitignore
└── deep
   ├── deep
   │  └── deeper
   │     └── bar.txt
   └── deeper
      └── foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And this is the content of my <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>deep/deeper
</code></pre>
<p>According to my understanding of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">spec</a> that pattern is relative to the directory where the <code>.gitignore</code> file exists in, so it should match <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep/deeper</code>, so I'd expect <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep/deeper/foo.txt</code> to get ignored.</p>
<p>Yet if I run this command while at the <code>&lt;cwd&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">rg deep --files
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following output, basically the <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep/deeper</code> directory wasn't ignored:</p>
<pre><code>deep/deep/deeper/bar.txt
deep/deeper/foo.txt
</code></pre>
<p>So I'm not quite understanding how that works in <code>ripgrep</code>, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>if we are checking for the relative paths of files and directories, relative to the directory where that <code>.gitignore</code> file was found in, which I think is what the spec intended for it to happen, then presumably <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep/deeper</code> would be ignored, and <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep/deeper/foo.txt</code> wouldn't be listed by the <code>rg</code> command I'm running, so that doesn't seem to be the case here. Possibly for good reasons, otherwise if we are ignoring for example <code>foo</code>, but then the user runs a search inside <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/foo</code>, <code>rg</code> wouldn't find anything, which is most probably not what the user wanted, although in this case I'm excluding a directory <em>inside</em> the directory I'm searching into, so perhaps that should still be excluded?</li>
<li>if we are matching the rules in the <code>.gitignore</code> file against relative paths that are relative to our root search directory, which in this case is <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep</code>, then presumably <code>&lt;cwd&gt;/deep/deep/deeper</code> should have been excluded, but it isn't, so that's not what's happening either.</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess the more specific questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are <code>.gitignore</code> files handled according to the spec?</li>
<li>If yes, then what strings is <code>ripgrep</code> actually trying to check if they are ignored by that <code>.gitignore</code> file?</li>
<li>If not, is this documented anywhere? I couldn't find more info about it.</li>
<li>Which hypothetical paths would a rule like &quot;deep/deeper&quot; actually ignore, according to <code>ripgrep</code>? And if the answer is &quot;no paths&quot; are we sure that's right?</li>
</ol>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<pre><code>mkdir -p test/deep/deeper
touch test/deep/deeper/foo.txt     

mkdir -p test/deep/deep/deeper
touch test/deep/deep/deeper/bar.txt

echo 'deep/deeper' &gt;&gt; .gitignore

cd test        
rg deep --files
</code></pre>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p><code>deep/deeper/foo.txt</code> is not ignored, and more generally <code>ripgrep</code> doesn't seem to be following the spec in ways that seem non-obvious.</p>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p><code>deep/deeper/foo.txt</code> to be ignored, and more generally handling <code>.gitignore</code> files to be less surprising, if it makes sense.</p>
