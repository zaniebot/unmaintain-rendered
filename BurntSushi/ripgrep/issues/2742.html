            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ripgrep's manpage does not document its default regex syntax, instead redirecting to the regex crate's documentation. This makes offline use with non-trivial regexes impractical, as end-users do not necessarily have a local copy of the crate's doc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this has been requested before, but duplicating the regex syntax doc is quarrelsome for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is extremely long. It would be too long to include it in <code>man rg</code> IMO. Which means we'd probably need to ship a <code>man rg-regex-syntax</code> or something.</li>
<li>This would create two separate copies of the syntax documentation, which in turn means it'd be easy for them to get out-of-sync with one another.</li>
<li>The regex syntax doc is &quot;plain&quot; HTML/CSS/some-javascript. It is not hard to download it if you need an offline copy.</li>
</ol>
