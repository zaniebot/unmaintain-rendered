            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 0.8.0 (rev 23d1b91ead)
-SIMD -AVX</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p><strong>Edition:</strong> Windows 10 Pro
<strong>Version:</strong> 1709
<strong>OS Build:</strong> 16299.248</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I was getting incomplete results from rg (without flags) and tried using <code>--sort-files</code> and <code>-j1</code> (in separate runs). Both returned the expected results.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Search some string in a somewhat &quot;deep&quot; directory. My case has 17094 files in 1092 folders.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>I can&#x27;t put the actual output here, but goes as something like:</p>
<p>Normal search:</p>
<pre><code># rg &quot;whatever&quot; .

path/to/file1
1: this file has whatever on it
</code></pre>
<p>Singlethreaded search:</p>
<pre><code># rg -j1 &quot;whatever&quot; .

path/to/file1
1: this file has whatever on it

path/to/file2
1: this other file also has whatever on it but don&#x27;t appear on the normal search
</code></pre>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>That the normal search return all results without the need to use <code>--sort-files</code> or <code>-j1</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the bug report! Unfortunately, without the ability to reproduce this, it&#x27;s unlikely to get fixed. In particular, the issue title is jumping to conclusions a bit. The bug here may not necessarily be that threads aren&#x27;t waiting until proper termination, but rather, there may just be a bug somewhere that&#x27;s causing the search routines themselves to behave differently between the single threaded and multithreaded implementations.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m finding it very hard to reproduce outside of the directory it happened, apparently I&#x27;ve found some unusual case.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve also just found out that if I use <code>rg -c &quot;string&quot; .</code> it counts correctly the number of results in each file.</p>
<p>Can I send the debug output to you directly, privately?</p>

<p>@zugl Yes, but I doubt that will help. You can send it to jamslam@gmail.com --- I really need to be able to reproduce a bug like this myself unfortunately.</p>
<p>I guess we can try debug-by-proxy? What are the outputs of the following commands?</p>
<pre><code>$ rg whatever | wc -l
$ rg -j1 whatever | wc -l
$ rg -j2 whatever | wc -l
$ rg . | wc -l
$ rg -j1 . | wc -l
$ rg -j2 . | wc -l
$ rg whatever -c | cut -d&#x27;:&#x27; -f2 | python -c &#x27;import sys; print(sum(int(x) for x in sys.stdin))&#x27;
$ rg whatever -c -j1 | cut -d&#x27;:&#x27; -f2 | python -c &#x27;import sys; print(sum(int(x) for x in sys.stdin))&#x27;
$ rg whatever -c -j2 | cut -d&#x27;:&#x27; -f2 | python -c &#x27;import sys; print(sum(int(x) for x in sys.stdin))&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure any of this will lead to answer for you, but let&#x27;s see what happens.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ll convert this commands to PowerShell equivalents because I&#x27;ve also just found out that this only occurs on rg for Windows (using PowerShell or Cmd).</p>
<p>Using rg (same version) on linux through WSL (bash) it returns correct results.</p>

<p>The issue seems related to rg.exe through PowerShell or Cmd.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I guess I&#x27;ve found the core issue and it might not have anything to do with rg itself. Here is the real problem:</p>
<p>One of the first results contained a latin1 character in the line, something like:</p>
<pre><code># rg -E latin1 &quot;erro&quot; .

path/to/file
1: erro improvável
</code></pre>
<p>Using just <code>rg &quot;erro&quot; .</code> resulted in:</p>
<pre><code>path/to/file
1: erro improv
</code></pre>
<p>The cmd hangs after the <strong>v</strong> in &quot;improvável&quot; and after some time exits.</p>
<p>Running <code>rg -j1 &quot;erro&quot; .</code> or <code>rg --sort-files &quot;erro&quot; .</code> resulted in:</p>
<pre><code>path/to/file
1: erro improv�vel
</code></pre>
<p>Here the full text is returned but with the <strong>replacement character</strong> in the string.</p>
<p>Outputting to a file in all cases returned the correct results, so maybe this is a console buffer issue? I for one have no idea.</p>
<p>However, now the question is: why rg didn&#x27;t output the <strong>replacement character</strong> in all cases?</p>
<p>Hope this helps somehow and you may close this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time on this project! =)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That is... interesting. I am pretty sure there are things going on with the console and encoding, but I honestly don&#x27;t know the precise details. @retep998 might know something though!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>By the way, on WSL the latin1 characters were cut out of the result:</p>
