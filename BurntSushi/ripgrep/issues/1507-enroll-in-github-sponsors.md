# Enroll in GitHub Sponsors

_@bbkane_

I use `ripgrep` a lot- I'd like to do the little dollar a month sponsor thingie and I bet other people do too. Consider enrolling in https://github.com/sponsors .

I'm appreciative that you would want to donate, but it's not a good fit for me. This is addressed in the FAQ: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#donations
