            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Bstr version 1.0 was released with a new MSRV of 1.60.
I understand from the README that ripgrep has a MSRV of 1.34 so upgrading isn&#x27;t directly an option..
However many rust project that depend on components of ripgrephave an MSRV of 1.60 (or above).
It would be nice if a new version of the ripgrep crates were released that bump bstr 1.0.</p>
<p>Currently any crate that depends on ripgrep components can not update bstr (or any crate that depends on it) without compiling two versions of bstr.</p>
<p>This problem occurred in <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/3890">helix-editor/helix#3890</a>.
Here we wanted to update gitoxide to 0.24, which depends on bstr 1.0 but chose to postpone because globset still depends on bstr 0.2.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to open a PR, however as ripgrep is developed in a workspace bumping bstr would mean bumping the MSRV of ripgrep aswell. Might it be possible to add an optional feature to switch to bstr 1.0?</p>
