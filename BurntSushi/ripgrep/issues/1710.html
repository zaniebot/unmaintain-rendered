            <div class="timeline-body"><p>When searching, usually the matches from minified files are unwanted because each match is extremely long and the match can be found in original file as well. Because matches from minified files are rarely desired, and currently <code>rg --type-list</code> has no type for minified files, I suggest adding a <code>minified</code> type so people can ignore minified files while searching by using <code>--type-not minified</code>. This new type should be printed as <code>minified: *.min.js, *.min.css, *.min.html</code> when we run <code>rg --type-list</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this seems reasonable to me. I don't usually track open issues for file types. Just submitting a PR is fine.</p>
<p>Also, you might be interested in the <code>-M/--max-columns</code> flag. It is particularly helpful with things like minified files since it will suppress extremely long lines.</p>
