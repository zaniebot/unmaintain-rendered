<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 14.1.1</p>
<p>features:+pcre2
simd(compile):+SSE2,+SSSE3,-AVX2
simd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2</p>
<p>PCRE2 10.43 is available (JIT is available)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Homebrew</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>MacOS 14.6.1</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>ripgrep clears the entire content of the file or will replace the file with random garbage.
This happens when running the mistake command
rg &#x27;&lt;,&#x27;&gt; file.txt</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>You will see that the file is completely cleared after issuing the command. I would be careful debugging this problem as it might result in data lost.</p>
<pre><code>echo hello &gt;&gt; hello.txt
cat hello.txt
rg &#x27;&lt;,&#x27;&gt; hello.txt
cat hello.txt 
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<pre><code>rg --debug &#x27;&lt;,&#x27;&gt; hello.txt
rg: DEBUG|rg::flags::parse|crates/core/flags/parse.rs:97: no extra arguments found from configuration file
rg: DEBUG|rg::flags::hiargs|crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs:1083: number of paths given to search: 0

rg: DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:453: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 12 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes
</code></pre>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>I ended up running the command trying to see if I can pass through selected content in vim to ripgrep. I wasn&#x27;t too worried but imagine my surprise when something I did cleared the file I was searching. I narrowed it down to this command. The expected behaviour is no matches and the file isn&#x27;t touched.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a shell command typo that ripgrep can&#x27;t do anything about. The shell interprets the quoting and redirect syntax before ripgrep is even executed, all it knows is that you&#x27;ve told it to search for the pattern <code>&lt;,</code> and output the results to a file. Even if it could see the raw shell command, it&#x27;s perfectly valid, so there&#x27;s no way for it (or the shell) to figure out that you meant to type something else</p>
<p>If you want, you can enable the <code>noclobber</code> option in your shell profile to make it so that <code>&gt;</code> isn&#x27;t allowed to overwrite the contents of existing files:</p>
<pre><code># In bash:
set -o noclobber

# In zsh:
setopt no_clobber
# Also set this to make it work like bash, where you can still use &gt;&gt; to create files:
setopt append_create
# ETA: Also set this to make it work like bash, where you can&#x27;t use &gt; to overwrite *empty* files:
setopt no_clobber_empty
</code></pre>
<p>If you do this you will have to remember to use <code>&gt;|</code> instead of <code>&gt;</code> whenever you want to actually overwrite a file</p>
