            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry, but no.</p>
<p>If it were up to me, I would have called the executable ripgrep. But I would have been overrun by complaints that the executable name was too long. Therefore, I wanted it to be short. But if it&#x27;s short, then it&#x27;s hard for it to carry any significant meaning and makes it harder to search for. ripgrep is a meatier name, and by using it in as many places as I can (<em>except</em> for the executable name), it makes it much more discoverable.</p>
<p>The situation is lamentable, and I think your particular issue is, at best, a very minor nuisance compared to the gains.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Also, a minor note: the title of this issue asks to rename the repository, but the content if your issue mentions <code>cargo install ripgrep</code>. The repository name on github is distinct from the crate name on crates.io. &quot;ripgrep&quot; is also used in various packaging repositories, such as brew and Archlinux. It&#x27;s not changing.</p>
