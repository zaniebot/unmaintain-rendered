            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>auto detect filetype by head of the file</h4>
<p>ripgrep detect compress file type by extension name. It would be nice that support filetype detection by head of file. Then we can search zst file by not only naming *.zst, but also *.zst.1, *.zst.2 etc. Such as this in <a href="https://fossies.org/linux/zutils/zutils.cc">zgrep test_format function</a>.</p>
<p>The usage is the same as old one, no changes in manpage</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don't have any plans to implement this, sorry. There is a big difference between detecting file type by looking at the name and actually opening the file and reading its contents. The latter requires a lot more work.</p>
