            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @BurntSushi, thanks for making such a neat tool. I've been finding myself typing <code>rg</code> more and more at the command line. I wanted to suggest a possible feature for rg that would make it useful for CSV. I tried looking through the documentation, but didn't find that this already exists. Apologies if it does or this is redundant.</p>
<p>I often use rg with large CSV files to subset and pull out the rows that match a certain field. This is useful for multi gigabyte CSV where loading them into R or python is very time consuming otherwise. Using rg to subset only the rows I'm interested in can help reduce the file size significantly. One thing that would help me would be if there was a flag to keep the first row in a CSV, which usually contains the column names. Maybe something like <code>--keep-first</code>? This would mean the first row is always printed.</p>
<p>Either way, thanks again for making such a useful tool.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think I'm going to just say no to this one. ripgrep isn't a tool to parse CSV files, even though it may occasionally be useful to use ripgrep on CSV data. Moreover, keeping the first line of a file doesn't even guarantee that it faithfully keeps the first CSV record (since CSV fields can span multiple lines).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>still, i think this could be useful for other use-cases as well if implemented like this:</p>
<p>E.g.: <code>--head=3</code> = print the first 3 lines of each marching file.</p>
