<p>Consider reading the docs carefully. The existence of that file is insufficient: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuration guide does not provide sufficient examples for excluding file and folder patterns from search results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are examples in the guide, so I don't know what you're talking about. See: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#manual-filtering-globs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuration guide is difficult to navigate to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you took the time to file an issue, but this is largely not actionable because you didn't really explain anything.</p>
