            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was grepping a large log file, and accidentally wrote a regex that matched a very large number of lines. After waiting for a minute of it just printing out lines to stdout, I killed <code>rg</code> with Ctrl-C. However, that left the <code>time</code> output and my shell prompt blue since apparently I&#x27;d interrupted it in the process of printing out a line number.</p>
<p><code>rg</code> should probably catch SIGINT and reset the terminal color (or any other terminal changes) before exiting.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Looks like we might be able to get away with the <a href="https://github.com/Detegr/rust-ctrlc"><code>ctrlc</code></a> crate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Or simply go into raw mode and handle <code>C-c</code> manually. <a href="http://github.com/ticki/termion">termion</a> allows this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter raw mode.</li>
<li>Read from the TTY (<code>termion::get_tty</code>).</li>
<li>Handle <code>termion::event::Key::Ctrl(&#x27;c&#x27;)</code> manually.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>termion</code> doesn&#x27;t work on Windows, right? (Which I suppose isn&#x27;t strictly a problem per se, I don&#x27;t even know if this issue exists on Windows.)</p>
<p>In any case, it seems strictly better to handle <code>SIGTERM</code> instead of <code>C-c</code> manually, since <code>SIGTERM</code> can come from anywhere.</p>
