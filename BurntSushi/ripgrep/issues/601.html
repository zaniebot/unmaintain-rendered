            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Currently, there is the following loop at the end of the <code>WalkParallel::run</code> method:</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/beb010d004a79eedb8baa6f4eab21532e83a0ef0/ignore/src/walk.rs#L944-L946</p>
<p>When generating a <code>WalkParallel</code> over a directory with many entries in <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">fd</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/pull/41">this PR</a>), this loop - and therefore, the <code>run</code>-method-call - takes several <em>seconds</em> to finish.</p>
<p>I tried to simply remove them and it seems to work fine (for my use case :smile:). So without understanding the details, I&#x27;m just going to ask: are these calls necessary? Does <code>run</code> have to be blocking?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Those thread join calls synchronize the completion of all worker threads. Without some synchronization step, there is no guarantee that the worker threads will terminate before the program terminates.</p>
<p>This sounds like an XY problem to me honestly. What problem are you trying to solve?</p>

<p>You were right, I figured out a way to solve this on my side.</p>

<p>I have a <code>sync::mpsc::channel</code> and each thread that is spawned by <code>WalkParallel::run</code> is sending results into the channel. I was calling <code>run</code> from the main thread and wanted to collect the results on the receiver-side of the channel in the main thread as well. Now, I&#x27;m spawning another thread for the receiver (before calling <code>WalkParallel::run</code>).</p>
