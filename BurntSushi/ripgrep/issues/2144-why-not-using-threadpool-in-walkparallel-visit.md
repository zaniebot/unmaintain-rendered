I don't know what the heck you're asking. Please add more detail to your question.

Also, consider that instead of asking "why not," you instead make an argument why I _should_ use something different. Then I can be more precise in telling you why I (probably) disagree.

I'm also moving this to a Discussion, since this seems like Q&A.
