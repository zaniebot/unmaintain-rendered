Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>I&#x27;m trying to query a lot of log files (some archived and some aren&#x27;t) using a list of ~10K patterns (using the &quot;-f&quot; flag).
I would like ripgrep to generate a report of how many times each pattern was found in all of the log files.</p>
<p>Thank you Andrew, you are an awesome developer :D</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s an interesting use case, but I&#x27;m going to have to decline. Despite the seeming simplicity of the request, this is something that would require a fair amount of work to design correctly, and would add yet another type of output mode to ripgrep, which I&#x27;m not keen on adding.</p>
<p>I would instead suggest that you use ripgrep&#x27;s libraries and write a Rust program to achieve what you want.</p>
