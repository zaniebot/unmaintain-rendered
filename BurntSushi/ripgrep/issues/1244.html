<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>

<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>I'm trying to query a lot of log files (some archived and some aren't) using a list of ~10K patterns (using the &quot;-f&quot; flag).
I would like ripgrep to generate a report of how many times each pattern was found in all of the log files.</p>
<p>Thank you Andrew, you are an awesome developer :D</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It's an interesting use case, but I'm going to have to decline. Despite the seeming simplicity of the request, this is something that would require a fair amount of work to design correctly, and would add yet another type of output mode to ripgrep, which I'm not keen on adding.</p>
<p>I would instead suggest that you use ripgrep's libraries and write a Rust program to achieve what you want.</p>
