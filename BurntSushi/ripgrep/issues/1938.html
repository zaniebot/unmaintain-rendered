<p>ok, what I'd like to see, is if the 0th argument, which should be the program's invocation name is <code>grep</code> (or the others? <code>igrep</code>)
that it conforms to POSIX as far as the required options. https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/grep.html it would be eventually nice to support the &quot;proprietary&quot; GNU extensions as well.</p>
<p>P.S. I actually kind of like rg better in some ways, but for a full replacement...</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this FAQ item is relevant: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#posix4ever</p>
<p>More generally, the way you've worded your feature request doesn't quite give me confidence that you fully understand what it would take to make a POSIX compliant grep. :-) Merely adding support for &quot;required options&quot; is nowhere near enough. If it were really that simple, I would have absolutely made that available by now. The truly &quot;difficult&quot; aspects of POSIX support are in the regex engine itself. In order to make that work, you really need to set out---at the design level---to build the regex engine with POSIX support in mind.</p>
<p>Nevermind having to support locales...</p>
<p>Also, I've never heard of <code>igrep</code>.</p>
<p>I'm happy for you (or anyone) to use this issue for Q&amp;A if you're curious about how you might go about building such a tool, but since ripgrep will never be that tool, I'm going to close this.</p>

<p>You might want to look into things like BSD grep or even busybox.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>igrep</code> and others are oddly just like <code>grep -i</code> I honestly have no idea why they exist</p>
