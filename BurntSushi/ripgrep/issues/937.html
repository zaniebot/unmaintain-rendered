            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 0.8.1
-SIMD -AVX</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p><code>cargo install ripgrep -f</code></p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Linux Debian 9.</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>On empty patterns utf8 strings aren&#x27;t presented with the correct encode.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<pre><code>❯ rg -S -n --color=always &#x27;&#x27; Cargo.toml
1:[package]
2:authors = [&quot;Jo[0mo Bolila &lt;j**&gt;&quot;]
..
❯ rg -S -n --color=always &#x27;au&#x27; Cargo.toml
2:authors = [&quot;João Bolila &lt;j**&gt;&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Or with any utf8 content.</p>
<p>https://github.com/lotabout/skim/issues/83</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>Doesn&#x27;t display correctly on empty patterns</p>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>Display always like when has a pattern match.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Initially, I couldn&#x27;t reproduce this:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test1
ã
$ rg --color always &#x27;&#x27; test1
1:ã
</code></pre>
<p>On a hunch, I tried a different terminal emulator (specifically, <code>xterm</code>):</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --color always &#x27;&#x27; test1
1:��
</code></pre>
<p>So that did the trick.</p>
<p>The specific problem here is that you&#x27;re searching with an empty pattern, which matches at <em>every</em> position, even between UTF-8 code units. I suspect this itself might actually be a bug in the regex engine. A simple fix on ripgrep&#x27;s side of things would be to simply not emit color escapes for zero width matches, since those color escapes aren&#x27;t visually observable by humans. This would fix things because the reason why you&#x27;re seeing bad output is presumably because there is a color escape sequence between UTF-8 code units, and your terminal emulator chokes on it. However, some folks are using ripgrep&#x27;s color escapes to determine match locations, so I don&#x27;t think I can make that change until ripgrep has a structured output feature.</p>
<p>So, you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with this behavior for now. You might re-visit why it is you&#x27;re feeding an empty pattern to ripgrep if you&#x27;re looking for a workaround.</p>
