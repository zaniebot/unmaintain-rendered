            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The attached contains a text file with 16 characters, including 4 CRLF's, before an 'x'; and a modification where the 4 ^M's were changed into ^K's.  You can see that some of the ^K's were counted as extra LF's (using rg.exe from ripgrep-0.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;\Utils\grep\rg.exe -n x really_text.txt not_really_text.txt
not_really_text.txt
8:x

really_text.txt
5:x
</code></pre>
<p>I believe this problem can only happen on files with ^K in them.  There's a fix for a similar issue in the bytecount crate: https://github.com/llogiq/bytecount/commit/52b177d229533adb25b42b0563aff15333df7e66.  See also the discussion in https://github.com/google/xi-editor/pull/122 -- where I was unaware of the existing bytecount fix. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@zdanz I was secretly hoping you'd trace this issue all the way through ripgrep. Excellent find. :-)</p>
<p>I am going to try hard to dig into the byte counting stuff this weekend and make sure we all have it right. I know @llogiq has written a couple blog posts that I need to digest. :-)</p>

<p>Bytecount has fixed the problem in the meantime, btw.</p>
