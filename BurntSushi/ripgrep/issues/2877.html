            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have a python backend that passes a stripe subscription field called <code>cancel_at_period_end</code> to the frontend. The frontend team prefers that our response objects use a camel case naming convention. My reluctance is that it'll add friction to code navigation because <code>rip grep cancel_at_period_end</code> will return one set of results and <code>rip grep cancelAtPeriodEnd</code> will return another. I always need to see these results together for an effective full stack debugging workflow.</p>
<p>One alternative would be to use <code>-E</code> -- I'd just need to programmatically build the pattern given a camelcase or snake case string. However I imagine there's enough full stack developers with this problem that it's worth adding to core.</p>
