            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>Provide an option along the lines of <code>find -mtime</code> to only look at files that were modified in the last X minutes.</p>
<pre><code>    -mtime n[smhdw]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the difference between the file last modification time and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full
             24-hour period, is n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the difference between the file last modification time and the time find was started is exactly n units.  Please
             refer to the -atime primary description for information on supported time units.
</code></pre>
<p>Doesn&#x27;t have to have units, can be simplified to just accept <code>--modified-in-last-minutes X</code></p>
<p>The idea is to be able to look within code files that were modified in the last hour, in the last day etc...</p>
<p>The main use case is to be able to do something along the lines of <code>rg --modified-in-last-minutes X --glob &#x27;*.your-extension&#x27; | fzf</code> which doesnt seem to work if we try to use <code>find</code> before using <code>rg</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is too much scope creep. And it is a feature that will beget more features. If we allow filtering by mtime, then what about creation time? And various other attributes?</p>
<p>I think it would be better to just use <code>find</code> and build a pipeline with ripgrep.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t see any reason why using <code>find</code> wouldn&#x27;t work here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi if you try to use <code>find</code> piped to <code>rg</code> then <code>.gitignore</code> functionality doesn&#x27;t appear to work with rg</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>find . -mmin -60 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rg . --hidden --with-filename --line-number --follow | fzf
</code></pre>
<p>goes into <code>.git</code> directory.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, no, it wouldn&#x27;t. Because there you&#x27;re passing those files explicitly to ripgrep, and if you give a file to ripgrep explicitly, then it will always search it.</p>
<p>You can use something like <code>fd</code> instead if you want gitignore. I don&#x27;t know if it has a last modified filter, but that&#x27;s probably where it would be.</p>
