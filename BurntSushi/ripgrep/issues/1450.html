            <div class="timeline-body"><p>it would be useful if options <code>-l</code> and <code>-v</code> worked together
to be effectively identical to <code>--files-without-match</code>
and so redefining <code>-l</code>: print file name(s) instead of file content(s)</p>
<p>there's one example
but there may be further opportunity to abstract/simplify/reduce options
hence the generic title</p>
<p>in any case
thank you for sharing your software! :}</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the thoughts, but this isn't quite right and I would rather not leave non-actionable tickets open. <code>-lv</code> in particular is <em>not</em> the same as <code>--files-without-match</code>. The former shows any file that contains at least one non-matching line, where as the latter shows any file that contains zero matching lines.</p>
