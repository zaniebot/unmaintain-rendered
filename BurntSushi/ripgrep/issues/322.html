            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello. Am currently on Windows, and there for some reason (...) unicode files are often created as UTF16BE.
I realized I have a project with mixed file encodings, most is UTF8 and some are UTF16BE, and ripgrep currently don&#x27;t find anything in those files.</p>
<p>In the attached archive is a project I was working on, and the file src\GUIGroup.ts happens to be in UTF16BE,
so try searching the folder for &quot;GUIGroup&quot; causes no hits in that file.</p>
<p>Tested with ripgrep 0.4.0 on Windows. Same result with ripgrep 0.4.0 on macOS</p>
<p>Github dont want to attach zip files today, so I put it here:
http://wikisend.com/download/290136/utf16issue_ripgrep.zip</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a dupe of #1.</p>
<p>As the README says, ripgrep doesn&#x27;t seamlessly support any encoding that isn&#x27;t ASCII compatible. (That includes UTF-8 and latin1, but not UTF-16.)</p>
<p>This is a desirable feature, especially at least UTF-16 since it is used a lot on Windows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, thanks. I glanced through the open issues looking for &quot;UTF16&quot;, thats why I didn&#x27;t notice #1.</p>
