            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I know of the following ripgrep modes for emacs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xuchunyang/rg-el">rg-el</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nlamirault/ripgrep.el">ripgrep.el</a></li>
</ul>
<p>AFAICT, neither of them allows navigating through the search results using the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Compilation-Mode.html">compilation mode</a> <code>M-g n</code> and <code>M-g p</code> key bindings.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Wilfred/ag.el">ag.el</a> and the now-abandoned <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/issues/584">ack-and-a-half</a> both supports this feature, so I’m used to the convenience from other grep modes :).</p>
<p>Is there a more fully featured emacs mode for ripgrep, which supports compilation mode key bindings?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>helm</code> has added support for ripgrep lately. You might want to give it a spin.</p>
<p>If you're used to <code>ag.el</code>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/avdv/2ee9a382cee297f2a3d7081e7a818ea2">here</a> is a small wrapper script for <code>rg</code> which makes it &quot;behave&quot; like <code>ag</code>. I'm using that currently with <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper"><code>swiper</code></a> which lacks support for ripgrep currently.</p>

<p>I would be happy to start accumulating a list of editor plugins in the README.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I do have a mode myself, but I've not cleaned it up and posted it publicly. I based it on <code>ack-and-a-half.el</code> -- basically did some search-and-replace :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I recently made <a href="https://github.com/dajva/rg.el">dajva/rg.el</a> for my personal usage. It's essentially a port of emacs rgrep for ripgrep and works very similar. It's even possible to use wgrep in the result buffer.</p>
