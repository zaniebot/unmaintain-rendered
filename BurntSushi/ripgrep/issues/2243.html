</code></pre>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>When using the vim plugin LeaderF, which uses rg as its search engine, I realized that the sorting order seems to be &quot;randomly&quot; incorrect.</p>
<p>After a bit of tweaking, I produced a minimal script reproducing the issue.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Under a clean temporary folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo string &gt; modified_first; sleep 1; mkdir -p dir; echo string &gt; dir/modified_second; find -type f | xargs stat
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, rg returns the correct order when executing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rg --sort modified string
</code></pre>
<p><strong>However, if we modify the two files now, the order becomes incorrect</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">echo string &gt; modified_first; sleep 1; mkdir -p dir; echo string &gt; dir/modified_second; find -type f | xargs stat # as the output shows, &quot;./modified_first&quot; is modified before &quot;./dir/modified_second&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we run <code>rg --sort modified string</code>, we find the following output:</p>
<pre><code>dir/modified_second
1:string

modified_first
1:string
</code></pre>
<p>when the expected behavior should be:</p>
<pre><code>modified_first
1:string

dir/modified_second
1:string
</code></pre>
<p>I'm attaching the full transcript with output below:</p>

<h2>Potential explanation</h2>
<p>I don't quite understand why this issue pops up, but I realized that <strong>this error does not exist if <code>modified_second</code> is not under <code>dir</code> directory</strong>.</p>
<p>So I did a <code>touch dir</code>, which seems to give the correct order. My speculation is that, <strong><code>--sort modified</code> somehow takes into consideration the modtime of a file's parent directory instead of the file itself</strong></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Nice bug report, thank you.</p>
<p>Sadly, yeah, this is a bug and it's rooted in how I implemented sorting. Namely, sorting is not fully correct. The sorting happens during directory traversal. So when you read the first set of directory entries (before recursing), those entries get sorted. Then recursion happens in the first directory seen, and those directory entries are themselves sorted.</p>
<p>In other words, the sorting implementation relies on the property that sorting the parent directory preserves the sorting order of its children. That works with <code>--sort path</code>, but probably not for anything else. For other things, probably sorting needs to happen globally. Which is pretty bad. It means ripgrep needs to collect everything into memory first and then sort the results. The idea with the current strategy is that it avoids needing to read everything into memory. But it seems quite foolish in retrospect.</p>
<p>So... definitely a bug, but sadly, probably not one that I'll have time to fix soon personally. If someone else wants to submit a patch though, that would be fine. However, I'd encourage discussing the implementation path with me first. It will likely require collecting all file paths first, sorting those, and then running the search. Sounds easy, but will likely require a fair bit of refactoring unfortunately.</p>

<p>As outlined in https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2243, results are incorrectly sorted by file stats (modified/created/accessed time).</p>
<p>One approach is to make the recursive directory traversal smarter. For example, when sorting by latest modified, the parent directory will be assigned the latest modified time of all its children, rather than the direct result of calling <code>stat</code> on it.</p>
<p>Another approach will be to sort the results after all search results have been matched and collected. This will likely collecting all results into memory, tagging each result with a key based on the sorting criteria, and sorting the results by this key.</p>

<p>Sounds a bit memory-intensive, but that probably can't be helped in the general case.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Anything specific in mind?</p>
<p>My guess without knowing anything about the codebase is that you would need whatever trait handles file sorting to have a <code>collect_everything_ahead_of_time() -&gt; bool</code> method to contrast with cases where the files can be sorted on the fly.</p>

<p>This is invalid. Either, the directory is walked by first yielding the directory inodes. Then, we don't know their contents, and therefore not the mtime. The other way, where the contents are searched first, also doesn't help us, since the results are printed before we have the results for sorting order. And on top of that, <code>ripgrep</code> relies on the directories-first approach for filtering.</p>
<p>One approach is to walk the directory and get all the mtimes, then walk it with correct sorting. This won't solve our problem either, since we want to sort files in different directories WITH EACH OTHER, and so collecting them in a big list is the only way :(</p>
