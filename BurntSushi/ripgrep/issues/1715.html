            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>master branch @ <code>c777e2cd5766128e11f7fd5dffd79e1ba8a753fb</code></p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>n/a, I was using the ignore crate as a library.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Tried on both macOS catalina and Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 running Ubuntu:</p>
<pre><code>$ uname -a
Linux MYPC 4.19.104-microsoft-standard #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 06:37:35 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</code></pre>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>There's a common way to ignore top level directories in <code>.gitignore</code> files: simply put the name of the directory in the <code>.gitignore</code> followed by a <code>/</code>. For example, if I wanted to ignore a directory called <code>target</code> and all of the files in it I would put <code>target/</code> in my <code>.gitignore</code> file. You can see an example of this in <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Rust.gitignore#L1-L4">GitHub's Rust <code>.gitignore</code></a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this doesn't work in the ignore crate's handling of <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>
<p>I understand that ripgrep doesn't want to exactly handle all of <code>.gitignore</code>'s edgecases (I've written this code in Go and ... it's really hard) but this is a pretty common case and I didn't see it documented in issues here. That said I completely understand if this is a WONTFIX issue. :)</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jazzdan/ripgrep/blob/b1ed7e01a9b004f8ecae540830d4050ecdb5575d/crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs#L707">a test case for the ignore crate demonstrating this</a>.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>With this <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-gitignore">target/
</code></pre>
<p>A change to a path like <code>./target/tcr.d</code> is not marked as ignored.</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>With this <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-gitignore">target/
</code></pre>
<p>A change to a path like <code>./target/tcr.d</code> should be ignored.</p>
<p>Thank you for making ripgrep and all of these great libraries!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Looks correct to me. The pattern <code>target/</code> will ignore the path <code>target</code>. So when using ignore for recursive traversal, it should ignore the <code>target</code> directory before descending into it. If you aren't doing recursive search, then you may need to match each parent path up to the level at which the gitignore file resides.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah, I might be misunderstanding how to use the library then. <a href="https://github.com/jazzdan/tcr/blob/master/src/ignore.rs#L32">Here's the code I wrote</a>, here's the part where I use the ignore crate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">match &amp;self.gitignore {
  Some(gi) =&gt; {
    let is_dir = event.is_dir;
    return paths.iter().all(|p| gi.matched(p, is_dir).is_ignore());
  }
  None =&gt; {}
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>p</code> is a path: I would expect like <code>matched('target/tcr.d', false).is_ignore() == true</code>. But from what you're saying it sounds like it won't check that <code>target/tcr.d</code> is a child of <code>target/</code> and so it will return false. Whereas if I just put <code>target/**</code> in my <code>.gitignore</code> then it will do what I expect.</p>
<p>Is there a way for the ignore crate to do the kind of parent matching that I'm describing?</p>
<p>By the way, I'm guessing that <code>target/</code> works with <code>git</code> because of some intricacy for how <code>git</code> handles files? Anyway, not important, feel free to close this issue as it seems I have a misunderstanding of the API.</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response and for all this great code!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The only way to do that with the ignore crate is to iterate over parent paths.</p>
<p>I think people probably don't realize just how limited the ignore crate is. If you aren't doing filtered recursive directory traversal, then <em>maybe</em> parts of the crate will be useful to you, but you'll likely need to work hard to make it come together.</p>

<p>Yeah git handles ignore rules pretty differently than ripgrep. Obviously I did my best to make them match, but I did that in the context of recursive directory traversal because that was the problem I needed to solve. But for example, if a file matches a gitignore pattern but is committed, then git won't ignore but ripgrep will.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Gotcha, thanks @BurntSushi! I think I will implement the recursive directory traversal myself, that sounds like a fun project.</p>
