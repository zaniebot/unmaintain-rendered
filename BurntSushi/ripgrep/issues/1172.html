            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Originally, I had thought that ripgrep would reach 1.0 some day and sit there for a long time with no backwards incompatible changes. In practice, ripgrep has seen very few backwards incompatible changes and no complaints about them thus far as far as I know. Instead of trying to commit to a 1.0 release, I thought it might be nice to just move the minor version over to the major version and subsequently be more flexible about bumping the major version while retaining our fairly conservative policy with regard to backwards incompatible changes.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind it, personally, for whatever that&#x27;s worth. I don&#x27;t maintain any projects that rely on ripgrep where semver might be useful, though</p>

<p>Pretty much, yes. I would still adhere to semver though. I&#x27;d just only do breaking changes in major version releases. Basically, I want to make bumping the major version a normal occurrence. Occasionally there may be a breaking change, but I feel confident breaking changes can be kept very small.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Are you going to change anything about the versioning on the libraries (<code>ignore</code>, <code>grep</code>, &amp;c.), too? Or just ripgrep itself?</p>
