There is going thread about persistent global config, but, on the other hand, as for me, in many cases I need custom .rgrc for custom project. And it will be great pros, because anyone invited to project won&#x27;t has to write own aliases or anything what he/she likes.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think we need two tickets tracking this. If directory specific configs are desirable, then that should probably be part of the initial design, since I expect it will add an extra layer of complexity.</p>
