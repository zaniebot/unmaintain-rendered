<pre><code>$ rg &#x27;\.invalidateQueries\((?!\[)&#x27;

regex parse error:
    (?:\.invalidateQueries\((?!\[))
                            ^^^
error: look-around, including look-ahead and look-behind, is not supported

Consider enabling PCRE2 with the --pcre2 flag, which can handle backreferences
and look-around.
</code></pre>
<p>ripgrep detects unsupported regex features and gives a good hint to enable pcre2, but it could instead print a warning, enable it automatically and continue with pcre2 enabled.</p>
<p>This would save the user some keystrokes for one-off searches where this warning can usually be ignored.</p>
<pre><code>$ rg &#x27;\.invalidateQueries\((?!\[)&#x27;

regex parse error:
    (?:\.invalidateQueries\((?!\[))
                            ^^^
warning: look-around, including look-ahead and look-behind, is not supported by default

To suppress this warning consider enabling PCRE2 explicitly with the --pcre2 flag, which
can handle backreferences and look-around but has associated performance tradeoffs.
Consult the ripgrep manual for more info. Continuing with PCRE2 enabled for convenience.
</code></pre>
<p>ripgrep could also detect if running on a TTY or in a script and turn this warning into an error in scripts if PCRE2 performance concerns are worth it.</p>
