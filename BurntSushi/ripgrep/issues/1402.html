<p>ripgrep 0.9.0 -SIMD -AVX
EDIT: Updated to the latest version, lost another 15 seconds on the same search.</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>curl -LO https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/11.0.2/ripgrep_11.0.2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i ripgrep_11.0.2_amd64.deb</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>Searching through directories of compressed log files (.gz) its faster to use find , xargs, zgrep than it is to use rg.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>time rg -z -Ff test /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/2019/2019-0[1,2]* &gt; test.res
real    1m42.605s
user    6m10.424s
sys     9m11.948s</p>
<p>time find /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/2019/2019-0[1,2]* -name &quot;*&quot; -print0 |xargs -P16 -0 zgrep -Ff test &gt; test.res</p>
<p>real    0m58.073s
user    4m52.100s
sys     1m46.900s</p>
<p>Where test contains three newline separated IP-addresses, speccifying the nymber of threads for rg only lead to a marginal improvement, a matter of a couple of seconds.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>Well,  it searches, completes the search with the correct results, but its just... slower.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>I would expect rg to be faster</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for the report, but this isn't really actionable without a corpus for me to reproduce this on. Otherwise, I can only guess: your directory contains many small files and the performance overhead of spinning up a gzip process for each file is impacting it. Another guess is that your log files are so big that you are just measuring disk read speeds, which might be highly variable unless you're doing a very careful benchmark.</p>
<p>But really, performance bugs need to come with a reproduction.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I suspect its unrelated to rg, somehow. Because testing with just one day its almost 8 times as fast as zgrep.</p>
<p>rg -zFf test /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/2019/2019-01-18/*</p>
<p>On one month worth of logs specified as 2019-01* rg is 35% faster. , and two months add upp, zgrep still uses around 58 seconds, for one month AND for two months.</p>

<p>Wish i could hand over the logs but i cant, and i know filing a report like this without the data is kind of stupid, will try to create the same kind of data elsewhere to reproduce if building from master doesnt work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>cloned the repo and built with cargo, would that be revision ripgrep 11.0.2 rev 8892bf648c or? Still takes about the same time. What i dont understand is how zgrep can spend the same time on one and two months whereas rg spends double the time for two months, as expected, , which leads me to think that zgrep is only doing half the work it should. The time doesnt show increased palatalization, and neither does the perf stats -d command.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that's right. Unfortunately, at this point, I think the only path forward is a reproduction so that I can investigate. (Unless you yourself wanted to dig into it.) You could try finding a small subset of your data on which you can reproduce the problem, and then potentially redact it perhaps by replacing every non-whitespace character with an <code>x</code> or something. (And hopefully redacting it doesn't change the performance characteristics.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will try to do that Monday. Before I left work I did some more testing and checked the results find xargs zgrep would find vs rg, and it does find all the same results. I believe the first method, from what I can see is way better at parallelizing the opening of the files to be searched in/ the directory traversal. Running it with -l it was clear that it was checking both months at the same time at a higher rate, but I will formalize the testing. It’s interesting tho that twice the data for the first method doesn’t mean twice the time, meaning parallelisation of the io(since system time isn’t higher) whereas rg doubles in time with double the data/directories(not sure who matters the most.)</p>
<p>Will get you some data to reproduce it, and run more in depth tests.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think i was able to create some relevant test data, a bit limited on time, but the content shouldnt matter much as i were able to reproduce.</p>
<p>https://github.com/RuneBergh/example_data/blob/master/testdir.tar.gz , in case it wasnt obvious i ran my tests on the archives zipped here( with tons of zipped &quot;log files&quot; inside them), so one needs to unzip it first.</p>
<p>Was only able to do some very brief testing on this data, on my x1 carbon, but the results are similar to what i exparienced before.</p>
<p>time find * -name '*' -print0 | xargs -P8 -0 zgrep -Fl 10.0.0.1 | wc -l
vs
time rg -zlF 10.0.0.1 | wc -l</p>
<p>rg spent 3-4 times as long time here, and the first method clearly showed way better CPU utilization, 100% across all 8 cores whereas rg just doesnt use the resources available in a lot of cases.  Keep in mind that im only using all my cores here because IO is fast enough, so it would of course have to be adabted and tested with both all and half available cores. Looking at how many processes rg uses tends to be a good indication. You are probably aware of this, just noting it in case others are testing as well.</p>
<p>So where does the limit go?
Numbers are aproximates, but tested.
Searching 1 day rg is 3x faster
Searching 2 days rg is 3x faster
Searching 4 days rg is 3x faster
Searching 8 days rg is 1.3x faster
Searching 16 days rg is ( didnt test this yet)
Searching 30 days rg is 0.5x slower
Searching 60 days rg is 0.25x slower ( and crashes half way through, only showing half the expected line count, so most likely even slower)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is almost as fast as zgrep:
time find 2019-01-<em>/</em> -name '*' -print0 | xargs -P8 -0 -I {} sh -c 'zcat {} |rg -Fl 10.0.0.1' | wc -l</p>
<p>Still takes 30% longer than zgrep, but its closer, and faster than rg on its own(which is another 20% slower).  The way i see it the problem is somewhat narrowed down to the parallelism of how rg works with a large number of files, since zcat invokes gzip -cd that art really shouldnt matter, but what i have learned is that what &quot;should be&quot; doesnt matter, benchmarks does.  Parallel takes twice as long as the same xargs version if that matters.</p>
<p>I mean htop says it all, it just doesnt use the power thats made availabe, at all, it seems to suffer from some of the same performance issues as parallel for this kind of usecase.</p>
<p>So this is still the fastest way:
time find 2019-01-<em>/</em> -name '*' -print0 | xargs -P8 -0 zgrep -Fl 10.0.0.1 | wc -l</p>
<p>But i dont want to stick with this because its &quot;good enought&quot; i want the performance increase of rg on larger directories as well, as its insanely fast on a smaller scale.</p>
