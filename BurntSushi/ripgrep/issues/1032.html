Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>Thanks for the fix to #842 to which this is somewhat related. Commit 5c80e4a does not add completion files for bash, zsh etc. to the deb package. I understand this was committed after the 0.9.0 release, but as it stands the next release will still lack these completion files, despite this <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/FAQ.md#complete">FAQ entry</a> suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>Is there a plan to add them to the deb build or should we settle for downloading the release tar &amp; manually copying them to the appropriate location?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@muendelezaji Ah thanks for noticing this! In theory, it should be fairly straight-forward to add completions. You can see how we manage the existing assets here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/3edeeca6e94b4e812b4ff078cf92f3178436daa3/Cargo.toml#L89-L102</p>
<p>I think the only thing I really need to know here is where to put the completions themselves. They probably vary by shell and I&#x27;m not familiar with Debian&#x27;s convention here.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>zsh completion functions for Debian/Ubuntu packages belong in <code>/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions</code>.</p>
<p>I think bash completion functions are supposed to go in <code>/usr/share/bash-completion/completions</code>, but i&#x27;m less sure of the conventions there. Some packages also add them to <code>/etc/bash_completion.d</code>, idk.</p>
<p>Not sure about fish at all, but a quick glance at the package contents suggests <code>/usr/share/fish/completions</code>.</p>
