<pre><code>echo &quot;foo&quot; &gt; a.txt
rg foo     # prints filename header
rg foo ./  # also prints filename
rg foo *   # does not print filename
rg foo ./* # does not print filename
rg foo ./a.txt  # does not print filename
</code></pre>
<p>If another file is in the directory, then the filenames are printed. I think this makes sense in the <code>rg a.txt</code> case but in the other cases, a user may be searching with a complex glob in a large directory, so doesn&#x27;t it make sense to also print the filename?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Globs are resolved by the shell on Unix, so when you use <code>rg foo *</code>, ripgrep never actually sees the <code>*</code>. Instead, it just sees the expansion, which in this case, is simply <code>rg foo a.txt</code>. In other words, in a directory with a single file <code>a.txt</code>, every single one of your commands is indistinguishable from the other from ripgrep&#x27;s perspective.</p>
<p>If you always want to display the file path, then you can use the <code>-H/--with-filename</code> flag (which is also found in GNU grep).</p>
