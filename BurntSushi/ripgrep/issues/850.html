Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>Tried to search using grep and ripgrep and the ripgrep results are incorrect.
Incorrect
I was trying to do some performance testing between grep and ripgrep and the results shown by ripgrep are not correct. I&#x27;m searching through log files ~20G in size. Changing options by removing &quot;-F&quot; or using a single cpu by adding -j1 didn&#x27;t make any difference.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>These log files are proprietary, so I can&#x27;t provide the actual logs.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p>Additional output using the --debug flag is following:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@abhichandra21 No, definitely not. Incorrect results like this on a simple literal query is a <em>serious</em> bug. If I could reproduce it, I would try to fix it as quickly as possible. My guess is that there&#x27;s something else going on that we&#x27;re not accounting for and that the search itself isn&#x27;t buggy. Is there anything else peculiar about your environment? If you&#x27;re willing to work with me on this, then maybe we can try to debug this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the same problem occur if you&#x27;re searching only one of these log files?</li>
<li>If so, let&#x27;s throw out the multiple file case and just focus on that one file. Does the same problem occur if you cut the file in half?</li>
<li>If so, does it occur if you cut the file in half again? And so on.</li>
<li>Do other queries suffer the same problem? How far can you chop the query down and still get results inconsistent with grep?</li>
<li>Have you tried using the <code>-a/--text</code> flag? Maybe the difference could be accounted for based on binary file detection.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you repeat that process and get the file down to a reasonable size, then maybe it&#x27;s possible to sanitize it and share it. I&#x27;m also amenable to other forms of sharing. e.g., You could encrypt the file with my public key and I could promise not to share it, but obviously I understand that&#x27;s a long shot. :-)</p>

<p>If so, let&#x27;s throw out the multiple file case and just focus on that one file. Does the same problem occur if you cut the file in half? I keep trimming the files down last night and I got the result if I had 2-3 files.
If so, does it occur if you cut the file in half again? And so on.
Do other queries suffer the same problem? How far can you chop the query down and still get results inconsistent with grep? With my initial testing, I was testing with just one word(Router).
Have you tried using the -a/--text flag? Maybe the difference could be accounted for based on binary file detection. I just did and I kept running into OOM.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That&#x27;s interesting. I&#x27;m really surprised that memory maps are leading to OOMs, but it&#x27;s likely because I don&#x27;t understand something about them. For example, if overcommit isn&#x27;t enabled, and a file backed memory map requests a size greater than available RAM, then perhaps that is what would cause the out-of-memory error. In particular, I would consider that a bug in ripgrep, since it should handle that error and switch to normal read calls. We already do that for certain types of errors: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/9163aaac277f6db9938f464d78d212a0e8997c59/src/worker.rs#L351 I think we need to add <code>ENOMEM</code> to that list of errors to check for.</p>

<p>I got the binary, I will test it when I can. But if I have to disable <code>mmap</code> and has performance implications, then I may have to stick with <code>grep</code>. All I am looking for is a faster way to look through files.</p>

<p>If you&#x27;re searching files that are bigger than available memory, then your speed will be limited by disk regardless of what tool you use (assuming it isn&#x27;t doing something very dumb :P).</p>
<p>Note that you don&#x27;t <em>have</em> to disable memory map. It sounds like your system is configured in such a way where it doesn&#x27;t permit memory mapping a file bigger than memory. There ain&#x27;t nothin ripgrep can do about that. ;-)</p>
