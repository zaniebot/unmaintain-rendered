            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have to admit that I found this quite confusing when I discovered this by accident:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls -a
.  ..  .gitignore

&gt; # .gitignore is searched, even though we did not specify `--hidden` or `-uu`:
&gt; rg --files
.gitignore

&gt; # .gitignore is not searched when we specify `--no-ignore`
&gt; rg --files --no-ignore
</code></pre>
<p>I found out that this was caused by a <code>!.gitignore</code> entry inside the <code>.gitignore</code> file. It looks like this ripgrep behavior is actually by design (see #90), but I just wanted to make sure - given that this seems to be a <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22%21.gitignore%22&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">common pattern</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This seems like it&#x27;s working as intended? ripgrep respects whitelists in your <code>.gitignore</code> file. This is why <code>.ignore</code> files exist---so you can override things that make sense for git tracking but not for searching.</p>
<p>I understand you might have been confused by this, but what other behavior would you expect here? Note that running ripgrep with <code>--debug</code> will usually tell you if a file has been whitelisted. Example:</p>
<pre><code>[andrew@Cheetah ripgrep-771] cat .gitignore 
!.gitignore
[andrew@Cheetah ripgrep-771] rg --files --debug

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi Thank you for the clarification!</p>
<p>I was confused/surprised because I somehow expected the hidden/non-hidden distinction to take precedence over ignored/non-ignored. I would have expected hidden files to never be searched unless <code>--hidden</code> was specified.</p>
<p>But I guess it makes sense when thinking in terms of whitelisting. This example might have been particularly surprising because the <code>.gitignore</code> file whitelisted itself (for reasons that are obviously not related to this file having valuable content to search through :smile:).</p>

<p>Thanks, I didn&#x27;t know that!</p>
