            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 0.10.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p><code>ripgrep-0.10.0</code> via nixpkgs.</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>NixOS 18.03, with unstable nixpkgs channel, <code>uname -a</code>:
<code>Linux ceres 4.14.90 #1-NixOS SMP Fri Dec 21 13:13:19 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux</code></p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>ripgrep stops reading data (without warning!) on the first unprintable character it encounters, even if it has already printed matches.</p>
<p>I encountered this issue when trying to use ripgrep to process a large corpus of text, which includes some incorrectly processed data, such as ASCII control codes and unprintable unicode codepoints.
I was piping the output of unzip into rg, and was wondering why rg was finishing within only a few seconds, as the corpus is hundreds of gigabytes in size.
rg was printing matches up until a certain point, where it exited with zero warning.
The workaround is to pass the <code>-a</code> flag to ripgrep, which allows rg to process the whole corpus.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Unknown, the corpus is too large to share easily.
I could not produce a reduced testcase manually, as rg seems to stop at null bytes despite the <code>-a</code> flag (so a testcase with null bytes isn&#x27;t equivalent), and I don&#x27;t know how to make echo in bash produce invalid codepoints otherwise.</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<p><code>$ unzip -p Corpus.zip | pv | rg -i &#x27;a peak&#x27; &gt; ctx/a_peak.txt</code></p>
<p>Output is too large to upload in its entirety</p>
<p>The only DEBUG information is printed at the start:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:100: required literals found: [Cut(A PEA), Cut(a PEA), Cut(A pEA), Cut(a pEA), Cut(A PeA), Cut(a PeA), Cut(A peA), Cut(a peA), Cut(A PEa), Cut(a PEa), Cut(A pEa), Cut(a pEa), Cut(A Pea), Cut(a Pea), Cut(A pea), Cut(a pea)]
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing is printed as rg exits</p>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p>I believe that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>rg should switch to text mode <code>-a</code> after printing it&#x27;s first match if reading from stdin, or</li>
<li>rg should exit with a warning (on stderr) if stdin contains binary data and no relevant flags were passed</li>
</ul>
