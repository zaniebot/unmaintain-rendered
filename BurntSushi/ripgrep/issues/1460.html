            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>11.0.2</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Arch package manager</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Arch 5.4.11 kernel</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>I used ripgrep to search a section of files for a string <code>rg -i newhardwarestatussvc</code> and ripgrep showed only 1 result it was a correct result however it missed several cases that grep found.</p>
<p>Even going to the directory with one of the files containing the string, ripgrep doesn't find the string. Ripgrep is searching golang files.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the code is proprietary so cannot give the maintainers the ability to reproduce it however I am willing to run what commands you give me and see if we can fix it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This issue doesn't have sufficient information. In particular, <code>rg -i newhardwarestatussvc</code> is not the same as <code>grep -ri newhardwarestatussvc</code> because the former does smart filtering while the latter does not. As the simplest possible next step, please consider trying <code>rg -uuu -i newhardwarestatussvc</code>.</p>
<p>If that still does not show the result where as grep does, then the next step is to reproduce this using a single file search. e.g., <code>rg -i newhardwarestatussvc the-file</code> vs <code>grep -i newhardwarestatussvc the-file</code>. Once you have that, you'll need to find some way to censor that file and send it to me in a way that lets you share it.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>-uuu</code> command did find the same results as <code>grep -ir</code> does <code>-uuu</code> disable smart filtering? and what does smart filtering do? Why does it remove valid results?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@eatthoselemons The first two sentences of the README should clear up your confusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect your .gitignore and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also mentioned in the first couple lines of the description in ripgrep's man page.</p>
<p>You might consider reading the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md">user guide</a> to get more insight on ripgrep's filtering options and behavior.</p>
