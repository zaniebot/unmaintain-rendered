<p>I can certainly put on binaries without SIMD support if that would help. (I was seeing if I could get away with not doing it, since it will be confusing to users. &quot;Which one should I download?&quot;)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, looks like your CPU doesn't support <code>ssse3</code>, which probably explains the error. I'll work on generating sse2-only binaries, but for now, I'm afraid you'll have to compile from source if you want to use <code>ripgrep</code> on that machine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>So... I want to fix this issue but I'm not sure what the best way is. I understand the <em>technical</em> issues at play, but I'm concerned more about the user experience here. Let me describe what I think is the problem.</p>
<p>Today, if I'm on Linux and I want to download a Linux binary for ripgrep, I click on the &quot;releases&quot; link and there is exactly one choice that makes sense: <code>ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz</code>.</p>
<p>In the future, if we add different downloads for various flavors of SIMD support, then will be multiple choices and none of them will be obvious. For example, you might have to choose between <code>ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz</code> and <code>ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-ssse3.tar.gz</code>. As a user of command line search tools, I have no idea what SIMD is or what SSSE3 means or whether my system supports it. Therefore, I will choose <code>ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz</code>. (Which is likely the wrong choice in the vast majority of cases.)</p>
<p>How can I fix this? I could add some notes about this in the release page, but I feel like that will be ineffective.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It is not unheard of to have a program do run time detection of the supported instruction set and pick the correct functions as needed. Openssl with AES instruction support is one example. VLC and other video players are another good source of examples. Here they actually fork and test the instruction works since they don't trust the CPU ID bits to be correct. https://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/vlc-devel/2009-September/066544.html</p>
<p>So the general solution may be to create one binary that detects and loads the correct arch specific module. I have no idea how to do that in rust, but I would like to hope it is possible without too many hoops. And hopefully it is just a small subset of the code that really needs the instructions for the performance boost.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@acmay Ah, thanks for the update! Yup, Rust has a few cpuid crates that we could use to avoid running SSSE3 code if it's not available. The problem is actually a bit more sinister then that though. In particular, if I compile a binary using the equivalent of <code>-mssse3</code>, then that enables SSSE3 based optimizations <em>everywhere</em>.</p>
<p>The only way to solve this problem for real is using target specific function attributes. (Which I just recently added to the Rust compiler.) This allows one to use SSSE3 vendor intrinsics on a function-by-function level without actually passing <code>-mssse3</code> as a compile-time flag. We can then use, e.g., cpuid to dispatch.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not a user of ripgrep, but I came across this while looking for something else entirely and thought of something that might help you out.</p>
<p>Suggestion: package all versions of the binary in a single RPM and use an install-time script to figure out which one to actually use.</p>
<p>ex:</p>
<ol>
<li>install PREFIX/bin/ripgrep-ssse3, PREFIX/bin/ripgrep-ssse2, etc.</li>
<li>Write an install script detects actual CPU capabilities</li>
<li>create symlink for PREFIX/bin/ripgrep to the appropriate binary based on detected capabilities</li>
</ol>
<p>This avoids having to manage complex state in a single binary, potentially having the performance gains from using SIMD lost by the capability checks, at the cost of a larger package.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi perhaps keep the default build as the one that includes the latest SIMD, and denote the alternative builds with something like <code>nosse3</code>, with a note about the errors users of such processors may encounter, then at least google can solve their problem.  This way, most users get the additional optimizations, but the option is there for those with unsupported processors, that they don't have to work out a whole rust toolchain to get a build done.</p>
<p>Worst case for users of modern processors who download the wrong version though is that they get a slightly less optimized build, right?  Doesn't seem like a much of a big deal.</p>

<p>So the CPU an <code>Intel E5-1630 v3</code> seems to support AVX and AVX2 but it looks like ripgrep isn't seeing that? Also in ripgrep 0.9.0 it now seems to detect no support for SIMD which used to work on the same system in 0.8.1</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --version 
ripgrep 0.8.1 (rev c8e9f25b85)
+SIMD -AVX
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe I have misunderstood but I expected that 0.9.0 would detect and use SMID and AVX?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@jamesmudd It should be, yes. The <code>-SIMD -AVX</code> refer to compile time options, neither of which are now enabled in the binary releases. Previously, the SSSE3 feature was enabled at compile time, which is why <code>0.8.1</code> shows <code>+SIMD</code>, and is exactly what caused binaries to be non-portable, and therefore, caused  the bug reported in this issue.</p>
<p>The build instructions in the README indicate that some SIMD features are enabled at compile time (line counting and transcoding, specifically) while others are enabled at runtime (regex matching). The ideal is that they are all enabled at runtime, but we'll have to wait for the maintainers of the respective libraries to catch up and add support for runtime detection.</p>
<p>The misleading output of <code>--version</code> is fixed on master, which now shows both compile time and run time feature detection:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --version
ripgrep 0.9.0 (rev 1bb8b7170f)
+SIMD +AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
<p>The only way to enable compile time SIMD/AVX is to build ripgrep yourself.</p>
