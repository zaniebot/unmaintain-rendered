---

_@DanielsBerlin_

hi, and thanks for the program.
suppose that i have a list which contains 100 entries, and i have a directory that contains some txt files and some zip files. so i want to search the list inside that directory in a way that when any of the entries are hit in that directory , the program needs to list those matching entries.
how to write a command for this
