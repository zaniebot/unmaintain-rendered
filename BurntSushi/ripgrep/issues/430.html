            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure how exactly coloring is made on Windows but you can <code>Crtl-C</code> ripgrep and it gets your console like that:</p>

<p>All non-colored fonts became red for example.
It can happen with any color that ripgrep is using just interrupt it in the moment when coloring starts...</p>
<p>P.s. workaround for powershell:</p>
<pre><code>[Console]::ResetColor()
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, sorry i haven't looked properly and found https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/de5cb7d22e00c18dfce082a68b0cf45924b56e7f</p>
<p>But no, it is bad. Really bad for user.
You cannot expect user to do clean-up after software.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ok, i'm sorry i didn't mean to be rude. But i was surprised to see that issue is closed while bad fix has been reverted.
I'm planning to look into possible ways to deal with it.</p>
