            <div class="timeline-body"><p>RIPGREP is already a very useful tool for replacing find and grep, however I encountered some cases when mtime or ctime options where needed.
Please add support for -mtime, -ctime or some time related options similar to those on find.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I've been thinking about doing this lately. We can use <code>jiff</code> to accept pretty fleixlbe inputs. IDK if I'll call them <code>-mtime</code> or <code>-ctime</code> though.</p>
