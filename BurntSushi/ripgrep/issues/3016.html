            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I want to provide some feedback on my user experience when invoking <code>rg</code> with certain command-line options. It's not a clear-cut bug and it is a matter of opinion, at least to some extent.</p>
<p>What would you expect this command to do?</p>
<pre><code>rg --no-ignore --hidden foobar</code></pre>
<p>If you're like me, you may expect this to mean: search the current directory for the regular expression <code>foobar</code>, excluding ignored files, and including hidden files. Instead, it actually means to search both ignored files and hidden files.</p>
<p>The reason my brain made this mistake is that it was treating all the command line options as adjectives (no ignored files, with hidden files). In fact the <code>--no-ignore</code> option is better read as a verb (&quot;don't ignore&quot;), and the <code>--hidden</code> option as an adjective (with hidden files).</p>
<p>Compare and contrast with this fictional interface of rg that uses adjectives for both options:</p>
<pre><code>rg --no-ignored --hidden foobar</code></pre>
<p>Or consider this interface that uses verbs for both options:</p>
<pre><code>rg --do-not-ignore --hide foobar</code></pre>
<p>I realise that these options are now firmly in people's muscle memory, and that this issue is subjective and low priority. I have thoughts about how the naming of the command-line options could be improved without breaking backwards compatibility. I'm happy to share those thoughts if there is interest.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I agree that the naming scheme used here is somewhat inconsistent and probably not ideal. The &quot;no ignore&quot; is referring to &quot;do not respect ignore files/rules&quot; where as &quot;hidden&quot; is referring to the hidden files themselves.</p>
<p>This probably isn't going to change. I understand how to change it without breaking compatibility (that part is somewhat easy). The problem is that now you need to maintain both naming schemes and I think this leads to an overall worse result than today. That is, the current naming scheme isn't bad enough to warrant introducing another naming scheme that I will happily concede could be better on its own. That is, the choices aren't, &quot;stick with what we have or provide a better naming scheme,&quot; but rather, &quot;provide a better naming scheme <em>in addition to</em> what we have.&quot; The latter is what I evaluate when adjudicating these kinds of requests, not the former.</p>
<p>Moreover, there already is an alternative naming scheme today: <code>-uu</code> is an equivalent and terser variant of <code>--no-ignore --hidden</code>. And it is generally what I'd recommend. <code>-u</code> ignores <code>.gitignore</code>. <code>-uu</code> searches hidden files. and <code>-uuu</code> searches binary files. It's a &quot;progressive&quot; loosening of ripgrep's default smart filtering.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense. I can see how maintaining two naming schemes indefinitely is not ideal. I can understand the desire to never deprecate or remove options that are good enough. Thanks for your quick and gracious response.</p>
<p>I'll close this issue. If the project ever shifts to be more idealistic (and less stable), or if this issue gathers enough upvotes, it may be worth re-opening it some day.</p>
