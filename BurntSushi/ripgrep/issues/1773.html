(As I couldn't find proper contact information to report a vulnerability, I used the email from https://blog.burntsushi.net/about/)
Since I believe this vulnerability can be exploited, I'm not publishing the detail here.</p>
<p>@BurntSushi Can you check the inbox, please?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This almost sounds like a bug in Windows or <code>std::process::Command</code> to me. Other people that are used to *nix might find this behaviour surprising and introduce similar vulnerabilities. Should this be fixed in the stdlib maybe? Maybe have some method on a <code>Command</code> that optionally resolves the path to an executable like your <code>resolve_binary</code>, overriding the OS's search path (skipping the current working directory)? Just some food for thought (duplicated here because comments on commits might not be the best place).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I meant a file a bug against std. The library team did have a brief private conversation about it a couple months ago, and there does seem to be some appetite toward doing <em>something</em> here.</p>
<p>I haven't gotten around to filing an issue, but we are okay doing it publicly. So anyone can create that issue. (And I would invite someone to do it.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Does this also affect ripgrep being used as a crate? If so, it's probably a good idea to also file an advisory at https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db - that way people relying on a vulnerable version would be notified through <code>cargo audit</code>, <code>cargo deny</code>, etc.</p>
