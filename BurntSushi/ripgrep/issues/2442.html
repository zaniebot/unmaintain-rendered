            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>I would like to have an &#x27;execute&#x27; option like in find/fd (--exec/-x) to run a command for every file that contains a matching or non-matching pattern.
I know this can be solved in the shell but it&#x27;s annoying.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, the pattern shall very normally match the content, and not the filename. For that we have find/fd.
But the execution of a command shall be on the files that contain that pattern.
e.g.
<code>rg &#x27;some.*pattern&#x27; --exec mv {} subfolder/</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think this is beyond the scope of what I want to be in ripgrep. I myself avoid using things like <code>--exec</code> in tools that have them today, because it&#x27;s basically another little DSL you have to understand that is embedded inside your shell. So I actually find it far <em>more</em> annoying than just using the shell or something like <code>xargs</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While I personally avoid <code>-x</code>/<code>-exec</code> myself, there are a few times where it&#x27;s quite useful. Sometimes we don&#x27;t have the luxury of using pipes, for one reason or another; and sometimes the pipe can affect performance quite a bit. Also, doing proper piping requires some boilerplate.</p>
<p>Compare
<code>sudo rg &#x27;pattern&#x27; -x cp -t some/destination/ {}</code>
versus
<code>sudo rg -l -0 &#x27;pattern&#x27; | sudo xargs -0 cp -t some/destination</code>.</p>
<p>Half the point of using <code>ripgrep</code> and <code>fd</code>, for me at least, is that it takes away a lot of the boilerplate I would do with <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code> otherwise. Why is this in particular any different?</p>

<p>There are an unbounded number of ways that ripgrep can reduce or eliminate boiler plate. I can&#x27;t accept and maintain all of them. Therefore, I must draw a line somewhere between &quot;we do some things that reduce boiler plate&quot; and &quot;we avoid doing other things that reduce boiler plate.&quot; Where that line is drawn is not informed by some rigorous formal process that consistently follows a sequence of objective criteria. Loosely speaking, it is informed by, in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>My perception of how broad the utility of the feature is.</li>
<li>What work-arounds look like.</li>
<li>Implementation complexity.</li>
<li>How likely it is to beget more feature requests.</li>
</ol>
<p>This just doesn&#x27;t clear the bar for me. Sorry.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>fair. It&#x27;s your project and I&#x27;m happy you responded to the proposal. I can work with xargs too. Thanks, and thanks for ripgrep. Have a great day :-)</p>
