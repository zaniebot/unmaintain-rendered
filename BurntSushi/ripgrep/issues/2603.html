            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey!</p>
<p>I have a lot of regex patterns I&#x27;d like to apply on a file, this leds to something like:</p>
<pre><code>rg --json --regexp &lt;pattern&gt; --regexp &lt;pattern&gt; .... &lt;path&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This works great returning a bunch of matches but in the match json there is no way to identify which regex pattern/s led to the match.</p>
<p>If there is a way to do this already could you let me know and I&#x27;ll close this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks so much :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Duplicate of #2471.</p>
<p>The good news is that the changes to the <code>regex</code> crate I talked about in #2471 have landed and you can now write a Rust program to search for multiple regexes simultaneously in a way that will tell you which matched. I should caution you though that it isn&#x27;t magic and it can&#x27;t scale to arbitrarily many regexes. But I have no plans to add this functionality to ripgrep at present.</p>
<p>Another technique is to use a crate like <a href="https://docs.rs/aho-corasick"><code>aho-corasick</code></a> to do some part of the matching for you because it scales better.</p>
<p>But I&#x27;ll stop here. If you want to talk more about the regex engine, we should move it to here: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/discussions</p>
