<p>I switched to Linux from macOS. On macOS I used iterm2 which automatically handled file links, Ripgrep would list a file out such as <code>src/subdirectory/subdirectory/filename.json</code> and if you alt+clicked that directory+filename listing, it&#x27;d open your editor. Unfortunately from what I can see none of the Linux terminal apps do this. However, if links were outputted as such <code>file://home/usr/projectname/src/subdirectory/subdirectory/filename.json</code>, it&#x27;d work just fine.</p>
<p>This is a good post on links in terminals: https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda.</p>
<p>Is this something that can be configured or would it need to be added to the rg source and merged in?</p>

<p>With all due respect (I&#x27;m only saying that because there&#x27;s no &quot;tone&quot; attached to what I&#x27;m about to say despite it kind of seeming like there is) but what&#x27;s the issue with not many other tools doing it? Why would rg need other tools to do it to consider it a useful feature?</p>
<p>Plus (and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here) but I don&#x27;t even believe that this would be more than a 1-2 line change in the source. Its just tweaking how the filename representation is output.</p>
