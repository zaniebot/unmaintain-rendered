<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>13.0.0</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>apt-get</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Debian</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>ripgrep echos unescaped input to terminal, for filenames and regexes</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>red=$&#x27;\x1b[31m RED \x1b[0;0m&#x27;</p>
<p>rg pat &quot;$red&quot;    # filename</p>
<p>rg &quot;$red&#x27;   # pattern</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>I see red  text</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>It should probably be escaped, at least in the filename case</p>
<p>I noticed this when testing a bunch of programs, as mentioned here</p>
<p>https://lobste.rs/s/qwcov5/deja_vu_ghostly_cves_my_terminal_title#c_js5pfq</p>
<p>There are two categories of programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>bash, perl, python2, lua, node JS, grep, ripgrep</li>
</ul>
<p>vs.</p>
<ul>
<li>ls and cat (coreutils), python3, ruby, OSH/YSH</li>
</ul>
<p>This is possibly debatable, but I think the latter behavior is better</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I imagine it will do the same for file data too (which has been reported before), which ripgrep just dumps to stdout as is. I&#x27;m not really sure this is worth fixing.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah I am not saying it&#x27;s a security issue -- all this stuff with terminals is  kinda ambiguous</p>
<p>Just saying that programs do disagree on this, but the trend is toward the latter behavior.  At least with coreutils in 2016 - https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/quotes.html</p>
<p>I think it&#x27;s more usable to see the quoted representation of what you typed, rather than  having invisible chars, or red chars</p>
<p>i.e. if there is a garbage filename on the file system, it could be more noticeable to the user in quoted form</p>
<p>(I never thought about the actual file contents on stdout, though come to think of it having a mode  to show that is something I might use, although it could also be a filter after grep/rg)</p>
