            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A while back I discovered that ripgrep supports a <code>--type-add</code> option and I was quite excited.  I find myself using the same glob patterns pretty regularly, so having a way to define common patterns seemed like it would save me a tremendous amount of time... until I saw that &quot;Type settings are NOT persisted&quot;.<br />
I found this rather disappointing because it meant that <code>--type-add</code> would only ever save time if I wrapped <code>rg</code> in an alias or function.<br />
It wasn't until much later (today in fact!) that I saw that ripgrep supports configuration files.  This effectively means that I <em>can</em> persist my type definitions.</p>
<p>Given the severe limitation of type definitions not being automatically persisted, I would strongly suggest updating the help text/manpages of <code>--type-add</code> and <code>--type-clear</code> to also mention the existence of using a configuration file as a workaround.  Yes, the configuration file guide uses <code>--type-add</code> as an example, but most users may not realize that a configuration file solution exists if something doesn't point them directly to it.</p>
<p>In summary, I suggest changing this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT persisted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Into something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT persisted.  See CONFIGURATION FILES for a workaround.</p>
