<ul>
<li>[X] I have a different issue.</li>
</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 14.1.0</p>
<p>features:-simd-accel,+pcre2
simd(compile):+SSE2,-SSSE3,-AVX2
simd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2</p>
<p>PCRE2 10.42 is available (JIT is available)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>pacman</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>archlinux</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>If you have an ignore rule like &quot;/a/*/b&quot; in .ignore or .gitignore,  then it will ignore files it shouldn&#x27;t if you are in a subdirectory that has a grandchild named b.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/issues/1506">sharkdp/fd#1506</a></p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Create a directory with a layout like:</p>
<pre><code>.
└── a
    ├── c
    │   └── b
    │       └── foo
    └── src
        └── f
            └── b
                └── foo

7 directories, 2 files
</code></pre>
<p>and at the top level create a .ignore file with the folowing contents:</p>
<pre><code>/a/*/b
</code></pre>
<p>From the root run <code>rg --files</code>
then run <code>rg --files</code> from the a/src directory (either cd into that directory or supply it as the path)</p>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>When run from the root folder, it works as expected and finds a/src/f/b/foo but not a/c/b/foo (because <code>*</code> only matches a single directory).</p>
<p>However, if I run from <code>a/src</code> then it doesn&#x27;t find any files.</p>
<p>Possibly related, if I run <code>rg --files</code> from the <code>a/</code> folder, then it actually finds both foo files, even though a/c/b/foo <em>should</em> be excluded because of it&#x27;s relation to the folder containing the .ignore file (and the ignore pattern is absolute).</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>a/src/f/b/foo should not be ignored, regardless of which directory I run <code>rg</code> from.</p>
<p>a/c/b/foo should be ignored, regardless of which directory I run <code>rg</code> from.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Where it goes wrong:</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/crates/ignore/src/dir.rs#L456</p>
<p>In the specific test case, we have:</p>
<pre><code>abs_parent_path = &quot;[...]/a/src&#x27;
dirpath = &quot;./f/b&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Prefix is computed to be <code>f</code> and that and the <code>/</code> are stripped before the base is concatenated with the absolute path giving:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;[...]/a/src/b&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>So that matches on the ignore regex and is filtered. The obvious (to me) solution seemed to be to strip the &quot;./&quot; (if necessary) and just do plain concatenation. We would expect our path not to have overlap its absolute parent, right? However, making that change causes regression of #1757. So, either get we doubled-up segments or segments missing.</p>

<p>They are related! The same sequence of events results in the <code>b</code> being sliced out of <code>a/c/b/foo</code>.</p>
