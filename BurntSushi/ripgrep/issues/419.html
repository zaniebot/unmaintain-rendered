            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'd be willing to add a <code>-Z</code> short flag for <code>--null</code>, since that's what grep does. (ripgrep obviously takes a certain amount of inspiration from ag, but when there's a choice to be made with respect to flags, I've tended to side with GNU grep because of its ubiquity.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That makes sense for GNU grep. Do note that BSD grep (which ships with macOS) behaves differently:</p>
<pre><code>-Z, -z, --decompress
         Force grep to behave as zgrep.</code></pre>
<p>Neither grep uses <code>-0</code>. I'm fine with <code>-Z</code> too though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yuck. I'd like ripgrep to support decompression some day. I still lean towards <code>-Z</code>... However, <code>-0</code> also has precedent, e.g., with <code>xargs</code>.</p>
