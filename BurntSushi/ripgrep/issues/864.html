<p>rg is 4x times slower then grep for a similar search.
I have a 11GB log file and just want to search for a simple text and count occurrences.</p>
<p>$ time rg -j 4 -a 'ScheduledTopUp.TimeStamp=1518' server.log.2018-02-14 -c
37930</p>
<p>real    0m46.510s

<p>real    0m13.145s

<p>Try with other settings too, but no improvements:</p>
<p>$ time rg -j 4 'ScheduledTopUp.TimeStamp=1518' server.log.2018-02-14 --mmap -c

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't enough information to act on. Fixing performance bugs requires that it can be reproduced. Please find a way to reproduce the problem on an open dataset (or find a way to get me your dataset).</p>
<p>Also, I see that you are on Windows. Almost all of my benchmarking has been done on Linux. What very little benchmarking I've done in Windows suggests that performance can be greatly impacted by active virus scanners.</p>
<p>The high variability between your runs is also quite suspicious. Are you sure you aren't just measuring disk bandwidth?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I will try to find a such  data set.
As you can see there were different parameters given to the rg.
If the same parameters/flags are given the same result is received.
&quot;-j 4 -a&quot; gives best result : ~ 50 sec
no flag the worst result: ~ 3 min</p>
<p>Btw. I installed rg on a debian machine:
4.14.0-2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.14.7-1 (2017-12-22) x86_64 GNU/Linux</p>
<p>Now the times are comparable:</p>
<p>$ time grep 'ScheduledTopUp.TimeStamp=1518' server.log.2018-02-14 -c
37930</p>
<p>real    2m20.756s
user    0m19.277s
sys     0m7.317s</p>
<p>$ time rg -j 4 -a 'ScheduledTopUp.TimeStamp=1518' server.log.2018-02-14 -c
37930</p>
<p>real    2m30.704s
user    0m8.266s
sys     0m6.611s</p>
<p>So issue seems to be windows related.
Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Something is very clearly amiss. You're searching a single file. ripgrep doesn't benefit from parallelism when searching a single file, so the fact that it's faster suggests something is going wrong. One possible explanation is that ripgrep is actually searching your entire CWD, even though that would definitely be a bug given the command you're running.</p>
