            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 11.0.2
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>pacman -S ripgrep</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Arch linux</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>I set the RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH as explained in the guide by adding this to my .profile:
<code>export RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/.rgrc</code></p>
<p>I confirm is set editing the file with:
<code>vim $(echo $RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH)</code></p>
<p>In the file I have:</p>
<pre><code>--hidden
--smart-case
</code></pre>
<p>But when using rg the options are not used:</p>
<pre><code># rg --debug export
DEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:59: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(export)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:435: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 11 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:435: built glob sep
</code></pre>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As far as I can tell, ripgrep doesn't think <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> is set. This doesn't appear to be a bug with ripgreo. Please confirm that your environment is configured correctly and that you are actually using the latest version ripgrep.</p>
<p>You can tell it's working since the debug output will indicate when a config file is loaded.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Well, if I <code>echo $RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code> I get the rigth path. What else can I do to check?
I'm using the version from the Arch repo, 11.0.2. I will try to build it from source.</p>
<p>EDIT: I removed the Arch package and installed with <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> but doesn't help. The output from --trace is the same.</p>
<p>EDIT: tried on another machine and work as expected, if I will find the reason I'll edit the issue for reference.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi no sorry, I reinstalled everything on the machine and after that I had no problems. I don't know what was going on but seems not related to ripgrep. I think this can be closed.</p>
