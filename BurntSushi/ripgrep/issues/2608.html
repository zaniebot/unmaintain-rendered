            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>Bash supports a feature called <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/bash-extended-globbing">&quot;Extended Globbing&quot;</a> that allows you to do group matching with a syntax similar to regular expressions.</p>
<p>I was wondering if you&#x27;d consider adding it to the Globset crate to be able to match expressions with that syntax. These are the patterns that Bash supports:</p>
<pre><code>  ?(pattern-list)   Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
  *(pattern-list)   Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
  +(pattern-list)   Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
  @(pattern-list)   Matches one of the given patterns
  !(pattern-list)   Matches anything except one of the given patterns
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect that GlobSet matched expressions based on those patterns. This is an example on how I&#x27;d expect to work with this feature enabled:</p>
<pre><code>const EXPR: &amp;str = &quot;main.@(rs|rb)&quot;;

fn main() {
    let glob = globset::GlobBuilder::new(EXPR)
	.extended_globbing(true)
        .build()
        .unwrap()
	.compile_matcher();
    assert!(glob.is_match(&quot;main.rs&quot;));
    assert!(glob.is_match(&quot;main.rb&quot;));
}
</code></pre>
<p>I can try to implement it myself with a little guidance on how to approach the codebase.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;d rather stick to the standard globbing features. IMO, if you really benefit from this extended syntax, it would probably just be better to use regexes.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll also note that <code>!(pattern-list)</code> is likely pretty tricky to do. <code>globset</code> works by converting the glob to a regular expression, and seemingly the <code>!(pattern-list)</code> syntax would require a regex engine that supports complement. Such engines are quite rare, and I&#x27;m not aware of any that would be appropriate to include in ripgrep or globset. (Even if I was willing to include another regex engine in the first place, which I don&#x27;t think I am.)</p>
