            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Not sure whether this can be counted as an <em>actual</em> issue, but it looks like the default colours are more geared towards having a black background in your terminal, which can incur some readability when using a different terminal background colour.</p>
<p>Compare the two outputs between <code>ag</code> and <code>rg</code>:</p>

<p>As you can see <code>ag</code> is a bit more readable here, especially on file names.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating to copy silver searcher's colour scheme exactly, but it would be nice if the defaults worked nicely with both.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually very much dislike <code>ag</code>'s color scheme (the background color on the match makes it very hard for me to read), and I use a terminal with a white background. The screenshot in the README is my environment:</p>

<p>I see that your <code>green</code> is very very bright. Is that the problem for you? If so, you might want to tweak your terminal so that your green isn't so... fluorescent.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>One thing I missed is that <code>ag</code>'s green is actually darker for you. That's interesting. I wonder if it's because <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/src/printer.rs#L280">I'm using <code>BRIGHT_GREEN</code></a>, which I did because that makes it bold on Windows. It looks like I should probably use <code>GREEN</code> instead on Unix and only use the <code>BRIGHT_*</code> variants on Windows?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, I am not exactly married to ag's colour scheme either.</p>
<p>The <code>Bright Green</code> I have is the OSX Default in the Terminal Menu (0, 255, 0).  It does look a lot better in your screenshots though, so maybe I have some colour profile set somewhere else.</p>
<p>I've adjusted it in my <a href="https://github.com/cetra3/ripgrep/commit/b48914fa84f9c591e8f2739b4e2e86267402dbde">fork</a> to use the normal colours rather than bright (i.e, <code>Green</code> is (0, 166,0)) and it appears to look a bit nicer for my setup, but I am now questioning whether my setup is standard or not:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@cetra3 Yup, we just discovered the same thing at the same time. :-) <code>rg</code> should switch to <code>GREEN</code> but keep <code>BRIGHT_GREEN</code> on Windows. I misdiagnosed: I think your setup is fine.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>At, It would be easy to add some <code>#[cfg(windows)]</code> where needed if you'd want a PR for this.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think maybe including it in as part of <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/51">this issue</a> more properly is the way to go</p>
