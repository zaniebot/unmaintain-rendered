            <div class="timeline-body"><p>As title says, the case sensivity is not respected any more when the search pattern contains capitals within brackets.
As an example,
<code>rg --smart-case &#x27;[EÉ]conomie&#x27;</code>
returns also lowercase matches (&quot;economie&quot;).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I see. Under what circumstances should an uppercase literal be detected? Would <code>\p{Lu}</code> qualify? What about <code>[[:upper:]]</code>? Or what about <code>[@-a]</code>, which contains <code>A-Z</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some more thoughts on this.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is an uppercase literal in the regex pattern itself. For example, <code>[A-Z]foo</code> contains an uppercase literal, and therefore the search would be case sensitive. Another example, <code>foo\p{Lu}</code> (where <code>\p{Lu}</code> is the set of all uppercase Unicode letters) contains no uppercase literals and therefore would be a case insensitive search.</li>
<li>There are no literal characters at all. For example, <code>\p{Lu}</code> contains no literals, and therefore should be a case sensitive search.</li>
</ol>
<p>(2) is actually slightly tricky to implement because the regex parser is a bit too ambitious. e.g., After parsing, there&#x27;s no actual way to distinguish <code>\p{Lu}</code> from its correspond character class as if it were manually typed by the user.</p>
<p>This is kind of why I hate the smart case feature and why it&#x27;s not the default. In the simple case, it has nice behavior, but when your regex grows beyond literals, its behavior becomes unclear and less intuitive.</p>
<p>In the absence of input from others, I think I&#x27;d like to just implement rule (1) and call it a day. It would, for example, work in @ngirard&#x27;s case.</p>
