</ul>
What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>14.1.0 (rev e50df40a19)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>chocolatey</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Windows 11</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>When .gitignore ignores things, then explicitly includes subthings, rg does not search the subthings.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>*
!searchme
</code></pre>
<p>The searchme folder won&#x27;t be searched.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Run the following bash script</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
mkdir /tmp/rgtest
cd /tmp/rgtest
echo -e &quot;*\nsearchme&quot; &gt; .gitignore
git init
mkdir searchme
echo hello &gt; searchme/hello.txt
rg hello
</code></pre>
What is the actual behavior?
<p>Nothing is searched.</p>
What is the expected behavior?
<p>searchme folder should be searched</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Your repo omits the leading <code>!</code>, so in that case, <code>searchme</code> is never whitelisted.</p>
<p>But the problem here is that while <code>searchme</code> itself is whitelisted and ripgrep <em>does</em> descend into it (confirmed by running with <code>--debug</code>), the <code>*</code> rule still applies to things within <code>searchme</code>. That is, whitelisting <code>searchme</code> doesn&#x27;t automatically negate every previous ignore pattern for everything within <code>searchme</code>. That would be undesirable in most cases, even though it is pretty weird in this case.</p>
<p>The solution is to <em>also</em> add <code>!searchme/**</code> for your specific case. That will forcefully override previous ignore patterns.</p>
