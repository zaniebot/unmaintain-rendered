            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thank you for fast reply. I am not really sure, because I installed cargo solely to install ripgrep, and it seems that I do not even have rustc in PATH, but <code>cargo -V</code> outputs <code>cargo 0.8.0 (built 2016-03-22)</code>, so I guess it is outdated then.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yup. Definitely too old. You can download a binary release though (which i
realize is not ideal).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I installed up-to-date version of cargo, so now it is working. And yeah, downloading binary release is not ideal, but at least there is a binary release, many popular projects do not even bother with them. Anyway, my problem is solved, thank you for your help, closing this issue.</p>
