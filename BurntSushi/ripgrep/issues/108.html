Not saying it is better in any way, but maybe you want to mention it in your documentation.</p>
<p>Same goes for http://rak.rubyforge.org ?</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for the nice background documentation on why some tools are faster than others. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;ll take a look at both. I think I had come across them in my travels, but hadn&#x27;t taken a serious look. I&#x27;m kind of assuming that since they&#x27;re written in Python/Ruby that they won&#x27;t be competitive.</p>
<p>I probably also don&#x27;t want to get into the business of listing every search tool in existence either. But I&#x27;ll at least check them out. Thanks for the heads up.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>grin</code> is very very slow. This meets my expectation, not only because it&#x27;s Python, but because Python&#x27;s regex engine isn&#x27;t known for being particularly speedy. Here are some very basic benchmarks.</p>

<p><code>grin</code> hasn&#x27;t seen any updates in six years. The project is dead. It&#x27;s not worth including in the README.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>rak</code> is even worse on literals, but doesn&#x27;t degrade as badly on a more complex regexes like <code>grin</code> does. My guess is that <code>grin</code> does a literal optimization while <code>rak</code> doesn&#x27;t, but I haven&#x27;t looked at the source code of either.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks.  I sort of expected that slowness, too, but I also liked your summary of the background of the different regex engines etc., so I thought you might want to mention them in the documentation / blog post.
Again, thanks for all the effort!</p>
