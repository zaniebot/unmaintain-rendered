# Incomplete matches when using the `--word-regexp` flag

#### What version of ripgrep are you using?
ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)

#### How did you install ripgrep?
`wget https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/13.0.0/ripgrep-13.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
Mac and Linux

#### Describe your bug.
According to the manual: 
```
-w, --word-regexp
            Only show matches surrounded by word boundaries. This is roughly equivalent to
            putting \b before and after all of the search patterns.
```

I'm using this text as a sample file:
```
some.domain.com
some.domain.com/x
some.domain.com
```

And here is some very naive regex that searches for "domains" (not really, but it is enough to show the problem):
`"([\w]+[.])*domain[.](\w)+`

Running this regex with the `-w` flag (`rg -w "([\w]+[.])*domain[.](\w)+"`) matches the first and third strings properly (`some.domain.com`), but for the second one **starts capturing from the second char onwards**, meaning it matches `ome.domain.com`.

If I change the execution, remove the `-w` flag and wrap the regex with `\b` (`rg "\b([\w]+[.])*domain[.](\w)+\b"`), then all lines are matched properly (`some.domain.com` is matched).

#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
Explained above.

#### What is the actual behavior?
https://gist.github.com/ilia-cy/396f43f57057e42723d4a3dc87d4e994
The matches aren't shown here because they are highlighted in the terminal, so i'm adding a screenshot:

#### What is the expected behavior?
I would expect that the flag usage would work similarly as wrapping the pattern with `\b` (as the manual indicates), so that all the `some.domain.com` instances will be matched.
