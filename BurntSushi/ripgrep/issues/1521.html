<p>ripgrep 0.10.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD -AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>rg through debian buster</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>after moving  the current directory to a different disk, rg fails with
&quot;No such file or directory (os error 2)&quot;</p>
<p>to reproduce:
mkdir t
cd t
mv ../t /mnt/external
cat ~/file|rg 60</p>
<p>I would like to see this fixed because I switch between grep and rg ocassionally.</p>
