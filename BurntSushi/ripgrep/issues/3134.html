            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello! I use the <code>--pre</code> and <code>--pre-glob</code> flags to search PDFs as suggested in the man page in my global <code>ripgreprc</code>. Since my pre-script is in my home directory, I&#x27;d like to somehow be able to reference it from the ripgreprc but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work (anymore?).</p>
<p>Using <code>~</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>--pre=~/.config/rg/pre-pdf.sh
--pre-glob=*.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>results in</p>
<pre><code>rg: ...: preprocessor command could not start: &#x27;&quot;~/.config/rg/pre-pdf.sh&quot; &quot;...&quot;&#x27;: No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>maybe because of the single quotes that surround the command? Same thing happens with <code>$HOME</code>. I feel like it used to work with <code>~</code> at some point but I won&#x27;t be able to verify that.</p>
<p>For now I&#x27;m using the absolute path which does work but is not nice. Alternatively to the home directory, I&#x27;d also be happy supplying a path relative to the ripgreprc but that&#x27;s probably more complicated than the home directory expansion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>What I think some folks don&#x27;t understand is that ripgrep&#x27;s &quot;config file&quot; is literally nothing more than prepending a series of command line arguments to whatever you invoke <code>rg</code> with in your shell. You can read about its development history in #196 and why I settled on that design. But the short story is that adding aliases and wrapper scripts is more difficult than it ought to be for Windows users, and so having a config file in that context is genuinely useful. But on Linux, there is <em>very little</em> friction to creating a wrapper script instead. So if you need parameter expansion or some other kind of logic in your config file, you can and should just create a wrapper script. You aren&#x27;t losing anything by doing that compared to using <code>RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH</code>.</p>
<p>If it weren&#x27;t for Windows users, it&#x27;s likely I never would have added support for a global persistent configuration file.</p>
