            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 11.0.2 (rev 9cb93abd11)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Official amd64 .deb package.</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Ubuntu 19.10 x64</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>The fish completions conflict with the completions provided by fish&#x27;s official Ubuntu (.deb) package, https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/ubuntu/release-3 , causing installation to fail.</p>
<p>Fish devs suggest at <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5822">fish-shell/fish-shell#5822</a>#issuecomment-585908454 that 3rd-party completions should be packaged to <code>/usr/share/fish/vendor_completions.d</code> instead of <code>/usr/share/fish/completions</code>, which is fish&#x27;s sole kingdom.</p>

<p>Is that what you meant by &quot;official&quot; deb package? I took that to mean the deb package in Debian&#x27;s repositories. But it looks like this should be fixed in my deb package as well. (Which is not official. It&#x27;s a binary package provided purely as a convenience.)</p>

<p>Yup, by &quot;official&quot; I meant the package published in the Releases page. Sorry for the confusion and thanks for re-opening.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@thernstig Do you really think it&#x27;s worth needling me about how I schedule my free time to do a release? I don&#x27;t. I mean, I wrote the policy. I linked the FAQ entry. Obviously I&#x27;m telling you that it applies. Moreover, this isn&#x27;t some written-in-stone-law that I have to obey. I made the language in the FAQ purposely vague to try to avoid people trying to lawyer me over it. I&#x27;ve now made it even more vague: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/ecec6147d117da638c933cf103a3ea14ce87102d</p>
<p>In any case, no, I do not see this as a high impact bug. First of all, this isn&#x27;t a regression. Nothing changed in the last release that made this a problem. Something else outside of my control appears to have changed. Second of all, my fix <em>only</em> applies to the ripgrep binary Debian package that I distribute. This fix does nothing to resolve any problems ripgrep may or may not have with other packages. If you all of a sudden can&#x27;t install the binary Debian package, then you can download the generic binary releases until the next release comes out. Or build the binary Debian package from source. Or, if you&#x27;re using Debian, use whatever release of ripgrep is in the Debian repos. Or, it looks like @zanchey posted a work-around (thank you for that).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It was merely a question, not implying it does fall under it. I think you read too much into my answer. Thanks for explaining. All good 😃</p>
