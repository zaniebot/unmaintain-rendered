            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 11.0.2 (rev 3de31f7527)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>Github binary release for Windows 64bit (msvc)</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>using double quotes in the glob:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rg -g &quot;<em>mp4</em>&quot; --files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gives me a list of mp4 files in the tree below my cwd, as expected.</p>
<p>using single quotes in the glob:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rg -g '<em>mp4</em>' --files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>gives me nothing.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>I would assume double and single quotes would behave identical (as long as you don't mix them up).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't an issue with ripgrep, as far as I can tell. ripgrep doesn't care about quotes. This is almost certainly your shell. You'll need to consult the documentation for whatever shell you're using on Windows.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Tried it with cmd.exe, powershell and bash (through conemu). The behaviour is linked to cmd.exe... <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24173825/what-does-single-quote-do-in-windows-batch-files">StackOverflow</a> to the rescue. Apparently single quotes are simply ignored by cmd.exe except in a <code>for</code> statement. Of course, I should have know ;-)</p>
<p>Agreed this is not a bug in ripgrep. But it might be worth mentioning in the FAQ or docs...</p>
