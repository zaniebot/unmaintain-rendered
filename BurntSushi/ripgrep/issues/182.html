            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Tracking down why colors aren&#x27;t working has historically been a very challenging task because a lot of it is dependent on your environment. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ TERM=foobar rg --color=always PATTERN --debug
</code></pre>
<p>Colors no longer work. The <code>--debug</code> flag might show a lot of other junk, but in my case, I do see this:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG:rg::out: error loading terminfo for coloring: could not find a terminfo entry for this terminal
</code></pre>
<p>If I try this with GNU grep, colors still work, even if my <code>TERM</code> setting is nonsensical:</p>
<pre><code>TERM=foobar grep --color=always PATTERN *
</code></pre>
<p>So this could be one possible explanation. There may be other problems. For example, if <code>TERM</code> is unset:</p>
<pre><code>$ unset TERM
$ rg --color=always PATTERN --debug
</code></pre>
<p>In the debug output, I see:</p>
<pre><code>DEBUG:rg::out: error loading terminfo for coloring: TERM environment variable unset, unable to detect a terminal
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, GNU grep still works. It seems GNU grep will fall back to some default settings that <code>ripgrep</code> doesn&#x27;t do, and maybe we should do that. In the mean time, my strong suspicion is that something about your environment isn&#x27;t configured correctly and GNU grep is bailing you out.</p>
<p>So, can you run <code>rg</code> with <code>--debug</code> and see if you can find the relevant error message? If not, you can just post the entire output. If that doesn&#x27;t turn up anything, what is the value of <code>TERM</code> when <code>rg</code> is run? What about <code>TERMINFO</code>?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Having <code>TERMINFO</code> unset is OK. <code>ripgrep</code> will look in standard locations for your terminfo database.</p>
<p>Indeed, if I set <code>TERM=dumb</code>, then I also get the same error message as you.</p>
<p>So... It sounds like you need to change your <code>TERM</code> to a setting that supports colors. There&#x27;s more info on the <code>dumb</code> setting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39001517/features-obligatory-for-term-dumb-terminal">here</a> and <a href="http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10137/what-does-term-dumb-in-eshell-mean">here</a>. Running <code>infocmp dumb</code> shows that a <code>dumb</code> terminal has very limited capabilities. If Emacs does indeed support colors, then it sounds like you&#x27;ll need to change your <code>TERM</code> environment variable to something else.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ticki You seem to know a thing or two about this sort of thing. Can you make sense of this? I notice in your <code>termion</code> library, you don&#x27;t read from the <code>TERMINFO</code> database and hardcode escape sequences. Does this work correctly across all terminals? (I suppose you&#x27;re in good company, since GNU grep does the same.) If so, what&#x27;s the purpose of the <code>TERMINFO</code> database in the first place? For things more advanced than colors?</p>

<p>Ok, just found that if I set TERM to eterm-color colors with ripgrep are
working, so perhaps it is the one to use when TERM=dumb ?</p>
<p>BTW ripgrep is using a basic red color, how do we configure which color
to use ?
Does ripgrep obey to <code>GREP_COLORS</code> env var ? Seems no.
Does it have a config file where we can set this ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>From reading the source of <code>termion</code>, I wonder if it&#x27;d be better to stop using the <code>term</code> crate, switch to <code>termion</code> for POSIX compatible stuff and handroll Windows support. This would mean not supporting the <code>TERMINFO</code> database, and I&#x27;m not sure what the implications of that are.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi So TERMINFO is mostly for detecting compatibility, but is only really relevant for very old terminals. Termion implements escapes which are supported by virtually every VTE used today (most of it is straight out of the ANSI standards, some are ones introduced by xterm). For the Windows stuff: I&#x27;m not that familiar with the Windows API, but I&#x27;m more than willing to accept a PR adding Windows support to Termion (i.e. adding the winapi calls to the formatter, I guess).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ticki Got ya. Given that every other tool in this space seems to not care about <code>TERMINFO</code>, it seems OK for <code>ripgrep</code> to do the same. With that in mind, I&#x27;d like to switch Unix handling to using <code>termion</code>, which I think should be straight-forward.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend treading carefully with Windows. For Windows, you need to make <em>synchronous</em> API calls to the console you&#x27;re writing to, which means that you can&#x27;t really implement Windows support in some arbitrary formatter that can write to anything. For <code>ripgrep</code>, this is particularly bad because we want to write matches to an in memory buffer and only actually print them later. There are a couple ways of doing this, including writing an ANSI interpreter, but I opted for something simpler but just as hacky: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/src/terminal_win.rs</p>
<p>What I&#x27;m saying is: as a future user of <code>termion</code>, I don&#x27;t expect you to support Windows for this. I expect to be subjected to grueling pain. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@thierryvolpiatto Thanks for taking the time to try and confirm the fix! Sorry it isn&#x27;t working right for you. It&#x27;s hard for me to understand your comment, but you&#x27;re saying you can&#x27;t get ripgrep <code>0.3.2</code> to output colors at all in emacs, regardless of any workaround? Can you try <code>--color ansi</code> instead of <code>--color always</code>? Also, what operation system are you on?</p>
<p>I honestly have no clue what&#x27;s going on. If you have <code>--color always</code> on non-Windows platforms, then it should always emit ANSI escape sequences now. On Windows however, <code>--color always</code> will always attempt to use the native console API for colors, which might not work in emacs. Instead, <code>--color ansi</code> will force the issue for ANSI escapes. Alternatively, <code>--color auto</code> with <code>TERM=eterm-color</code> should also work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting! That did the trick. Something is definitely a little weird, however, I am seeing that the match text is at least <em>bolded</em>, but it&#x27;s not colored.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Errrmm, but I am using latest master which has some fixes related to that, so that might not be the case for <code>0.3.2</code>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can reproduce the fundamental problem, so hopefully I can fix this. Thank you. :-)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ah! I figured it out. It looks like the emacs terminal has very limited support for ANSI escape sequences, and doesn&#x27;t actually work with constructs like <code>\x1B[38;5;4m</code> to set the text to blue (for example). Instead, it needs <code>\x1B[34m</code>. I think I just need to straighten this out and we should be good.</p>

<p>I installed rust and builded rg from master, and I can confirm rg is now
outputing colors as expected :-).</p>
<p>Many thanks for your quick fix and for rg!</p>
