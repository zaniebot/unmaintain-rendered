            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I was on mobile before. Here&#x27;s a more useful workaround:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat $HOME/bin/rgp
#!/bin/sh

exec rg -p &quot;$@&quot; | less -RFX
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can just use <code>rgp</code> whenever you want to have a pager pause results for you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Can there be a flag to (more intelligently) do that with ripgrep alone? Akin to what <code>git grep</code> does: forking <code>$PAGER</code> and connecting stdout to <code>$PAGER</code>&#x27;s stdin, but only with interactive sessions. Would you accept a patch that does that?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ibotty I think that has already been requested. I&#x27;m on mobile, but could you please find that issue, read it, and respond to the arguments given against doing that? I would in particular like to hear what a wrapper script is insufficient.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>That is the issue I am responding to.</p>
<p>A wrapper script is not as comfortable as command line flags. I do use such a wrapper script (as <code>rg</code>), but whenever I want to pipe rg&#x27;s output I have to remember using <code>\rg</code>. It&#x27;s no big deal, but not as nice as a built-in mechanism.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@ibotty Sorry, this was the issue I was referring to: <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/86">BurntSushi/ripgrep#86</a> --- It would help if you addressed the concerns in that issue (is this a cross platform feature?) and why specifically you can&#x27;t pipe when using <code>less -RFX</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh, I can and do pipe to <code>less -RFX</code>. I&#x27;ll comment on #86.</p>
