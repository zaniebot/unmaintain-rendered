            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It would be nice to have support for the <code>LS_COLORS</code> variable used by various other programs (<code>fd</code> and <code>lf</code> come to mind) to highlight file paths with different colors depending on their type.</p>
<p>The following screenshot compares the output of <code>rg</code>, which currently uses a static color (magenta?) for all files, versus <code>fd</code>, which supports <code>LS_COLORS</code>, in a directory with a markdown file, a rust file and a pdf:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fair enough, but the current mechanism is quite limiting as it only allows specifying colors for the path <em>as a whole</em>, with no distinction for different file extensions (e.g. pdf files vs rust files) or different path components (e.g. parent directory vs file name).</p>
<p>This wouldn't be a replacement of the current colors implementation (it only applies to the <code>path</code> <code>{style}</code>), just a nice option to have.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is a bit tangled. The current <em>mechanism</em> doesn't prevent this. It's just there there is no color type (or indeed, any configuration inside of ripgrep) that permits this granularity of color control. But this has nothing to do with <code>LS_COLORS</code> support.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes, I'm okay with that. I'm not too interested in giving super granular control over colors.</p>
<p>So it kind of sounds like you got two separate issues tangled up here. One of them is &quot;I want a different way to specify colors.&quot; The other is, &quot;I want more control over the color of different parts of the output.&quot; Incidentally, I think my answer is &quot;no&quot; to both.</p>
