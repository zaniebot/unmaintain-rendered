            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do this in my spare time.</li>
<li>I have a small child which makes my spare time incredibly limited.</li>
<li>I spent most of my spare time over the last three years <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/">rebuilding ripgrep's regex engine</a>.</li>
<li>There hasn't been a pressing need to put out a new release.</li>
<li>I try hard to amortize my work. This means I can take long sabbaticals from individual projects with occasional bursts of activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been working on the next release for the last couple months. It will be ready when it's ready.</p>
