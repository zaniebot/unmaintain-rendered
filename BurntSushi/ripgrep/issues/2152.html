            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>ripgrep 12.1.1 (rev 7cb211378a)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>via apt</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Ubuntu 18.04, Linux 5.10.0-051000-generic</p>
Describe your bug.
<p>ripgrep sometimes panics or hangs when searching a modestly-sized file hierarchy.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>I&#x27;m able to reproduce the hang ~25% of the time by calling <code>rg foo</code> in the root of my corpus.  It panics very rarely, &lt;1% of the time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t share the corpus I&#x27;m working with and I&#x27;m struggling to reproduce against other corpuses.  I&#x27;ll try to share some details that hopefully could be helpful.</p>
<p>The corpus is a git repo with the below stats.  As such, it&#x27;s mostly text files (I don&#x27;t know of any blobs) and it&#x27;s mostly ASCII-encoded.</p>
<pre><code>226 matches
188 matched lines
41 files contained matches
554 files searched
0 bytes printed
6329653 bytes searched
0.014501 seconds spent searching
0.021117 seconds
</code></pre>
<p>The corpus I&#x27;m searching has a bunch of minified javascript in it, so there are some very long individual lines.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also often searched along with another corpus that has a badly-formatted <code>.gitignore</code> that creates the below non-fatal errors.  I don&#x27;t know if ripgrep does some caching that could cause problems.</p>
<pre><code>./projects/another-corpus/path/to/.gitignore: line 11: error parsing glob &#x27;oblong-gs{{g_speak_version}}-{{project_name}}&#x27;: nested alternate groups are not allowed
./projects/another-corpus/path/to/.gitignore: line 12: error parsing glob &#x27;oblong-gs{{g_speak_version}}-{{project_name}}-dbg&#x27;: nested alternate groups are not allowed
</code></pre>
<p>I was also able to capture some of the state of ripgrep while it was in this hanging state.</p>
<p>The kernel stack while its hanging according to <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/stack</code> is</p>
<pre><code>[&lt;0&gt;] futex_wait_queue_me+0xbb/0x120
[&lt;0&gt;] futex_wait+0x105/0x240
[&lt;0&gt;] do_futex+0x10f/0x1e0
[&lt;0&gt;] __x64_sys_futex+0x13d/0x1d0
[&lt;0&gt;] do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90
[&lt;0&gt;] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9
</code></pre>
<p>According to <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/status</code>, ripgrep is in a sleeping state.  And according to <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/wchan</code>, ripgrep is sleeping in <code>futex_wait_queue_me</code>, so it seems as though there&#x27;s some unmet promise that&#x27;s being waited on.</p>
<p>If I pipe STDOUT to /dev/null, i.e.. <code>rg foo 1&gt;/dev/null</code>, then the error doesn&#x27;t occur.  At least not after a few dozen tries.</p>
<p>Again, I apologize for not providing more helpful reproduction steps.  I&#x27;m happy to pull more data from procfs to see what&#x27;s going on.  If there are any open corpuses that you think might hit similar parts of the code, I can try that as well.</p>
What is the actual behavior?

What is the expected behavior?
<p>The search doesn&#x27;t hang</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If we can&#x27;t reproduce this with the latest version, then I&#x27;m going to close this as fixed.</p>
<p>If you do see this again... Yeah, unfortunately, the only way forward here is for me to either get a reproduction or for you to debug it. And by &quot;debug&quot; it, I probably mean &quot;insert some printf statements in the code, re-compile, then reproduce it.&quot; Then repeat that procedure until you find the place in the code that it hangs.</p>
<p>My best guess is that the hanging comes from the parallel directory traversal in the <code>ignore</code> crate. There have been some subtle bugs there in the past, but none have been reported in quite some time.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that you see a panic occasionally. If you can get that panic with a full stack trace (by setting <code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code>), then that would help too.</p>
