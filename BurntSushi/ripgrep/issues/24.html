            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I just got very confused for quite a while, as my fingers tend to just naturally type <code>-r</code> which wanting a recursive search sometimes. The current <code>-r</code> does something (to me) really confusing (I'm not really sure what it would be useful for, but I'm sure it was added for a reason). However, it is (in my opinion) worth considering leaving <code>-r</code> unused, as it's such a common option people give to <code>grep</code> (then at least they get an error message).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The <code>-r</code> flag is short for <code>--replace</code>, which pretty much does what it says on the tin: it replaces each match with the value given to the flag, expanding capturing groups if necessary.</p>
<p>Can you suggest an alternative shorthand for <code>--replace</code>?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>You could use <code>-s</code> (like <code>sed s/.../.../</code>). But unfortunately <code>s</code> isn't one of the letters in <code>replace</code> :/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm sympathetic to this request. Muscle memory is tricky. But I really like <code>-r</code> as a short hand for <code>--replace</code>.</p>
<p>I'd prefer we try to fix this by making it clearer that <code>rg</code> will do recursive search. I added some clarification to the output of <code>--help</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi Maybe at least include this warning in the README.md?.   I found ripgrep a year or two ago (grep-&gt;ack-&gt;silversearcher)....</p>
<p>grep -r (recursive) memory  getting confused  -&gt; ends up nuking lots of files.  Fortunately, it was a fresh repo checkout but even figuring out what the glob actually replaced would have been a painful day in another directory :)</p>

<p>It is: &quot;ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>What? ripgrep doesn't nuke anything. I don't know what you're talking about. When complaining, please be <strong>specific.</strong></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Ack @BurntSushi;   You're correct and it's my bad.   I only saw it on the OUTPUT side and was bewildered :)</p>
