# rg --files triggers Windows Antimalware

https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/600 has regressed, it looks like that fix got lost

I confirmed that commenting out this section fixes the problem: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/ignore/src/walk.rs#L1407

So we just need a fix similar to the earlier one that avoids this check when in `--files` mode.
