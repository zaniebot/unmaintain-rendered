            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m going to pass on this. <code>file-line-{match}</code> is the standard grep format for showing contextual lines. I don&#x27;t think another flag is worth adding to change this behavior. If you want other programs to understand the <code>file-line</code> format, then teach them. If you can&#x27;t teach them, then write a wrapper script that understands the <code>file-line</code> format and translates it to something they understand.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi could we please re-open? <code>file-line-match</code> is inherently ambiguous because <code>-</code> is valid in filenames, so there&#x27;s no reliable way to teach tools without introducing some other issues / corner cases, eg:</p>
<pre><code>compiler/README-10-bar.txt
</code></pre>
<p>is this a file <code>compiler/README-10-bar.txt</code> or <code>compiler/README</code> at line <code>10</code> followed by context <code>bar.txt</code>
there&#x27;s no way to tell.</p>
<p>Allowing customizing the 1st separator is simple and would solve this; eg:</p>
<pre><code># default:
compiler/README-10-bar.txt
# with rg --contextSep=&#x27;:&#x27;
compiler/README:10-bar.txt
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>:</code> is just as valid in file names (at least on UNIX), so that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be much better</p>
<p>Anyway, if you use <code>-0</code> the file name will be separated from the line number (or match) by a <code>NUL</code>; the output should be pretty reliably machine-parseable then</p>
