<p>When downloading binaries from a GitHub releases page, or downloads/release pages in general, it would be beneficial to have something of a checksums file available for reference.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub CLI: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v1.9.2</li>
<li>GitLab CLI: https://github.com/profclems/glab/releases/tag/v1.16.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Both have a <code>*.txt</code> file for referencing hashes, such as <code>checksums.txt</code> or other naming convention.</p>
<p>This is a good idea in order to verify the integrity of a downloaded binary.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-verify-ubuntu#1-overview</li>
<li>https://docs.hak5.org/hc/en-us/articles/360049922674-How-to-verify-the-SHA256-checksum-of-a-downloaded-file</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...it is definitely reassuring to be able to verify that the image [or artifact] you have downloaded is not corrupted in some way, and also that it is an authentic image [or artifact] that hasn’t been tampered with.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Describe the solution you'd like</strong></p>
<p>A release page should have a <code>*.txt</code> file for checksums of release artifacts, in the format similar to the GitHub and GitLab CLI checksum files I provided.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/"><code>salt</code></a> to install packages like <code>ripgrep</code>, and by default they support checksum validation by referencing the file examples given above for GitLab/GitHub CLI downloads. :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I would be okay with this. It seems like a good idea, probably not much work and is unlikely to be a maintenance hazard.</p>
<p>I doubt I'll do this myself (any time soon), so if someone wanted to take a stab at it, that would be great!</p>
