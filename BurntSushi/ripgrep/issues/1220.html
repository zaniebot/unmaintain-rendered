            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Assuming you didn't understand the feature request, I explain here. If you did, but not the use case, please skip this.</p>
<p>Currently PATH is the last argument to a ripgrep invocation.</p>
<p><code>ripgrep dependencies rust_examples</code> would be one such invocation.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is a way to mention the pattern at the end so that it can be useful in programs that need it such (read on for  a concrete example)</p>
<p>The invocation would look like this:</p>
<p><code>ripgrep --path $RUST_STDLIB_SRC --path $RUST_COOKBOOK_SRC -e std::vec::Vec</code></p>
<p>Here the pattern to search comes last.</p>
<p>Concrete example (I only have one, sorry I said &quot;programs&quot;):</p>
<p>I want to set vim keywordprg to <code>let &amp;keywordprg=':grep! -p $RUST_STDLIB_SRC -p $RUST_EXAMPLE -e</code></p>
<p>My grepprg is <code>rg\ --vimgrep\ --no-heading\ --hidden</code></p>
<p>What I'm trying to achieve is that everytime I hit <code>K</code>, I can see usages and definitions of a class in the rust standard library and a canonical example project.</p>
<p>Please do let me know if I am still not clear. Since you added --vimgrep, I am hopeful I can persuade you to consider this option as worth being adding.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I still don't understand why you need a flag for this. The paths you search don't actually need to be the last argument. When you use the <code>-e</code> flag, ripgrep automatically figures this out. Try this from the root of the ripgrep repository, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg ./grep-matcher ./globset -e 'fn is_empty'
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>And I thought PATH always had to be the last argument! Thanks for answering and for a brilliant tool!</p>
