            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I sort of thought the use case was obvious: I want to see matches for a given pattern in a bunch of files but I don't care what files the matches are in. For example, if I want to search for log entries matching a pattern in a bunch of compressed log files which are split up only so they don't get too big, then each matching log line fully identifies everything I need to know about it in the log line itself; I don't care about the file name when looking at the results.</p>
