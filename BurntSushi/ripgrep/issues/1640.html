            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<pre><code>./rg --version
ripgrep 11.0.1 (rev 973de50c9e)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>This is part of a plugin in vscode im not sure if its bundled with the main app or a plugin.</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>macOS Catalina 10.15.4 (19E266)</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>See images:
https://imgur.com/a/5nHcyoe</p>
<p>System ground to a halt when vscode was doing something.</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>I dont know, I was checking my installed extensions and looking at my settings.json as I am migrating to a new macbook.
I don't remember doing anything except maybe typing a search term in the Extensions input box.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>All I can see is that the process was using 30gb of memory and my system nearly froze, its a 6-core 2018 MBP with 16gb of ram.</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Is it possible to throttle / prevent ripgrep from consuming too much memory by limiting how much it takes in at a time?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This isn't actionable without a command line reproduction on a particular corpus that I can access. Sorry.</p>
<p>And your version of ripgrep is pretty old. Please upgrade.</p>
