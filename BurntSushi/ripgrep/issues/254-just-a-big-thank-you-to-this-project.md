# Just a big Thank You to this project!

_@Jiehong_

**This isn't a bug**, but I simply wanted to express how thankful I am for this project!

It's working great! It's fast! It's has a great CLI!

The best point is the static releases for Linux, so that I can easily install rg on machines on which I cannot compile rust!

# Thanks everyone for making this great project happen!
