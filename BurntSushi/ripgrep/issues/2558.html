            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Dear contributors and owners:
I know ripgrep is not a kind of some application which is keen on release new versions, but it&#x27;s been a while that ripgrep has no new version for almost two years.
Hope it has a new version released which make your recent efforts meaningfull!
Thanks!</p>
