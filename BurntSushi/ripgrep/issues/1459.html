            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Possibly a silly question - would it be possible (or feasible) to extend ripgrep to be able to search in git trees (like other branches / commits) similar to how <code>git grep</code> does it?  I really like the tool, its speed, set of options etc. - but need to be able to search other branches / all commits (like https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog does).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It&#x27;s a neat idea, but I think it&#x27;s definitively outside the scope of ripgrep. The additional flags required for such a rich feature alone would, I&#x27;m guessing, probably increase ripgrep&#x27;s surface area by a significant amount. However, someone could use ripgrep&#x27;s libraries to build a new command line tool dedicated to the purpose. That seems like a better approach to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I ran into a similar issue - doing a global search for something, only to realize it was in an older branch (took me multiple hours!).  I honestly wish there was a way for <code>rg</code> to even just give an indication that the needed content is gziped (?) inside the git repo - so that I could start searching its content using other tools...</p>
