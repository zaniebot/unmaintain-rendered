            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Would there be any interest in limiting the column length to a sane value by default so that machine-generated/machine-parsed ASCII files containing &quot;lines&quot; that are several MiB long do not take over the output?</p>
<p>e.g. how would you feel if <code>-M</code> defaulted to something like <code>80*24</code> (being the default terminal window size on many systems) with <code>-M 0</code> disabling this limit?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think reasonable people could go either way on this. IMO, I kind of like the current behavior where the default is that you see everything. Since searching is (typically) so fast, it's typically not onerous to re-run the command with <code>-M100</code> (or whatever) if you happen to get spammed with a very long line. Of course, if you happen to see long lines very frequently in your searches, then perhaps <code>-M100</code> (or whatever) would be reasonable to enable by default. You can do that today by defining an alias in your shell, e.g., for bash that's <code>alias rg=&quot;rg -M100&quot;</code>. The downside there is that <code>rg -M100 -M0</code> yields an error since the <code>-M</code> flag can't be specified more than once. So perhaps if we fixed that such that the most recent value &quot;wins&quot;, then this would be a reasonable compromise?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Coming back to this, I don't think we should be limiting column length by default. Uses can add something like <code>-M100</code> in their alias, and once #196 is done, users could add <code>-M0</code> to override the previous <code>-M100</code>.</p>
