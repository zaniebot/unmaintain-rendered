<p>When searching for fixed strings (-F), dash (-) in pattern should be ignored, but it returns rg: unrecognized flag -&gt;</p>
<p>I looked at <code>man</code> page, and saw that I can use <code>-e</code>, but it&#x27;s strange, because I&#x27;m not looking for a regex pattern.</p>
<p>In my case, I was searching: <code>rg -F &#x27;-&gt; Result&#x27;</code></p>
<p>I also tested, and realized that I can combine both: <code>rg -Fe &#x27;-&gt; Result&#x27;</code>, which already solves my problem.
So this is a small issue.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll still open the issue, because I think it&#x27;s unintuitive when using <code>-F</code>
but I understand that handling starting with <code>-</code> is edge case, and would probably complicate things.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s great that <code>-Fe</code> works, though!! 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is intended behavior. <code>-F</code> is a boolean switch that doesn&#x27;t accept a parameter. So it isn&#x27;t possible to disambiguate a pattern starting with a <code>-</code> and some other flag. Hence why you need <code>-e</code>, which always knows the next argument is a pattern.</p>
<p>A &quot;pattern&quot; is common terminology for not just a regex but also a plain literal.</p>
