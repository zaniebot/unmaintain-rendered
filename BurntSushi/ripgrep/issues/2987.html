<p>When searching for fixed strings (-F), dash (-) in pattern should be ignored, but it returns rg: unrecognized flag -&gt;</p>
<p>I looked at <code>man</code> page, and saw that I can use <code>-e</code>, but it's strange, because I'm not looking for a regex pattern.</p>
<p>In my case, I was searching: <code>rg -F '-&gt; Result'</code></p>
<p>I also tested, and realized that I can combine both: <code>rg -Fe '-&gt; Result'</code>, which already solves my problem.
So this is a small issue.</p>
<p>I'll still open the issue, because I think it's unintuitive when using <code>-F</code>
but I understand that handling starting with <code>-</code> is edge case, and would probably complicate things.</p>
<p>It's great that <code>-Fe</code> works, though!! 😄</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is intended behavior. <code>-F</code> is a boolean switch that doesn't accept a parameter. So it isn't possible to disambiguate a pattern starting with a <code>-</code> and some other flag. Hence why you need <code>-e</code>, which always knows the next argument is a pattern.</p>
<p>A &quot;pattern&quot; is common terminology for not just a regex but also a plain literal.</p>
