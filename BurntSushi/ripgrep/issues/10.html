<p>Fedora is getting Rust packaged soon, so that may be plausible.</p>
<p>Sadly, we may need to live with binaries distributed here for the time being.</p>

I also added <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ripgrep/">ripgrep to the Archlinux user repository</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the brew formula isn't actually in Homebrew, and it downloads a binary, which is really bad form. I'd like to fix it, but I'm not quite sure how.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>rust does appear to be packaged in Homebrew (http://braumeister.org/formula/rust) - just a heads-up.</p>
<p>The current approach uses a 'bottle' and so pulls binaries and should work just fine. It /does/ install cargo. It currently builds from source on the latest macOS Sierra, because the formula hasn't been updated to include a bottle for that yet.</p>

If your packaging story requires you to use the Rust that is already packaged, then it's probably a stable Rust, which means you can't use <code>simd-accel</code>.</p>

<p>In practice, no, I don't think so. Almost all provide bottles and I think it's considered good form to allow that (just for speed probably). However, you are right that they also all provide source compile, and not doing so is probably bad form.</p>

<p>@CrashyBang I've never created an Ubuntu package before (and I don't use Ubuntu), so I'm not terribly familiar with how it works. Ubuntu would at least need to have Rust 1.9 and Cargo in its repos. If it has that, then <code>ripgrep</code> can be packaged.</p>

<li>Thanks for that FAQ entry, I didn't know about the <code>--frozen</code> flag.  Fedora is still sorting out what their Rust package guidelines will look like, so hopefully that tidbit will be useful in the discussion.  The dependencies are going to be a biggest thing to sort out.  Hopefully there is a way to package the source files of rust libraries into &quot;-devel&quot; packages, which can then be installed and referenced in other build roots without full internet access.</li>
<li>I went ahead and wrote the instructions up for you in #183.</li>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hey @mattiasb! We can take this conversation to <a href="https://github.com/dstcruz/chocolatey-mypackages/tree/master/packages/ripgrep">the ripgrep chocolatey package repo</a> if it turns out to be a packaging issue.  Right now all the package is doing is fetching and unzipping (the released zip files)[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases].  According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30811668/php-7-missing-vcruntime140-dll">this stackoverflow post</a>, it would seem that due to me packaging the MSVC files, we might be missing that. Could you try downloading an testing the windows-gnu files from the releases link? If that works better I might switch to using those instead.</p>
<p>The decision to use the MSVC over the windows-gnu files was quite arbitrary. I don't know exactly what the difference is.  I'm curious to know if the windows-gnu files have other dependencies that we might need to take care of also.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dstcruz I'm not a Windows expert, but my understanding is that MSVC should be preferred, but that the GNU version doesn't require any external dependencies. My understanding though is that MSVC does require  having the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145">Microsoft VC++ 2015 redistributable</a> installed. I've been told that one can bundle this with the ripgrep executable though.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Binaries linked using mingw come with bloat that needs to be stripped and even then aren't as small as binaries linked using msvc. Binaries linked using mingw come with dwarf debuginfo, so you can't ask the OS for backtraces, and libbacktrace is broken so you can't get backtraces that way either, meanwhile msvc backtraces work great when you have the PDB. The redistributable issue will soon be a non-issue due to https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37545 so msvc can statically link the CRT. So basically the only remaining point in MinGW's favor is that MinGW itself is open source.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@retep998 thanks for the info. I'll keep the MSVC version then as the package, and include a dep to the vcredist2015 package.  Any way I can be alerted when <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37545">rust-lang/rust#37545</a> becomes a reality and is used by ripgrep and I can stop making the vcredist2015 a dep?

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. That's all you need to do.</p>
<p>The other files are nice-to-haves if you want <code>rg</code> integrated into your shell. e.g. the <code>rg.bash-completion</code> is so you can do <code>rg --p&lt;tab&gt;</code> and see all the options that begin with <code>p</code>. If you use the fish shell, you use <code>rg.fish</code>. If you use zsh, you use <code>_rg</code>, and if you use powershell you use <code>_rg.ps1</code>.</p>
<p><code>rg.1</code> is a manpage. You can copy that to wherever you keep your manpages. (you probably won't use <code>man rg</code> and will instead use <code>rg --help</code> or look up docs online so this is also not required.</p>

You are still quite welcome to get involved in the SIG!  And FWIW, I want a solution not using &quot;with&quot; too: https://pagure.io/fedora-rust/rust2rpm/issue/29</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since we didn't hear back from @CrashyBang and 17.04 came out recently (which has repos for rustc 1.16 and cargo 0.17) I tried to build a package myself.
Seems like Launchpad forbids internet access during build and I'm not sure how to get the build dependencies to run cargo with <code>--frozen</code> (maybe something similar to cargo-vendor?).</p>
<p>If anyone has an idea on this, please let me know.</p>
<p>Other than that you can run</p>
<pre><code>apt install cargo
cargo install ripgrep
</code></pre>
<p>on Ubuntu 17.04 (if you don't mind having 360mb &quot;overhead&quot; for cargo)</p>
<p>edit: I could of course provide *.deb binary-packages for Ubuntu.. but I for myself wouldn't trust binaries of random strangers on the internet ;)

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@x4121 Depending on how far you want to go packaging it &quot;correctly&quot;, you have two options.</p>
<p>Easy but not policy-compliant (note: cargo-vendor might help you with some of this): download and unpack all the .crate files for all the dependencies (recursively), as well as ripgrep itself, and unpack them all in subdirectories of a single directory that you use as the source. In each one, put a <code>.cargo-checksum.json</code> file, containing <code>{&quot;package&quot;:&quot;$SHA256&quot;,&quot;files&quot;:{}}</code> , where <code>$SHA256</code> is the sha256 checksum of the .crate file.  Create a directory containing a <code>.cargo/config</code> file, containing this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[source.crates-io]
replace-with = &quot;my-registry&quot;

[source.my-registry]
directory = &quot;/path/to/the/vendor/directory&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Then run <code>CARGO_HOME=/the/source/directory cargo install ripgrep --root some/installation/path</code> and copy the binary in place from that installation path.</p>
<p>If you want to build policy-compliant debs, then give debcargo a try.  <code>cargo install debcargo</code>.  You'll also need dh-cargo from Debian experimental.  You can use debcargo to build a deb for each package, then upload all those packages to your PPA in dependency order (to build using each other).</p>

Having the dependencies with the build files is IMHO 'prettier' than having to build all ~40 dependencies inside a PPA. Having everything (including debcargo) in the (non-experimental) Debian/Ubuntu-Sources would be nicer, of course.</p>
<p>I created a separate PPA for the package (so no accidental installation of other stuff):

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I tried creating a package using debcargo, but I got caught up in a sort of dependency hell. Running <code>debcargo package ripgrep</code> creates a directory containing a <code>debian</code> directory. The control file specifies several build dependencies, such as <code>librust-bytecount-0.1+default-dev</code> and <code>librust-lazy-static-0.2+default-dev</code>. These in turn can be build using debcargo, and then you need the dependencies of those dependencies, and so on. Eventually I hit a problem where I did have a package, but it was the wrong kind. E.g. some package depends on librust-regex-0.2+default-dev but I only got librust-regex-0.2+simd-accel-dev_0.2.2-1_all.deb.</p>
<p>Besides debcargo there is also <a href="https://github.com/mmstick/cargo-deb">cargo-deb</a>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@apeduru as far as I understood @Sjord (and what was my problem as well), you can't really download stuff during build (as cargo does) when building &quot;official&quot; Debian/Ubuntu packages. AFAIK everything you need during build has to be provided as source or another &quot;official&quot; Debian/Ubuntu package. This makes builds very stable, secure and reproducible but is not really compatible with the ideas behind things like cargo. That's why @Sjord got dependencies like <code>librust-bytecount-0.1+default-dev</code> and why I built it for myself shipping all dependencies with the source code.
Would be very happy if I understood this wrong or someone finds a way around this :confused:</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fedora has the same policy as Debian; dependencies must either be in the package sources or available as another official package (BuildRequires).  The unofficial <a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/carlwgeorge/ripgrep/">copr</a> I maintain for Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS downloads the dependencies during the build for now.  Fedora policy now allows bundled dependencies, so if ripgrep were to vendor it's dependencies I could take advantage of that.  Is that something you would consider @BurntSushi?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The end goal would be to have a single tarball for users to download that they could build ripgrep from without downloading any additional dependencies.  Committing snapshots of your dependencies to this repository is probably the easiest way to achieve that goal.  It seems to be more common in the golang ecosystem (examples: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/vendor">kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/vendor">moby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah/tree/master/vendor">buildah</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mholt/caddy/tree/master/vendor">caddy</a>) than the rust ecosystem.</p>
<p>I don't know if <code>cargo vendor</code> is the best way to achieve this, it's just the first thing I came across while searching.</p>
<p>I suppose it doesn't matter who does the actual committing of the dependencies, I just wanted to discuss it with you first.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>They did previously, but it was relaxed significantly.  It's more of a strong preference than a requirement now.</p>
<p>https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Bundling_and_Duplication_of_system_libraries</p>
<p>Context for the next paragraph: EPEL is a Fedora subproject that allows Fedora packagers to ship software for RHEL/CentOS that Red Hat doesn't include in the main distribution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Rust">Fedora Rust SIG</a> has been working on the Rust-specific guidelines for Fedora, as well as packaging many popular libraries.  However, they have chosen to make heavy use of a recent RPM feature called &quot;<a href="https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/pull/299">with rich dependencies</a>&quot;, to represent the dependency ranges in Rust.  That feature isn't available in RHEL7's version of RPM, so the work they are doing won't be able to be easily reused when building for RHEL7.  However, a tarball with bundled dependencies would circumvent the need for the dependency ranges, and allow an official EPEL build for RHEL7.  That's the type of scenario where using bundled dependencies is acceptable, and already regularly occurs for golang software in EPEL.</p>
<p>On a related note, <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/rust@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/D7PYBU7JKGLRYR2HKRXBM6EGZZEDCK33/">last month ripgrep was been officially added to Fedora Rawhide</a>, meaning that it will be available from the default repos in Fedora 28 (due to be released in May 2018).</p>

<p>I think someone needs to do the work to add a release artifact. Unfortunately, I don't have a good way of testing this, since PRs, AFAIK, can't create release artifacts. So if someone was going to work on this, they'd need to test it in their own setup.</p>
<p>Note that I cannot add complex release artifacts. Doing releases is extraordinarily painful already because something always seems to fail. Increasing the rate of failures will directly impact the frequency of releases.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CosmicCuttlefish/ReleaseSchedule">Ubuntu 18.10 release schedule</a>, it <em>should</em> become available in the next Ubuntu release — the Debian Import Freeze is on 2018-08-23. However, it probably won't be backported to Ubuntu 18.04.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>There are some other hurdles as well. Currently the build-dependency tree of ripgrep contains packages that depend on other packages that were not yet uploaded. The reason is because when we package crate X for Debian, we generate packages for all of its features, X+featureY etc. However ripgrep does not require all of these features in order to build, which is why we were already able to package ripgrep for Debian Unstable.</p>
<p>However for the Debian Testing release process, it is not allowed to have a package X+featureY which depends on package Y that does not yet exist, because users cannot install it. Unfortunately this prevents packages X+featureY' (for all Y') from getting into Debian Testing, because they are all built from the same source package rust-X. So to have ripgrep in Debian Testing, we need to package some more rust packages until we have the full transitive closure of all features.</p>
<p>Presumably Ubuntu has a similar requirement.</p>
<p>For more details see the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/RustPackaging/Policy">Debian rust packaging policy</a> which explains the distinction between source vs binary packages, build-dependencies vs runtime-dependencies, etc.</p>

<p>This might affect ripgrep in the future because it's one of its dependencies. Right now we're compiling the default feature-set on Debian, which currently has no simd acceleration. If you want to add this to the default feature-set, the build will break unless you condition this for particular architectures.</p>
<p>I also notice for cargo-deb you're defining <code>features = [&quot;pcre2&quot;]</code> under <code>[package.metadata.deb]</code>. Since this is a <code>cargo-deb</code>-specific section I don't feel comfortable reading it, but if you want to add a &quot;debian&quot; feature-set I can have our tooling read and use that.</p>

<p>My problem with this whole thing generating more work is that the <code>simd</code> crate was, and for the foreseeable future, will be an experimental nightly only thing. The Rust ecosystem is moving through a transition period in how we handle SIMD, so there are growing pains here. The thing you desire is exactly where the ecosystem should be headed towards. For example, the regex crate used by ripgrep will auto-configure the use of SIMD at runtime, so that nobody but that code needs to worry about platform support. Unfortunately, some of ripgrep's dependencies (<code>encoding_rs</code> and <code>bytecount</code>, namely) haven't moved to this new model yet, but AFAIK, that is the <em>goal</em>. So for the time being, SIMD support in Rust is split between runtime support (auto-configured) and compile time support (burden pushed to the person running <code>cargo build</code>). I think I agree with you that even compile time support should be handled better, but there's nothing on the roadmap for that AFAIK and nobody has even thought to work on it. Probably because runtime detection is so much nicer when possible.</p>
<p>In other words, if it were up to me, I'd probably forget about packaging optional nightly only Rust features. (For ripgrep, that includes both <code>simd-accel</code> and <code>avx-accel</code>.) In particular, since I imagine you're only packaging stable Rust, and stable Rust cannot build ripgrep with either the <code>simd-accel</code> or <code>avx-accel</code> features anyway, I don't think I can even conceptualize how those features would be used in the Debian package ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought features <code>[ &quot;pcre2&quot; ]</code> in <code>[package.metadata.deb]</code> meant &quot;the Debian package should compile with --features pcre2&quot;.

My point was how to let crate developers specify which features they want us to build for the Debian package, if not the default feature set. I was suggesting just adding a &quot;debian&quot; feature for that purpose, rather adding that to a tool-specific section.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see. So let me try to play this back to you... What you want to know is whether, when someone does, <code>apt-get install ripgrep</code>, whether that should automatically come with PCRE2 support or not? My feeling there is that <em>yes</em>, it should, because it's better for users. So I think what you're saying is that you'd like to see a signal for that? So is this all you would want?</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[package.metadata.debian]
features = [&quot;pcre2&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Do you need/want any of the other metadata that's in the <code>package.metadata.deb</code> section?</p>
<p>I'm so sorry that I don't understand Debian's policy better. I'm sure that's part of the cause of what's making this difficult. I really really appreciate your time and patience with me as we figure this out. :-)</p>

<p>That is my understanding, yes. This is already true for <code>regex</code>. <code>bytecount</code> is <a href="https://github.com/llogiq/bytecount/pull/44">in the process</a> of moving to that model. I know less about <code>encoding_rs</code> though and what their specific plans are regarding runtime dispatch of optimized SIMD routines (cc @hsivonen).

<p>I know less about encoding_rs though and what their specific plans are regarding runtime dispatch of optimized SIMD routines (cc @hsivonen).

<p>The plan is not to add run-time dispatch. encoding_rs relies heavily on inlining, and I don't want to add complexity to support hardware that's so old as to be desupported by major browsers.</p>

<p>Do you mean the SIMD support in Rust isn't ready? Surely 64-bit POWER can be trusted to always have SIMD available. Even 32-bit PowerPC had it since G4. (I'm hoping to attempt SIMD-enabling encoding_rs on 32-bit PowerPC once the compiler and standard library support is there.)</p>

<p>That's unfortunate. That means the only way users of ripgrep will get encoding_rs's SIMD optimizations is by enabling compile time flags. (Which is the case today, but I figured Rust's support for runtime detection of CPU features would cause folks to use it so that &gt;SSE2 optimizations can be enabled automatically on CPUs that support it.)</p>

<p>It sounds like you're reserving the &quot;default&quot; feature to avoid installing extra stuff, how about a standard name like &quot;default+packaged&quot; for distros / package managers that can expect to package everything?</p>

<p>All of this is fine, my point is that this should be clearly documented in the rust-simd crate - so crates depending on rust-simd, such as encoding-rs and all of its dependents like ripgrep, can supply the correct <code>cfg</code> conditionals in their Cargo.toml. Or if they don't, distros like Debian have enough documentation to patch it in so that builds don't break on ppc64 etc. Currently I really have no idea, I have to guess by enabling <code>--feature simd+accel</code> on <code>ripgrep</code> and figure out whether build failures due to <code>encoding_rs</code>, on each of the 10 Debian architectures that have rust, are &quot;my fault&quot; or &quot;your fault&quot;.</p>
<p>(edit: then some build failures are even invisible, e.g. some of our x86 autobuilders have sse2 and some don't, and then it's up to <code>cargo test</code> to actually exercise these instructions which we don't do by default due to the possibility of dev-dependency loops)</p>

<p>To clarify this point, which I may not have made clear enough in my previous point - I think rust's own SIMD does work on ppc64 but some crates are using your crate <code>simd</code> as a dependency, which <a href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=rust-simd&amp;arch=ppc64&amp;ver=0.2.2-1&amp;stamp=1536046860&amp;raw=0">doesn't build on ppc64</a>. However neither <code>ripgrep</code> nor <code>encoding_rs</code> give any architecture conditionals in their <code>Cargo.toml</code>. If I wanted to experiment with enabling <code>simd+accel</code> for <code>ripgrep</code> in Debian, I have to figure out these <code>cfg</code> conditionals myself. But this information is not obvious and should be documented by <code>simd</code>. For example I had no idea it required sse on 32-bit x86 since the <a href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=rust-simd&amp;arch=i386&amp;ver=0.2.2-1&amp;stamp=1535879876&amp;raw=0">build worked on Debian 32-bit x86</a>, probably because that particular builder happened to support sse, and I generally don't investigate successful builds.</p>

<p>Right. encoding_rs uses very basic 128-bit SIMD, so the kind of SIMD it needs is always present on x86_64 and aarch64.</p>
<p>The flag is there just because SIMD still requires nightly. Once <code>std::simd</code> graduates to the release channel, the plan is to not require any feature flag and to instead look at target features only, so in the future I expect SIMD to be enabled if targeting x86_64, i686, aarch64 or thumbv7neon/armv7neon and be disabled if targeting i586 or armv7/thumbv7. (i686 and i586 used in the Rust target sense and not in the GCC target sense.)</p>

<p>Sorry about that. I added a note to the README of <code>simd</code> on trunk. The crate was that way when it was transferred to me and I've tried to keep changes to the minimum while waiting for <code>std::simd</code>. (This was already documented in the README for encoding_rs.)</p>
