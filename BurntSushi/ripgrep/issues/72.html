            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I admit, I find it a little weird for <code>ripgrep</code> to have a dedicated chat room. Filing issues seems like it ought to be enough.</p>
<p>With that said, if we do pursue this, I'd rather use IRC.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm just going to close this. I continue to think a chat room for a tool like this is a bit overkill.</p>
<p>If you want to chat with me, I'm usually on the various IRC/Mozilla Rust channels. <code>#rust</code> for Rust specific stuff, but <code>#rust-offtopic</code> will work for <code>ripgrep</code> stuff. If <code>ripgrep</code> traffic gets too heavy, then we can fork off into our own channel.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Since I've been linking people to this issue when they ask for a chat room, I figured I'd add a bit more context and some updates.</p>
<p>Firstly, I no longer hang around on IRC. The only chat rooms I visit these days are the Rust Discord server and the <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com">rust-lang Zulip server</a>. If you ping me on either of those places, I should see it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the problem with an officially endorsed chat room is that they require moderation. I am on the Rust moderation team, but I cannot spend my days sitting in a chat room moderating it.</p>
<p>As a compromise, I reached out to GitHub and specifically requested access to their Discussions beta program. You are now encouraged to post questions---any kind of question---in ripgrep's discussion board: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions</p>
