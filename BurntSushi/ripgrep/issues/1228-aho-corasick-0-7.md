# aho-corasick 0.7

_@igor-raits_

Hi @BurntSushi, I'm pretty sure you are planning to update aho-corasick at some point. Just curious if anytime soon.

I would be happy if you just have patch (doesn't have to be new release).

Thanks in advance!

The intent is to do it soonish, yes.

(One of the goals of the Aho-Corasick rewrite was to fix the slow performance of the `-f` flag when used with a large dictionary of literals.)
