            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hi.
When trying to integrate your wonderful tool inside vim using &#x27;let g:ctrlp_user_command = ...&#x27; I always got an error back because it seems that CtrlP always sends the path in windows format, which rg doesn&#x27;t like, because apparently it tries to interpret the path as a regex (I checked this on the command line).</p>
<p>Strangely enough, even when setting &#x27;shellslash&#x27; to on, the behaviour doesn&#x27;t change (I&#x27;m gonna open an issue with CtrlP about this), so I had to resort to a custom batch script that substitutes the backslashes with forward slashes. Hacky to say the least.. :P</p>
<p>I think backslash support in Windows should be improved. I&#x27;m surprised nobody had problems with this before.. I don&#x27;t know what the best approach would be, though. Maybe a specific switch or marker char that would mean &quot;use this verbatim&quot; or something?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for reporting this!</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about or how to reproduce the problem. ripgrep should have no problems with Windows paths on Windows.</p>
<p>Could you please try to reproduce the issue outside of ctrlp/vim? Also, could you please include other basic information like your ripgrep version and environment? E.g., cygwin or native Windows?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Of course I tried in the command line. In fact that&#x27;s how I found out / worked around the problem.
If I enter this in my terminal:
<code>&gt;rg --files .\repo\newrepo</code>
all I get is &quot;Literal &#x27;\n&#x27; not allowed&quot;.
If I do forward slashes instead I get the expected result.
I&#x27;m using ripgrep 0.3.2.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>It sounds like you&#x27;re trying to type a file path for your regex?</p>
<p>Could you please provide more details about your environment? Are you in cygwin? A native console?</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve certainly used paths like <code>foo\bar\baz</code> on Windows before with ripgrep and it works just fine. (I don&#x27;t have a Windows machine currently available to test. It will have to wait until I get home.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This is a normal windows console, yes.
I&#x27;m merely providing a path as specified in this example from the &#x27;usage&#x27; message:

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I can&#x27;t reproduce this problem on ripgrep 0.4.0. I can run <code>rg --files .\some\path</code> and get the expected output. Note that <code>rg .\repo\newrepo</code> shows the error you&#x27;ve reported which is <strong>correct</strong>.</p>
<p>Can you please provide additional information?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Please note that I also used the &#x27;--files&#x27; flag, so ripgrep should interpret the rest as a path, isn&#x27;t that right?
What do yo mean the error is &quot;correct&quot;?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@chopsueysensei I&#x27;m trying to figure out the cause of the bug you&#x27;re reporting. Sometimes the cause of bugs is that the report is either flawed in some way or I&#x27;ve misunderstood it (i.e., &quot;user error&quot; bugs). I&#x27;m trying to rule out that possibility.</p>
<p>I will be very clear. This is expected and correct output, because <code>.\repo\newrepo</code> is interpreted as a regex and not a file path:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg &#x27;.\repo\newrepo&#x27;
Literal &#x27;\n&#x27; not allowed.
</code></pre>
<p>But this is unexpected and <em>incorrect</em> output because <code>.\repo\newrepo</code> is seemingly interpreted as a regex when it should be interpreted as a file path:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --files &#x27;.\repo\newrepo&#x27;
Literal &#x27;\n&#x27; not allowed.
</code></pre>
<p>However, I <em>cannot</em> reproduce this problem. Given the relative simplicity of the invocation, this led me to try to rule out user error.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t have any idea as to what&#x27;s actually wrong yet. This bug doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting. While I couldn&#x27;t reproduce this on Windows, I can seem to reproduce it on Linux:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --files &#x27;.\repo\newrepo&#x27;
Literal &#x27;\n&#x27; not allowed.
</code></pre>
<p>Weird. I should be able to track down the cause of the problem now.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand your motivations, of course. But, as I noted, I was using the &#x27;--files&#x27; switch so indeed it seems as if it still wanted to interpret what should be a path as a regex instead.
I&#x27;m glad you have something to work on, now. Please let me know if there&#x27;s anything I can try to help you track this down..</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A slight workaround if you do want it to work in ctrl-p</p>
<pre><code>    let g:ctrlp_user_command = &#x27;rg --files --color never &quot;&quot; %s&#x27;
</code></pre>
<p>This will have a stray <code>: The system cannot find the path specified. (os error 3)</code> for the extra quotes but it will still build the list with the correct path.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Another workaround is to add the -F flag so it treats patterns as literal strings instead of as regex. So for ctrl-p on windows I use</p>
