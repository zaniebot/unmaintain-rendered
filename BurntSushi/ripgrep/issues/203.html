            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Right now, I need to remember to update ripgrep every so often because it keeps improving (which is great). But I use ripgrep as <code>rg</code>, which means that every time I want to check for updates I have to remember what the program's official name is so that I can hunt it down. So I think it would be convenient if one or both of <code>rg --version</code> and <code>rg --help</code> mentioned that the official full name was 'ripgrep'. It would be great if <code>rg --help</code> also mentioned the master repository URL.</p>
<p>(The manpage mentions that rg is ripgrep, but I don't always remember to put the manpage somewhere that <code>man rg</code> can find it because I only put the <code>rg</code> command in my personal <code>$HOME/bin</code> directory. And even the manpage doesn't mention authorship information or the master repository URL.)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, I would have happily made the command itself called <code>ripgrep</code> and insisted that folks alias it to a shorter command, because I don't really like having dual names (<code>rg</code>/<code>ripgrep</code>) for the same thing. Alas, with the way the world works, I actually think this would have been a significant hurdle to adoption. (&quot;because it takes too long to type <code>ripgrep</code>&quot;)</p>
