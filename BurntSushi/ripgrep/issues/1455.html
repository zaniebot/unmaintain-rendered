            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My project currently uses a wrapper type around globset's <code>GlobMatcher</code> in order to implement <code>Serialize</code> and <code>Deserialize</code>. The implementation <a href="https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/blob/c82bc8a3583a65279d7aa28cde4b53977cd78fc4/src/glob.rs#L38-L50">is pretty trivial</a>!</p>
<p>Does it make sense for the globset crate to implement <code>Serialize</code>/<code>Deserialize</code>? I'd like to have them on both the <code>Glob</code> and <code>GlobMatcher</code> types for myself, but it's possible other types make sense. This would probably want to be behind a feature flag.</p>
<p>If this sounds okay, I'll file a PR! I think this change is similar to the spirit of #1447, but that PR hasn't been reviewed yet as of time of this writing.</p>
