<p>Being my first day learning about ripgrep, I am very excited to know that it exists. Thank you for creating and maintaining it!!!</p>
<p>I just about installed it using the .deb download, but thankfully I read on and found that it is officially maintained by Debian. That, of course, means that it is available in Debian/Ubuntu derivatives like PopOS. Since Buster is now double-superseded, the whole Debian section of the install docs could probably be replaced by a simple <code>sudo apt install ripgrep</code> with the appropriate note about derivative distributions. Just my two cents.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. I made a small tweak to the wording, but the rest of it really should stay. The <code>deb</code> package installation steps, for example, are important because Debian usually has very old versions of software. The <code>deb</code> package provides an easy way for users to opt into something newer.</p>
