<p>As a ruby dev, it feels like the <code>type</code> ruby is a bit incomplete.</p>
<p>https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/df83b8b44426b3f2179abe632eb183e8c8270524/crates/ignore/src/default_types.rs#L176</p>
<p>I suggest adding <code>*.ru</code> and maybe <code>*.erb</code>. Since the first one is <code>rack</code> specific (most web apps) it feels like a nobrainer. The second one however already has its dedicater type and is not the only templating engine for ruby, hence it could be added to a more global <code>rails</code> type?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Adding default file types is such a small change that I ask that you just open a PR. It sounds like <code>ru</code> is a good candidate to go into the existing <code>ruby</code> type.</p>
<p>If it's not clear where <code>erb</code> should go, then it's definitely not clear to me. :-) I suggest asking other Ruby devs what should be done.</p>
