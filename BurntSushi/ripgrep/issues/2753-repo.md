#### Describe your feature request

Please describe the behavior you want and the motivation. Please also provide
examples of how ripgrep would be used if your feature request were added.

If you're not sure what to write here, then try imagining what the ideal
documentation of your new feature would look like in ripgrep's man page. Then
try to write it.

If you're requesting the addition or change of default file types, please open
a PR. We can discuss it there if necessary.
