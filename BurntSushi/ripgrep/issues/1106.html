<p>I&#x27;m trying to get a list of files that contain one word, but not another word. To do that I call &quot;rg -l foo&quot; to get a list of files that I pass on to another call with &quot;rg --files-without-match bar&quot;. The call looks something like this: rg -l foo | xargs -i -d &#x27;\n&#x27; rg --files-without-match bar {}</p>
<p>This doesn&#x27;t work because --files-without-match cannot be used with a single file. The error message is &quot; output kind PathWithoutMatch requires a file path&quot;. However I don&#x27;t understand why that shouldn&#x27;t be possible.
Maybe there&#x27;s a better way to do this? If not I&#x27;d really appreciate it if that could be implemented.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If you need an example, use the ripgrep source code with this (it lists all files with an impl block, but no tests):
rg -l -g &#x27;*.rs&#x27; &quot;impl &quot; | xargs -i -d &#x27;\n&#x27; grep -L &#x27;cfg(test)&#x27; {}</p>
<p>What I would like is to use rg for the second part as well, which probably would be: rg -l -g &#x27;*.rs&#x27; &quot;impl &quot; | xargs -i -d &#x27;\n&#x27; rg --files-without-match &#x27;cfg\(test\)&#x27; {}</p>
<p>My use case is searching in C++ code for includes that are not needed, e.g. rg -l &quot;#include &lt;vector&gt;&quot; | xargs -i -d &#x27;\n&#x27; grep -L &quot;vector&lt;&quot; {}</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks. As a suggestion, your <code>xargs</code> use is a bit indiosyncratic. <code>rg -l -g &#x27;*.rs&#x27; &quot;impl &quot; -0 | xargs -0 grep -L &#x27;cfg(test)&#x27;</code> is simpler.</p>
<p>Also, <code>xargs</code> is not needed for a reproduction. Here&#x27;s a very simple example:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg --files-without-match &#x27;cfg(test)&#x27; src/main.rs
src/main.rs: output kind PathWithoutMatch requires a file path

$ rg --files-without-match &#x27;cfg(test)&#x27; src/main.rs src/main.rs
src/main.rs
src/main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This is definitely a bug. Thanks for reporting it!</p>
