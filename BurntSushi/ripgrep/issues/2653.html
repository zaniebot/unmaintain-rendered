<h3>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h3>
<p>failed to build repgrep 14.0.0</p>
<h3>How did you install ripgrep?</h3>
<p>I am attempting to build it from source with the latest version of cargo on the latest version of rust (I ran <code>rustup update</code> before attempting the build) by doing <code>cargo install ripgrep</code>.</p>
<h3>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h3>
<p>Windows 11 version 22H2</p>
<h3>Describe your bug.</h3>
<p>ripgrep version 14.0.0 fails to build from source with <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> due to a link error.</p>
<h3>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h3>
<p>I just have to write <code>cargo install ripgrep</code> in the terminal to get the error, but I am not sure how to reproduce it on someone elses machine if it works for them.</p>
<h3>What is the actual behavior?</h3>
<p>I am trying to build version 14 through cargo, but it fails with the error message</p>
<pre><code>error: linking with \`link.exe\` failed: exit code: 1327 </code></pre>
<p>followed by a very long collection of different paths, ending with</p>
<pre><code> note:
      C:\Users\$USERNAME\.cargo\registry\src\index.crates.io-$HASH\ripgrep-14.0.0\pkg/windows/Manifest.xml : general error c1010070: Failed to load and parse the manifest. Det går inte att hitta sökvägen.
      LINK : fatal error LNK1327: failure during running mt.exe</code></pre>
<p>The text &quot;Det går inte att hitta sökvägen.&quot; is Swedish for &quot;The path could not be found&quot; (expected since I'm in Sweden).</p>
<p>Other rust programs build from source as expected.</p>
<h3>What is the expected behavior?</h3>
<p>ripgrep should have built and installed succeessfully.</p>
