            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello.
Comparing 2 key databases consisting of 2 text files. 1 file - a template with 1 million keys, in the second several million, in which you need to find similar ones.
Note: since the files are large, you have to divide the template and the checked one into several parts, and then check each checked part with each part of the template. For this I use the bat file. In principle, it is tolerable.
About processing speed: there are 65,000 lines in a template piece. There are also 65000 lines in the piece of the checked one. Checked by the central processor in 5 seconds.
Request for speeding up the process - is it possible to transfer the reconciliation of 2 bases to CUDA NVidia?
It would be even faster.
Thanks.</p>

Now the processing is carried out using the central processor. I am looking for 1 million keys from a template file in other files with millions of different keys.</p>

<p>and this process, is it possible to do such processing using a video card, and not a CPU?</p>
<p>And how would I simplify my bat file? As I knew I did, but I'm not a programmer.

<p>I don't know. Maybe. I'm not the right person to ask. Sorry.</p>

<p>Because I answered the question.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Nope. I don't do GPU programming. It's too much of a niche. I can pretty safely say I'll ~never work on GPU. Maybe something in that niche will change in the years to come that will draw me in, but there's no point in tracking something that is unlikely to ever happen.</p>
<p>Like I said, go out and build it. If you aren't a programmer, then you might have to pay someone to do it or find someone who is specifically interested in GPU programming and regex searching.</p>
