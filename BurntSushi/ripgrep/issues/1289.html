Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>When <code>--null-data</code> option is used (but without using <code>--null</code>) and filenames are part of output, such file paths are terminated with NUL byte, similar to what <code>--null</code> does. Is this expected behavior?</p>
<pre><code>$ echo &#x27;how are you?&#x27; &gt; f1.txt

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Interesting! Thanks for filing this.</p>
<p>The problem here is that when ripgrep prints file headings (instead of the full file path for each matching line), it needs to print a new line after the file path. Currently, the new line character used for that is the newline character set by the end user. In this case, the <code>--null-data</code> flag explicitly and intentionally sets the newline character to <code>\x00</code>. So that when printing the heading, the newline character used is <code>\x00</code> instead of <code>\n</code>. The same logic applies when printing file paths, as the newline character that was set is used there as well.</p>
<p>I wonder what the correct behavior should be. The current behavior is indeed surprising, but consistent. Is the correct behavior to just assume <code>\n</code> as a line terminator when printing headings and file paths, unless <code>--null</code> is given?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Personally, I don&#x27;t have a use case, so I don&#x27;t have a preference and this could just be added to manual as a note. Couple of points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filename and line number combination like <code>f1.txt1:</code> looks odd because NUL isn&#x27;t visible on terminal</li>
<li>User can always add <code>--null</code> option to get NUL separated paths, whereas if they want newline separated ones, there isn&#x27;t a way to do it (as far as I know)</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, as far as I&#x27;ve noticed, GNU grep uses <code>-z</code> to change line separator only for input data processing and adding the NUL after each output data match. File names are separated by newline as usual.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I also experienced the similar issue - with <code>--null-data</code>, but not using <code>-l</code>. In my case, I want to have normal newline (<code>\n</code>) to separate results in the output, unless --null is explicitly given. Otherwise, the output will be garbage - not displayed correctly line-by-line. Even pipeline to <code>wc -l</code> doesn&#x27;t work for that output. (Current temporary fix: can only pipeline to <code>tr &#x27;\0&#x27; &#x27;\n&#x27;</code>, which breaks terminal coloring and some behaviors)</p>
<p>Changing the input data as null-terminated not just mean an I/O stream of lines terminated by null. It can also mean we want a textual file not to be separated into lines, so that we could use <code>rg</code> to match only first line, e.g. search the linux shebang pattern by <code>rg --null-data -o &#x27;\A#!/.*&#x27;</code>. It doesn&#x27;t always imply user want the output to be garbage with <code>\0</code> separators.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body">About the output problem I mentioned above
<p>I just double checked. Output without pipeline is still line-by-line, it is NOT ALWAYS garbage (or hard-to-read, I should say). I found that in the output of <code>rg --null-data -o &#x27;\A#!/.*&#x27;</code> (without further pipeline!), the first-character of each line (the filename part) disappeared due to a <code>\r&lt;some-color-escapes&gt;\0</code> sequence (just before &#x27;\n&#x27;) (my files is in DOS line ending). (Note: &#x27;\r&#x27; make cursor return home, and &#x27;\0&#x27; print a blank). <em>Should a &quot;.&quot; better don&#x27;t match both \r &amp; \n by default? (This doesn&#x27;t harm linux environment)</em></p>
<p>i.e. expected correct output:</p>
<pre><code>file1.sh 1:#!/bin/bash
file2.sh 1:#!/bin/bash
file3.sh 1:#!/bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>become:</p>
<pre><code> ile1.sh 1:#!/bin/bash
 ile2.sh 1:#!/bin/bash
 ile2.sh 1:#!/bin/bash</code></pre>
<p>In addition, I&#x27;ve checked that with pipeline or not, the behavior is different. With a further <code>| cat</code>, the output of <code>rg</code> is always single-lined (no <code>\n</code> but only &#x27;\r&#x27; &amp; &#x27;\0&#x27;). These two behaviors seems confusing...</p>
<p><code>rg --version</code> -&gt; 11.0.2</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Info: for <code>grep</code>, &#x27;--null-data&#x27; or &#x27;-z&#x27; -&gt; <code>Treat  input  and  output  data  as  sequences  of lines, each terminated by a zero byte</code>. Thus, I cannot say <code>rg</code> is wrong, because current behavior align with <code>grep</code>. Just not quite convenient for the mentioned use cases.</p>
