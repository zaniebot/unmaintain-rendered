            <div class="timeline-body"><p>This might be a bit subjective, but for me the result of <code>rg -h</code> was somewhat suboptimal in giving me much more output than expected, thus quickly scrolling the most useful stuff off the screen.</p>
<p>I think I would like it better if <code>rg -h</code> did not show the <code>Less common options</code> and <code>File management options</code> by default, instead showing a line at the bottom that refers to some extra switch to make <code>-h/--help</code> more verbose.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>FWIW, <code>rg --help | less</code> should help, and it's what I normally do when the output of <code>--help</code> is large.</p>
<p>I'm not opposed to doing this, but I'm not 100% sure we should because I'm not a fan of making flags harder to discover.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yeah, that's another option that would maybe help discovery without making flags harder to discover.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I'm not sure if something has happened since this, but the help output is once again enormous, and I usually end up doing <code>rg --help | rg &quot;thing i'm looking for&quot;</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>rg --help</code> has been basically &quot;the man page&quot; for years. Nothing has changed recently. If you want a denser view, then use <code>rg -h</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Oh interesting. I'm not used to <code>-h</code> and <code>--help</code> doing different things. Perhaps they should be merged and manpages can be generated separately?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No. man pages aren't available everywhere. The behavior is staying as is.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p><code>rg -h</code> still has a large header block that looks identical to the one from <code>rg --help</code>. Perhaps we could slim down the <code>rg -h</code> header block for just a couple of lines? It seems odd that even the USAGE section isn't immediately visible in <code>rg -h | less</code> on a 80x24 terminal.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Indeed, I'd be open to that. The initial header block has indeed slowly grown larger over the years.</p>
