            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>`rg --version</p>
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)`</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>cargo install</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Archlinux 5.17.4-arch1-1</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>When we use the replace flag -r, some characters seem to break the replaced result
if they are placed just after a capture group like $1.
For example underscore (_).</p>
<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Run
<code>ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1_en.ass'</code>
Here, _ is just after the 1 in '$1', and it will break the output.
This also happen if we have any alphabet letter after the 1.</p>
<h4>What is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>Here are some commands i tried.</p>
<p><code> ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1_en.ass'</code>
<code>.ass</code>
The $1 is ignored and _ has apparently eaten the &quot;en&quot; part of the pattern.</p>
<p><code>ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1$_en.ass'</code>
<code>file.ass</code>
Since $$ is used to escape $, i tried to write $_,
and while it still eats the &quot;en&quot; part, the $1 is correctly replaced this time.</p>
<p><code>ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1 en.ass'</code>
<code>file en.ass</code>
Here we can see that the output is correct if a space follow the 1, this is also the case for ., !, and probably others.</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>The expected behavior to the first command listed above is :
<code>file_en.ass</code></p>
<p>I think this is a bug, but if this is intentional, then please show me where in the doc i could have find this, because i have not.
Is there a way to escape the capture group and/or find a way for underscore to not break the output ?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The behavior is correct. The docs sadly do not mention the <code>${1}</code> syntax. It's <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/struct.Captures.html#method.expand">documented in the regex engine</a>, but you shouldn't need to dig into that. Specifically, this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The longest possible name consisting of the characters <code>[_0-9A-Za-z]</code> is used. e.g., <code>$1a</code> looks up the capture group named 1a and not the capture group at index 1. To exert more precise control over the name, or to refer to a capture group name that uses characters outside of <code>[_0-9A-Za-z]</code>, use braces, e.g., <code>${1}a</code> or <code>${foo[bar].baz}</code>. When using braces, any sequence of characters is permitted. If the sequence does not refer to a capture group name in the corresponding regex, then it is replaced with an empty string.</p>

I leave the issue open until the doc is updated.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Sorry for my duplicate in #2455</p>
<p>It came to my mind that this might be this kind of problem; and I've to admit: I didn't go deep enough into the doc to find this section. <strong>But</strong>, IMHO (very humble), it doesn't seem very logical to me that the priority is given to users that use named groups over users (97% I suppose) that don't.</p>
<p>I expected that to match <code>$1_en.ass</code> one should use <code>${1_en.ass}</code>, and <code>$1_en.ass</code> to be equivalent to <code>${1}_en.ass</code></p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Yes, if I could go back in time, I might tweak these rules. But I don't feel comfortable making a breaking change of this sort at this point. The problem is that it would be a silent breaking change. It would silently change the semantics of replacement strings that previously worked.</p>
