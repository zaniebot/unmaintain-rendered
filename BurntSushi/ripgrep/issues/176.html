<p>Correct. Not even the <code>s</code> flag will help, because <code>ripgrep</code> explicitly instructs the regex automaton to never match <code>\n</code>. Like <code>grep</code>, <code>ripgrep</code> is a <em>line oriented search tool</em>.</p>
<p><code>ripgrep</code> can perform a search in two different ways. One of them reads a chunk of bytes at a time and searches it. The other memory maps the file and searches that all at once. The former has a number of advantages, including being faster when searching a large number of small files in parallel and being able to search streams in constant memory. The latter has the advantage of being faster for single files (sometimes) and much simpler to implement.</p>
<p>The former <em>only works</em> because search is line oriented. A multiline regex can technically match, say, 2GB of data, which is completely incompatible with searching small chunks at a time.</p>
<p>The latter could be made to work with multiline search, but memory maps can&#x27;t search stdin for example. So a multiline search on stdin would have to block and read all of stdin into memory before searching. (There exists a way around even this, but it requires changing the regex engine to be capable of incremental search, which is an even bigger change, but theoretically possible.)</p>
<p>multiline searching therefore comes with significant implementation complexity, and IMO is a pretty niche use case. I can also imagine it having a pretty big impact on the printing code. This fact alone is a good reason why it may never be in <code>ripgrep</code> proper, but perhaps once #162 is done, others can take a crack at it.</p>
<p>This is a good example of a feature that The Silver Searcher has that <code>ripgrep</code> may either never have or won&#x27;t have for a long time.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I&#x27;m going to re-open this, because it&#x27;s one of the most highly requested features.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed about the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/176#issuecomment-253652811">problems I outlined above</a>. However, multiline search needn&#x27;t be the default. If we provide it as a flag, then we can do what we need to do to support multiline search only when that flag is provided. The critical thing that multiline search needs is a <em>complete</em> sequence of bytes in memory to search. Memory maps can provide this, but failing that, we would need to read the entire file into memory before starting a search.</p>
<p>Other than using heap space proportional to the file being searched, the fundamental issue with this flag is when it&#x27;s used in conjunction with searching stdin. Namely, ripgrep will need to block until EOF is read on stdin before a search can even start. Alternatively, multiline search simply wouldn&#x27;t be allowed on stdin. The silver searcher will in fact do this silently when searching stdin:</p>
<pre><code>/* TODO: this will only match single lines. multi-line regexes silently don&#x27;t match */
void search_stream(FILE *stream, const char *path) {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>I don&#x27;t like the &quot;silent&quot; idea, but stopping ripgrep with an error is certainly something I&#x27;d be open to. Neither seem like good choices to me, but I don&#x27;t think it should block this feature altogether.</p>
<p>N.B. This is a significant feature and it would have to be part of the libripgrep effort.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The other thing I forgot to mention is that multiline search will negate inner literal optimizations. Normal prefix and, in special cases, suffix, literal optimizations will still be performed as part of the regex engine.

<blockquote>

<p>They are not. If they were, ripgrep would be very slow. The reasons for this are a bit subtle, but basically, &quot;it&#x27;s faster to search a huge chunk than it is to break it into little pieces and then search each piece.&quot; &quot;Huge chunk&quot; in this case might be the size of some internal buffer, perhaps, 8KB.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re curious about how a fast grep tool works in more detail, check out this section in my blog post on ripgrep: http://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/#anatomy-of-a-grep</p>

<p>If you have a regex like <code>a\s+b</code>, then it&#x27;s not possible to determine the length of the match up front. You have three choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>You use a regex engine that supports incremental search. (This is somewhat at odds with performance if &quot;incremental&quot; means &quot;byte at a time.&quot; So for something like this, you&#x27;d need an incremental engine that can process chunks at a time.) ripgrep&#x27;s regex engine doesn&#x27;t support this.</li>
<li>You feed the regex engine every byte you got. (The Plan.)</li>
<li>You arbitrarily cap the size of the match. This will invariably get things wrong and there&#x27;s no way to escape.</li>
</ol>
<p>I still actually strongly believe that multiline search is a very niche feature, but it is one that can be quite useful when the situation calls for it. (A text editor is perhaps one such situation, but ripgrep is first and foremost a command line tool where multiline search feels a lot less common.) Therefore, taking approach (3) doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. In the common case, memory maps will work just fine and your OS will manage the memory for you. It&#x27;s only the corner cases that are sub-optimal: when memory maps can&#x27;t be used (e.g., on virtual files or stdin).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If <code>--multiline</code> is behind a flag, then I&#x27;m pretty confident that the standard UX of ripgrep won&#x27;t be impacted. Including performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you actually need a special flag to ripgrep? or can you reliably determine from the expression itself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A flag is 100% necessary. A regex like <code>a\s+b</code> shouldn&#x27;t match across multiple lines by default, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve all come to expect from line oriented searchers. But it is totally plausible that you might <em>want</em> it to. That&#x27;s when you&#x27;d pass a flag.</p>

<p>I would agree use is actually niche, but desire to use is not.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is a bit non intuitive how to properly write a multiline expression.  Especially if the engine doesn&#x27;t support the <code>. dotAll</code> matching and even worse if you want to constrain to a range like next N lines.</li>
<li>Due to 1, many use incomplete results although not always knowingly.  Most coding languages can have line breaks almost anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would say if you are searching for 2 terms and completeness is important then using multiline would often be your default.  However, writing an expression to find termA followed by termB within 5 or less lines is likely not something that rolls off of the fingertips of someone who occasionally uses regular expressions although I think many would find it useful and use such expressions if more intuitive to write.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dakaraphi Good points. I&#x27;d like to use your comment to <em>constrain</em> this feature, namely, that multiline search is the ability to apply a regex whose matches may span an arbitrary number of lines.</p>
<p>With that said:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would be plausible to make <code>.</code> match <code>\n</code> by default if multiline mode is enabled.</li>
<li>The use case of &quot;where do <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> co-occur within N lines of each other&quot; is definitely something I agree can be useful. It&#x27;s possible to some extent to do this with a regex, e.g., <code>A([^\n]*\n){0,5}[^\n]*B|B([^\n]*\n){0,5}[^\n]*A</code>, but that is a little painful. Extending this to three terms would probably be horrifying.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think (2) is something that&#x27;s enabled by multiline search, although, today, you can do something similar with contexts: <code>rg B -C5 | rg A -C5</code> for example works to some extent. Regardless, it might be wiser to categorize this into a separate feature whose UX can be more thoughtfully designed. Others have requested similarish things, as in #346 and #360. <a href="https://github.com/svent/sift"><code>sift</code></a> is a tool that has support for this kind of matching, so we may be able to crib ideas from them.</p>
<p>With all that said, we must be careful not to get too far away from what ripgrep is supposed to be good at doing: <em>searching lines</em>. :-) I say this because there <em>has</em> to be a point at which &quot;write code for your specialized search&quot; becomes a valid thing to say. The key is figuring out where that point is.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything ripgrep would do differently in terms of UX with respect to the silver searcher, other than 1) not doing it by default and 2) probably not doing silent things.</p>

<p>ok right.  Yes I&#x27;m not sure if that really should be part of something like ripgrep or not.  For example, I&#x27;ve been thinking about maybe writing some extension for VS Code like a regex helper or such that would take something like common patterns or templates and you just plugin the values for such use cases and it would generate the regex.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@dakaraphi directed me here from Microsoft/vscode #13155</p>
<p>It looks like one of the most common requests for searching across multiple lines is related to text editors. At the moment, my needs are very simple. If I can get a match across multiple files in a project for a multiline selection -- even if it&#x27;s fully literal -- I could work with it. For most text editors, the menu option to search across multiple lines is separate than a simple search, and so a ripgrep flag, as @BurntSushi suggested, would naturally fit this use case.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m still making it through @BurntSushi&#x27;s <em>anatomy of a grep</em> link, but it appears to me that a multiline search for text editors mostly requires a literal search with some multiple literals (white space, line endings) and therefore the search won&#x27;t even make it to the regex engine for these cases.</p>
<p>Isn&#x27;t the multiple line selection just a contiguous sequence of bytes (in the fully literal case) to be matched in a buffer? Or am I missing something related to optimisation here?</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure people will come up with cases where a regex in a multiline search/replace would be mighty handy, but I think support for the simpler multiple literal multiline case would be a good start to give some text editors (such as vscode and atom) missing functionality.</p>
<p>btw, a most excellent ripgrep article @BurntSushi!</p>

<p>All searching happens through the <code>grep</code> crate, and the interface is a regex. Literal optimizations are an implementation detail.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am making decent progress on multi line mode in ripgrep. In the course of implementing it, I came across a question that doesn&#x27;t have an obvious answer (to me anyway) and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on it.</p>
<p>In particular, when multi line mode is enabled (which is an opt-in), what should the semantics of <code>.</code> be? In most regex engines, a <code>.</code> will match any character except for <code>\n</code>. In ripgrep today, we obviously don&#x27;t have to worry about this because every match is restricted to a single line, so a <code>.</code> can&#x27;t match through a <code>\n</code>. But in multi line mode, it&#x27;s not clear to me what the <strong>default</strong> behavior should be.</p>
<ul>
<li>We could make <code>.</code> match <code>\n</code> by default when multi line mode is enabled, which seems somewhat natural, since multi line mode had to be explicitly enabled. However, I worry that folks will find this surprising since I kind of think that most people have come to expect <code>.</code> to not match <code>\n</code>.</li>
<li>We could make <code>.</code> not match <code>\n</code> by default when multi line mode is enabled, but here I feel like this might also be surprising since folks might be expecting this sort of thing to &quot;just work&quot; since they had to opt-in to multi line search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, in either case, the user can always twiddle the meaning by using <code>(?s:.)</code> to force <code>.</code> to match <code>\n</code> and <code>(?-s:.)</code> to force <code>.</code> to not match <code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>What do people think the default behavior should be?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Personally, I&#x27;ve always found it frustrating that <code>.</code> does not match newlines, as when I want to match any character, I mean any character, and having to special case <code>\n</code> each time is a pain.</p>
<p>I think though people might have come to expect <code>.</code> doesn&#x27;t match <code>\n</code>, that&#x27;s more often than not an inconvenience rather than a feature. I think, as you say, having opted into multi-line mode is a sufficient reason to override this behaviour.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever seen a regular-expression implementation that automatically enables <code>DOTALL</code> (or equivalent) in &#x27;multi-line&#x27; mode. (To say &#x27;multi-line&#x27; here is a bit confusing, because in PCRE and, i&#x27;m pretty sure, the Rust engine as well, patterns are <em>always</em> matched across lines, and the <code>MULTILINE</code> option just controls whether <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match only against the full string or against each line in it.)</p>
<p>One major example of an end-user application of regex searching i can think of is Sublime Text, whose search function <em>does</em> operate across lines by default, but, again, it does <em>not</em> enable the <code>DOTALL</code> behaviour.</p>
<p>Sounds like most of the people who&#x27;ve commented so far are in favour of defaulting to <code>DOTALL</code>, but idk, might be worth considering that it will be different from most other search tools. I personally don&#x27;t feel super strongly either way, it&#x27;s easy enough to change if i ever need that functionality.</p>
<p>Whichever way you decide, if you&#x27;re worried about the UX, you could always offer an additional option in <code>rg</code> to control the default flags. Like a <code>--regex-modes=-s</code> or whatever that people could put in their alias/config.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>A point of clarity: regex engines often expose both &quot;multiline&quot; flags and &quot;dotall&quot; flags. They do different but somewhat related things. Multiline flags typically impact the behavior of <code>^</code> and <code>$</code>. Namely, when multiline mode is disabled, <code>^</code> will only match at the beginning of a haystack where as if mulitline mode is enabled, then <code>^</code> can also match the position immediately following the line terminator. This proceeds analogously for <code>$</code>. (Regex engines also often expose <code>\A</code> and <code>\z</code> as variants of <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> that always behave as if multiline mode is disabled.)</p>
<p>As far as I know, most regex engines have both of these modes disabled by default. That is, <code>^/$</code> only match at the beginning/end of a haystack and <code>.</code> never matches <code>\n</code>.</p>
<p>Today, ripgrep always enables multiline mode for the regex engine (such that <code>^/$</code> maybe after/before line terminators). The question of whether <code>.</code> matches a line terminator is moot because ripgrep specifically forbids this.</p>
<p>In a world where &quot;multiline search&quot; is enabled (completely unrelated to the &quot;mulitline mode&quot; mentioned above for regexes), it&#x27;s less clear what the defaults for these should be. I&#x27;m inclined to continue to keep multiline mode in the regex itself enabled by default. The dotall flag is where I&#x27;m kind of hung up.</p>
<p>@okdana A <code>--regex-modes</code> flag is interesting. I&#x27;d be sad if we had to resort to that, but yeah, I can kind of see that happening. (And sorry, I typed out most of this comment before I saw yours, so apologies for re-explaining some things!)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>If I&#x27;m understanding it correctly, having the dotall flag enabled by default would make something like <code>name1.*name2</code> potentially match two consecutive lines <code>name1\nname2</code>, as well as <code>name1name2</code>? I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m missing a use case, but I find myself very often using <code>&lt;pattern1&gt;.*&lt;pattern2&gt;</code> when I use ripgrep from the command line, much more than I would expect to find <code>.</code> matching a newline as useful. I can see dotall being on by default as requiring a lot of typing to avoid accidentally matching something much too large across multiple lines (not a perf problem, but could cover up many intended matches in a single big match depending on greediness). Anecdotally, when using <code>isearch</code> in emacs interactively, I have found it tolerable to type out <code>\(.\|\n\)</code> to express a match across lines (because I&#x27;m far less often interested in matching that) and since ripgrep is PCRE (and searching more than one file at a time) that&#x27;s 3 fewer backslashes, so it would be even more tolerable.</p>
<p>I also think the conjunction of multiline matching mode on by default, and dotall mode off by default, makes sense -- if you were to do <code>rg -l &#x27;^a.*b&#x27; | xargs sed -rie &#x27;s/^a.*b//g&#x27;</code> (which I&#x27;ve done), you currently can expect <code>.</code> to match similarly for <code>rg</code> and <code>sed</code>. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to follow the lead of other tools&#x27; interfaces if that&#x27;s not the best, but I also think that conjunction of options is a highly sensible default, and getting that parity with other tools seems like a useful bonus, again unless that parity requires other compromises.</p>
<p>All of the above is clearly anecdotal, I just wanted to comment because I feel like I have (anecdotally) definitely run into the problem of accidentally matching too much when running interactive searches when <code>.</code> matches a newline (when I have set up my search flags to do that, in other search tools). I think either approach would work -- but I really do think the frequency of searches intended to span multiple lines will be a lot lower (and typing out <code>(?s:.)</code> will then be more tolerable), and for someone who&#x27;s not familiar with the default, accidentally matching their whole file (in a pathological case) could be potentially very confusing, even if the reasoning is in the help page.</p>

<p>Multi line search will emphatically be opt-in (as noted in my comments above) and not be enabled by default. Therefore, the question here is only about what the defaults are when multi line search is enabled. The defaults when multi line search is not enabled (which is itself ripgrep&#x27;s default) will not change.</p>

That is, in order to use multi line search, you already need to explicitly opt into it, so the thinking I had is that if <code>.</code> matches <code>\n</code> by default in multi line search, then that would be OK since you&#x27;re already explicitly opting into multi line search.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this and this logic is pretty reasonable, and could definitely justify the decision. I guess my concern is that if the default with multi-line search is that <code>.</code> matches <code>\n</code>, then I think the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are only going to be useful when you need to match the end of a line and have that also be the end of a string, which, if you&#x27;re trying to match a pattern across multiple lines, seems like it becomes less likely to be what you want (especially since e.g. <code>$</code> in this case can be simulated anyway with <code>\n?\Z</code> I think?). That&#x27;s of course unless the default pattern expands to allow <code>^</code>/<code>$</code> in the <em>middle</em> of patterns -- but that&#x27;s not at all a serious suggestion.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@cosmicexplorer Hmm, that is an interesting one to noodle on. The problem is that the usefulness of <code>^/$</code> is a bit strange in general when multi line search is enabled. Namely, all we&#x27;re discussing here are the semantics of <code>.</code>, but there are other commonly used character classes, such as <code>\s</code> or <code>[[:space:]]</code>, that will also be able to match through a <code>\n</code> when multi line search is enabled, which will make the interaction between <code>^/$</code> and <code>\s</code> similarly confusing as <code>^/$</code> with <code>(?s:.)</code>. But, <code>\s</code> matches much less than <code>.</code>, so the confusion may not manifest nearly as frequently.</p>
<p>I think we might just need to pick one here, and then probably provide a flag for enabling/disabling DOTALL semantics so that folks can pick their own default via an alias or ripgreprc. :-/</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I will always advocate for &quot;just picking one&quot;, and I definitely hadn&#x27;t considered the potential dilemma for character classes besides <code>.</code> that you just mentioned -- especially in the cli context (which is what we&#x27;re discussing). I think if all of this is behind a non-default flag anyway it does seem to make sense to not necessarily be super concerned about the default semantics of DOTALL behind a non-default flag. And thinking again about the &quot;searching a few different patterns on the command line&quot; context I can see <code>.</code> matching newline being pretty nifty (the example in the OP in particular).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>For my part, I&#x27;d personally find it confusing and inconvenient if <code>.</code> matched newlines by default, even after opting into searches spanning lines, but that&#x27;s primarily because no other regex engine does that.</p>
<p>However, there&#x27;s an interesting related issue: negated character classes do include newlines even when <code>.</code> doesn&#x27;t. Even with DOTALL disabled, regex engines normally let <code>[^x]</code> match <em>any</em> character other than x, including newline. This can <em>also</em> be confusing and inconvenient, but can also sometimes be exactly what you want.</p>
<p>I think I&#x27;d describe the distinction this way: sometimes when doing a multiline search, you still want to match something line-oriented <em>inside</em> that search, and even after opting into multiline search, when you write the line-oriented sub-search you might get surprised if the components of that sub-search match across lines.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;d suggest the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate the options to enable multiline and dotall.</li>
<li>In addition to the in-regex options like <code>(?:m)</code>, have a command-line option that enables multiline for the whole regex, and another that enables dotall. (But perhaps have a single combined option for what seems to be a common case; for instance, <code>-m</code> for multiline and <code>-M</code> for multline-with-dotall.)</li>
<li>Encourage people, when trying to match line-oriented things inside a multiline regex, to turn multiline and dotall <em>off</em> for the line-oriented match, to avoid surprises. (And perhaps have a convenient shortcut for turning both off at once.)</li>

I don&#x27;t use DOTALL pretty much at all, since I work with many different regex engines, some of which don&#x27;t support it (e.g. Javascript regexes), so I prefer to always use &quot;portable&quot; regex syntax.</p>
<p>If DOTALL-by-default ends up being implemented, I&#x27;d like it to be possible to disable it via a command-line flag, so it&#x27;d be possible to make a shell alias that disables DOTALL without an inline flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All righty, so, the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/tree/ag/libripgrep-freeze-1"><code>ag/libripgrep-freeze-1</code></a> branch has multiline powered ripgrep on it. It passes the integration test suite on Unix (I still have a bit of work to do for Windows), but if folks want to try it out, they can build it from source now. I won&#x27;t force push to that branch (<code>ag/libripgrep</code> is my dev branch and i do frequently force push to it).</p>
<p>Right now, you get multiline search using the <code>--multiline</code> flag. The &quot;dot all&quot; option is not enabled by default, so you need to use <code>(?s)</code> to make it possible for <code>.</code> to match <code>\n</code> in your regex.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been using it a little bit myself, and here&#x27;s my rough experience (with the added caveat that I still don&#x27;t quite consider myself the target audience for this feature, so I don&#x27;t really trust my experience yet):</p>
<ul>
<li>Nearly every time I&#x27;ve run a multiline search, I&#x27;ve used <code>.*?</code> as a way to match through multiple lines. As a result, I&#x27;ve basically always needed to add <code>(?s)</code> to my regex.</li>
<li>The <code>--multiline</code> flag is kind of painful to type and too long. It feels like this flag is deserving of a short switch.</li>
<li>I found myself &quot;overshooting&quot; my search quite a bit, where I would wind up with matches that spanned many more lines than I intended. It seems like a dual to <code>--max-columns</code> might be desirable here, such that matches longer than a particular number of lines are omitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>With respect to finding a short switch to enable multiline mode, unfortunately, both <code>-m</code> and <code>-M</code> are taken. While ripgrep has generally reserved the right to make breaking changes in accordance with semver, I am in practice pretty conservative about it, and would rather not re-purpose existing flags. Therefore, if we want a short switch for multiline mode, then we&#x27;ll need to pick from the available switches. Here are the switches already in use:</p>
<pre><code>0 a A b B c C e E f F g h H
i j l L m M n N o p q r s S
t T u v V w x z
</code></pre>
<p>Alphabetic uppercase switches available:</p>
<pre><code>D G I J K O P Q R U W X Y Z
</code></pre>
<p>Alphabetic lowercase switches available:</p>
<pre><code>d k y
</code></pre>
<p>Wow. That&#x27;s a little horrifying to look at! We&#x27;re almost out of real estate.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some random thoughts on switches to get the ball rolling, in particular, looking at how these switches are used by other tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-d</code>/<code>-D</code> are used in GNU grep to control the behavior when a &quot;directory&quot;/&quot;device&quot; is encountered. It&#x27;s conceivable ripgrep could support this one day, but I doubt it deserves a short switch.</li>
<li><code>-G</code> is used in GNU grep to indicate the use of &quot;basic&quot; regexes, which ripgrep will never support.</li>
<li><code>-I</code> is related to changing how binary detection. Probably doesn&#x27;t deserve a short switch.</li>
<li><code>-J</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep at all.</li>
<li><code>-K</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep at all.</li>
<li><code>-O</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep at all.</li>
<li><code>-P</code> is out. I have another use in mind for this.</li>
<li><code>-Q</code> is commonly used as &quot;literal&quot; search in other tools (ack, ag).</li>
<li><code>-R</code> means &quot;recursive search, but follow symlinks,&quot; which doesn&#x27;t really make sense in ripgrep. Plus, we already have <code>-L/--follow</code> for following symlinks.</li>
<li><code>-U</code>, like <code>-I</code>, is also related to binary detection. Probably also doesn&#x27;t deserve a short switch. This is also the second letter in <code>multiline</code>. <code>-U</code> is also used in the silver searcher to relax its filtering, but ripgrep generally uses <code>-u</code> for that. Hmm.</li>
<li><code>-W</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep at all.</li>
<li><code>-X</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep at all.</li>
<li><code>-Y</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep at all.</li>
<li><code>-Z</code> is used in GNU grep, but ripgrep uses <code>-0/--null</code> for the same functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>-k</code> isn&#x27;t used by GNU grep, although it is used in <code>ack</code>, where I believe the ripgrep equivalent would be <code>-tall</code>.</p>
<p><code>-y</code> appears to be an obsolete synonym for <code>-i</code> in GNU grep. TIL. Neat.</p>
<p><code>ag</code> itself uses the <code>--multiline</code> flag, but of course, multiline is the default there.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m currently liking <code>-U</code> the best, but the choices aren&#x27;t great.</p>

<p>@thijsvandien I&#x27;d like to avoid the backward compatibility discussion if possible please. While I have no concrete way of knowing this, my feeling from talking to various people about how they use ripgrep is that <code>-m</code> and <code>-M</code> are not infrequently used. <code>-M</code> in particular was added almost a year and a half ago and <code>-m</code> was added before even that. Reversing course on that kind of thing is not good for users. <strong>The hardest part about backwards compatibility is coming to terms with the fact that your software will have warts.</strong> If I could do it all again, I would have found a different short flag for <code>--max-columns</code> and used <code>-M</code> for multiline. Alas, we shall live with the wart. It is not the first and will most certainly not be the last.</p>

<p>The <code>-X</code> for &quot;a cross&quot;, mentioned in the tweet, actually has a neat alternative (and more direct) interpretation, considering that <code>x</code> is the informal symbol for multiplication (&quot;multiple lines&quot;, 3x, etc.).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>All righty, here is what I have for docs for multiline mode. Do folks mind giving them a quick skim to make sure I haven&#x27;t missed anything? Are there any obvious unanswered questions that the docs could cover?</p>
<pre><code>-U, --multiline
    Enable matching across multiple lines.

    When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match
    cannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not
    codepoint other than \n. Similarly, the regex \n is explicitly forbidden, and if
    you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error. However, when multiline and
    regexes like \n are permitted.

    An important caveat here is that multiline mode does not change the match
    semantics of .. Namely, in most regex matchers, a .  will by default match any
    character other than \n, and this is true in ripgrep as well. In order to make .
    match \n, you must enable the &quot;dot all&quot; flag inside the regex. For example, both
    (?s).  and (?s:.)  have the same semantics, where .  will match any character,
    including \n. Alternatively, the --multiline-dotall flag may be passed to make
    the &quot;dot all&quot; behavior the default. This flag only applies when mulitline search
    is enabled.

    There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match can span.

    WARNING: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline searches may
    be slower than normal line oriented searches, and they may also use more memory.
    In particular, when multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep requires that each file it
    searches appear as if it exists contiguously in memory (either by reading it on
    to the heap or memory mapping it). Things that cannot be memory mapped (such as
    stdin) will be consumed until EOF before searching can begin. In general, ripgrep
    will only do these things when necessary. That is, even if you use the
    --multiline flag but your regex cannot match over multiple lines, then ripgrep
    won’t consume unnecessary resources. Nevertheless, if you only care about matches
    spanning at most one line, then it is always better to disable multiline mode.

    This flag can be disabled with --no-multiline.

--multiline-dotall
    This flag causes .  to match new lines when multiline searching is enabled. This
    flag has no effect if multiline searching isn’t enabled.

    Normally, a .  will match any character except for newlines. While this behavior
    typically isn’t relevant for line oriented matching (since matches can span at
    most one line), this can be useful when searching with the -U/--multiline flag.

When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match
cannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not

codepoint other than &#x27;\\n&#x27;. Similarly, the regex &#x27;\\n&#x27; is explicitly forbidden,
and if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error. However, when multiline
mode is enabled, &#x27;\\p{any}&#x27; will match any Unicode codepoint including &#x27;\\n&#x27;
and regexes like &#x27;\\n&#x27; are permitted.

An important caveat here is that multiline mode does not change the match
semantics of &#x27;.&#x27;. Namely, in most regex matchers, a &#x27;.&#x27; will by default match
any character other than &#x27;\\n&#x27;, and this is true in ripgrep as well. In order
to make &#x27;.&#x27; match &#x27;\\n&#x27;, you must enable the \&quot;dot all\&quot; flag inside the regex.
For example, both &#x27;(?s).&#x27; and &#x27;(?s:.)&#x27; have the same semantics, where &#x27;.&#x27; will
match any character, including &#x27;\\n&#x27;. Alternatively, the &#x27;--multiline-dotall&#x27;

<p>Instead of &quot;For example&quot;, I&#x27;d use &quot;In particular&quot;, &quot;namely&quot;, &quot;specifically&quot;, or some other equivalent expression.</p>

<p>I&#x27;d use commas around &quot;including &#x27;\n&#x27;&quot;, which IMO makes the sentence structure (and intended reading flow) slightly more explicit.</p>

<p>I&#x27;m not sure this sentence&#x27;s structure conveys the intended message clearly. Do you think you could rephrase it somehow? I think what&#x27;s confusing me is the &quot;even if&quot; / &quot;but&quot; / &quot;then&quot; structure.</p>

<p>&quot;any character except newlines.&quot; -- simpler and has the same meaning.</p>

<p>Just for completeness, I&#x27;d add a note at the end explicitly mentioning that multiline mode by default assumes a false dotall flag.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@waldyrious Awesome! I think I took all of your suggestions except for the first. Here&#x27;s paragraph containing the portion you requested to have rewritten. What do you think?</p>
<pre><code>**WARNING**: Because of how the underlying regex engine works, multiline
searches may be slower than normal line-oriented searches, and they may also
use more memory. In particular, when multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep
requires that each file it searches appear as if it exists contiguously in
memory (either by reading it onto the heap or by memory-mapping it). Things
that cannot be memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed until EOF before
searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do these things when
necessary. Specifically, if the --multiline flag is provided by the regex
cannot match over multiple lines, then ripgrep won&#x27;t read each file into memory
before searching it. Nevertheless, if you only care about matches spanning at
most one line, then it is always better to disable multiline mode.

If we’re going to have that “stronger version”, wouldn’t it make sense to use a short switch that is available both in lower case (<code>--multiline</code>) and upper case (<code>--multiline-dotall</code>), like <code>-z</code> and <code>-Z</code>? That would be a good reason to have a different switch than most other tools, because none offer both options, as far as I’m aware.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>@BurntSushi I&#x27;m glad you agree with the suggestions! The reworded sentence is indeed much clearer, after fixing the typo pointed out by @mateon1.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the diff of that sentence, for future reference/convenience:</p>
<pre><code>-That is, even if you use the --multiline flag but your regex cannot
-match over multiple lines, then ripgrep won&#x27;t consume unnecessary resources.
+Specifically, if the --multiline flag is provided but the regex

</code></pre>
<p>Now that I re-read that, I&#x27;m not sure &quot;cannot match&quot; is the best choice of words, since it can imply both a neutral statement or an imperative enforcement. (Not sure I&#x27;m being clear myself; let me know if I should rephrase!)</p>
<p>I suppose you&#x27;re referring to the case where the regex does not contain any patterns that would match newlines, or it contains <code>.</code> without the dotall flag being activated. Is that correct?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Whether dotall is enabled or not is mostly orthogonal; what matters is whether a <code>\n</code> exists in any of the possible matches of a regex. Enabling dotall and uttering <code>.</code> is one way to achieve that, but a literal <code>\n</code>, <code>\s</code>, <code>\p{any}</code> and so on also achieve that.</p>
<p>It is possible I should just remove this part of the docs. I&#x27;m not sure. I put it there as a way of saying that even if you enable multiline mode but don&#x27;t make use it, you generally won&#x27;t pay (much) for it. But maybe that&#x27;s not that important.</p>

I was rather driving at the distinction between text editor and ripgrep.
I couldn&#x27;t quite follow.
Is it b/c you consider ripgrep as a command line tool having a more advanced audience which demands more control and less <em>magic</em> than a graphical text editor?</p>
