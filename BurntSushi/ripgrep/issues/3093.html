            <div class="timeline-body">Describe your feature request
<p>Is it possible to use the <code>ignore</code> create together with the <code>vfs</code> create for <a href="https://crates.io/crates/vfs">virtual file system</a>. I use the <code>fvs</code> create so that its easy to write unit tests that use a mock file system in my project.</p>
<p>The best way I&#x27;ve found currently to use the <code>ignore</code> create and <code>vfs</code> together is to use the <code>GitignoreBuilder</code> manually and reimplement file traversal myself (I can&#x27;t even add a file with <code>GitignoreBuilder</code> since that takes a path and not file content, so I&#x27;ll have to <a href="https://docs.rs/ignore/0.4.23/ignore/gitignore/struct.GitignoreBuilder.html#method.add_line">add_line</a> manually for each line). In practice that means that I have to re-implement a lot of stuff myself when I&#x27;d prefer to just use the <code>WalkBuilder</code> directly.</p>
<p>Is there an more ergonomic way this could be done?</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>No. <code>ignore</code> is tightly coupled with file system APIs and I don&#x27;t want to change that. Sorry.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Wouldn&#x27;t making a bit less tightly coupled with file system API make it easier to write unit test for the ripgrep project? And potentially open up more re-use across the ecosystem, ex if someone want to create a tool that reuses <code>ignore</code> / <code>ripgrep</code> logic for other things than a &quot;real filesystem&quot; like zip archives, AWS S3 filestorage, a filestructure loaded from a database or an api call, etc.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I have no problem writing tests using the real file system.</p>
<p>I understand the advantages of abstraction, but they don&#x27;t really confer many advantages for me personally. I just don&#x27;t need that sort of abstraction to write tests for <code>ignore</code>, and I&#x27;m not interested in working on making gitignore filtering work in contexts other than standard file systems. In contrast, you neglect to discuss the disadvantages, which involve a massive amount of work and API design across at least <code>ignore</code> and <code>walkdir</code>.</p>
<p>If this sort of abstraction is a requirement for you, then you&#x27;ll need to build your own crate to do it.</p>
