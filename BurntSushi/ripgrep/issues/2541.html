            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hello, great app!</p>
<p>The --regexp and --fixed-strings options are opposite behaviors so --regexp should override any prior --fixed-strings flags. Specifically, I'd imagine the implementation to simply always expand &quot;-e&quot; as though the user had instead typed &quot;--no-fixed-strings -e&quot;.</p>
<p>Currently:</p>
<pre><code>rg -F .mo                         # matches &quot;.mode&quot;; skips &quot;remote&quot;
rg -F -e .mo                      # matches &quot;.mode&quot;; skips &quot;remote&quot;
rg -F --no-fixed-strings -e .mo   # matches &quot;.mode&quot;; matches &quot;remote&quot;</code></pre>
<p>What would be nice (and makes more sense to me):</p>
<pre><code>rg -F .mo                         # matches &quot;.mode&quot;; skips &quot;remote&quot;
rg -F -e .mo                      # matches &quot;.mode&quot;; matches &quot;remote&quot;
rg -F --no-fixed-strings -e .mo   # matches &quot;.mode&quot;; matches &quot;remote&quot;</code></pre>
<p>My motivation: I like my default searches to be literal so I would like to put <code>--fixed-strings</code> into my <code>.ripgreprc</code>, however if I do that now, it is not enough to use <code>rg -e</code> to undo the fixed-strings option, I have to use <code>rg --no-fixed-strings -e</code> which is too long.</p>
<p>Such a change WOULD alter some current reasonable behavior though. Before:</p>
<pre><code>rg -F -- -2.2                     # matches &quot;x = -2.2&quot;; skips &quot;2020-2023&quot;
rg -F -e -2.2                     # matches &quot;x = -2.2&quot;; skips &quot;2020-2023&quot;
rg -F --no-fixed-strings -e -2.2  # matches &quot;x = -2.2&quot;; matches &quot;2020-2023&quot;</code></pre>
<p>After:</p>
<pre><code>rg -F -- -2.2                     # matches &quot;x = -2.2&quot;; skips &quot;2020-2023&quot;
rg -F -e -2.2                     # matches &quot;x = -2.2&quot;; matches &quot;2020-2023&quot;
rg -F --no-fixed-strings -e -2.2  # matches &quot;x = -2.2&quot;; matches &quot;2020-2023&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, I think the benefit outweighs the change in behavior, but I could understand the opposing view. Objectively, however, currently there is no good way to make fixed-string searches the default with an easy override, while after the change restoring current behavior is a single key change: use <code>rg -F -- -2.2</code> instead of <code>rg -F -e -2.2</code> which is already hinted at in the documentation of the --regex option. This feature request would also fix #2273 without consuming a new short flag and please @steliyan.</p>
<p>As for the reverse ordering (-e before -F), I don't think anything would change from current behavior. <code>rg -e -F</code> would still do a search for the pattern regexp &quot;-F&quot; (and not enable fixed strings), so there would be no change in behavior in this case. The more exotic <code>rg -e -2.2 -F</code> already behaves in the way that I would expect (-F overrides the regexp to perform a fixed string search for &quot;.mo&quot;). After the change, the behavior would be unchanged as it would be equivalent to <code>rg --no-fixed-strings -e -2.2 -F</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks for the app and for considering this feature!</p>

<p>They are not. I realize the naming is a little confusing, but the names come from <code>grep</code> and I didn't see a compelling reason to change them. It is correct and intended that <code>-F</code> applies to patterns given via the <code>-e/--regexp</code> flag. That is, <code>rg -F -e ...</code> and <code>rg -F ...</code> are equivalent commands and that will absolutely never change.</p>

<p>OK, this seems like the actual request to me: &quot;please provide a more convenient way to disable <code>-F/--fixed-strings</code> other than <code>--no-fixed-strings</code>. I've updated the issue title to reflect that.</p>
<p>I don't think I have a good answer for you unfortunately. The typical way to do this would be to provide a short flag for <code>--no-fixed-strings</code>, but we are running low on available short flags and I'm not sure your use case clears the bar for one.</p>
<p>Personally, if I were you and wanted <code>-F/--fixed-strings</code> enabled by default, then I would define an alias to undo it (with perhaps a better name):</p>
<pre><code>alias rgnof=&quot;rg --no-fixed-strings&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like it should solve your specific problem.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Fair enough, I'm going with <code>alias rge='rg --no-fixed-strings'</code> since it fits my mental model of the -e option. I do see after re-reading the manual and your indication that they aren't meant as opposites that the power in -e is as an &quot;OR&quot; operator which my proposal would very much break: <code>rg -F -e .mode -e .moo</code>. I've never noticed or used that even with grep, but agree that is not something worth breaking.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and consideration, I unfortunately have no better suggestion for a short form --no-fixed-strings within ripgrep itself so I suspect the proper resolution to this request is a wontfix.</p>
