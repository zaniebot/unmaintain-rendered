            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<pre><code>ripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)
</code></pre>
How did you install ripgrep?
<pre><code>$ brew tap burntsushi/ripgrep https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep.git
$ brew install ripgrep-bin
</code></pre>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>macOS 10.14.3 (18D109)</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p><code>rg</code> appears to fail to find a certain pattern in a one-line file that definitely contains that pattern.</p>
<p>I must be missing something — this seems very unlikely to be a legitimate bug — but I can&#x27;t figure out what.</p>
If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<ol>
<li><code>echo 153.230000 &gt;| test.txt</code></li>
<li><code>rg &#x27;\d\d\d00&#x27; test.txt</code>. This successfully finds a match of <code>23000</code>.</li>
<li><code>rg &#x27;\d\d\d000&#x27; test.txt</code>. This <em>fails</em> to find any match, when it should match <code>230000</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that <code>grep &#x27;\d\d\d000&#x27; test.txt</code> correctly matches <code>230000</code>. (<code>grep --version</code> <code>grep (BSD grep) 2.5.1-FreeBSD</code>)</p>
If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?
<pre><code>$ echo 153.230000 &gt;| test.txt
$ rg --debug &#x27;\d\d\d000&#x27; test.txt
DEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:110: required literal found: &quot;000&quot;
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:424: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: &quot;**/.*.s[a-w][a-z]&quot;, re: &quot;(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)\\..*\\.s[a-w][a-z]$&quot;, opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: false, backslash_escape: true }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal(&#x27;.&#x27;), ZeroOrMore, Literal(&#x27;.&#x27;), Literal(&#x27;s&#x27;), Class { negated: false, ranges: [(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;w&#x27;)] }, Class { negated: false, ranges: [(&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;z&#x27;)] }]) }
DEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 3 basenames, 0 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 1 regexes
$
</code></pre>
If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?
<p><code>rg &#x27;\d\d\d000&#x27; test.txt</code> should identify the single match in the file, as <code>grep</code> does. Specifically:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg &#x27;\d\d\d000&#x27; test.txt
1:153.230000
</code></pre>
Other
<p>Note that changing the corpus in seemingly irrelevant ways can cause the bug to change or disappear. For example, the <code>\d\d\d000</code> pattern matches if three <code>0</code> characters are prepended to the contents of the file (that is, the file contains <code>000153.230000</code>).</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks so much for reporting this! It is indeed a bug in the regex engine. You can <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/661bf53d5b2b6dde25549aaad601ad8c59b37bfd">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/edf45e6f5fa54705298ba14f3216cfb5277c0908">this</a> for the specific changes to the regex engine to fix this. The short story is that you were tripping in a reverse suffix literal optimization that wasn&#x27;t quite correct. The reason why it seemed sensitive to different regexes and inputs is because it is! :-) The reverse suffix literal optimization only runs in very specific circumstances related to the size and structure of the regex, and this particular bug is only tripped when a suffix literal (such as <code>000</code>) can result in potentially overlapping matches. In this case, both your pattern and your haystack did this.</p>
<p>This should now be fixed on master, since I&#x27;ve bumped ripgrep&#x27;s regex dependency to <code>1.1.2</code>.</p>
