<p>The standard library had the same problem, because Microsoft has made it very hard to create symlinks on Windows. I worked around it in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/31360">this pull request</a>.</p>
<p>The best option for testing is to use directory junctions, which you do have permission for to create.
But I never finished cleaning up the implementation of this in in the standard library...</p>

<p>Will this work for symlinking files? Some of the tests are already symlinking directories and that seems to work, but the test I killed was (I believe) trying to symlink a file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am surprised to hear symlinking directories works, but don't have my computer nearby to check.
For files I have no solution.</p>
<p>The problem is that your Windows user account needs to have the <code>SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege</code>.  It is possible to grand this to a normal user account. For admin accounts the story is more complicated, because even if you have the permission, it is stripped during login in most cases. It is a bit unclear to me to be honest.</p>
<p>What I did was: create a normal user account on my computer with the permission to create symlinks, so I can run all the test locally. For all the tests that use symlinks, just do as if the test passes if creating the symlink fails. See the <code>got_symlink_permission</code> function and how it is used in the pull request I linked.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I am going to close this. It's mildly annoying to skip a couple tests on Windows because of symlink issues, but I don't have the bandwidth to dig into fixing it properly.</p>
<p>If someone were especially motivated to fix this for real in a way that permits tests to pass on AppVeyor, then I'd support that effort, but otherwise I'm fine with what we have for now.</p>
