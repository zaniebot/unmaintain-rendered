            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Thanks for following up. But I&#x27;ll never understand why people scrub their issues like this. Like what if someone else had the same problem as you? Now this issue is much less likely to appear in a web search.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The reason for removing it is that is confusing: It was a faulty question. The real question should be:
Why does rg follow symlinks when you type <code>rg search-pattern .*</code>  but not <code>rg search-pattern .</code>.</p>
<p>Also, thank you for you response and work.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I understand. But that fault question came <em>from a perspective</em> and that perspective is valid and may be shared by others.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not a big deal, but personally I would just suggest not scrubbing issues in the future.</p>
