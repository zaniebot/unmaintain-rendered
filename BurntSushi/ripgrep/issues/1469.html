            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>None</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>I have not yet</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>linux amd64</p>
Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>Firstly, amazing project! Thanks for it!
Secondly, would it be too much to ask to remove the version strings from the release artifacts filenames? I am currently looking to incorporate automatic downloading and installing of some non-core utilities in my shell setup. For docker-compose, it looks a lot like this (in my ~/.bashrc at the moment):</p>
<p>which docker-compose 1&gt;/dev/null || curl -L &quot;https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)&quot;
-o ~/.local/bin/docker-compose &amp;&amp; chmod +x ~/.local/bin/docker-compose</p>
<p>This is possible because docker-compose doesn&#x27;t have the release number as a substring of the file name, which makes it relatively reliable to guess where I&#x27;ll be able to download it from (if used alongside the /latest/ release alias). This is SUPER convenient and REALLY nice! It allows me to grab up to date tooling without having to worry about installing it from an upstream. I use a somewhat out of date linux distro at work, which is unavoidable and unfortunate.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re unwilling to make this work, I 100% understand but would ask you to consider what value the version in the artifact&#x27;s downloaded filename provides. Thanks again for the time and effort in this tool! I find it invaluable in my daily usage :)</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I appreciate the convenience of a missing version number, but I&#x27;d rather not change the artifact naming convention without a better reason.</p>
<p>You can fairly easily come up with the latest version via GitHub&#x27;s API:</p>
<pre><code>$ version=&quot;$(curl -s &quot;https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/latest&quot; | jq -r .tag_name)&quot;

$ echo $version
11.0.2

$ curl -LO &quot;https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/$version/ripgrep-$version-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz&quot;
</code></pre>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Seeing as how jq is non-standard, that solution is untenable from a fresh install perspective, which makes this a chicken/egg problem for me.</p>
<p>It is, however, your prerogative. Thanks for consideration!</p>
<p>EDIT: though i suppose that I am lucky: jq has release artifacts without a version number. I can grab it first and put it in <code>$PATH</code> and THEN grab other artifacts. Feels hacky, but it should work</p>
