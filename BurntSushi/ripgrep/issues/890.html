<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<h4>Describe your question, feature request, or bug.</h4>
<p>On Windows 10, using MSYS (<a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git bash for Windows</a>, in my case) <code>ripgrep -l</code> will not pipe the files in a way that actually allows them to be used as an argument for another item.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Reproduction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">~/dev/ripgrep$ rg fast -l

CHANGELOG.md
appveyor.yml
FAQ.md
GUIDE.md
README.md
...
</code></pre>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p><code>ripgrep -l</code> output cannot be piped to stuff like sed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">~/dev/ripgrep$ rg fast -l | xargs sed s/fast/FAST/g -i

<h4>If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>I have confirmed this is an MSYS specific issue, doing the same thing in WSL will work as expected:</p>

<p>This is not a huge problem for me, but it'd still be nice to have this work.</p>
<p>Sorry if I am stupidly missing something obvious. And also sorry if this is a MSYS issue rather than a <code>rg</code> issue.</p>

[FASTmod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod)
like `FASTer` will. `faste` would also match!
In this case, we used `FAST\w*` for our pattern instead of `fast\w+`. The `*`
`FAST\s+(\w+)`, which matches `fast`, followed by any amount of whitespace,
$ rg 'FAST\s+(\w+)' README.md -r 'fast-$1'
Our replacement string here, `FAST-$1`, consists of `fast-` followed by the
$ rg 'FAST\s+(?P&lt;word&gt;\w+)' README.md -r 'fast-$word'
  That is `rg -i FAST` matches `fast`, `fASt`, `FAST`, etc.
</code></pre>
<p>It looks like your environment doesn't like standard Windows paths. You can replace <code>\</code> with <code>/</code> though easily enough:</p>
<pre><code>$ rg 'faster than' -l --path-separator '\x2F' | xargs sed 's/fast/FAST/' | rg fast
[FASTmod](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod)
like `FASTer` will. `faste` would also match!

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>The problem here seems to be that rg isn't detecting the pipe in an MSYS environment, so it outputs the ANSI color escape sequences. This works correctly in Cygwin.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>rg -l ... | od -c
rg --color never -l ... | od -c
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the escape sequences in the output of the first command.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Unlike Cygwin, MSYS performs path-mangling by default to rewrite Windows-style paths to Unix-style with MSYS's filesystem prefix if needed—even for piped output—so I don't think this is another path conversion issue.</p>
<p>For Cygwin specifically (or for MSYS with path-conversion turned off) we can resolve paths between <code>rg -l</code> and Cygwin/MSYS programs by streaming the output of rg through <code>cygpath</code>:</p>
<pre><code>rg -l ... | cygpath --file -

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>My experience matches @cyrossignol's when using Git Bash. Making an alias like <code>rgplain</code> or something will probably be my interim solution, but I'd be interested to know why <code>rg</code> isn't able to detect the output pipe in this case.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Hmmm, I don't remember reading @cyrossignol's comment, but that looks like a nice catch. This warrants a closer look. My guess at this point is that the <code>atty</code> crate will need some tweaking in how it detects the pipe (which is basically one giant hack on Windows), and it isn't surprising at all that there are some cases where it fails.</p>

<p>In theory it should be. You can see the code for that here, there isn't much of it: https://github.com/softprops/atty/blob/master/src/lib.rs</p>
<p>In particular, the msys hack is dependent on implementation specific strings. So it might just be that those need to be updated.</p>
<p>This is something that I'll look into next time I make the Windows rounds for ripgrep. But otherwise, anyone else can do this as well. What I do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checkout ripgrep.</li>
<li>Checkout atty.</li>
<li>Modify <code>atty = &quot;...&quot;</code> in ripgrep's <code>Cargo.toml</code> to <code>atty = { version = &quot;*&quot;, path = &quot;path/to/atty/checkout&quot; }</code>.</li>
<li>Do printf-debugging in <code>path/to/atty/checkout/src/lib.rs</code> to see what <a href="https://github.com/softprops/atty/blob/4a7e706c0275cc94f7f34b5097ef229d428d83c2/src/lib.rs#L136">the value of <code>name</code></a> is.</li>
<li>If nothing is printed, then the problem has likely been misdiagnosed and more debugging is required. Otherwise, if the string printed doesn't line up with <a href="https://github.com/softprops/atty/blob/4a7e706c0275cc94f7f34b5097ef229d428d83c2/src/lib.rs#L144-L146">the test check</a>, then fix the check and submit a PR to atty. :-)</li>
</ul>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I actually played around with this a few days ago. It seems like the version of atty (0.2.10) that ripgrep depends on at the tip of master fixes this problem.</p>
<p>I can reproduce the issue when rebuilding ripgrep 0.8.1 (atty 0.2.2). The problem disappears when rebuilding 0.8.1 against the newer atty version.</p>
<p>I wanted to find the change before commenting, but got sidetracked. Looking back now, it's softprops/atty#24 (released with 0.2.7) that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>In short: this should be fixed with the next release of ripgrep.</p>

Note that I think https://github.com/softprops/atty/pull/24 introduced a bug that I later fixed in https://github.com/softprops/atty/pull/25. But that was only for cygwin I think.

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>OK, I've tried this out myself and this appears to be working as well as one might hope. I still needed to either set the path separator or use <code>cygpath</code> in my MSYS terminal in order to get the OP's original command to work, but AFAIK, this is just another instance of weird path mangling that is probably never going to get fixed. Either <code>cygpath</code> or <code>--path-separator</code> are the intended work arounds.</p>
