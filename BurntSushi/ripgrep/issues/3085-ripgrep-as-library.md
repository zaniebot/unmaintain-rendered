# ripgrep as library

---

_@sumit-modak_

Ripgrep is a great utility but it isn't very well suited to use it from other rust packages. The `std::command::Command` is the only way to use this. It would be helpful to have a library like `libripgrep` which will have all the apis of ripgrep. Thank you!
