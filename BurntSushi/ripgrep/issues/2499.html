            <div class="timeline-body"><h4>What version of ripgrep are you using?</h4>
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0 (rev a7ae9e4043)
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
<h4>How did you install ripgrep?</h4>
<p>using source binary files</p>
<h4>What operating system are you using ripgrep on?</h4>
<p>Debian 11</p>
<h4>Describe your bug.</h4>
<p>I scanned the tool &quot;cargo-geiger&quot;(https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-geiger) on ripgrep to find the usage of unsafe code in the package. It showed the statistics that a lot of code in the package has unsafe code. The screenshot of result is given below:

<h4>What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Install cargo-geiger using cargo install cargo-geiger</p>
<p>1.Navigate to the directory same as the Cargo.toml
2. run cargo geiger</p>
<h4>What is the expected behavior?</h4>
<p>Expected behavior is showing all the files used by ripgrep are safe!</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I may be assuming a bit much here, but you don't seem to have any Rust repository, so maybe you're unaware that <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.unsafe.html"><code>unsafe</code> is a legitimate Rust keyword</a>. It doesn't <em>automatically</em> make the code insecure, it only enables a few additional features which prevent the Rust compiler from automatically proving that the code is 100% safe. It indicates a region of code which needs careful manual review.</p>
<p>The Rust standard library contains unsafe code <em>everywhere</em>, so requiring ripgrep to use only safe code is a bit unrealisitc. 🙂</p>

<p>I can't tell whether this is a joke, you're under-informed or if you're informed and seriously hold this position.</p>
<p>My guess is that you're under-informed. If so, I don't really know where your confusion lies, so I'll link you to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/">Rustonomicon</a>.</p>
