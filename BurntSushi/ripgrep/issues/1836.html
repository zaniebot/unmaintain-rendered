            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Some files on some filesystems (e.g. ext4) can be sparse - they contain holes which are read as all zero bytes and occupy no space on disk.</p>
<pre><code>$ truncate -s 1000G fake_big_file
$ du fake_big_file
0       fake_big_file
$ rg foo fake_big_file # this takes a long time, but could be made to take a short time

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this is a good fit for ripgrep. I note also that GNU grep doesn&#x27;t appear to implement any hole-oriented optimizations either.</p>
<p>For the most part, I just don&#x27;t see how to robustly implement something like this. Your implementation in <code>ag</code>, for example, seems tightly coupled to the memory map method of searching. Memory maps don&#x27;t work for all files. Moreover, when the &quot;skip holes&quot; flag is enabled, there is a non-trivial additional amount of overhead for every file searched.</p>
<p>With that said, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re stuck. I suspect that you would be able to write a preprocessor program that did this handling for you. See the section in the guide on the <code>--pre</code> flag: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#preprocessor</p>
