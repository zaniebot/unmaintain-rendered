            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I semi-regularly use command-line tools to do mass substitutions in my code (whether with Rust or with Python). Perhaps I ought to learn to make better use of the IDE here, but even for non-code things this has been a useful feature.</p>
<p>Currently I usually use something like <code>find . -name &quot;*.rs&quot; | xargs sed -i &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;s!foo!bar!g&#x27;</code>. However, <code>sed</code> seems like a pretty old-school tool and I sometimes find that it&#x27;s hard to make it do modern regex features.</p>
<p>It would be nice if ripgrep could do --replace -i &#x27;&#x27; (the argument is used to as a suffix for backed up files, but I almost never use it because stuff is usually under version control anyway).</p>
<p>I realize this might be out of scope a bit since it involves actually rewriting the files rather than just searching through them. Wanted to mention this as a desirable feature (to me) anyway.</p>
