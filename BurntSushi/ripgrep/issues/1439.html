            <div class="timeline-body"><p>Using ripgrep 11.0.2 I ran into a hang using ripgrep from GNU Emacs via helm-rg on Windows. Window creates a stdin and ripgrep detects that stdin exists and waits for data, making it look like ripgrep is hung. I was able to easily work around the issue once I saw that I could explicitly specify the directory to search. Having this in the doc may save others confusion. Also having the note about .gitignore's are only respected if .git exists.</p>
<p>The man page intro currently contains:</p>
<pre><code>   ripgrep (rg) recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default,
   ripgrep will respect your .gitignore and automatically skip hidden files/directories and
   binary files.</code></pre>
<p>Could it be updated to:</p>
<pre><code>   ripgrep (rg) recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern. By default,
   ripgrep will respect your .gitignore files when a .git directory exists and automatically skip
   hidden files/directories and binary files.

   ripgrep will automatically detect if stdin exists and search stdin for a regex pattern, e.g.
   &quot;ls | rg foo&quot;. In some environments, stdin may exist when it shouldn't. To turn off stdin
   detection explicitly specify the directory to search, e.g. &quot;rg foo ./&quot;.</code></pre>
<p>It would also be nice to mention why you need a .git directory to have .gitignores but that may be lost in time?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
