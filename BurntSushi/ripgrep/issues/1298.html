Describe your feature request
<p>It seems like <code>--sort/sortr</code> only have an effect on files within the same folders. I&#x27;d like the whole result list sorted. I realise this means having to wait for the whole result list to come, but it&#x27;s probably faster than my current workaround <code>rg &quot;$@&quot; | while IFS=: read  -r   f m; do  printf &#x27;%s:%s\n&#x27; &quot;$(stat --printf &#x27;%Y\t%n&#x27; &quot;$f&quot;)&quot; &quot;$m&quot;; done | sort -nr | cut -f2-</code>.</p>
<p>The reason I want the whole list sorted is that I work in a big git repo where there are some files that are nearly never changed and which are fairly irrelevant most of the time (but not always), but I keep getting their hits at the top of my list when I use <a>https://oremacs.com/2017/08/04/ripgrep/</a> to get a grip on the project.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>I think <code>--sort path</code> already behaves as you&#x27;re requesting. <code>--sortr path</code> will not, since as you&#x27;ve noticed, files are sorted in each directory. For sorting in lexicographic ascending order, this works fine, but can produce something that isn&#x27;t quite the descending order when sorting in reverse.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth supporting this feature. I&#x27;d recommend either continuing your work-around, or even better, use a custom <code>.ignore</code> file with the <code>--ignore-file</code> flag to filter out files you don&#x27;t want to search most of the time (but not always).</p>
