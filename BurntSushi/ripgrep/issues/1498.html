<p>Ripgrep returns the string used for querying as the result repeatedly, even tho the file doesn't contain such string.</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?</h4>
<p>Take the file from: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mishari/85a73923ce42410a06a6ca22d529e083/raw/9639d6f5aa87e94eb416ad272efb005d5541da3a/f3430896.txt put in directory by itself
run:
rg -r Blah .</p>
<h4>If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?</h4>
<p>rg Blah .</p>

<p>If I do:</p>
<p>rg Blah recup_dir.1/f3430896.txt</p>
<p>nothing returns as it should be, neither if I do</p>
<p>rg -r -e Blah .
or
