            <div class="timeline-body">What version of ripgrep are you using?
<p>ripgrep 13.0.0
-SIMD -AVX (compiled)
+SIMD +AVX (runtime)</p>
How did you install ripgrep?
<p>Installed using cargo.</p>
What operating system are you using ripgrep on?
<p>Ubuntu 20.04 via Docker.</p>
Describe your bug.
<p><code>rg</code> uses all CPU for an extremely long time.</p>
What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?
<p>Not sure how to reproduce it. I used <code>rg</code> to search for texts in my project for a few times. Later the machine was reported to be very slow. Running <code>top</code> shows that <code>rg</code> uses all CPU for an extremely long time.

What is the actual behavior?
<p>Show the command you ran and the actual output. Include the <code>--debug</code> flag in
your invocation of ripgrep.</p>
<p>If the output is large, put it in a gist: https://gist.github.com/</p>
<p>If the output is small, put it in code fences:</p>
<pre><code>your
output
goes
here
</code></pre>
What is the expected behavior?
<p><code>rg</code> should use any resources after it finishes running.</p>
