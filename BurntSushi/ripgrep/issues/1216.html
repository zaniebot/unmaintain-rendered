<p>It would be great if ripgrep could extend it's ignored files support for fossil scm.
Fossil ignore file is: <code>.fossil-settings/ignore-glob</code></p>
<p>The glob patterns are not the same though.  One difference I have noticed
for example was not being able to use <code>/venv</code> -&gt; <code>venv/</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While in principle I agree it would be nice, in practice, I don't think this is worth doing. Getting the ignore rules correct is one of the biggest sources of bugs in ripgrep, and that's considering that we're only trying to handle one source control system. If I were to devote resources to supporting another source control system, it wouldn't be Fossil, it would probably be Mercurial, just based on my perception of how many people use it.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to just translate your Fossil rules to an <code>.ignore</code> file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thank you for your explanation.  i just realised that there is a very good document comparing
git's ignore with fossil's in the fossil wiki, so for the sake of completeness i'll just put it here:
