Describe your question, feature request, or bug.
<p>It would be great if ripgrep could extend it&#x27;s ignored files support for fossil scm.
Fossil ignore file is: <code>.fossil-settings/ignore-glob</code></p>
<p>The glob patterns are not the same though.  One difference I have noticed
for example was not being able to use <code>/venv</code> -&gt; <code>venv/</code>.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>While in principle I agree it would be nice, in practice, I don&#x27;t think this is worth doing. Getting the ignore rules correct is one of the biggest sources of bugs in ripgrep, and that&#x27;s considering that we&#x27;re only trying to handle one source control system. If I were to devote resources to supporting another source control system, it wouldn&#x27;t be Fossil, it would probably be Mercurial, just based on my perception of how many people use it.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to just translate your Fossil rules to an <code>.ignore</code> file.</p>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p>thank you for your explanation.  i just realised that there is a very good document comparing
git&#x27;s ignore with fossil&#x27;s in the fossil wiki, so for the sake of completeness i&#x27;ll just put it here:
